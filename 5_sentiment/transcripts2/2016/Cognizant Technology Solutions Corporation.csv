I presume you saw our announcement reaffirming our 2015 guidance a few weeks ago. We finished 2015 as we had anticipated. Fourth quarter revenue was $3.23 billion, up 1.4% over last quarter and 17.9% year-over-year. For the full year 2015, we delivered $12.42 billion of revenue, which represented growth of 21% over 2014. We are pleased with our performance in 2015 having raised our full year guidance 3x during the year. We expect to deliver revenue within a range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion for Q1 of 2016, reflecting some softness in our Banking and Financial Services and Healthcare segments as we start the year. For the full year, we expect to deliver revenue within a range of $13.65 billion to $14.2 billion. This represents full year growth of 10% to 14%, including an approximate 1 point negative currency impact. 
You'll notice that we have changed the way we provide guidance. Going forward, we will provide a range for both revenue and EPS in our quarterly and full year projections. We believe this approach provides better visibility to our investors.
As we enter 2016, I'd now like to spend a few moments to give you some color on the market and demand environment and also the investments we continue to make to stay ahead of the market. As you know, there's now no doubt that we're in the midst of a disruptive technological shift that's pushing clients to look for innovative ways to adapt their traditional business models and products. It's clear that our market opportunities are substantial. I'd like to share 4 observations from having been on the front lines of the digital transition for the past 5 years. 
The first observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that from a technology standpoint, most clients cannot make an immediate clean-sheet-of-paper transition to a digital technology backbone. Clients will typically build a digital architecture on top of their legacy technology, and the integration between these 2 layers is a very critical part of the transformation. Our intimate knowledge of our clients legacy complying with our leading-edge digital capabilities really give us an edge here. 
The second observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that a new, broader set of capabilities is required to help clients navigate the digital transition. In the digital world, consulting must include both strategic consulting and design sensibilities. An end to end digital realization requires consulting, design, technology and industry knowledge. Our digital works model is deliberately built to combine strategy design technology and business consulting into one tightly integrated model.
The third observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that now, more than ever, knowledge of our clients' industries and processes is critically important. As our clients seek to digitize all aspects of their business, they are reinventing their business models and their processes. Our deep industry knowledge and process expertise enables us to partner with them as they work through the process of transforming their businesses into digital enterprises. 
And the final observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that as digital goes mainstream, clients need a partner with global scale and heft to support them. As clients look to rapidly scale, they need the best talent at scale available across the globe. Our global footprint and team is a substantial asset in this regard.
With these 4 observations, I'd like to now update you on the key areas of investment focus we outlined last year: building digital capabilities, evolving our IT services, building platform solutions and further investing in consulting that continue to enhance our capabilities. 
First, we are building capabilities to enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. Our digital works approach is solid and showing results. Our focus now is to scale that capability quickly across the world. Let me explain with an example. We recently signed a strategic multimillion dollar engagement with Etihad Airways, a United Arab Emirates flag carrier, to define a comprehensive digital transformation strategy. While Etihad Airways is renowned for a world-class experience in the air, they realize that customer experience starts long before the customer arrives at the airport and continues after they land. The Cognizant Digital Works team and other partners are helping Etihad to innovation future customer experience possibilities, whether these interactions happen via the web, mobile apps or airport kiosks. As clients like Etihad navigate the challenges involved in becoming digital enterprises, we continue to build out our portfolio of offerings to help them navigate that shift.
Second, we are evolving our IT services capabilities to enable our clients to create next-generation technology infrastructures that are characterized by high levels of operational efficiency at the back end and enhanced by new digital capabilities on the front end. To achieve this goal, clients are being challenged to lower total cost of ownership of legacy environments, to reinvest these savings into enabling digital transformation or what we have often called the dual mandate. In creating solutions for next-generation IT, we are focused on both sides of the dual mandate. On one side, we are bringing in higher levels of automation, integrating our service lines and moving core processes to a managed services environment to improve operational effectiveness. On the other side, we're modernizing legacy systems to create the backbone to help our clients become digital enterprises. Our recent acquisition of KBACE Technologies, for example, will enhance our capabilities in next-generation IT. KBACE has 400 technology and consulting associates specializing in Oracle cloud applications. Cloud and SaaS migration is a key component of the solution to the dual mandate. This acquisition will expand our digital and cloud capabilities to help more clients deploy SaaS applications to lower cost and increase business agility.
Our third focus area of investment is building platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new levels of efficiency. We've created a number of sharply focused vertical platform-based solutions that will offer the clients in a Business Process-as-a-Service or BPaaS model. These solutions enable clients to turn over entire processes or subprocesses to us to own and operate on an output or outcome-based commercial model. These solutions not only help our clients create variable cost structures but reduce their time to value by quickly getting clients to best-in-class benchmark levels of performance. And by embedding analytics in these platforms, we're able to bring critical insights and share best practices and industry knowledge across multiple customers. We have a headstart here through our acquisition of TriZetto in 2014 as well as having developed a number of our own platforms in core areas such as clinical trials in Life Sciences that have shown good traction. For example, several quarters back, we announced an engagement with TransCelerate to develop and build a cloud-based shared investigator platform for global life sciences companies to use in clinical trials. This platform provides a unified point of access on a single platform, linking all the critical personnel running clinical trials with major global pharmaceutical companies. This enables standardization, consistency and operational efficiency, resulting in lower cost and faster processing of clinical trials. 
And our fourth investment area is driven by our recognition that we must continue to drive ever more strategic relationships with our clients. Cognizant's consulting group, or CBC, is a critical component of this effort. For over 10 years, we have built out our consulting practice and have integrated this practice into all parts of our business. We believe that a strong consulting practice is essential to helping clients envision and implement the many transitions facing their businesses. 
In closing, 2015 was a very significant year for us. We strengthened our position as a leading transformational partner for our clients. I'm happy with our progress and proud of the accomplishments of our teams. I'm confident that we will remain the partner of choice for our clients as they transition to the digital economy. 
With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later to take your questions. Gordon?"

I'd like to add some comments on the overall demand environment and provide an update on client budgets before moving to our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter. Client budgets are complet",1611,"Think you, Francisco. I'd like to add some comments on the overall demand environment and provide an update on client budgets before moving to our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter. 
Client budgets are complete and the outcome is very much as we expected. As Frank mentioned, we're seeing a soft start to the year in Banking and Financial Services, primarily due to macroeconomic concerns, and in healthcare, on the back of industry consolidation and the payer industry. More broadly, clients continue to face a dual mandate within their operations, and we expect many of the trends we saw driving demand within our portfolio services in 2015 to continue over the course of 2016. With that in mind, let me now provide you with additional color on our results across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies. 
Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 1.8% sequentially and 16.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong performance in insurance. We are seeing an increased interest in managed service deals with both banking and insurance clients, as clients continue to focus on cost optimization and look for ways to increase operational efficiencies. Within banking, we saw a continuation of spending on projects around regulatory and compliance and cybersecurity as well as a growing interest in rearchitecting infrastructure. As mentioned above, macroeconomic concerns are weighing on our banking practice as we go into the start of this year.
Before I move on to healthcare, let me give you an example of the type of projects we're seeing in our Financial Services segment. For a leading property and casualty insurer, we undertook a multiphase project of consolidating and transforming their technology and business processes and shifted to a managed services model. The client's legacy environment and existing processes were creating platform instability and inconsistent service levels, resulting in poor agent and customer experience. By moving to a managed services model, combining applications, business processes and other services, we'll reduce operational risk and deliver cost savings through a variable cost structure in addition to transforming our clients service operations.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 1.4% sequentially and 23.2% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strength in Life Sciences. Rising medical costs, consumerization of healthcare and a changing regulatory environment, among other things, are driving industry consolidation in the payer industry. We're seeing some slowdown in our healthcare practice due to this consolidation, particularly in the early part of this year, as reflected in our Q1 guidance. That said, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the payer segment and are quite encouraged by the large deal pipeline in this area for 2016. As the healthcare industry shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models, healthcare organizations are simultaneously looking for new ways to deliver consumer-centric care while driving operational efficiencies. We are helping many through this transition. A great example of this work is the work we're doing for the Texas Children's Health Plan. They recently leveraged Cognizant services and the TriZetto healthcare process automation service to add a new line of business and improve its claims end of processes, processing times, costs and claims backlog. By automating both technology and business processes, the solution reduced the clients' claim backlog by 65% in the first week of implementation.
Moving to our Life Sciences business, we had a strong quarter as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for the pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Additionally, we saw continued strong growth among our medical device clients. Within Life Sciences, we continue to see a trend towards multiservice deals leveraging cloud technologies and platforms as well as strength in advanced data analytics. Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 7x of a percent sequentially and 14.3% year-over-year, driven by strength in manufacturing and logistics. As is typical, Q4 is a slow quarter for retail given the lockdown of IT systems during the holiday season. Additionally, there were a number of furloughs in the segment at year end. We continue to see clients focus on modernizing their technology environments, particularly around supply chain and omnichannel commerce solutions. On the manufacturing side, in particular, we saw demand around product transformation as well. Our investments in digital capabilities for the manufacturing segment were recently recognized in a report by AOM Intelligence, formerly Kennedy Research & Advisory. We were recognized for a robust and comprehensive IOT consulting portfolio as well as our expertise in sensors and devices and our ability to design wide-ranging IOT solutions by collaborating from early phase roadmap development through testing, prototyping and deployment of solutions at scale.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.3% sequentially and 15.3% year-over-year. Within the telecom and IME industries, we're seeing demand driven by the need to upgrade and change business support systems to better support digital solutions. For example, one of our clients, a global satellite network and communications provider, has grown through both acquisitions and organic expansion of services -- of service offerings. In the process, they ended up with a complex legacy business support system structure comprised of multiple order and billing solutions. This complexity was hampering their ability to create bundled services and introduce new services. Cognizant was selected to design and implement an integrated business support system solution. This integrated solution will help our clients go to market with a new set of digital open solutions, showcase products from their partners more readily and lower overall cost of ownership.
Now let me turn to our Horizon 2 service lines, cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant business process services. Our Horizon 2 services have reached critical mass and have significantly increased our addressable market. We're pleased with the continued above-average growth that each of our Horizon 2 service lines achieved in 2015. Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerate delivery. The integration between clients legacy technology foundation and new digital architecture is a key driver of demand for our infrastructure services. Increasingly, there's a strong emphasis on automation and IT operations, driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions. Cognizant Infrastructure Services plays a key role in helping clients incorporate a cloud-centric architecture as one part of the strong foundation. 
As the lines between physical and digital assets continue to blur, it will affect the way people, business services, data, machines and devices interact with each other, leading to a significant redesign of business processes. Cognizant Business Process Services is at the forefront of this process redesign, infusing technology and automation in core business processes to help clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while enhancing business outcomes through data analytics. 
As Frank mentioned earlier, Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. Our consulting practice is increasingly working with all parts of our business as clients embark on enterprisewide transformation. 
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 9/10 of a percent sequentially and 18.7% year-over-year. Europe was up 2.3% sequentially, after a 1.7% negative currency impact and 9.6% from last year. The U.K. grew approximately 2% sequentially and 9.8% year-over-year, and Continental Europe grew 2.8% sequentially and 9.5% over prior year.
Finally, we saw a continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up by 6.8% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as India, Singapore and the Middle East, where we are seeing good traction with clients' adoption of digital technologies. For example, for the [indiscernible] Group, one of India's largest conglomerates, Cognizant serves as the e-commerce partner and helps implement their new fashion e-commerce platform to deliver a differentiated shopping experience for customers. 
Finally, let me provide some color on our business operations. Coming into 2015, we were focused on retraining existing employees and hiring new associates to meet the changing demand environment. As a result, our utilization rate dropped. Throughout 2015, we leveraged that training and brought utilization back up to what we believe as a sustainable level. Our Q4 annualized attrition of 19% still remained above our desired range. We're committed to improving our retention levels and have put in place various employee engagement initiatives in 2015. This remains an area of focus for us as we go into 2016. We believe that developing a culture which embraces shared success and supports continuous skills improvement is critical to recruiting and retaining the best talent, driving our continued success and winning in the digital era. However, increased employee engagement must be combined with a continued focus on operational excellence. In 2015, we've put in place a structure to improve our operating discipline, and we will continue to strengthen and raise the bar for operating excellence in 2016. The tremendous efforts of our employees over the course of 2015 to deliver both strong revenue performance as well as improved operational efficiencies enabled us to increase our 2015 bonus accruals to levels well above the prior year.
Additionally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees, business partners, government agencies and others involved in the Chennai recovery efforts that helped quickly bring our business operations back to normal unprecedented flooding in Chennai in the fourth quarter. 
As we enter 2016, I believe that we're well-positioned to capture the evolving opportunities. Although the year is off to a slow start, we believe our investments in expanded capabilities markets, combined with operational excellence and an engaged and empowered workforce, position us well to achieve our goals in 2016. With that, I'll turn the call over to Karen to review our financial results."

Fourth quarter revenue of $3.23 billion met our guidance and represented growth of 1.4% sequentially and 17.9% year-over-year. We had a negative currency headwind, which impacted sequential revenue growth by $11 million or 36 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by 188 basis points or $52 million. 
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.6%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 exceeded guidance by $0.03. 
For the full year 2015, revenue of $12.42 billion represented growth of 21% year-over-year, including a negative currency impact of 258 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.7%, and non-GAAP EPS was $3.07. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 58.2% and 41.8% of revenue, respectfully [ph], for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 1.5% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year. Outsourcing services increased 1.3% sequentially and grew 7.6% from Q4 a year ago. 
During Q4, we saw a continuation of the trend we have seen in recent quarters, whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards project-based work, including digital and other transformational programs. During the fourth quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts and, as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 8 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 300. 
During the quarter, we had 2,400 net employee additions and we ended the quarter with approximately 221,700 employees globally. Approximately 207,600 of our employees were service delivery staff. 
Utilization was essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 76%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 81%. And on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with just over $4.9 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $900 million from the quarter ending September 30, including $350 million in proceeds from our revolver. Our cash and short-term investments net of debt were up by approximately $1.5 billion from the year-ago period.
Total receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 70.3 days. This is down slightly from 70.6 days in Q3. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was $369 million, down from $421 million at the end of Q3. We billed approximately 58% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, which included $350 million outstanding balance on our revolver.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $690 million, financing activities generated approximately $307 million and capital expenditures were approximately $74 million during the quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 650,000 shares for a total cost of $42.1 million and our fully diluted share count decreased to 612.6 million shares for the quarter. To date, we have repurchased approximately 41.2 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.6 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We have $438 million remaining unutilized. 
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $13.65 billion to $14.2 billion, which represents growth of 10% to 14%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. 
For the first quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion. During the first quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.78 to $0.80. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 612.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 612.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%.

I think the situation in healthcare, we've talked to you about it in past calls. As you know, the payer industry is going through a period of some consolidation at the moment, and that is creating some pause with some of our larger payer clients as they defer plans to -- technology plans until their merger plans are clearer, because systems will have to be consolidated, some will have to be retired and so on and so forth, so there's a period of uncertainty. Having said that, in healthcare, we feel very, very good about the pipeline of deals that we have for 2016 of large deals. Many of these deals are on the back of the TriZetto acquisition that we did a little over a year ago. And so in the net, I feel like healthcare will have a slow start to the year but with a very strong pipeline in the back half of the year kicking in. I think Financial Services is a little different. As you know, there have been, in the last couple of months, a lot of macroeconomic concerns around the world. I think as a result of that, Financial Services, particularly banking, or more than insurance, but our banking clients are taking a cautious approach at this point putting some projects on hold, just I think adopting a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I think that will -- I don't have a good view as to when that resolves itself. I think we're going to watch that over the next quarter or 2 and see how it unfolds. And so we're not baking -- we're baking some growth in Financial Services into our view going forward, but I think our view in Financial Services right now is sort of more of a wait-and-see approach.

So we've taken a conservative stance on that for the year. When I look at the pipeline of larger deals, there are several larger deals in the healthcare space that we feel quite good about, and that's why obviously there's a range in our guidance. You never want to count on those deals closing. But if they do, certainly they can be quite beneficial to us. But that would be more towards the latter half of the year."

I think that hypothesis is proving out to be exactly on point. A number of the large deals and that we mentioned a minute ago that are in the healthcare pipeline, as Gordon said, are combined, if you will, Cognizant with TriZetto capabilities together. And so we feel very good about the integration, how it's happened, both from an impact in the market standpoint but also from an internal Cognizant operational standpoint. We've retained the TriZetto leadership team. All of the TriZetto leaders are playing important roles within Cognizant. And we feel very good about both the operational and the market impact results of the TriZetto acquisition. As we look forward, we've continued to say that our primary acquisition focus will be to look at small tuck-in acquisitions. We announced KBACE a few weeks ago. We'll continue to look for acquisitions of that nature in the areas that we've talked to you about in the past like digital, like geographic expansion, like deepening our industry domain expertise. But as is always, as we said in the past, if an opportunity -- scale opportunity presents itself, like TriZetto did, we won't hesitate to look at it if it makes strategic sense for the business."

That said, given our growth rates are materially higher than the industry, even for we believe for 2016, we should be able to provide the best career opportunity. So there's a bunch of stuff we're doing. Chief component of is what we refer to as the Cognizant career architecture. That's where we're making -- giving tremendous clarity on what are the different roles we have, what does it take to move into those different roles so people can self-manage their careers so we remain very much a meritocracy and the best and brightest can move up fast at Cognizant than their alternatives. On compensation, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are strong believers in sharing the success with our employees, our bonus accrual for 2015 was well above what it was for the prior year. And we're a believer in empowerment. Over and over again, when people join us, they say, wow, it's just so invigorating, so exciting. The freedom and the autonomy that I get at Cognizant.

I think the best analogy to draw here is sort of the analogy that we saw during the dotcom transition.

It is -- to really do digital well, you need to combine design talent with consulting talent, with technology talent, with consulting and strategy talent and, of course, you need to bring the clients' perspective into all of this. And so you need, first of all, a very, very diverse set of skills and capabilities. And so when we think about -- when we look at competition, originally, we had, I would say, maybe a couple of years ago, we would see a lot of smaller boutique type of firms that focused more on the design elements and what I think of as the front-end of digital. But I think it's now migrating because clients are looking to deploy digital at global scale and integrate with their legacy applications. And so the firms that we see competing most against are the large firms that have an integrated set of capabilities where they can bring all of those capabilities together. It's not that many firms in the world that can bring design, consulting, technology, industry and knowledge, process expertise at global scale together. I would say there's a small handful of 2 or 3 firms, and those are the ones that we tend to compete with most often."

In Financial Services, they're relatively more recent phenomenon of a little bit of uncertainty. A larger number of what I would say smaller projects getting pushed out because of the macroeconomic uncertainty. So I think that, depending on volatility and what's going on in the industry, could see 1 of 2 scenarios. You could see continued conservatism in spending for a quarter or 2 in Financial Services, or you could see that come back relatively quickly because these are projects that, as I said a minute ago, I think are smaller discretionary projects that could be turned on relatively more quickly. So it's just a little bit difficult to say right now. I think the next month or 2 we'll get better visibility.

Fourth quarter revenue was $3.23 billion, up 1.4% over last quarter and 17.9% year-over-year. For the full year 2015, we delivered $12.42 billion of revenue, which represented growth of 21% over 2014. We're pleased with our performance in 2015 having raised our full year guidance 3x during the year. We expect to deliver revenue within a range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion for Q1 of 2016, reflecting some softness in our Banking and Financial Services and Healthcare segments as we start the year. For the full year, we expect to deliver revenue within a range of $13.65 billion to $14.2 billion. This represents full year growth of 10% to 14%, including an approximate 1 point negative currency impact.
You'll notice that we have changed the way we provide guidance. Going forward, we will provide a range for both revenue and EPS in our quarterly and full year projections. We believe this approach provides better visibility to our investors.
As we entered 2016, I'd now like to spend a few moments give you some color on the market and demand environment and also the investments we continue to make to stay ahead of the market. As you know, there's now no doubt that we're in the midst of a disruptive technological shift that's pushing clients to look for innovative ways to adapt their traditional business models and products. It's clear that our market opportunities are substantial. 
I'd like to share 4 observations from having been on the front lines of the digital transition for the past 5 years. 
The first observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that from a technology standpoint, most clients cannot make an immediate clean-sheet-of-paper transition to a digital technology backbone. Clients will typically build a digital architecture on top of their legacy technology, and the integration between these 2 layers is a very critical part of the transformation. Our intimate knowledge of our clients' legacy compliant with our leading-edge digital capabilities really give us an edge here. 
The second observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that a new, broader set of capabilities is required to help clients navigate the digital transition. In the digital world, consulting must include both strategic consulting and design sensibilities. An end-to-end digital realization requires consulting, design, technology and industry knowledge. Our digital works model is deliberately built to combine strategy, design, technology and business consulting into one tightly integrated model.
The third observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that now, more than ever, knowledge of our clients' industries and processes is critically important. As our clients seek to digitize all aspects of their business, they are reinventing their business models and their processes. Our deep industry knowledge and process expertise enables us to partner with them as they work through the process of transforming their businesses into digital enterprises. 
And the final observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that as digital goes mainstream, clients need a partner with global scale and heft to support them. As clients look to rapidly scale, they need the best talent at scale available across the globe. Our global footprint and team is a substantial asset in this regard.
With these 4 observations, I'd like to now update you on the key areas of investment focus we outlined last year: building digital capabilities, evolving our IT services, building platform solutions and further investing in consulting that continue to enhance our capabilities.
So first, we are building capabilities to enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. Our digital works approach is solid and showing results. Our focus now is to scale that capability quickly across the world. 
Let me explain with an example. We recently signed a strategic multimillion dollar engagement with Etihad Airways, a United Arab Emirates flag carrier, to define a comprehensive digital transformation strategy. While Etihad Airways is renowned for a world-class experience in the air, they realized that customer experience starts long before the customer arrives at the airport and continues after they land. The Cognizant Digital Works team and other partners are helping Etihad to envision future customer experience possibilities, whether these interactions happen via the web, mobile apps or airport kiosks. As clients like Etihad navigate the challenges involved in becoming digital enterprises, we continue to build out our portfolio of offerings to help them navigate that shift.
Second, we are evolving our IT services capabilities to enable our clients to create next-generation technology infrastructures that are characterized by high levels of operational efficiency at the back end and enhanced by new digital capabilities on the front end. To achieve this goal, clients are being challenged to lower total cost of ownership of legacy environments to reinvest these savings into enabling digital transformation or what we have often called the dual mandate. In creating solutions for next-generation IT, we are focused on both sides of the dual mandate. On one side, we are bringing in higher levels of automation, integrating our service lines and moving core processes to a managed services environment to improve operational effectiveness. On the other side, we're modernizing legacy systems to create the backbone to help our clients become digital enterprises. Our recent acquisition of KBACE Technologies, for example, will enhance our capabilities in next-generation IT. KBACE has 400 technology and consulting associates specializing in Oracle Cloud Applications. Cloud and SaaS migration is a key component of the solution to the dual mandate. This acquisition will expand our digital and cloud capabilities to help more clients deploy SaaS applications to lower costs and increase business agility.
Our third focus area of investment is building platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new levels of efficiency. We've created a number of sharply focused, vertical platform-based solutions that we offer to clients in a Business Process-as-a-Service or BPaaS model. These solutions enable clients to turn over entire processes or subprocesses to us to own and operate on an output or outcome-based commercial model. These solutions not only help our clients create variable cost structures but reduce their time to value by quickly getting clients to best-in-class benchmark levels of performance. And by embedding analytics in these platforms, we're able to bring critical insights and share best practices and industry knowledge across multiple customers. We have a head start here through our acquisition of TriZetto in 2014 as well as having developed a number of our own platforms in core areas, such as clinical trials in life sciences that have shown good traction. For example, several quarters back, we announced an engagement with TransCelerate to develop and build a cloud-based shared investigator platform for global life sciences companies to use in clinical trials. This platform provides a unified point of access on a single platform, linking all the critical personnel running clinical trials with major global pharmaceutical companies. This enabled standardization, consistency and operational efficiency, resulting in lower cost and faster processing of clinical trials. 
And our fourth investment area is driven by our recognition that we must continue to drive ever more strategic relationships with our clients. Cognizant Consulting Group, or CBC, is a critical component of this effort. For over 10 years, we have built out our consulting practice and have integrated this practice into all parts of our business. We believe that a strong consulting practice is essential to helping clients envision and implement many transitions facing their businesses. 
In closing, 2015 was a very significant year for us. We strengthened our position as a leading transformational partner for our clients. I'm happy with our progress and proud of the accomplishments of our teams. I'm confident that we will remain the partner of choice for our clients as they transition to the digital economy. 
With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later to take your questions. Gordon?"

I'd like to add some comments on the overall demand environment and provide an update on client budgets before moving to our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter. Client budgets are complet",1607,"Think you, Francisco. I'd like to add some comments on the overall demand environment and provide an update on client budgets before moving to our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter. 
Client budgets are complete, and the outcome is very much as we expected. As Frank mentioned, we're seeing a soft start to the year in Banking and Financial Services, primarily due to macroeconomic concerns, and in Healthcare, on the back of industry consolidation in the payer industry. More broadly, clients continue to face a dual mandate within their operations, and we expect many of the trends we saw driving demand within our portfolio services in 2015 to continue over the course of 2016. With that in mind, let me now provide you with additional color on our results across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies.
Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 1.8% sequentially and 16.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong performance in insurance. We're seeing an increased interest in managed service deals, with both banking and insurance clients, as clients continue to focus on cost optimization and look for ways to increase operational efficiencies. Within banking, we saw a continuation of spending on projects around regulatory and compliance and cybersecurity as well as a growing interest in rearchitecting infrastructure. As mentioned above, macroeconomic concerns are weighing on our banking practice as we go into the start of this year.
Before I move on to Healthcare, let me give you an example of the type of projects we're seeing in our Financial Services segment. For a leading property and casualty insurer, we undertook a multiphase project of consolidating and transforming their technology and business processes and shifted to a managed services model. The client's legacy environment and existing processes were creating platform instability and inconsistent service levels, resulting in poor agent and customer experience. By moving to a managed services model, combining applications, business processes and other services, we'll reduce operational risk and deliver cost savings through a variable cost structure, in addition to transforming our client's service operations.
Our Healthcare segment, which consist of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 1.4% sequentially and 23.2% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strength in Life Sciences. Rising medical costs, consumerization of healthcare and a changing regulatory environment, among other things, are driving industry consolidation in the payer industry. We're seeing some slowdown in our Healthcare practice due to this consolidation, particularly in the early part of this year, as reflected in our Q1 guidance. That said, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the payer segment and are quite encouraged by the large deal pipeline in this area for 2016. As the Healthcare industry shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models, healthcare organizations are simultaneously looking for new ways to deliver consumer-centric care while driving operational efficiencies. We're helping many through this transition. 
A great example of this work is the work we're doing for the Texas Children's Health Plan. They recently leveraged Cognizant services and the TriZetto Healthcare Process Automation Service to add a new line of business and improve its claims at processes, processing times, costs and claims backlog. By automating both technology and business processes, the solution reduced the clients' claim backlog by 65% in the first week of implementation.
Moving to our Life Sciences business. We had a strong quarter, as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for the pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Additionally, we saw continued strong growth among our medical device clients. Within Life Sciences, we continue to see a trend towards multiservice deals leveraging cloud technologies and platforms as well as strength in advanced data analytics. 
Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 0.7% sequentially and 14.3% year-over-year, driven by strength in manufacturing and logistics. As is typical, Q4 is a slow quarter for retail, given the lockdown of IT systems during the holiday season. 
Additionally, there were a number of furloughs in the segment at year-end. We continue to see clients focus on modernizing their technology environments, particularly around supply chain and omnichannel commerce solutions. On the manufacturing side, in particular, we saw demand around product transformation as well. Our investments in digital capabilities for the Manufacturing segment were recently recognized in a report by ALM Intelligence, formerly Kennedy Research & Advisory. We were recognized for a robust and comprehensive IOT consulting portfolio as well as our expertise in sensors and devices and our ability to design wide-ranging IOT solutions by collaborating from early phase roadmap development through testing, prototyping and deployment of solutions at scale.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.3% sequentially and 15.3% year-over-year. Within the telecom and IME industries, we're seeing demand driven by the need to upgrade and change business support systems to better support digital solutions. 
For example, one of our clients, a global satellite network and communications provider, has grown through both acquisitions and organic expansion of services -- of service offerings. In the process, they ended up with a complex legacy business support system structure comprised of multiple order and billing solutions. This complexity was hampering their ability to create bundled services and introduce new services. Cognizant was selected to design and implement an integrated business support system solution. This integrated solution will help our clients go to market with a new set of digital open solutions, showcase products from their partners more readily and lower overall cost of ownership.
Now let me turn to our Horizon 2 service lines, Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 services have reached critical mass and have significantly increased our addressable market. We're pleased with the continued above-average growth that each of our Horizon 2 service lines achieved in 2015. Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerate delivery. The integration between clients' legacy technology foundation and new digital architecture is a key driver of demand for our Infrastructure Services. Increasingly, there is a strong emphasis on automation and IT operations, driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions. Cognizant Infrastructure Services plays a key role in helping clients incorporate a cloud-centric architecture as one part of the strong foundation.
As the lines between physical and digital assets continue to blur, it will affect the way people, business services, data, machines and devices interact with each other, leading to a significant redesign of business processes. Cognizant Business Process Services is at the forefront of this process redesign, infusing technology and automation in core business processes to help clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while enhancing business outcomes through data analytics.
As Frank mentioned earlier, Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. Our consulting practice is increasingly working with all parts of our business, as clients embark on enterprise-wide transformation. 
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 0.9% sequentially and 18.7% year-over-year. Europe was up 2.3% sequentially, after a 1.7% negative currency impact and 9.6% from last year. The U.K. grew approximately 2% sequentially and 9.8% year-over-year, and Continental Europe grew 2.8% sequentially and 9.5% over prior year.
Finally, we saw a continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up by 6.8% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strengths in key markets, such as India, Singapore and the Middle East, where we are seeing good traction with clients' adoption of digital technologies. 
For example, for the Aditya Birla Group, one of India's largest conglomerates, Cognizant serves as the e-commerce partner and helps implement their new fashion e-commerce platform to deliver a differentiated shopping experience for customers. 
Finally, let me provide some color on our business operations. Coming into 2015, we were focused on retraining existing employees and hiring new associates to meet the changing demand environment. As a result, our utilization rate dropped. Throughout 2015, we leveraged that training and brought utilization back up to what we believe as a sustainable level. Our Q4 annualized attrition of 19% still remained above our desired range. We're committed to improving our retention levels and have put in place various employee engagement initiatives in 2015. This remains an area of focus for us as we go into 2016. We believe that developing a culture which embraces shared success and supports continuous skills improvement is critical to recruiting and retaining the best talent, driving our continued success and winning in the digital era. However, increased employee engagement must be combined with a continued focus on operational excellence. In 2015, we put in place a structure to improve our operating discipline, and we will continue to strengthen and raise the bar for operating excellence in 2016. The tremendous efforts of our employees over the course of 2015 to deliver both strong revenue performance as well as improved operational efficiencies enabled us to increase our 2015 bonus accruals to levels well above the prior year.
Additionally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees, business partners, government agencies and others involved in the Chennai recovery efforts that helped in quickly bringing our business operations back to normal following the unprecedented flooding in Chennai in the fourth quarter. 
As we enter 2016, I believe that we're well positioned to capture the evolving opportunities. Although the year is off to a slow start, we believe our investments in expanded capabilities markets, combined with operational excellence and an engaged and empowered workforce position us well to achieve our goals in 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Karen to review our financial results."

We had a negative currency headwind, which impacted sequential revenue growth by $11 million or 36 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by 188 basis points or $52 million.
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.6%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 exceeded guidance by $0.03.
For the full year 2015, revenue of $12.42 billion represented growth of 21% year-over-year, including a negative currency impact of 258 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.7%, and non-GAAP EPS was $3.07. 
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 58.2% and 41.8% of revenue, respectively for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 1.5% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year. Outsourcing services increased 1.3% sequentially and grew 7.6% from Q4 a year ago. 
During Q4, we saw a continuation of the trend we have seen in recent quarters whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards project-based work, including digital and other transformational programs. During the fourth quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 8 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 300. 
During the quarter, we had 2,400 net employee additions, and we ended the quarter with approximately 221,700 employees globally. Approximately 207,600 of our employees were service delivery staff. 
Utilization was essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 76%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 81%. And on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with just over $4.9 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $900 million from the quarter ending September 30, including $350 million in proceeds from our revolver. Our cash and short-term investments, net of debt, were up by approximately $1.5 billion from the year-ago period.
Total receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 70.3 days. This is down slightly from 70.6 days in Q3. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was $369 million, down from $421 million at the end of Q3. We billed approximately 58% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, which included $350 million outstanding balance on our revolver.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $690 million. Financing activities generated approximately $307 million, and capital expenditures were approximately $74 million during the quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 650,000 shares for a total cost of $42.1 million, and our fully diluted share count decreased to 612.6 million shares for the quarter. To date, we have repurchased approximately 41.2 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.6 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We have $438 million remaining unutilized.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $13.65 billion to $14.2 billion, which represents growth of 10% to 14%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. 
For the first quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion. During the first quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.78 to $0.80. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 612.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 612.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%.
Now we would like to open the call for questions. Operator?"

Let me take a crack at that, and then Gordon can jump in if there's additional color. Look, I think in -- let me start with Healthcare. I think the situation in Healthcare -- we've talked to you about it in past calls, as you know, the payer industry is going through a period of some consolidation at the moment, and that is creating some pause with some of our larger payer clients, as they defer plans to -- technology plans until their merger plans are clearer. Because systems will have to be consolidated, some will have to be retired and so on and so forth, so there's a period of uncertainty. Having said that, in Healthcare, we feel very, very good about the pipeline of deals that we have for 2016 of large deals. Many of these deals are on the back of the TriZetto acquisition that we did little over a year ago. And so in the net, I feel like Healthcare will have a slow start to the year, but with a very strong pipeline in the back half of the year kicking in. I think Financial Services is a little different. As you know, there have been, in the last couple of months, a lot of macroeconomic concerns around the world. I think as a result of that, Financial Services, particularly banking more than insurance -- but our banking clients are taking a cautious approach at this point putting some projects on hold, just I think adopting a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I think that will -- I don't have a good view as to when that resolves itself. I think we're going to watch that over the next quarter or 2 and see how it unfolds. And so we're not baking -- we're baking some growth in Financial Services into our view going forward, but I think our view in Financial Services right now is sort of more of a wait-and-see approach. Gordon, is there anything you want to add to that?"

Look, I think we've been more than pleased with the results of the TriZetto acquisition. As you said, it's been a little over a year. The hypothesis was that acquiring intellectual property in the form of a platform would allow us to combine that software with our traditional IT and BPO services and create solutions and bundles of solutions for clients that neither company would independently have been able to provide in the marketplace. I think that hypothesis is proving out to be exactly on point. A number of the large deals that we mentioned a minute ago that are in the Healthcare pipeline, as Gordon said, are combined, if you will, Cognizant with TriZetto capabilities together. And so we feel very good about the integration, how it's happened, both from an impact in the market standpoint but also from an internal Cognizant operational standpoint. We've retained the TriZetto leadership team. All of the TriZetto leaders are playing important roles within Cognizant, and we feel very good about both the operational and the market impact results of the TriZetto acquisition. As we look forward, I -- we continue to say that our primary acquisition focus will be to look at small tuck-in acquisitions. We announced KBACE a few weeks ago. We'll continue to look for acquisitions of that nature in the areas that we've talked to you about in the past like digital, like geographic expansion, like deepening our industry domain expertise. But as is always, as we said in the past, if a scale opportunity presents itself, like TriZetto did, we won't hesitate to look at it if it makes strategic sense for the business."

That's where we're making -- giving tremendous clarity on what are the different roles we have, what does it take to move into those different roles, so people can self-manage their careers, so we remain very much a meritocracy and the best and the brightest can move up faster at Cognizant than their alternatives. On compensation, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are strong believers in sharing the success with our employees. Our bonus accrual for 2015 was well above what it was for the prior year, and we're a believer in empowerment. Over and over again, when people join us, they say, ""Wow, it's just so invigorating, so exciting the freedom and the autonomy that I get at Cognizant."" So when you combine all of those, I think, we'll be in good shape. Obviously, we had the headwind of our BPS businesses growing faster than company average, and by definition, BPS has a bit of higher attrition. But I think it's headed back towards the levels that we want. And on -- do you want to comment on?"

Yes, it costs us some money, but in the realm of things, it's not material for us. So we expect to be able to handle that within the current margin. We're always conscious of what's happening in immigration. Cognizant is a leader in immigration compliance. We feel very good about our structure. We have independent audits on a voluntary basis all the time. We've separated compliance from the actual immigration transaction. So we feel good about that. At the same time, we are working hard to hire more and more Americans. We further expanded our college recruiting program. We further expanded our U.S. MBA recruiting. We're investing heavily in STEM education, which is obviously a longer-term solution. But clearly, we have to watch immigration during the political cycle. But we certainly feel good that we're playing by both the letter and spirit of the law, and we are making efforts to hire more locals. One thing is we are very excited about is our veterans program. We've hired several hundred veterans over the recent past, and we've actually just further strengthened the hiring of veterans as some of the leaders in the company have come out of military. They've taken leadership on this program. So I think that's going to yield good results as well."

I think the best analogy to draw here is sort of the analogy that we saw during the dotcom transition. What we're seeing is that, as I said in my prepared remarks, that digital is not just a technology issue, right. It is -- to really do digital well, you need to combine design talent with consulting talent, with technology talent, with consulting and strategy talent, and, of course, you need to bring the clients' perspective into all of this. And so you need, first of all, a very, very diverse set of skills and capabilities. And so when we think about -- when we look at competition, originally, we -- I would say, maybe a couple of years ago, we would see a lot of smaller boutique type of firms that focused more on the design elements and what I think of as the front end of digital. But I think it's now migrating because clients are looking to deploy digital at global scale and integrate with their legacy applications. And so the firms that we see competing most against are the large firms that have an integrated set of capabilities where they can bring all of those capabilities together. It's not that many firms in the world that can bring design, consulting, technology, industry knowledge, process expertise at global scale together. I would say there's a small handful of 2 or 3 firms, and those are the ones that we tend to compete with most often."

So we would look to acquisitions that expand our geographic capabilities. We would look at acquisitions that broaden or deepen our core service lines and service offerings. So as we think about digital as a service offering, as we think about our Horizon 2 businesses that are growing very fast right now, we would look at acquisitions that accelerate those service offerings.

In Financial Services, they're relatively more recent phenomenon of a little bit of uncertainty. A larger number of, what I would say, smaller projects getting pushed out because of the macroeconomic uncertainty. So I think that depending on volatility and what's going on in the industry, you could see 1 of 2 scenarios. You could see continued conservatism in spending for a quarter or 2 in Financial Services or you could see that come back relatively quickly because these are projects that, as I said a minute ago, I think are smaller discretionary projects that could be turned on relatively more quickly. So it's just a little bit difficult to say right now. I think the next month or 2 we'll get better visibility.

I presume you saw our announcement reaffirming our 2015 guidance a few weeks ago. We finished 2015 as we had anticipated. Fourth quarter revenue was $3.23 billion, up 1.4% over last quarter and 17.9% year-over-year. For the full year 2015, we delivered $12.42 billion of revenue, which represented growth of 21% over 2014. We're pleased with our performance in 2015 having raised our full year guidance 3x during the year. We expect to deliver revenue within a range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion for Q1 of 2016, reflecting some softness in our Banking and Financial Services and Healthcare segments as we start the year. For the full year, we expect to deliver revenue within a range of $13.65 billion to $14.2 billion. This represents full year growth of 10% to 14%, including an approximate 1 point negative currency impact.
You'll notice that we have changed the way we provide guidance. Going forward, we will provide a range for both revenue and EPS in our quarterly and full year projections. We believe this approach provides better visibility to our investors.
As we enter 2016, I'd now like to spend a few moments giving you some color on the market and demand environment and also the investments we continue to make to stay ahead of the market. As you know, there's now no doubt that we're in the midst of a disruptive technological shift that's pushing clients to look for innovative ways to adapt their traditional business models and products. It's clear that our market opportunities are substantial. 
I'd like to share 4 observations from having been on the front lines of the digital transition for the past 5 years. 
The first observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that from a technology standpoint, most clients cannot make an immediate clean-sheet-of-paper transition to a digital technology backbone. Clients will typically build a digital architecture on top of their legacy technology, and the integration between these 2 layers is a very critical part of the transformation. Our intimate knowledge of our clients' legacy combined with our leading-edge digital capabilities really give us an edge here. 
The second observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that a new, broader set of capabilities is required to help clients navigate the digital transition. In the digital world, consulting must include both strategy consulting and design sensibilities. An end-to-end digital realization requires consulting, design, technology and industry knowledge. Our digital works model is deliberately built to combine strategy, design, technology and business consulting into one tightly integrated model.
The third observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that now, more than ever, knowledge of our clients' industries and processes is critically important. As our clients seek to digitize all aspects of their business, they are reinventing their business models and their processes. Our deep industry knowledge and process expertise enables us to partner with them as they work through the process of transforming their businesses into digital enterprises. 
And the final observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that as digital goes mainstream, clients need a partner with global scale and heft to support them. As clients look to rapidly scale, they need the best talent at scale available across the globe. Our global footprint and team is a substantial asset in this regard.
With these 4 observations, I'd like to now update you on the key areas of investment focus we outlined last year: building digital capabilities, evolving our IT services, building platform solutions and further investing in consulting that continue to enhance our capabilities.
So first, we are building capabilities to enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. Our digital works approach is solid and showing results. Our focus now is to scale that capability quickly across the world. 
Let me explain with an example. We recently signed a strategic multimillion dollar engagement with Etihad Airways, a United Arab Emirates flag carrier, to define a comprehensive digital transformation strategy. While Etihad Airways is renowned for a world-class experience in the air, they realize that customer experience starts long before the customer arrives at the airport and continues after they land. The Cognizant Digital Works team and other partners are helping Etihad to envision future customer experience possibilities, whether these interactions happen via the web, mobile apps or airport kiosks. As clients like Etihad navigate the challenges involved in becoming digital enterprises, we continue to build out our portfolio of offerings to help them navigate that shift.
Second, we are evolving our IT services capabilities to enable our clients to create next-generation technology infrastructures that are characterized by high levels of operational efficiency at the back end and enhanced by new digital capabilities on the front end. To achieve this goal, clients are being challenged to lower total cost of ownership of legacy environments, to reinvest these savings into enabling digital transformation or what we have often called the dual mandate. In creating solutions for next-generation IT, we are focused on both sides of the dual mandate. On one side, we are bringing in higher levels of automation, integrating our service lines and moving core processes to a managed services environment to improve operational effectiveness. On the other side, we're modernizing legacy systems to create the backbone to help our clients become digital enterprises. Our recent acquisition of KBACE Technologies, for example, will enhance our capabilities in next-generation IT. KBACE has 400 technology and consulting associates specializing in Oracle Cloud Applications. Cloud and SaaS migration is a key component of the solution to the dual mandate. This acquisition will expand our digital and cloud capabilities to help more clients deploy SaaS applications to lower costs and increase business agility.
Our third focus area of investment is building platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new levels of efficiency. We've created a number of sharply focused, vertical platform-based solutions that we offer to clients in a Business Process-as-a-Service or BPaaS model. These solutions enable clients to turn over entire processes or subprocesses to us to own and operate on an output or outcome-based commercial model. These solutions not only help our clients create variable cost structures but reduce their time to value by quickly getting clients to best-in-class benchmark levels of performance. And by embedding analytics in these platforms, we're able to bring critical insights and share best practices and industry knowledge across multiple customers. We have a head start here through our acquisition of TriZetto in 2014 as well as having developed a number of our own platforms in core areas, such as clinical trials in life sciences that have shown good traction. For example, several quarters back, we announced an engagement with TransCelerate to develop and build a cloud-based shared investigative platform for global life sciences companies to use in clinical trials. This platform provides a unified point of access on a single platform, linking all the critical personnel running clinical trials with major global pharmaceutical companies. This enables standardization, consistency and operational efficiency, resulting in lower cost and faster processing of clinical trials. 
And our fourth investment area is driven by our recognition that we must continue to drive ever more strategic relationships with our clients. Cognizant's Consulting Group, or CBC, is a critical component of this effort. For over 10 years, we have built out our consulting practice and have integrated this practice into all parts of our business. We believe that a strong consulting practice is essential to helping clients envision and implement the many transitions facing their businesses. 
In closing, 2015 was a very significant year for us. We strengthened our position as a leading transformational partner for our clients. I'm happy with our progress and proud of the accomplishments of our teams. I'm confident that we will remain the partner of choice for our clients as they transition to the digital economy. 
With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later to take your questions. Gordon?"

I'd like to add some comments on the overall demand environment and provide an update on client budgets before moving to our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter. Client budgets are complet",1611,"Think you, Francisco. I'd like to add some comments on the overall demand environment and provide an update on client budgets before moving to our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter. 
Client budgets are complete, and the outcome is very much as we expected. As Frank mentioned, we're seeing a soft start to the year in Banking and Financial Services, primarily due to macroeconomic concerns, and in Healthcare, on the back of industry consolidation in the payer industry. More broadly, clients continue to face a dual mandate within their operations, and we expect many of the trends we saw driving demand within our portfolio of services in 2015 to continue over the course of 2016. With that in mind, let me now provide you with additional color on our results across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies.
Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 1.8% sequentially and 16.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong performance in insurance. We're seeing an increased interest in managed service deals with both banking and insurance clients, as clients continue to focus on cost optimization and look for ways to increase operational efficiencies. Within banking, we saw a continuation of spending on projects around regulatory and compliance and cybersecurity as well as a growing interest in rearchitecting infrastructure. As mentioned above, macroeconomic concerns are weighing on our banking practice as we go into the start of this year.
Before I move on to Healthcare, let me give you an example of the type of projects we're seeing in our Financial Services segment. For a leading property and casualty insurer, we undertook a multiphase project of consolidating and transforming their technology and business processes and shifted to a managed services model. The client's legacy environment and existing processes were creating platform instability and inconsistent service levels, resulting in poor agent and customer experience. By moving to a managed services model, combining applications, business processes and other services, we'll reduce operational risk and deliver cost savings through a variable cost structure, in addition to transforming our client's service operations.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 1.4% sequentially and 23.2% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strength in Life Sciences. Rising medical costs, consumerization of healthcare and a changing regulatory environment, among other things, are driving industry consolidation in the payer industry. We're seeing some slowdown in our Healthcare practice due to this consolidation, particularly in the early part of this year, as reflected in our Q1 guidance. That said, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the payer segment and are quite encouraged by the large deal pipeline in this area for 2016. As the Healthcare industry shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models, healthcare organizations are simultaneously looking for new ways to deliver consumer-centric care while driving operational efficiencies. We're helping many through this transition. 
A great example of this work is the work we're doing for the Texas Children's Health Plan. They recently leveraged Cognizant services and the TriZetto Healthcare Process Automation Service to add a new line of business and improve its claims, edit [ph] processes, processing times, costs and claims backlog. By automating both technology and business processes, the solution reduced the clients' claim backlog by 65% in the first week of implementation.
Moving to our Life Sciences business. We had a strong quarter, as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for the pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Additionally, we saw a continued strong growth among our medical device clients. Within Life Sciences, we continue to see a trend towards multiservice deals leveraging cloud technologies and platforms as well as strength in advanced data analytics. 
Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 0.7% sequentially and 14.3% year-over-year, driven by strength in manufacturing and logistics. As is typical, Q4 is a slow quarter for retail, given the lockdown of IT systems during the holiday season. 
Additionally, there were a number of furloughs in the segment at year-end. We continue to see clients focus on modernizing their technology environments, particularly around supply chain and omnichannel commerce solutions. On the manufacturing side, in particular, we saw demand around product transformation as well. Our investments in digital capabilities for the Manufacturing segment were recently recognized in a report by ALM Intelligence, formerly Kennedy Research & Advisory. We were recognized for a robust and comprehensive IOT consulting portfolio as well as our expertise in sensors and devices and our ability to design wide-ranging IOT solutions by collaborating from early phase roadmap development through testing, prototyping and deployment of solutions at scale.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.3% sequentially and 15.3% year-over-year. Within the telecom and IME industries, we're seeing demand driven by the need to upgrade and change business support systems to better support digital solutions. 
For example, one of our clients, a global satellite network and communications provider, has grown through both acquisitions and organic expansion of services -- of service offerings. In the process, they ended up with a complex legacy business support system structure comprised of multiple order and billing solutions. This complexity was hampering their ability to create bundled services and introduce new services. Cognizant was selected to design and implement an integrated business support system solution. This integrated solution will help our clients go to market with a new set of digital open solutions, showcase products from their partners more readily and lower overall cost of ownership.
Now let me turn to our Horizon 2 service lines, Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 services have reached critical mass and have significantly increased our addressable market. We're pleased with the continued above-average growth that each of our Horizon 2 service lines achieved in 2015. Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. The integration between clients' legacy technology foundation and new digital architecture is a key driver of demand for our Infrastructure Services. Increasingly, there's a strong emphasis on automation in IT operations, driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions. Cognizant Infrastructure Services plays a key role in helping clients incorporate a cloud-centric architecture as one part of a strong foundation.
As the lines between physical and digital assets continue to blur, it will affect the way people, business services, data, machines and devices interact with each other, leading to a significant redesign of business processes. Cognizant Business Process Services is at the forefront of this process redesign, infusing technology and automation in core business processes to help clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while enhancing business outcomes through data analytics.
As Frank mentioned earlier, Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. Our consulting practice is increasingly working with all parts of our business, as clients embark on enterprise-wide transformation. 
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 0.9% sequentially and 18.7% year-over-year. Europe was up 2.3% sequentially, after a 1.7% negative currency impact and 9.6% from last year. The U.K. grew approximately 2% sequentially and 9.8% year-over-year, and Continental Europe grew 2.8% sequentially and 9.5% over prior year.
Finally, we saw a continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up by 6.8% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strengths in key markets, such as India, Singapore and the Middle East, where we are seeing good traction with clients' adoption of digital technologies. 
For example, for the Aditya Birla Group, one of India's largest conglomerates, Cognizant serves as the e-commerce partner and helps implement their new fashion e-commerce platform to deliver a differentiated shopping experience for customers. 
Finally, let me provide some color on our business operations. Coming into 2015, we were focused on retraining existing employees and hiring new associates to meet the changing demand environment. As a result, our utilization rate dropped. Throughout 2015, we leveraged that training and brought utilization back up to what we believe is [ph] a sustainable level. Our Q4 annualized attrition of 19% still remained above our desired range. We're committed to improving our retention levels and have put in place various employee engagement initiatives in 2015. This remains an area of focus for us as we go into 2016. We believe that developing a culture which embraces shared success and supports continuous skills improvement is critical to recruiting and retaining the best talent, driving our continued success and winning in the digital era. However, increased employee engagement must be combined with a continued focus on operational excellence. In 2015, we put in place a structure to improve our operating discipline, and we will continue to strengthen and raise the bar for operating excellence in 2016. The tremendous efforts of our employees over the course of 2015 to deliver both strong revenue performance as well as improved operational efficiencies enabled us to increase our 2015 bonus accruals to levels well above the prior year.
Additionally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees, business partners, government agencies and others involved in the Chennai recovery efforts that helped in quickly bringing our business operations back to normal following the unprecedented flooding in Chennai in the fourth quarter. 
As we enter 2016, I believe that we're well positioned to capture the evolving opportunities. Although the year is off to a slow start, we believe our investments in expanded capabilities and markets, combined with operational excellence and an engaged and empowered workforce position us well to achieve our goals in 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Karen to review our financial results."

Fourth quarter revenue of $3.23 billion met our guidance and represented growth of 1.4% sequentially and 17.9% year-over-year. We had a negative currency headwind, which impacted sequential revenue growth by $11 million or 36 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by 188 basis points or $52 million.
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.6%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 exceeded guidance by $0.03.
For the full year 2015, revenue of $12.42 billion represented growth of 21% year-over-year, including a negative currency impact of 258 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.7%, and non-GAAP EPS was $3.07. 
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 58.2% and 41.8% of revenue, respectfully (sic) [respectively] for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 1.5% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year. Outsourcing services increased 1.3% sequentially and grew 7.6% from Q4 a year ago. 
During Q4, we saw a continuation of the trend we have seen in recent quarters whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards project-based work, including digital and other transformational programs. During the fourth quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 8 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 300. 
During the quarter, we had 2,400 net employee additions, and we ended the quarter with approximately 221,700 employees globally. Approximately 207,600 of our employees were service delivery staff. 
Utilization was essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 76%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 81%. And on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with just over $4.9 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $900 million from the quarter ending September 30, including $350 million in proceeds from our revolver. Our cash and short-term investments, net of debt, were up by approximately $1.5 billion from the year-ago period.
Total receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 70.3 days. This is down slightly from 70.6 days in Q3. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was $369 million, down from $421 million at the end of Q3. We billed approximately 58% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, which included $350 million outstanding balance on our revolver.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $690 million. Financing activities generated approximately $307 million, and capital expenditures were approximately $74 million during the quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 650,000 shares for a total cost of $42.1 million, and our fully diluted share count decreased to 612.6 million shares for the quarter. To date, we have repurchased approximately 41.2 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.6 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We have $438 million remaining unutilized.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $13.65 billion to $14.2 billion, which represents growth of 10% to 14%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. 
For the first quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion. During the first quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.78 to $0.80. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 612.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 612.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%.

Let me take a crack at that, and then Gordon can jump in if there's additional color. Look, I think in -- let me start with Healthcare. I think the situation in Healthcare -- we've talked to you about it in past calls, as you know, the payer industry is going through a period of some consolidation at the moment, and that is creating some pause with some of our larger payer clients, as they defer plans to -- technology plans until their merger plans are clearer. Because systems will have to be consolidated, some will have to be retired and so on and so forth, so there's a period of uncertainty. Having said that, in Healthcare, we feel very, very good about the pipeline of deals that we have for 2016 of large deals. Many of these deals are on the back of the TriZetto acquisition that we did a little over a year ago. And so in the net, I feel like Healthcare will have a slow start to the year, but with a very strong pipeline in the back half of the year kicking in. I think Financial Services is a little different. As you know, there have been, in the last couple of months, a lot of macroeconomic concerns around the world. I think as a result of that, Financial Services, particularly banking more than insurance -- but our banking clients are taking a cautious approach at this point putting some projects on hold, just I think adopting a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I think that will -- I don't have a good view as to when that resolves itself. I think we're going to watch that over the next quarter or 2 and see how it unfolds. And so we're not baking -- we're baking some growth in Financial Services into our view going forward, but I think our view in Financial Services right now is sort of more of a wait-and-see approach.

That said, given our growth rates are materially higher than the industry, even for -- we believe for 2016, we should be able to provide the best career opportunities. So there's a bunch of stuff we're doing. Chief component of is what we refer to as the Cognizant Career Architecture.  That's where we're making -- giving tremendous clarity on what are the different roles we have, what does it take to move into those different roles, so people can self-manage their careers, so we remain very much a meritocracy and the best and the brightest can move up faster at Cognizant than their alternatives. On compensation, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are strong believers in sharing the success with our employees. Our bonus accrual for 2015 was well above what it was for the prior year, and we're a believer in empowerment. Over and over again, when people join us, they say, ""Wow, it's just so invigorating, so exciting the freedom and the autonomy that I get at Cognizant."" So when you combine all of those, I think, we'll be in good shape.

We have independent audits on a voluntary basis all the time. We've separated compliance from the actual immigration transaction. So we feel good about that. At the same time, we are working hard to hire more and more Americans. We've further expanded our college recruiting program. We've further expanded our U.S. MBA recruiting. We're investing heavily in STEM education, which is obviously a longer-term solution. But clearly, we have to watch immigration during the political cycle. But we certainly feel good that we're playing by both the letter and spirit of the law, and we are making efforts to hire more locals. One of the things we are very excited about is our veterans program.

I think the best analogy to draw here is sort of the analogy that we saw during the dotcom transition. What we're seeing is that, as I said in my prepared remarks, that digital is not just a technology issue, right. It is -- to really do digital well, you need to combine design talent with consulting talent, with technology talent, with consulting and strategy talent, and, of course, you need to bring the clients' perspective into all of this. And so you need, first of all, a very, very diverse set of skills and capabilities. And so when we think about -- when we look at competition, originally, we -- I would say, maybe a couple of years ago, we would see a lot of smaller boutique type of firms that focused more on the design elements and what I think of as the front end of digital. But I think it's now migrating because clients are looking to deploy digital at global scale and integrate with their legacy applications. And so the firms that we see competing most against are the large firms that have an integrated set of capabilities where they can bring all of those capabilities together. There's not that many firms in the world that can bring design, consulting, technology, industry knowledge, process expertise at global scale together. I would say there's a small handful of 2 or 3 firms, and those are the ones that we tend to compete with most often."

In Financial Services, the relatively more recent phenomenon of a little bit of uncertainty, a larger number of, what I would say, smaller projects getting pushed out because of the macroeconomic uncertainty. So I think that depending on volatility and what's going on in the industry, you could see 1 of 2 scenarios. You could see continued conservatism in spending for a quarter or 2 in Financial Services or you could see that come back relatively quickly because these are projects that, as I said a minute ago, I think are smaller discretionary projects that could be turned on relatively more quickly.

Fourth quarter revenue was $3.23 billion, up 1.4% over last quarter and 17.9% year-over-year. For the full year 2015, we delivered $12.42 billion of revenue, which represented growth of 21% over 2014. We're pleased with our performance in 2015 having raised our full year guidance 3x during the year. We expect to deliver revenue within a range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion for Q1 of 2016, reflecting some softness in our Banking and Financial Services and Healthcare segments as we start the year. For the full year, we expect to deliver revenue within a range of $13.65 billion to $14.2 billion. This represents full year growth of 10% to 14%, including an approximate 1 point negative currency impact.
You'll notice that we have changed the way we provide guidance. Going forward, we will provide a range for both revenue and EPS in our quarterly and full year projections. We believe this approach provides better visibility to our investors.
As we enter 2016, I'd now like to spend a few moments giving you some color on the market and demand environment and also the investments we continue to make to stay ahead of the market. As you know, there's now no doubt that we're in the midst of a disruptive technological shift that's pushing clients to look for innovative ways to adapt their traditional business models and products. It's clear that our market opportunities are substantial.
I'd like to share 4 observations from having been on the front lines of the digital transition for the past 5 years.
The first observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that from a technology standpoint, most clients cannot make an immediate clean-sheet-of-paper transition to a digital technology backbone. Clients will typically build a digital architecture on top of their legacy technology, and the integration between these 2 layers is a very critical part of the transformation. Our intimate knowledge of our clients' legacy combined with our leading-edge digital capabilities really give us an edge here.
The second observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that a new, broader set of capabilities is required to help clients navigate the digital transition. In the digital world, consulting must include both strategy consulting and design sensibilities. An end-to-end digital realization requires consulting, design, technology and industry knowledge. Our digital works model is deliberately built to combine strategy, design, technology and business consulting into one tightly integrated model.
The third observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that now, more than ever, knowledge of our clients' industries and processes is critically important. As our clients seek to digitize all aspects of their business, they are reinventing their business models and their processes. Our deep industry knowledge and process expertise enables us to partner with them as they work through the process of transforming their businesses into digital enterprises.
And the final observation from the front lines of the digital transition is that as digital goes mainstream, clients need a partner with global scale and heft to support them. As clients look to rapidly scale, they need the best talent at scale available across the globe. Our global footprint and team is a substantial asset in this regard.
With these 4 observations, I'd like to now update you on the key areas of investment focus we outlined last year: building digital capabilities, evolving our IT services, building platform solutions and further investing in consulting that continue to enhance our capabilities.
So first, we are building capabilities to enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. Our digital works approach is solid and showing results. Our focus now is to scale that capability quickly across the world.
Let me explain with an example. We recently signed a strategic multimillion dollar engagement with Etihad Airways, a United Arab Emirates flag carrier, to define a comprehensive digital transformation strategy. While Etihad Airways is renowned for a world-class experience in the air, they realize that customer experience starts long before the customer arrives at the airport and continues after they land. The Cognizant Digital Works team and other partners are helping Etihad to envision future customer experience possibilities, whether these interactions happen via the web, mobile apps or airport kiosks. As clients like Etihad navigate the challenges involved in becoming digital enterprises, we continue to build out our portfolio of offerings to help them navigate that shift.
Second, we are evolving our IT services capabilities to enable our clients to create next-generation technology infrastructures that are characterized by high levels of operational efficiency at the back end and enhanced by new digital capabilities on the front end. To achieve this goal, clients are being challenged to lower total cost of ownership of legacy environments, to reinvest these savings into enabling digital transformation or what we have often called the dual mandate. In creating solutions for next-generation IT, we are focused on both sides of the dual mandate. On one side, we are bringing in higher levels of automation, integrating our service lines and moving core processes to a managed services environment to improve operational effectiveness. On the other side, we're modernizing legacy systems to create the backbone to help our clients become digital enterprises. Our recent acquisition of KBACE Technologies, for example, will enhance our capabilities in next-generation IT. KBACE has 400 technology and consulting associates specializing in Oracle Cloud Applications. Cloud and SaaS migration is a key component of the solution to the dual mandate. This acquisition will expand our digital and cloud capabilities to help more clients deploy SaaS applications to lower costs and increase business agility.
Our third focus area of investment is building platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new levels of efficiency. We've created a number of sharply focused, vertical platform-based solutions that we offer to clients in a Business Process-as-a-Service or BPaaS model. These solutions enable clients to turn over entire processes or subprocesses to us to own and operate on an output or outcome-based commercial model. These solutions not only help our clients create variable cost structures but reduce their time to value by quickly getting clients to best-in-class benchmark levels of performance. And by embedding analytics in these platforms, we're able to bring critical insights and share best practices and industry knowledge across multiple customers. We have a head start here through our acquisition of TriZetto in 2014 as well as having developed a number of our own platforms in core areas, such as clinical trials in life sciences that have shown good traction. For example, several quarters back, we announced an engagement with TransCelerate to develop and build a cloud-based shared investigative platform for global life sciences companies to use in clinical trials. This platform provides a unified point of access on a single platform, linking all the critical personnel running clinical trials with major global pharmaceutical companies. This enables standardization, consistency and operational efficiency, resulting in lower cost and faster processing of clinical trials.
And our fourth investment area is driven by our recognition that we must continue to drive ever more strategic relationships with our clients. Cognizant's Consulting Group, or CBC, is a critical component of this effort. For over 10 years, we have built out our consulting practice and have integrated this practice into all parts of our business. We believe that a strong consulting practice is essential to helping clients envision and implement the many transitions facing their businesses.
In closing, 2015 was a very significant year for us. We strengthened our position as a leading transformational partner for our clients. I'm happy with our progress and proud of the accomplishments of our teams. I'm confident that we will remain the partner of choice for our clients as they transition to the digital economy.
With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later to take your questions. Gordon?"
386024,322379130,928733,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2016",2016-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Think you, Francisco. I'd like to add some comments on the overall demand environment and provide an update on client budgets before moving to our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter.Client budgets are complete",1611,"Think you, Francisco. I'd like to add some comments on the overall demand environment and provide an update on client budgets before moving to our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter.
Client budgets are complete, and the outcome is very much as we expected. As Frank mentioned, we're seeing a soft start to the year in Banking and Financial Services, primarily due to macroeconomic concerns, and in Healthcare, on the back of industry consolidation in the payer industry. More broadly, clients continue to face a dual mandate within their operations, and we expect many of the trends we saw driving demand within our portfolio of services in 2015 to continue over the course of 2016. With that in mind, let me now provide you with additional color on our results across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies.
Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 1.8% sequentially and 16.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong performance in insurance. We're seeing an increased interest in managed service deals with both banking and insurance clients, as clients continue to focus on cost optimization and look for ways to increase operational efficiencies. Within banking, we saw a continuation of spending on projects around regulatory and compliance and cybersecurity as well as a growing interest in rearchitecting infrastructure. As mentioned above, macroeconomic concerns are weighing on our banking practice as we go into the start of this year.
Before I move on to Healthcare, let me give you an example of the type of projects we're seeing in our Financial Services segment. For a leading property and casualty insurer, we undertook a multiphase project of consolidating and transforming their technology and business processes and shifted to a managed services model. The client's legacy environment and existing processes were creating platform instability and inconsistent service levels, resulting in poor agent and customer experience. By moving to a managed services model, combining applications, business processes and other services, we'll reduce operational risk and deliver cost savings through a variable cost structure, in addition to transforming our client's service operations.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 1.4% sequentially and 23.2% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strength in Life Sciences. Rising medical costs, consumerization of healthcare and a changing regulatory environment, among other things, are driving industry consolidation in the payer industry. We're seeing some slowdown in our Healthcare practice due to this consolidation, particularly in the early part of this year, as reflected in our Q1 guidance. That said, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the payer segment and are quite encouraged by the large deal pipeline in this area for 2016. As the Healthcare industry shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models, healthcare organizations are simultaneously looking for new ways to deliver consumer-centric care while driving operational efficiencies. We're helping many through this transition.
A great example of this work is the work we're doing for the Texas Children's Health Plan. They recently leveraged Cognizant services and the TriZetto Healthcare Process Automation Service to add a new line of business and improve its claims, edit [ph] processes, processing times, costs and claims backlog. By automating both technology and business processes, the solution reduced the clients' claim backlog by 65% in the first week of implementation.
Moving to our Life Sciences business. We had a strong quarter, as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for the pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Additionally, we saw a continued strong growth among our medical device clients. Within Life Sciences, we continue to see a trend towards multiservice deals leveraging cloud technologies and platforms as well as strength in advanced data analytics.
Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 0.7% sequentially and 14.3% year-over-year, driven by strength in manufacturing and logistics. As is typical, Q4 is a slow quarter for retail, given the lockdown of IT systems during the holiday season.
Additionally, there were a number of furloughs in the segment at year-end. We continue to see clients focus on modernizing their technology environments, particularly around supply chain and omnichannel commerce solutions. On the manufacturing side, in particular, we saw demand around product transformation as well. Our investments in digital capabilities for the Manufacturing segment were recently recognized in a report by ALM Intelligence, formerly Kennedy Research & Advisory. We were recognized for a robust and comprehensive IOT consulting portfolio as well as our expertise in sensors and devices and our ability to design wide-ranging IOT solutions by collaborating from early phase roadmap development through testing, prototyping and deployment of solutions at scale.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.3% sequentially and 15.3% year-over-year. Within the telecom and IME industries, we're seeing demand driven by the need to upgrade and change business support systems to better support digital solutions.
For example, one of our clients, a global satellite network and communications provider, has grown through both acquisitions and organic expansion of services -- of service offerings. In the process, they ended up with a complex legacy business support system structure comprised of multiple order and billing solutions. This complexity was hampering their ability to create bundled services and introduce new services. Cognizant was selected to design and implement an integrated business support system solution. This integrated solution will help our clients go to market with a new set of digital open solutions, showcase products from their partners more readily and lower overall cost of ownership.
Now let me turn to our Horizon 2 service lines, Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 services have reached critical mass and have significantly increased our addressable market. We're pleased with the continued above-average growth that each of our Horizon 2 service lines achieved in 2015. Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. The integration between clients' legacy technology foundation and new digital architecture is a key driver of demand for our Infrastructure Services. Increasingly, there's a strong emphasis on automation in IT operations, driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions. Cognizant Infrastructure Services plays a key role in helping clients incorporate a cloud-centric architecture as one part of a strong foundation.
As the lines between physical and digital assets continue to blur, it will affect the way people, business services, data, machines and devices interact with each other, leading to a significant redesign of business processes. Cognizant Business Process Services is at the forefront of this process redesign, infusing technology and automation in core business processes to help clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while enhancing business outcomes through data analytics.
As Frank mentioned earlier, Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. Our consulting practice is increasingly working with all parts of our business, as clients embark on enterprise-wide transformation.
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 0.9% sequentially and 18.7% year-over-year. Europe was up 2.3% sequentially, after a 1.7% negative currency impact and 9.6% from last year. The U.K. grew approximately 2% sequentially and 9.8% year-over-year, and Continental Europe grew 2.8% sequentially and 9.5% over prior year.
Finally, we saw a continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up by 6.8% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strengths in key markets, such as India, Singapore and the Middle East, where we are seeing good traction with clients' adoption of digital technologies.
For example, for the Aditya Birla Group, one of India's largest conglomerates, Cognizant serves as the e-commerce partner and helps implement their new fashion e-commerce platform to deliver a differentiated shopping experience for customers.
Finally, let me provide some color on our business operations. Coming into 2015, we were focused on retraining existing employees and hiring new associates to meet the changing demand environment. As a result, our utilization rate dropped. Throughout 2015, we leveraged that training and brought utilization back up to what we believe is [ph] a sustainable level. Our Q4 annualized attrition of 19% still remained above our desired range. We're committed to improving our retention levels and have put in place various employee engagement initiatives in 2015. This remains an area of focus for us as we go into 2016. We believe that developing a culture which embraces shared success and supports continuous skills improvement is critical to recruiting and retaining the best talent, driving our continued success and winning in the digital era. However, increased employee engagement must be combined with a continued focus on operational excellence. In 2015, we put in place a structure to improve our operating discipline, and we will continue to strengthen and raise the bar for operating excellence in 2016. The tremendous efforts of our employees over the course of 2015 to deliver both strong revenue performance as well as improved operational efficiencies enabled us to increase our 2015 bonus accruals to levels well above the prior year.
Additionally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees, business partners, government agencies and others involved in the Chennai recovery efforts that helped in quickly bringing our business operations back to normal following the unprecedented flooding in Chennai in the fourth quarter.
As we enter 2016, I believe that we're well positioned to capture the evolving opportunities. Although the year is off to a slow start, we believe our investments in expanded capabilities and markets, combined with operational excellence and an engaged and empowered workforce position us well to achieve our goals in 2016.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Karen to review our financial results."

Fourth quarter revenue of $3.23 billion met our guidance and represented growth of 1.4% sequentially and 17.9% year-over-year. We had a negative currency headwind, which impacted sequential revenue growth by $11 million or 36 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by 188 basis points or $52 million.
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.6%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 exceeded guidance by $0.03.
For the full year 2015, revenue of $12.42 billion represented growth of 21% year-over-year, including a negative currency impact of 258 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.7%, and non-GAAP EPS was $3.07.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 58.2% and 41.8% of revenue, respectfully (sic) [respectively] for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 1.5% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year. Outsourcing services increased 1.3% sequentially and grew 7.6% from Q4 a year ago.
During Q4, we saw a continuation of the trend we have seen in recent quarters whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards project-based work, including digital and other transformational programs. During the fourth quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 8 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 300.
During the quarter, we had 2,400 net employee additions, and we ended the quarter with approximately 221,700 employees globally. Approximately 207,600 of our employees were service delivery staff.
Utilization was essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 76%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 81%. And on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with just over $4.9 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $900 million from the quarter ending September 30, including $350 million in proceeds from our revolver. Our cash and short-term investments, net of debt, were up by approximately $1.5 billion from the year-ago period.
Total receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 70.3 days. This is down slightly from 70.6 days in Q3. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was $369 million, down from $421 million at the end of Q3. We billed approximately 58% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, which included $350 million outstanding balance on our revolver.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $690 million. Financing activities generated approximately $307 million, and capital expenditures were approximately $74 million during the quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 650,000 shares for a total cost of $42.1 million, and our fully diluted share count decreased to 612.6 million shares for the quarter. To date, we have repurchased approximately 41.2 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.6 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We have $438 million remaining unutilized.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $13.65 billion to $14.2 billion, which represents growth of 10% to 14%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year.
For the first quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion. During the first quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.78 to $0.80. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 612.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 612.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%.

Let me take a crack at that, and then Gordon can jump in if there's additional color. Look, I think in -- let me start with Healthcare. I think the situation in Healthcare -- we've talked to you about it in past calls, as you know, the payer industry is going through a period of some consolidation at the moment, and that is creating some pause with some of our larger payer clients, as they defer plans to -- technology plans until their merger plans are clearer. Because systems will have to be consolidated, some will have to be retired and so on and so forth, so there's a period of uncertainty. Having said that, in Healthcare, we feel very, very good about the pipeline of deals that we have for 2016 of large deals. Many of these deals are on the back of the TriZetto acquisition that we did a little over a year ago. And so in the net, I feel like Healthcare will have a slow start to the year, but with a very strong pipeline in the back half of the year kicking in. I think Financial Services is a little different. As you know, there have been, in the last couple of months, a lot of macroeconomic concerns around the world. I think as a result of that, Financial Services, particularly banking more than insurance -- but our banking clients are taking a cautious approach at this point putting some projects on hold, just I think adopting a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I think that will -- I don't have a good view as to when that resolves itself. I think we're going to watch that over the next quarter or 2 and see how it unfolds. And so we're not baking -- we're baking some growth in Financial Services into our view going forward, but I think our view in Financial Services right now is sort of more of a wait-and-see approach. Gordon, is there anything you want to add to that?"

Look, I think we've been more than pleased with the results of the TriZetto acquisition. As you said, it's been a little over a year. The hypothesis was that acquiring intellectual property in the form of a platform would allow us to combine that software with our traditional IT and BPO services and create solutions and bundles of solutions for clients that neither company would independently have been able to provide in the marketplace. I think that hypothesis is proving out to be exactly on point. A number of the large deals that we mentioned a minute ago that are in the Healthcare pipeline, as Gordon said, are combined, if you will, Cognizant with TriZetto capabilities together. And so we feel very good about the integration, how it's happened, both from an impact in the market standpoint but also from an internal Cognizant operational standpoint. We've retained the TriZetto leadership team. All of the TriZetto leaders are playing important roles within Cognizant, and we feel very good about both the operational and the market impact results of the TriZetto acquisition. As we look forward, I -- we've continued to say that our primary acquisition focus will be to look at small tuck-in acquisitions. We announced KBACE a few weeks ago. We'll continue to look for acquisitions of that nature in the areas that we've talked to you about in the past like digital, like geographic expansion, like deepening our industry domain expertise.

That's where we're making -- giving tremendous clarity on what are the different roles we have, what does it take to move into those different roles, so people can self-manage their careers, so we remain very much a meritocracy and the best and the brightest can move up faster at Cognizant than their alternatives.

I think the best analogy to draw here is sort of the analogy that we saw during the dotcom transition. What we're seeing is that, as I said in my prepared remarks, that digital is not just a technology issue, right. It is -- to really do digital well, you need to combine design talent with consulting talent, with technology talent, with consulting and strategy talent, and, of course, you need to bring the clients' perspective into all of this. And so you need, first of all, a very, very diverse set of skills and capabilities. And so when we think about -- when we look at competition, originally, we -- I would say, maybe a couple of years ago, we would see a lot of smaller boutique type of firms that focused more on the design elements and what I think of as the front end of digital. But I think it's now migrating because clients are looking to deploy digital at global scale and integrate with their legacy applications. And so the firms that we see competing most against are the large firms that have an integrated set of capabilities where they can bring all of those capabilities together. There's not that many firms in the world that can bring design, consulting, technology, industry knowledge, process expertise at global scale together. I would say there's a small handful of 2 or 3 firms, and those are the ones that we tend to compete with most often."

Our Q1 revenue was $3.2 billion, down 0.9% from Q4 and within our guidance -- guided range of $3.18 to $3.24 billion. Revenue was up 10% from a year ago. 
The quarter developed exactly as we outlined when we provided guidance back in February. As we expected, we saw some softness in our Financial Services and Healthcare segments, resulting in a slow start to the year. Macroeconomic concerns and market volatility weighed on the banking industry at the start of this year, resulting in some moderation in discretionary spending. We anticipate a return to positive sequential growth in our Financial Services practice for the balance of this year. 
Industry consolidation within the healthcare payer space was a key factor in the softness of our Healthcare practice during Q1. Going forward this year, we also expect a return to positive sequential growth in our Healthcare segment as the pressure from industry consolidation is expected to be partially offset by anticipated project ramp-ups and a strong pipeline, including the recent signing of a significant multiyear deal with Emblem Health, one of New York's leading health insurance and wellness companies.
Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance within the range of $3.32 to $3.44 and tightening our full year revenue growth guidance to a range of approximately 10% to 13%. What's important to note is our Q2 revenue guidance, reflecting a strong rebound in sequential growth, is a range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion. This represents incremental revenue within a range of $140 million to $200 million and would make Q2 a strong sequential growth quarter, putting us on a solid trajectory for the rest of the year. We expect broad-based momentum across service lines, geographies and industries in Q2. 
In support of our confidence in the business and the strength of our pipeline, we stepped up hiring, adding approximately 11,300 net hires this past quarter. Karen will provide you with full details of our expected financial performance shortly.
Moving on, let me provide some color on the key factors influencing client spending in the current environment. As we've seen over the last several quarters, digital transformation continues to be a strong driver of demand as clients look for new solutions that allow them to defend their businesses against digital disruptors while innovating to create new areas of growth. We are in a strong position to capture the opportunity that are emerging from this transition. We believe that for true enterprise-wide digital transformation, clients need an interdisciplinary framework, which brings together strategy, technology, design, data science and industry knowledge. Cognizant Digital Works has been developed to provide this integrated approach to driving transformation.
This quarter, we've added another dimension to our digital works approach by acquiring a 49% stake in Red Associates, a human science consultancy that focuses in consumer experience and behavior and how these factors impact corporate strategy, products and services and go-to market approaches. Together, Red and Cognizant will provide a unique and compelling approach for businesses in helping them reframe their challenges for the digital era. Gordon will talk more about Red later in his comments.
True digital transformation requires businesses to make fundamental changes in customer experience, operations and business models that extends throughout the organization, from the front office to the middle office and right through the back office systems. At the front end, where enterprises engage with a myriad of stakeholders, from customers to employees and business partners, our clients are looking to build capabilities that create personalized experiences across multiple devices that are well integrated with their business and technology architectures and can be deployed rapidly at scale. 
In the middle office, clients are looking for operational agility and efficiency by combining people, processes and technology through platforms that have delivered as outcome-based models. These shared utility models, sometimes called Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, can be enhanced with automation and analytics to bring additional value to clients' operations. 
And in the back office, clients must modernize core IT systems and implement complex engineering development methods to create the technology backbone that will be able to support the agility, scale and performance needs of a digital enterprise. 
It's through this lens that we have identified investments in 3 key strategic areas to take clients through this transformation journey. Let me now talk more about each of these initiatives in detail. 
The first [indiscernible] initiative is building the digital capability to work with our clients on their front-end systems. I spoke a few minutes ago about our digital works approach, which seamlessly integrates 5 essential elements: strategy, technology, data science, experience design and industry expertise to develop and deliver digital solutions rapidly. We are finding great traction for this framework across the industries that we serve. For example, we are helping a leading life sciences company to improve diabetic care by implementing an Internet of Things, or IoT, infrastructure that enables remote upgrades to home-based glucose meters and insulin pumps. Doing so will improve customer satisfaction and adherence to testing regimes. This comes after we've already successfully developed on IoT monitoring framework for the same company to better maintain its thousands of surgical devices remotely. 
The second strategic initiative is to help clients achieve new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in their core transaction processing operations by building platform-based solutions and industry utilities. These solutions are offered to clients in a Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, model that allows clients to shift from buying service to buying an outcome. By applying a series of levers, including process optimization, digitization and large scale efficiencies, we are able to bring clients levels of effectiveness which they would have been unable to reach on their own.
The third strategic initiative is to transform clients' existing IT systems and infrastructure to next-generation IT. Clients cannot harness the potential from digital technologies without integrating ways and upgrading their legacy systems and infrastructure. This requires a transformation of their IT backbone, including a simplification of how applications are developed and delivered, along with the standardization of the IT infrastructure to ensure simplicity and flexibility at an appropriate cost. For instance, under our agreement with the healthcare client I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, over the next several years, Cognizant will help retire, upgrade and modernize their legacy infrastructure, software and development processes. We will replace legacy infrastructure with cloud-based virtual infrastructure, upgrade all software capabilities with Cognizant's TriZetto Facets software and implement agile methodologies to ensure and expedite the timely development and rollout of new products. 
With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later to take your questions. Gordon?"

Heading into the rest of the year, we have good momentum across the business, as indicated by our Q2 guidance, which anticipates very healthy sequential revenue growth.

Heading into the rest of the year, we have good momentum across the business, as indicated by our Q2 guidance, which anticipates very healthy sequential revenue growth. With that in mind, let me provide you with some additional color on our performance across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies. 
Our Banking and Financial Services segment was down 1.7% sequentially and up 10.7% year-over-year. As we discussed on our first quarter call, macroeconomic concerns weighed on our banking practice at the start of the year. While we've seen stabilization in the markets and expect improved performance within our banking practice over the course of the year, several of our banking clients continue to take a cautious approach. Looking past these short-term challenges, it is increasingly clear that the [indiscernible] revolution is driving our banking clients to invest in significant changes to their business model to meaningfully pivot towards becoming digital enterprises. 
Moving on to our insurance practice, we continue to see strong demand for solutions which help transform the claims and underwriting processes, deliver greater efficiencies, increasingly through Managed Services or other outcome-based arrangements. In addition, there's an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service, often through harnessing data and analytics to drive real-time decisions. 
Let me give you an example. We are working with Guardian Life Insurance company to implement a next-generation IT solution for modernizing its Big Data infrastructure with Cognizant's big frame, a platform solution that leverages Cognizant's extensive Big Data and mainframe expertise. Using the big frame solution, Guardian will fast-track its modernization program while minimizing risk and operational impact. The new platform-based environment integrates data from multiple sources, providing comprehensive data as a service to internal teams for self-service analysis, improve decision-making and faster product development. 
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients declined 4% sequentially and grew 4% year-over-year. The seasonal impact of TriZetto software business contributed to roughly half of this sequential decline as the large portion of software sales occur in the fourth quarter. As we've discussed for several quarters, the industry consolidation among several of the nation's largest payers is weighing on our healthcare practice in 2016. However, the payer sector continues to undergo fundamental changes. Over the medium- and longer-term, we believe these changes will create opportunities that we are well-positioned to capture, particularly through the combined Cognizant and TriZetto offerings.
As you recall, we've said that by acquiring TriZetto, we are acquiring IT in the form of software, which, when combined with our traditional IT and Business Process Services, would allow us to create revenue synergies that neither company alone would have been able to achieve. These synergies include increased systems integration, hosting and business process opportunities around the TriZetto software and, most importantly, end-to-end platform-based solutions. The integration of TriZetto and market acceptance of our combined capabilities has exceeded even our own expectations. As a result, we continue to feel good about the acquisition and our ability to create shareholder value through strong synergy revenues.
In addition to end-to-end BPaaS solutions in healthcare, we're also winning in digital. For example, Cognizant's been engaged by a division of a major healthcare player as their strategic partner in their digital business transformation. This client is experiencing rapid growth and has process systems and technology that cannot keep pace with their growth and strategic vision. We are helping them to reimagine their customer experience, replatform their operational backbone and redesign their operating model, ultimately resulting in an increased customer retention and operational effectiveness, improved customer insights and experience and lower cost of operations.
Moving to our Life Sciences business, where the pipeline for deals is strong despite a muted start to 2016, we continue to see demand for multiservice deals combining applications and infrastructure in our midsized pharma clients, while our large pharma clients are increasingly interested in managed services arrangements to help reduce operational risk and deliver cost savings.
Our retail manufacturing segment was up 3.6% sequentially and 15.2% year-over-year, driven by strength in retail, manufacturing and logistics. One of the keys to the strength in our manufacturing logistics practice in recent quarters has been our growing relationship with the engineering teams within our clients, leveraging our digital and IoT expertise to help them smart enable products, to improve instrumentation across their product portfolios. 
For example, for a global manufacturer of industrial machinery, we're helping the client who's faced a period of declining sales digitally enable existing equipment and create new digital products as a way to monetize data, improve the utilization of their equipment as well as reduce inventory in the supply chain. 
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 2% sequentially and 14.7% year-over-year, driven by our technology practice. With high-tech clients, we are seeing good opportunity around platform engineering for cloud services. Working with our high-tech clients enables us to do leading-edge technology work, which is often applicable to other industries.
For example, we're implementing this platform development for a client who's a leading provider of cloud computing services. Cognizant is creating a fully automated platform, which will target the midmarket enterprise space to provide real-time and elastic capacity for their customers' network and storage needs and to price this capacity accordingly. As a result, the client was able to significantly reduce cloud services provisioning time and launch new variable pricing models, matching changes in market demand. This kind of experience is increasingly relevant to our corporate clients, who are thinking about rearchitecting their infrastructure by deploying cloud solutions. 
Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 services, Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 services, which are approaching a $3 billion annual revenue run rate, have reached critical scale and have significantly increased our addressable market. They are central to both the work we are doing around digital transformation and platform-based solutions. The success and tremendous growth we've seen from these service lines over the past years demonstrates the power of the Three Horizon model as a way to manage growth and investment in the company. 
Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a key competitive differentiator for us, and it's underlying much of the work we're doing across our strategic initiatives. As clients undergo enterprisewide transformation, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as technology, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, program and change management and process redesign.
Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, there's a strong focus on automation and IT operations, driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions. 
For example, in manufacture and medical devices, we saw an opportunity to improve performance and uptime needed to standardize and improve its global IT operations. We developed a scalable and reliable IT infrastructure and offered an end-to-end solution to manage all the client's hardware and applications, improving speed, predictability and customer satisfaction. 
Cognizant Business Process Services saw a very strong growth during the quarter, led by work with our high-tech and insurance clients. Infusing technology and automation in core business processes is critical to helping clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while also enhancing business outcomes through data analytics. 
Cognizant recently commenced a multiyear agreement with Storebrand, one of the largest Financial Services firms in the Nordics to transform their operations. Cognizant will combine business process with consulting and infrastructure services to enable Storebrand to reengineer business processes across the customer lifecycle, automate and modernize existing IT systems and infrastructure and develop digital platforms with advanced analytic capabilities. As part of the contract, Cognizant will help Storebrand to move to a BPaaS model and deliver seamless omnichannel experience.
From a geographic standpoint, North America declined 1.4% sequentially. Adjusting for the seasonality of the TriZetto business, North America was broadly flat with Q4. Europe was up 9/10 of 1% sequentially after a 2.5% negative currency impact. The U.K. declined approximately 2.3% sequentially after a 4.5% negative currency impact. And Continental Europe grew 5.4% sequentially after a slight positive currency impact. 
Finally, the rest of the world was up 30 basis points sequentially and almost 25% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as India, Australia and the Middle East, where we are seeing good traction with clients's adoption of digital technologies.
Before I turn the call over to Karen, I'd like to discuss our recently announced 49% investment in an exclusive partnership with Red Associates. How a customer interacts with his or her world, whether it's taking medications, driving a car, shopping or going for a job has largely been the same for decades. Yet with the digital revolution and emerging of the physical and the virtual, these basic activities are now being rethought. This has become the new competitive battleground for many of our clients, revitalizing their products and services with digital technology. 
Red is a unique, highly specialized consultancy whose expertise in the human sciences is helping businesses to address these issues. Red specialists in sociology, anthropology, philosophy and political science work with market-leading blue chip clients such as Adidas, Ford and Novo Nordisk to create compelling experiences for their customers. The customers who now expect their workout equipment, car, shopping experience and healthcare to be every bit as personalized, engaging and insightful as their iPhone. Our minority ownership model allows us to work together exclusively while helping us preserve the unique culture and processes that have lead to long-term success of Red Associates. This partnership will enable Cognizant and Red to create an entirely new model for making sense of human behavior, connecting those insights to strategy, applying design thinking to creating engaging digital experiences, and then applying technology to achieve global enterprise scale. These critical elements add to the front office capabilities, which we described earlier, and enable us to address these challenges in a unique way. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen, who will review our financial results."

First quarter revenue of $3.2 billion met our guidance and represented a sequential decline of 0.9% sequentially and an increase of 10% year-over-year. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $15 million or approximately 50 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $34 million or 120 basis points. 
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.9%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 was at the high end of our guidance range of $0.78 to $0.80. 
Consulting and technology services and Outsourcing Services represented 57.8% and 42.4% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services declined 1.6% sequentially, reflecting the cautiousness of certain clients, primarily in banking and healthcare, to spend on project-based work as well as the seasonality of TriZetto software license revenue. Revenue from consulting and technology services grew 12.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing Services revenue was flat sequentially and grew 6.2% from Q1 a year ago. 
During the first quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts and, as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 8 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 308. 
As Frank mentioned earlier, we ramped up hiring during the quarter with approximately 11,300 net new hires, reflecting our near-term growth expectations and strength of our pipeline. Annualized attrition of 14.6% during the quarter, including BPO and in trainees, was down by almost 450 basis points from last quarter and up slightly from the year-ago period. 
Throughout 2015, we put in place various employment engagement initiatives to improve our retention levels and are pleased with the progress we've made to date. We will continue to enhance these initiatives over the course of 2016. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 233,000 in place globally, of which approximately 218,000 were service delivery staff. 
As a result of our strong hiring in the first quarter, utilization was down slightly compared to the fourth quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 75%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 80%. And on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $500 million from the quarter ending December 31. Borrowings under our revolver decreased during the quarter by $250 million, ending at $100 million. Our cash and short-term investments net of debt were up by approximately $1.2 billion from the year-ago period. Total receivables were $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 74 days. This is up from 73 days in Q1 of 2015. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was $432 million, up from $369 million at the end of Q4. We billed approximately 53% of the Q4 unbilled balance in April. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. 
Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1 billion at the end of the quarter, which included $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $68.8 million. Financing activities were approximately a $467.8 million use of cash during the quarter. And capital expenditures were approximately $63.7 million during the quarter. 
During the first quarter, we accelerated our share repurchase activity, repurchasing 4.3 million shares for a total cost of $244.6 million. And our diluted share count decreased to 611.8 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q1, we had repurchased approximately 45.5 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.8 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We had $193 million remaining unutilized. 
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we have tightened our revenue expectations to be in the range of $13.65 to $14 billion, which represents growth of approximately 10% to 13%, including an approximate 1% negative currency impact. The tightened range is primarily a result of our slower than usual performance in Q1. As Frank mentioned, we expect broad-based momentum across service lines, geographies and industries as we move into Q2 and the rest of the year and expect the ramp-up of several deals, including the healthcare deal mentioned earlier. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rate at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. 
For the second quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion. During the second quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the second quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.81 to $0.83. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 610 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44 for the full year. This guidance anticipates the full year share count of approximately 611 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%.

Let's talk about both confidence for Q2 and the back half of the year because they tie together. We have very good momentum going into Q2. Your guidance is for $140 million to $200 million of sequential growth. We expect to return to positive growth -- positive sequential growth both in Healthcare and Financial Services. So sort of the headwinds that we had in Q1 on a sequential basis have subsided because it's in our run rate. When you think about the back half of the year, there are a couple of wildcards, and obviously, that's why there's a guidance range. One is what happens with additional BPaaS deals and the timing on those? What happens with the timing of some of the big M&A in Healthcare? And we've -- for the full year, we continue to be cautious in Financial Services. But even with that, given the pipeline both of new projects from existing customers and very healthy new logo wins in Q1, we feel good both about the sequential growth going into Q2 and that we continue to have healthy momentum in the back half of the year."

I would say that, overall, the world is becoming more technology-intensive, not less technology-intensive. And that technology needs to be deployed, it needs to be integrated, it needs to be configured, it needs to be maintained and upgraded and so on and so forth. And none of that activity goes away. So at the very macro level, I see very strong growth opportunities for us, across all 3 horizons, frankly, because I don't see Horizon 1 declining. I think that as new technology gets deployed, you need to upgrade it, you need to maintain it, you need to take care of it and so on and so forth. And so Horizon 1 services would continue to, I think, have healthy growth going forward. So net-net, when I look at the portfolio across all 3 Horizons, in the long run, I think that there's plenty of market opportunity. And I'll remind you, I don't need to remind you, but I'll just say that, it's a very fragmented market. We have 1% to 2% market share, so there's plenty of opportunity for us to go capture additional share in the market. And to the second part of your question, I continue to expect that we will have an active M&A strategy as we have historically looking at tuck-in acquisitions in the areas that we've always said, geographic expansion, new technologies, new and deepening our industry expertise and also now software and IP, I think, will factor into that. But I think our baseline is to do small tuck-ins and then from time-to-time, if great opportunities like TriZetto present themselves that are bigger, we'll obviously look at those. TriZetto has been I think as Gordon said in his comments, exceeded our expectations, I think, in what we've been able to achieve in a year and a half. And so we'll continue to look favorably at opportunities like that, but also look at them very carefully to make sure that they meet all of the criteria for us."

That's part of the return to positive sequential growth in Financial Services in the coming quarters. And then, I think, that in terms of color around what kind of discretionary work gets pushed or had been pushed in Q1, I would say it's across the board. Anything that's sort of project-oriented or discretionary. So things that project work, new application development, some of the digital projects got pushed a little bit. Again, I don't know that this was a major push or a big delay. I think this was sort of some slowdown in budget getting finalized in Q1 and then that translating into a relatively slow kickoff of new projects in some of the banks during the first quarter, which now I think we see starting to alleviate itself."

Clearly, the majority of our activity in pipeline right now is in healthcare around the TriZetto platform. But we have BPaaS both opportunities in the pipeline and also client engagements that are in other industries, in other sectors. In many cases, those are platforms that we've developed ourselves. In some cases, these are platforms that we have acquired, smaller platforms that we've acquired in the past. And in some cases, these are offerings that we've constructed on top of third-party products, so software platforms, either commercial, ISD [ph] platforms or sometimes we are having conversations about taking a client's asset and essentially wrapping a BPaaS service around that and taking it to market. So there are a number of opportunities and a number of irons we have in that fire and a lot of, I think, positive momentum there. I would say in terms of the economics, the economics on the initial BPaaS deals tend to be roughly in line with maybe a little lower than traditional deal. But then the second, third, fourth time you do it because you've established the factory and the utility, the margins start to get very, very promising because you're essentially amortizing the fixed cost over a larger volume."

And so, really, digital really is very much of the core operating fabric of all our service offerings, all of our service lines. I think we continue to feel very good about the broad-based capability that we've built in digital. We were out ahead, I think, of many on the digital opportunity with social, mobile, analytics and cloud from a technology standpoint. I think we are in for Cognizant in the third- or fourth-generation of our thinking around digital with our digital works, approach and methodology where we've gone well beyond technology to include design and data science in addition to strategy and technology and industry knowledge to combine those together, which is what you really need when you're deploying digital on behalf of clients. We spoke a little bit about our investment in ReD Associates this quarter, which is another dimension to the digital works approach. We feel very good about what the possibilities are in combining ReD, which brings a human approach, digital look from the social sciences standpoint. And so that's just another dimension to digital. So overall, I feel like we really have one of the leading digital capabilities out there. We have -- we are doing very deep impactful work with clients, like the life sciences client that I spoke about in my prepared comments. So I feel good about the capability. It's hard to say what to quantify exactly what portion of this is discretionary in the sense of in the event of an economic slowdown. But I would say that contextually, the work that we're doing is largely very fundamental to the future of our clients' businesses and their strategy. Today, there is no strategy for a business without some digital component. And so the work that we're doing tends to be very much in the heart of the future of these businesses. And so I would imagine that there'd be some stickiness to that in the event of economic slowdown. Hard to quantify, though."

Let me say, first of all that, clearly, large enterprises are looking at the cloud in multiple different ways. I would say that most of the large enterprises and that we deal with are very much focused on hybrid cloud and looking at very carefully thinking about what workloads belong in the cloud and what workloads belong on-prem and how those balance off against each other. I would say that the wild and nature of workloads in the cloud requires a different maintenance profile. A workload in the cloud needs to be maintained and upgraded and monitored and modernized and all of those kinds of things, just like a workload on premise. There's much of the care and feeding of a workload in the cloud that still needs to be taken care of. And so I don't think it's a fair assumption to just assume that when a workload moves into the cloud, it exists in the cloud without any support or care and feeding around it. So the implication that perhaps a workload moving to the cloud completely cannibalizes revenue is not entirely I think accurate, at least based on the technology that's available today and what we see. I think more importantly though, so that's one dimension of the answer. The other dimension of the answer I would say is look over the time horizons that you talked about, 10, 15 years, the amount of data and the number of devices that are going to exist in the ecosystem is going to explode. It's going to increase absolutely exponentially. And so all of that complexity is going to require, in my opinion, far more management, far more maintenance, far more deployment help. There's all of these other services that will be required to manage that degree of complexity as data and devices explode. And so I think when you look over the time horizons that you're looking at, I'll come back to the answer I gave to one of the earlier questions, which is the world is going to become more technology-intensive, not less technology-intensive. It's going to become more data-intensive, not less data-intensive. And it's going to become more device-intensive, and these devices are going to be much more heterogeneous than they are today. All of that complexity is going to require a lot of services to manage and maintain, and I think we are very well-positioned as that transition occurs."

So I would say that if you think about our Financial Services portfolio, the bulk of our Financial Services portfolio is clients are that we worked with over many, many, many years. And if you look historically at our performance in Financial Services, I think you'll see that our Financial Services performance and portfolio has delivered very consistent results and solid growth year-over-year sequentially over many, many quarters. The reason for that is that I think we've got great relationships with these clients. We tend to be very embedded with these clients as they plan their annual operating budgets and their annual operating plans, their project portfolios and so on and so forth. And they work very closely with us as they're planning that to make sure that we have the capacity and the talent available to meet their demands. So we tend to have very good visibility with these clients. We knew of slowdown in Q1. We told you about the slowdown in Financial Services when we gave you our first look into the first quarter, and that was as a result of the fact that we had been given that heads-up in working with a lot of these clients. And as we have gone through the first quarter, we continue that process with them, we now feel comfortable that we've got visibility that we will return Financial Services to positive sequential growth for the rest of this year.

We've rolled out our career architecture, so people can understand what does it take to move up in the organization so they can self-manage their careers. We've improved rotational experiences. We've invested -- doubled down again in investment in training for our people. So I think what's happened is as people as employees have experienced what we've talked about and as we focused on it again, we've seen improvement.

The second thing is for the grants that we've issued in early 2016, we're moving to a 2-year measurement period instead of 1 year measurement period. So what this does it further differentiates the measurements on the annual bonus from the measurements for the PSUs. And obviously, the PSUs then is a fairly longtail afterwards before they actually.

So I would say, I'll remind you that our primary access in going to market has been for the better part of a decade maybe longer the industry vertical. So we take everything to market through an industry vertical lens. We view that as being an incredibly important and significant part of our differentiation to have deep domain expertise around the industries that we serve and taking all of our services into a client through the industry lens. Behind the industry groups, we have essentially what you might think of as lines of service. The lines of service are -- fall into different categories. These are the traditional services, the Horizon 2 services or rather, the BPO, IT Infrastructure Services and consulting and also the new digital services. And all of these services go to market through the verticals. The Three Horizon model is how we manage investments across the business. So both across verticals and the horizontals, if you go the lines of service, we apply the Three Horizon model to say how we allocate capital, how do we make investments across both the verticals and the horizontals. And actually, there's a third dimensions which are the geographies in which we operate. So the Three Horizon model is a very clear and crisp way for us to say across the 3 legs of our metrics, the verticals, the lines of service and the geographies in which we operate, how do we allocate capital to the places where we're going to get the best returns, where growth potential is the best. And so Three Horizon for us is less of an internal organizational construct. We don't have a Horizon 1 or Horizon 2 and a Horizon 3 organization. What we have is an investment model that are follows the Three Horizon, and layers on top of the 3 vectors of that I just talked about, which are the 3 legs of the matrix or the real organizational vectors, the verticals, the geographies and the lines of service.
So I hope that clarifies it a little bit. And I think that's our last question. So with that, let me thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you."

Our Q1 revenue was $3.2 billion, down 0.9% from Q4 and within our guided range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion. Revenue was up 10% from a year ago. 
The quarter developed exactly as we outlined when we provided guidance back in February. As we expected, we saw some softness in our Financial Services and Healthcare segments, resulting in a slow start to the year. Macroeconomic concerns and market volatility weighed on the banking industry at the start of this year, resulting in some moderation in discretionary spending. We anticipate a return to positive sequential growth in our Financial Services practice for the balance of this year. 
Industry consolidation within the health care payer space was a key factor in the softness of our Healthcare practice during Q1. Going forward this year, we also expect a return to positive sequential growth in our Healthcare segment as the pressure from industry consolidation is expected to be partially offset by anticipated project ramp-ups and a strong pipeline, including the recent signing of a significant multiyear deal with EmblemHealth, one of New York's leading health insurance and wellness companies.
Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance within the range of $3.32 to $3.44 and tightening our full year revenue growth guidance to a range of approximately 10% to 13%. What's important to note is our Q2 revenue guidance, reflecting a strong rebound in sequential growth, is a range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion. This represents incremental revenue within a range of $140 million to $200 million and would make Q2 a strong sequential growth quarter, putting us on a solid trajectory for the rest of the year. We expect broad-based momentum across service lines, geographies and industries in Q2. In support of our confidence in the business and the strength of our pipeline, we've stepped up hiring, adding approximately 11,300 net hires this past quarter. Karen will provide you with full details of our expected financial performance shortly.
Moving on, let me provide some color on the key factors influencing client spending in the current environment. As we've seen over the last several quarters, digital transformation continues to be a strong driver of demand as clients look for new solutions that allow them to defend their businesses against digital disruptors while innovating to create new areas of growth. We are in a strong position to capture the opportunities that are emerging from this transition. And we believe that for true enterprise-wide digital transformation, clients need an interdisciplinary framework, which brings together strategy, technology, design, data science and industry knowledge. Cognizant Digital Works has been developed to provide this integrated approach to driving transformation.
This quarter, we've added another dimension to our Digital Works approach by acquiring a 49% stake in ReD Associates, a human science consultancy that focuses in consumer experience and behavior and how these factors impact corporate strategies, products and services and go-to market approaches. Together, ReD and Cognizant will provide a unique and compelling approach for businesses in helping them reframe their challenges for the digital era. Gordon will talk more about ReD later in his comments.
True digital transformation requires businesses to make fundamental changes in customer experience, operations and business models that extend throughout the organization, from the front office to the middle office and right through to the back-office systems. At the front end, where enterprises engage with a myriad of stakeholders, from customers to employees and business partners, our clients are looking to build capabilities that create personalized experiences across multiple devices that are well integrated with their business and technology architectures and can be deployed rapidly at scale. 
In the middle office, clients are looking for operational agility and efficiency by combining people, processes and technology through platforms that are delivered as outcome-based models. These shared utility models, sometimes called Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, can be enhanced with automation and analytics to bring additional value to clients' operations. And in the back office, clients must modernize core IT systems and implement complex engineering development methods to create the technology backbone that's able to support the agility, scale and performance needs of a digital enterprise.  
It's through this lens that we've identified investments in 3 key strategic areas to take clients through this transformation journey. Let me now talk more about each of these initiatives in detail. The first strategic initiative is building the digital capabilities to work with our clients on their front-end systems. I spoke a few minutes ago about our Digital Works approach, which seamlessly integrates 5 essential elements: strategy, technology, data science, experienced design and industry expertise to develop and deliver digital solutions rapidly. We're finding great traction for this framework across the industries that we serve. For example, we're helping a leading life sciences company to improve diabetic care by implementing an Internet of Things, or IoT, infrastructure that enables remote upgrades to home-based glucose meters and insulin pumps. Doing so will improve customer satisfaction and adherence to testing regimes. This comes after we've already successfully developed on IoT monitoring framework for the same company to better maintain its thousands of surgical devices remotely. 
The second strategic initiative is to help clients achieve new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in their core transaction processing operations by building platform-based solutions and industry utilities. These solutions are offered to clients in a Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, model that allows clients to shift from buying service to buying an outcome. By applying a series of levers, including process optimization, digitization and large-scale efficiencies, we're able to bring clients' levels of effectiveness which they would have been unable to reach on their own.
The third strategic initiative is to transform clients' existing IT systems and infrastructure to next-generation IT. Clients cannot harness the potential from digital technologies without integrating ways and upgrading their legacy systems and infrastructure. This requires a transformation of their IT backbone, including a simplification of how applications are developed and delivered, along with the standardization of the IT infrastructure to ensure simplicity and flexibility at an appropriate cost. For instance, under our agreement with the health care client I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, over the next several years, Cognizant will help retire, upgrade and modernize their legacy infrastructure, software and development processes. We will replace legacy infrastructure with cloud-based virtual infrastructure, upgrade all software capabilities with Cognizant's TriZetto Facets software and implement Agile methodologies to ensure and expedite the timely development and rollout of new products. 
With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance, and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later to take your questions. Gordon?"

Heading into the rest of the year, we have good momentum across the business, as indicated by our Q2 guidance, which anticipates very healthy sequential revenue growth. With that in mind, let me provide you with some additional color",1689,"Thank you, Francisco. Heading into the rest of the year, we have good momentum across the business, as indicated by our Q2 guidance, which anticipates very healthy sequential revenue growth. With that in mind, let me provide you with some additional color on our performance across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies. 
Our banking and Financial Services segment was down 1.7% sequentially and up 10.7% year-over-year. As we discussed on our first quarter call, macroeconomic concerns weighed on our banking practice at the start of the year. While we've seen stabilization in the markets and expect improved performance within our banking practice over the course of the year, several of our banking clients continue to take a cautious approach. Looking past these short-term challenges, it is increasingly clear that the fintech revolution is driving our banking clients to invest in significant changes to their business model to meaningfully pivot towards becoming digital enterprises. 
Moving on to our insurance practice. We continue to see strong demand for solutions which help transform the claims and underwriting processes deliver greater efficiencies increasingly through managed services or other outcome-based arrangements. In addition, there's an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service, often through harnessing data and analytics to drive real-time decisions. 
Let me give you an example. We're working with The Guardian Life Insurance Company to implement a next-generation IT solution for modernizing its big data infrastructure with Cognizant's BIGFrame, a platform solution that leverages Cognizant's extensive big data and mainframe expertise. Using the BIGFrame solution, Guardian will fast-track its modernization program while minimizing risk and operational impact. The new platform-based environment integrates data from multiple sources, providing comprehensive data as a service to internal teams for self-service analysis, improved decision-making and faster product development. 
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, declined 4% sequentially and grew 4% year-over-year. The seasonal impact of the TriZetto software business contributed to roughly half of this sequential decline as a large portion of software sales occur in the fourth quarter. As we've discussed for several quarters, the industry consolidation among several of the nation's largest payers is weighing on our Healthcare practice in 2016. However, the payer sector continues to undergo fundamental changes. Over the medium and longer term, we believe these changes will create opportunities that we are well positioned to capture, particularly through the combined Cognizant and TriZetto offerings.
As you recall, we have said that by acquiring TriZetto, we are acquiring IP in the form of software, which when combined with our traditional IT and business process services, would allow us to create revenue synergies that neither company alone would have been able to achieve. These synergies include increased systems integration, hosting and business process opportunities around the TriZetto software and most importantly, end-to-end platform-based solutions. The integration of TriZetto and market acceptance of our combined capabilities has exceeded even our own expectations. As a result, we continue to feel good about the acquisition and our ability to create shareholder value through strong synergy revenues.
In addition to end-to-end BPaaS solutions in health care, we're also winning in digital. For example, Cognizant has been engaged by a division of a major health care player as their strategic partner in their digital business transformation. This client is experiencing rapid growth and has process systems and technologies that cannot keep pace with their growth and strategic vision. We're helping them to reimagine their customer experience, replatform their operational backbone and redesign their operating model, ultimately resulting in an increased customer retention and operational effectiveness, improved customer insights and experience and lower cost of operations.
Moving to our Life Sciences business, where the pipeline for deals is strong despite a muted start to 2016. We continue to see demand for multiservice deals combining applications and infrastructure in our mid-sized pharma clients while our large pharma clients are increasingly interested in managed services arrangements to help reduce operational risk and deliver cost savings.
Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 3.6% sequentially and 15.2% year-over-year, driven by strength in retail, manufacturing and logistics. One of the keys to the strength in our manufacturing and logistics practice in recent quarters has been our growing relationship with the engineering teams within our clients, leveraging our digital and IoT expertise to help them smart-enable products, to improve instrumentation across their product portfolios. For example, for a global manufacturer of industrial machinery, we're helping the client, who has faced a period of declining sales, digitally enable existing equipment and create new digital products as a way to monetize data, improve the utilization of their equipment as well as reduce inventory in the supply chain. 
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 2% sequentially and 14.7% year-over-year, driven by our technology practice. With high-tech clients, we are seeing good opportunity around platform engineering for cloud services. Working with our high-tech clients enables us to do leading-edge technology work, which is often applicable to other industries. For example, we're implementing this platform development for a client who is a leading provider of cloud computing services. Cognizant is creating a fully automated platform, which will target the mid-market enterprise space to provide real-time and elastic capacity for their customers' network and storage needs and to price this capacity accordingly. As a result, the client was able to significantly reduce cloud services' provisioning time and launch new variable pricing models, matching changes in market demand. This kind of experience is increasingly relevant to our corporate clients, who are thinking about rearchitecting their infrastructure by deploying cloud solutions. 
Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 services: Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 services, which are approaching a $3 billion annual revenue run rate, have reached critical scale and have significantly increased our addressable market. They are essential to both the work we are doing around digital transformation and platform-based solutions. 
The success and tremendous growth we've seen from these service lines over the past years demonstrates the power of the Three Horizon model as a way to manage growth and investment in the company. Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a key competitive differentiator for us and is underlying much of the work we're doing across our strategic initiatives. As clients undergo enterprise-wide transformation, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as technology, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, program and change management and process redesign.
Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, there's a strong focus on automation and IT operations, driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions. For example, in manufacturing and medical devices, which show an opportunity to improve performance and uptime, needed to standardize and improve its global IT operations. We're developing a scalable and reliable IT infrastructure and offered an end-to-end solution, managing all the clients' hardware and applications, improving speed, predictability and customer satisfaction. 
Cognizant Business Process Services saw a very strong growth during the quarter, led by work with our high-tech and insurance clients. Infusing technology and automation in core business processes is critical to helping clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while also enhancing business outcomes through data analytics. Cognizant recently commenced a multiyear agreement with Storebrand, one of the largest financial services firms in the Nordics, to transform their operations. Cognizant will combine business process with consulting and infrastructure services to enable Storebrand to reengineer business processes across the customer lifecycle, automate and modernize existing IT systems infrastructure and develop digital platforms with advanced analytic capabilities. As part of the contract, Cognizant will help Storebrand to move to a BPaaS model and deliver seamless omni-channel experience.
From a geographic standpoint, North America declined 1.4% sequentially. Adjusting for the seasonality of the TriZetto business, North America was broadly flat with Q4. Europe was up 0.9% sequentially after a 2.5% negative currency impact. The U.K. declined approximately 2.3% sequentially after a 4.5% negative currency impact. And Continental Europe grew 5.4% sequentially after a slight positive currency impact. Finally, the rest of the world was up 30 basis points sequentially and almost 25% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as India, Australia and the Middle East, where we're seeing good traction with the clients' adoption of digital technologies.
Before I turn the call over to Karen, I'd like to discuss our recently announced 49% investment in an exclusive partnership with ReD Associates. How a customer interacts with his or her world, whether it's taking medications, driving a car, shopping or going for a jog has largely been the same for decades. Yet with the digital revolution and emerging of the physical and the virtual, these basic activities are now being rethought. This has become the new competitive battleground for many of our clients of revitalizing their products and services with digital technology. ReD is a unique, highly specialized consultancy whose expertise in the human sciences is helping businesses to address these issues. ReD specialists in sociology, anthropology, philosophy and political science work with market-leading blue-chip clients, such as adidas, Ford and Novo Nordisk, to create compelling experiences for their customers, the customers who now expect their workout equipment, car, shopping experience and health care to be every bit as personalized, engaging and insightful as their iPhone. 
Our minority ownership model allows us to work together exclusively while helping us preserve the unique culture and processes that have led to the long-term success of ReD Associates. This partnership will enable Cognizant and ReD to create an entirely new model for making sense of human behavior, connecting those insights to strategy, applying design thinking to creating engaging digital experiences, and then applying technology to achieve global enterprise scale. These critical elements add to the front-office capabilities, which we described earlier, and enable us to address these challenges in a unique way. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen, who will review our financial results."

First quarter revenue of $3.2 billion met our guidance and represented a sequential decline of 0.9% sequentially and an increase of 10% year-over-year. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $15 million or approximately 50 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $34 million or 120 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.9%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 was at the high end of our guidance range of $0.78 to $0.80. 
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.8% and 42.2% of revenue, respectfully, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services declined 1.6% sequentially, reflecting the cautiousness of certain clients, primarily in banking and health care, to spend on project-based work as well as the seasonality of the TriZetto software license revenue. Revenue from consulting and technology services grew 12.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue was flat sequentially and grew 6.2% from Q1 a year ago. During the first quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts. And as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 8 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 308. 
As Frank mentioned earlier, we ramped up hiring during the quarter with approximately 11,300 net new hires, reflecting our near-term growth expectations and strength of our pipeline. Annualized attrition of 14.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down by almost 450 basis points from last quarter and up slightly from the year-ago period. Throughout 2015, we put in place various employment engagement initiatives to improve our retention levels and are pleased with the progress we've made to date. We will continue to enhance these initiatives over the course of 2016. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 233,000 employees globally, of which approximately 218,000 were service delivery staff. As a result of our strong hiring in the first quarter, utilization was down slightly compared to the fourth quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 75%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 80%. And on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $500 million from the quarter ending December 31. Borrowings under our revolver decreased during the quarter by $250 million, ending at $100 million. Our cash and short-term investments, net of debt, were up by approximately $1.2 billion from the year-ago period. Total receivables were $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 74 days. This is up from 73 days in Q1 of 2015. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was $432 million, up from $369 million at the end of Q4. We billed approximately 53% of the Q4 unbilled balance in April. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1 billion at the end of the quarter, which included $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $68.8 million. Financing activities were approximately a $467.8 million use of cash during the quarter and capital expenditures were approximately $63.7 million during the quarter. During the first quarter, we accelerated our share repurchase activity, repurchasing 4.3 million shares for a total cost of $244.6 million and our diluted share count decreased to 611.8 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q1, we had repurchased approximately 45.5 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.8 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We had $193 million remaining unutilized. 
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we have tightened our revenue expectations to be in the range of $13.65 billion to $14 billion, which represents growth of approximately 10% to 13%, including an approximate 1% negative currency impact. The tightened range is primarily a result of our slower-than-usual performance in Q1. As Frank mentioned, we expect broad-based momentum across service lines, geographies and industries as we move into Q2 and the rest of the year and expect the ramp-up of several deals, including the Healthcare deal mentioned earlier. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. 
For the second quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion. During the second quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the second quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.81 to $0.83. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 610 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 611 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%.

Our guidance is for $140 million to $200 million of sequential growth. We expect to return to positive sequential growth both in Healthcare and Financial Services. So sort of the headwinds that we had in Q1 on a sequential basis have subsided because it's in our run rate. When you think about the back half of the year, there are a couple of wildcards. And obviously, that's why there's a guidance range. One is what happens with additional BPaaS deals and the timing on those? What happens with the timing of some of the big M&A in Healthcare? And we've -- for the full year, we continue to be cautious in Financial Services. But even with that, given the pipeline both of new projects from existing customers and very healthy new logo wins in Q1, we feel good both about the sequential growth going into Q2 and that we continue to have healthy momentum in the back half of the year."

And that technology needs to be deployed, it needs to be integrated, it needs to be configured, it needs to be maintained and upgraded and so on and so forth. And none of that activity goes away. So at a very macro level, I see very strong growth opportunities for us across all 3 Horizons, frankly, because I don't see Horizon 1 declining. I think that as new technology gets deployed, you need to upgrade it, you need to maintain it, you need to take care of it and so on and so forth. And so Horizon 1 services will continue to, I think, have healthy growth going forward. So net-net, when I look at the portfolio across all 3 Horizons, in the long run, I think that there's plenty of market opportunity. And I'll remind you -- I don't need to remind you, but I'll just say that, it's a very fragmented market. We have 1% to 2% market share, so there's plenty of opportunity for us to go capture additional share in the market. And to the second part of your question, I continue to expect that we will have an active M&A strategy as we have historically, looking at the tuck-in acquisitions in the areas that we've always said, geographic expansion, new technologies, deepening our industry expertise. And also now software and IP, I think, will factor into that. But I think our baseline is to do small tuck-ins, and then from time-to-time, if great opportunities like TriZetto present themselves that are bigger, we'll obviously look at those. TriZetto has been, I think, as Gordon said in his comments, exceeded our expectations, I think, in what we've been able to achieve in 1.5 years. And so we'll continue to look favorably at opportunities like that but also look at them very carefully to make sure that they meet all of the criteria for us."

And then post merger, depending upon when the integration starts, there tends to be quite a bit of upside as you bring the platforms together or implement new process and new platforms for the combined organization. And that clearly in big Healthcare deals like this would have quite a long runway. So as you said, depending on the timing of those deals, given the fact that we are a strong partner on all 4 sides of the equation in those deals, we would certainly expect to see at least our fair share of the integration work."

Again, I don't know that this was a major push or big delays.

Clearly, the majority of our activity in pipeline right now is in Healthcare around the TriZetto platform. But we have BPaaS, both opportunities in the pipeline and also client engagements that are in other industries, in other sectors. In many cases, those are platforms that we've developed ourselves. In some cases, these are platforms that we have acquired, smaller platforms that we've acquired in the past. And in some cases, these are offerings that we've constructed on top of third-party products, the software platforms, either commercial ISV platforms or sometimes we're having conversations about taking a client's asset and essentially wrapping a BPaaS service around that and taking it to market. So there are a number of opportunities and a number of irons we have in that fire and a lot of, I think, positive momentum there. I would say in terms of the economics, the economics on the initial BPaaS deals tend to be roughly in line with -- maybe a little lower than a traditional deal. But then the second, third, fourth time you do it because you've established the factory and the utility, the margins start to get very, very promising because you're essentially amortizing the fixed cost over a larger volume."

And so really, digital really is very much of the core operating fabric of all our service offerings, all of our service lines. I think we continue to feel very good about the broad-based capability that we've built in digital. We were out ahead, I think, of many on the digital opportunity with social, mobile, analytics and cloud from a technology standpoint. I think we are in, for Cognizant, in the third or fourth generation of our thinking around digital with our Digital Works approach and methodology, where we've gone well beyond technology to include design and data science in addition to the strategy and technology and industry knowledge to combine those together, which is what you really need when you're deploying digital on behalf of clients. We spoke a little bit about our investment in ReD Associates this quarter, which is another dimension to the Digital Works approach. We feel very good about what the possibilities are in combining ReD, which brings a human approach to digital from the social sciences standpoint. And so that's just another dimension to digital. So overall, I feel like we really have one of the leading digital capabilities out there. We have -- we're doing very deep, impactful work with clients, like the Life Sciences client that I spoke about in my prepared comments. So I feel good about the capability. It's hard to say what -- to quantify exactly what portion of this is discretionary in the sense of in the event of an economic slowdown. But I would say that contextually, the work that we're doing is largely very fundamental to the future of our clients' businesses and their strategy. Today, there is no strategy for a business without some digital component. And so the work that we're doing tends to be very much in the heart of the future of these businesses. And so I would imagine that there'd be some stickiness to that in the event of economic slowdown. Hard to quantify, though."

Let me say, first of all, that clearly large enterprises are looking at the cloud in multiple different ways. I would say that most of the large enterprises that we deal with are very much focused on hybrid cloud and looking at -- very carefully thinking about what workloads belong in the cloud and what workloads belong on-prem and how those balance off against each other. I would say that the -- while the nature of workloads in the cloud requires a different maintenance profile, a workload in the cloud needs to be maintained and upgraded and monitored and modernized and all of those kinds of things, just like a workload on-premise. There's much of the care and feeding of a workload in the cloud that still needs to be taken care of. And so I don't think it's a fair assumption to just assume that when a workload moves into the cloud, it exists in the cloud without any support or care and feeding around it. So the implication that perhaps a workload moving to the cloud completely cannibalizes revenue is not entirely, I think, accurate, at least based on the technology that's available today and what we see. I think more importantly though -- so that's one dimension of the answer. The other dimension of the answer I would say is, look, over the time horizons that you talked about, 10, 15 years, the amount of data and the number of devices that are going to exist in the ecosystem is going to explode. It's going to increase absolutely exponentially. And so all of that complexity is going to require, in my opinion, far more management, far more maintenance, far more deployment help. There's all of these other services that will be required to manage that degree of complexity as data and devices explode. And so I think when you look over the time horizons that you're looking at, I'll come back to the answer I gave to one of the earlier questions, which is that the world is going to become more technology-intensive, not less technology-intensive. It's going to become more data-intensive, not less data-intensive. And it's going to become more device-intensive, and these devices are going to be much more heterogeneous than they are today. All of that complexity is going to require a lot of services to manage and maintain. And I think we're very well positioned as that transition occurs."

So I would say that if you think about our Financial Services portfolio, the bulk of our Financial Services portfolio, clients that we've worked with over many, many, many years. And if you look historically at our performance in Financial Services, I think you'll see that our Financial Services performance and portfolio has delivered very consistent results and solid growth year-over-year sequentially over many, many quarters. The reason for that is that I think we've got great relationships with these clients. We tend to be very embedded with these clients as they plan their annual operating budgets and their annual operating plans, their project portfolios and so on and so forth. And they work very closely with us as they're planning that to make sure that we have the capacity and the talent available to meet their demands. So we tend to have very good visibility with these clients. We knew of a slowdown in Q1. We told you about the slowdown in Financial Services when we gave you our first look into the first quarter. And that was a result of the fact that we had been given that heads-up in working with a lot of these clients. And as we've gone through the first quarter, we continue that process with them. We now feel comfortable that we've got visibility that we'll return Financial Services to positive sequential growth for the rest of this year.

I'm assuming you're referring to the PSUs. So there's 2 things that are going on there. One is, historically, PSUs have been 100% revenue. We've now shifted that to a combination of revenue and earnings to balance it out a bit more and in line with what other companies are doing. The second thing is for the grants that we've issued in early 2016, we're moving to a 2-year measurement period instead of a 1-year measurement period. So what this does is it further differentiates the measurements on the annual bonus from the measurements for the PSUs. And obviously, the PSUs then there's a fairly long tail afterwards before they actually vest. But we wanted to make sure that the incentives are aligned with revenue and earnings and that they're multiyear. So it's more aligning to what others in the industry are doing. That's the primary purpose of that."

So I would say I'll remind you that our primary access in going to market has been for the better part of a decade, maybe longer, the industry vertical. So we take everything to market through an industry vertical lens. We view that as being an incredibly important and significant part of our differentiation to have deep domain expertise around the industries that we serve and taking all of our services into a client through the industry lens. Behind the industry groups, we have essentially what you might think of as lines of service. The lines of service are -- fall into different categories. These are the traditional services, the Horizon 2 services or rather the BPO, IT Infrastructure Services and consulting and also the new digital services. And all of these services go to market through the verticals. The Three Horizon model is how we manage investments across the business. So both across verticals and the horizontals, if you go to the lines of service, we apply the Three Horizon model to say how do we allocate capital? How do we make investments across both the verticals and the horizontals? And actually, there's a third dimension, which are the geographies in which we operate. So the Three Horizon model is a very clear and crisp way for us to say across the 3 legs of our metrics, the verticals, the lines of service and the geographies in which we operate, how do we allocate capital to the places where we're going to get the best returns, where the growth potential is the best? And so Three Horizon for us is less of an internal organizational construct. We don't have a Horizon 1 or Horizon 2 and a Horizon 3 organization. What we have is an investment model that are follows the Three Horizon and layers on top of the 3 vectors that I just talked about, which are the 3 legs of the matrix or the real organizational vectors: the verticals, the geographies and the lines of service. So I hope that clarifies it a little bit. And I think that's our last question. So with that, let me thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions. And we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you."

Our Q1 revenue was $3.2 billion, down 0.9% from Q4 and within our guided range of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion. Revenue was up 10% from a year ago. 
The quarter developed exactly as we outlined when we provided guidance back in February. As we expected, we saw some softness in our Financial Services and Healthcare segments, resulting in a slow start to the year. Macroeconomic concerns and market volatility weighed on the banking industry at the start of this year, resulting in some moderation in discretionary spending. We anticipate a return to positive sequential growth in our Financial Services practice for the balance of this year. 
Industry consolidation within the health care payer space was a key factor in the softness of our Healthcare practice during Q1. Going forward this year, we also expect a return to positive sequential growth in our Healthcare segment as the pressure from industry consolidation is expected to be partially offset by anticipated project ramp-ups and a strong pipeline, including the recent signing of a significant multiyear deal with EmblemHealth, one of New York's leading health insurance and wellness companies.
Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance within a range of $3.32 to $3.44 and tightening our full year revenue growth guidance to a range of approximately 10% to 13%. What's important to note is our Q2 revenue guidance, reflecting a strong rebound in sequential growth, is a range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion. This represents incremental revenue within a range of $140 million to $200 million and would make Q2 a strong sequential growth quarter, putting us on a solid trajectory for the rest of the year. We expect broad-based momentum across service lines, geographies and industries in Q2. In support of our confidence in the business and the strength of our pipeline, we've stepped up hiring, adding approximately 11,300 net hires this past quarter. Karen will provide you with full details of our expected financial performance shortly.
Moving on, let me provide some color on the key factors influencing client spending in the current environment. As we've seen over the last several quarters, digital transformation continues to be a strong driver of demand as clients look for new solutions that allow them to defend their businesses against digital disruptors while innovating to create new areas of growth. We are in a strong position to capture the opportunities that are emerging from this transition. And we believe that for true enterprise-wide digital transformation, clients need an interdisciplinary framework, which brings together strategy, technology, design, data science and industry knowledge. Cognizant Digital Works has been developed to provide this integrated approach to driving transformation.
This quarter, we've added another dimension to our Digital Works approach by acquiring a 49% stake in ReD Associates, a human science consultancy that focuses on consumer experience and behavior and how these factors impact corporate strategies, products and services and go-to market approaches. Together, ReD and Cognizant will provide a unique and compelling approach for businesses in helping them reframe their challenges for the digital era. Gordon will talk more about ReD later in his comments.
True digital transformation requires businesses to make fundamental changes in customer experience, operations and business models that extend throughout the organization, from the front office to the middle office and right through to the back-office systems. At the front end, where enterprises engage with a myriad of stakeholders, from customers to employees and business partners, our clients are looking to build capabilities that create personalized experiences across multiple devices that are well integrated with their business and technology architectures and can be deployed rapidly at scale. 
In the middle office, clients are looking for operational agility and efficiency by combining people, processes and technology through platforms that are delivered as outcome-based models. These shared utility models, sometimes called Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, can be enhanced with automation and analytics to bring additional value to clients' operations. And in the back office, clients must modernize core IT systems and implement complex engineering development methods to create the technology backbone that's able to support the agility, scale and performance needs of a digital enterprise.  
It's through this lens that we've identified investments in 3 key strategic areas to take clients through this transformation journey. Let me now talk more about each of these initiatives in detail. The first strategic initiative is building the digital capabilities to work with our clients on their front-end systems. I spoke a few minutes ago about our Digital Works approach, which seamlessly integrates 5 essential elements: strategy, technology, data science, experienced design and industry expertise to develop and deliver digital solutions rapidly. We're finding great traction for this framework across the industries that we serve. For example, we're helping a leading life sciences company to improve diabetic care by implementing an Internet of Things, or IoT, infrastructure that enables remote upgrades to home-based glucose meters and insulin pumps. Doing so will improve customer satisfaction and adherence to testing regimes. This comes after we've already successfully developed on IoT monitoring framework for the same company to better maintain its thousands of surgical devices remotely. 
The second strategic initiative is to help clients achieve new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in their core transaction processing operations by building platform-based solutions and industry utilities. These solutions are offered to clients in a Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, model that allows clients to shift from buying service to buying an outcome. By applying a series of levers, including process optimization, digitization and large-scale efficiencies, we're able to bring clients levels of effectiveness which they would have been unable to reach on their own.
The third strategic initiative is to transform clients' existing IT systems and infrastructure to next-generation IT. Clients cannot harness the potential from digital technologies without integrating with and upgrading their legacy systems and infrastructure. This requires a transformation of their IT backbone, including a simplification of how applications are developed and delivered, along with the standardization of the IT infrastructure to ensure simplicity and flexibility at an appropriate cost. For instance, under our agreement with the health care client I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, over the next several years, Cognizant will help retire, upgrade and modernize their legacy infrastructure, software and development processes. We will replace legacy infrastructure with cloud-based virtual infrastructure, upgrade all software capabilities with Cognizant's TriZetto Facets software and implement Agile methodologies to ensure and expedite the timely development and rollout of new products. 
With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance, and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later to take your questions. Gordon?"

Heading into the rest of the year, we have good momentum across the business, as indicated by our Q2 guidance, which anticipates very healthy sequential revenue growth. With that in mind, let me provide you with some additional color on our performance across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies. 
Our banking and Financial Services segment was down 1.7% sequentially and up 10.7% year-over-year. As we discussed on our first quarter call, macroeconomic concerns weighed on our banking practice at the start of the year. While we've seen stabilization in the markets and expect improved performance within our banking practice over the course of the year, several of our banking clients continue to take a cautious approach. Looking past these short-term challenges, it is increasingly clear that the fintech revolution is driving our banking clients to invest in significant changes to their business model to meaningfully pivot towards becoming digital enterprises. 
Moving on to our insurance practice. We continue to see strong demand for solutions which help transform the claims and underwriting processes deliver greater efficiencies, increasingly through managed services or other outcome-based arrangements. In addition, there's an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service, often through harnessing data and analytics to drive real-time decisions. 
Let me give you an example. We're working with The Guardian Life Insurance Company to implement a next-generation IT solution for modernizing its big data infrastructure with Cognizant's BIGFrame, a platform solution that leverages Cognizant's extensive big data and mainframe expertise. Using the BIGFrame solution, Guardian will fast-track its modernization program while minimizing risk and operational impact. The new platform-based environment integrates data from multiple sources, providing comprehensive data as a service to internal teams for self-service analysis, improved decision-making and faster product development. 
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, declined 4% sequentially and grew 4% year-over-year. The seasonal impact of the TriZetto's software business contributed to roughly half of this sequential decline as a large portion of software sales occur in the fourth quarter. As we've discussed for several quarters, the industry consolidation among several of the nation's largest payers is weighing on our Healthcare practice in 2016. However, the payer sector continues to undergo fundamental changes. Over the medium and longer term, we believe these changes will create opportunities that we are well positioned to capture, particularly through the combined Cognizant and TriZetto offerings.
As you recall, we had said that by acquiring TriZetto, we were acquiring IP in the form of software, which when combined with our traditional IT and business process services, would allow us to create revenue synergies that neither company alone would have been able to achieve. These synergies include increased systems integration, hosting and business process opportunities around the TriZetto software and most importantly, end-to-end platform-based solutions. The integration of TriZetto and market acceptance of our combined capabilities has exceeded even our own expectations. As a result, we continue to feel good about the acquisition and our ability to create shareholder value through strong synergy revenues.
In addition to end-to-end BPaaS solutions in health care, we're also winning in digital. For example, Cognizant has been engaged by a division of a major health care player as their strategic partner in their digital business transformation. This client is experiencing rapid growth and has process, systems and technologies that cannot keep pace with their growth and strategic vision. We're helping them to reimagine their customer experience, replatform their operational backbone and redesign their operating model, ultimately resulting in increased customer retention and operational effectiveness, improved customer insights and experience and lower cost of operations.
Moving to our Life Sciences business, where the pipeline for deals is strong despite a muted start to 2016. We continue to see demand for multiservice deals combining applications and infrastructure in our mid-sized pharma clients while our large pharma clients are increasingly interested in managed services arrangements to help reduce operational risk and deliver cost savings.
Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 3.6% sequentially and 15.2% year-over-year, driven by strength in retail, manufacturing and logistics. One of the keys to the strength in our manufacturing and logistics practice in recent quarters has been our growing relationship with the engineering teams within our clients, leveraging our digital and IoT expertise to help them smart-enable products, to improve instrumentation across their product portfolios. For example, for a global manufacturer of industrial machinery, we're helping the client, who has faced a period of declining sales, digitally enable existing equipment and create new digital products as a way to monetize data, improve the utilization of their equipment as well as reduce inventory in the supply chain. 
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 2% sequentially and 14.7% year-over-year, driven by our technology practice. With high-tech clients, we are seeing good opportunity around platform engineering for cloud services. Working with our high-tech clients enables us to do leading-edge technology work, which is often applicable to other industries. For example, we're implementing this platform development for a client who is a leading provider of cloud computing services. Cognizant is creating a fully automated platform, which will target the mid-market enterprise space to provide real-time and elastic capacity for their customers' network and storage needs and to price this capacity accordingly. As a result, the client was able to significantly reduce cloud services' provisioning time and launch new variable pricing models, matching changes in market demand. This kind of experience is increasingly relevant to our corporate clients, who are thinking about rearchitecting their infrastructure by deploying cloud solutions. 
Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 services: Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 services, which are approaching a $3 billion annual revenue run rate, have reached critical scale and have significantly increased our addressable market. They are essential to both the work we are doing around digital transformation and platform-based solutions. 
The success and tremendous growth we've seen from these service lines over the past years demonstrates the power of the Three Horizon model as a way to manage growth and investment in the company. Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a key competitive differentiator for us and is underlying much of the work we're doing across our strategic initiatives. As clients undergo enterprise-wide transformation, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as technology, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, program and change management and process redesign.
Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, there's a strong focus on automation and IT operations, driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions. For example, in manufacturing medical devices, we've shown an opportunity to improve performance and uptime needed to standardize and improve its global IT operations. We're developing a scalable and reliable IT infrastructure and offered an end-to-end solution, managing all the clients' hardware and applications, improving speed, predictability and customer satisfaction. 
Cognizant Business Process Services saw a very strong growth during the quarter, led by work with our high-tech and insurance clients. Infusing technology and automation in core business processes is critical to helping clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while also enhancing business outcomes through data analytics. Cognizant recently commenced a multiyear agreement with Storebrand, one of the largest financial services firms in the Nordics, to transform their operations. Cognizant will combine business process with consulting and infrastructure services to enable Storebrand to reengineer business processes across the customer lifecycle, automate and modernize existing IT systems infrastructure and develop digital platforms with advanced analytic capabilities. As part of the contract, Cognizant will help Storebrand to move to a BPaaS model and deliver seamless omni-channel experience.
From a geographic standpoint, North America declined 1.4% sequentially. Adjusting for the seasonality of the TriZetto business, North America was broadly flat with Q4. Europe was up 0.9% sequentially after a 2.5% negative currency impact. The U.K. declined approximately 2.3% sequentially after a 4.5% negative currency impact. And Continental Europe grew 5.4% sequentially after a slight positive currency impact. Finally, the rest of the world was up 30 basis points sequentially and almost 25% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as India, Australia and the Middle East, where we're seeing good traction with the clients' adoption of digital technologies.
Before I turn the call over to Karen, I'd like to discuss our recently announced 49% investment in an exclusive partnership with ReD Associates. How a customer interacts with his or her world, whether it's taking medications, driving a car, shopping or going for a jog has largely been the same for decades. Yet with the digital revolution and the merging of the physical and the virtual, these basic activities are now being rethought. This has become the new competitive battleground for many of our clients of revitalizing their products and services with digital technology. ReD is a unique, highly specialized consultancy whose expertise in the human sciences is helping businesses to address these issues. ReD specialists in sociology, anthropology, philosophy and political science work with market-leading blue-chip clients, such as adidas, Ford and Novo Nordisk, to create compelling experiences for their customers, the customers who now expect their workout equipment, car, shopping experience and health care to be every bit as personalized, engaging and insightful as their iPhone. 
Our minority ownership model allows us to work together exclusively while helping us preserve the unique culture and processes that have led to the long-term success of ReD Associates. This partnership will enable Cognizant and ReD to create an entirely new model for making sense of human behavior, connecting those insights to strategy, applying design thinking to creating engaging digital experiences, and then applying technology to achieve global enterprise scale. These critical elements add to the front-office capabilities, which we described earlier, and enable us to address these challenges in a unique way. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen, who will review our financial results."

First quarter revenue of $3.2 billion met our guidance and represented a sequential decline of 0.9% sequentially and an increase of 10% year-over-year. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $15 million or approximately 50 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $34 million or 120 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.9%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 was at the high end of our guidance range of $0.78 to $0.80. 
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.8% and 42.2% of revenue, respectfully, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services declined 1.6% sequentially, reflecting the cautiousness of certain clients, primarily in banking and health care, to spend on project-based work as well as the seasonality of TriZetto's software license revenue. Revenue from consulting and technology services grew 12.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue was flat sequentially and grew 6.2% from Q1 a year ago. During the first quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts. And as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 8 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 308. 
As Frank mentioned earlier, we ramped up hiring during the quarter with approximately 11,300 net new hires, reflecting our near-term growth expectations and strength of our pipeline. Annualized attrition of 14.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down by almost 450 basis points from last quarter and up slightly from the year-ago period. Throughout 2015, we've put in place various employment engagement initiatives to improve our retention levels and are pleased with the progress we've made to date. We will continue to enhance these initiatives over the course of 2016. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 233,000 employees globally, of which approximately 218,000 were service delivery staff. As a result of our strong hiring in the first quarter, utilization was down slightly compared to the fourth quarter. Offshore utilization was approximately 75%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 80%. And on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $500 million from the quarter ending December 31. Borrowings under our revolver decreased during the quarter by $250 million, ending at $100 million. Our cash and short-term investments, net of debt, were up by approximately $1.2 billion from the year-ago period. Total receivables were $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 74 days. This is up from 73 days in Q1 of 2015. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was $432 million, up from $369 million at the end of Q4. We billed approximately 53% of the Q4 unbilled balance in April. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1 billion at the end of the quarter, which included $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $68.8 million. Financing activities were approximately a $467.8 million use of cash during the quarter and capital expenditures were approximately $63.7 million during the quarter. During the first quarter, we accelerated our share repurchase activity, repurchasing 4.3 million shares for a total cost of $244.6 million and our diluted share count decreased to 611.8 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q1, we had repurchased approximately 45.5 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.8 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We had $193 million remaining unutilized. 
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we have tightened our revenue expectations to be in the range of $13.65 billion to $14 billion, which represents growth of approximately 10% to 13%, including an approximate 1% negative currency impact. The tightened range is primarily a result of our slower-than-usual performance in Q1. As Frank mentioned, we expect broad-based momentum across service lines, geographies and industries as we move into Q2 and the rest of the year and expect the ramp-up of several deals, including the Healthcare deal mentioned earlier. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. 
For the second quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion. During the second quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the second quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.81 to $0.83. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 610 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 611 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%.

Let's talk about both confidence for Q2 and the back half of the year because they tie together. We have very good momentum going into Q2. Our guidance is for $140 million to $200 million of sequential growth. We expect to return to positive sequential growth both in Healthcare and Financial Services. So sort of the headwinds that we had in Q1 on a sequential basis have subsided because it's in our run rate. When you think about the back half of the year, there are a couple of wildcards. And obviously, that's why there's a guidance range. One is what happens with additional BPaaS deals and the timing on those? What happens with the timing of some of the big M&A in Healthcare? And we've -- for the full year, we continue to be cautious in Financial Services. But even with that, given the pipeline both of new projects from existing customers and very healthy new logo wins in Q1, we feel good both about the sequential growth going into Q2 and that we continue to have healthy momentum in the back half of the year."

And that technology needs to be deployed, it needs to be integrated, it needs to be configured, it needs to be maintained and upgraded and so on and so forth. And none of that activity goes away. So at a very macro level, I see very strong growth opportunities for us across all 3 Horizons, frankly, because I don't see Horizon 1 declining. I think that as new technology gets deployed, you need to upgrade it, you need to maintain it, you need to take care of it and so on and so forth. And so Horizon 1 services will continue to, I think, have healthy growth going forward. So net-net, when I look at the portfolio across all 3 Horizons, in the long run, I think that there's plenty of market opportunity. And I'll remind you -- I don't need to remind you, but I'll just say that, it's a very fragmented market. We have 1% to 2% market share, so there's plenty of opportunity for us to go capture additional share in the market. And to the second part of your question, I continue to expect that we will have an active M&A strategy, as we have historically, looking at the tuck-in acquisitions in the areas that we've always said, geographic expansion, new technologies, deepening our industry expertise. And also now software and IP, I think, will factor into that. But I think our baseline is to do small tuck-ins, and then from time-to-time, if great opportunities like TriZetto present themselves that are bigger, we'll obviously look at those. TriZetto has been, I think, as Gordon said in his comments, exceeded our expectations, I think, in what we've been able to achieve in 1.5 years. And so we'll continue to look favorably at opportunities like that but also look at them very carefully to make sure that they meet all of the criteria for us."

And that clearly in big Healthcare deals like this would have quite a long runway.

Clearly, the majority of our activity and pipeline right now is in Healthcare around the TriZetto platform. But we have BPaaS, both opportunities in the pipeline and also client engagements that are in other industries, in other sectors. In many cases, those are platforms that we've developed ourselves. In some cases, these are platforms that we have acquired, smaller platforms that we've acquired in the past. And in some cases, these are offerings that we've constructed on top of third-party products, software platforms, either commercial ISV platforms or sometimes we're having conversations about taking a client's asset and essentially wrapping a BPaaS service around that and taking it to market. So there are a number of opportunities and a number of irons we have in that fire and a lot of, I think, positive momentum there. I would say in terms of the economics, the economics on the initial BPaaS deals tend to be roughly in line with -- maybe a little lower than a traditional deal. But then the second, third, fourth time you do it, because you've established the factory and the utility, the margins start to get very, very promising because you're essentially amortizing the fixed cost over a larger volume."

And so really, digital really is very much of the core operating fabric of all our service offerings, all of our service lines. I think we continue to feel very good about the broad-based capability that we've built in digital. We were out ahead, I think, of many on the digital opportunity with social, mobile, analytics and cloud from a technology standpoint. I think we are in, for Cognizant, in the third or fourth generation of our thinking around digital with our Digital Works approach and methodology, where we've gone well beyond technology to include design and data science in addition to strategy and technology and industry knowledge to combine those together, which is what you really need when you're deploying digital on behalf of clients. We spoke a little bit about our investment in ReD Associates this quarter, which is another dimension to the Digital Works approach. We feel very good about what the possibilities are in combining ReD, which brings a human approach to digital from the social sciences standpoint. And so that's just another dimension to digital. So overall, I feel like we really have one of the leading digital capabilities out there. We have -- we're doing very deep, impactful work with clients, like the Life Sciences client that I spoke about in my prepared comments. So I feel good about the capability. It's hard to say what -- to quantify exactly what portion of this is discretionary in the sense of in the event of an economic slowdown. But I would say that contextually, the work that we're doing is largely very fundamental to the future of our clients' businesses and their strategy. Today, there is no strategy for a business without some digital component. And so the work that we're doing tends to be very much in the heart of the future of these businesses. And so I would imagine that there'd be some stickiness to that in the event of economic slowdown. Hard to quantify, though."

But 2020, we could be up to 15% and some are predicting, actually, 50% of all workloads, maybe 10, 15 years out, will be in the cloud. So I guess my question is are you actually seeing this? We hear about a tipping point in many large companies, maybe of the ones that you deal with, the big financial banks, want to move to AWS and want to move to the cloud. So are you seeing that? Are you helping with that? And how would it affect your business, especially, I guess, I have about 7% of your business, I think, is in RIM or remote infrastructure management?"

Let me say, first of all, that clearly large enterprises are looking at the cloud in multiple different ways. I would say that most of the large enterprises that we deal with are very much focused on hybrid cloud and looking at -- very carefully thinking about what workloads belong in the cloud and what workloads belong on-prem and how those balance off against each other. I would say that the -- while the nature of workloads in the cloud requires a different maintenance profile, a workload in the cloud needs to be maintained and upgraded and monitored and modernized and all of those kinds of things, just like a workload on-premise. There's much of the care and feeding of a workload in the cloud that still needs to be taken care of. And so I don't think it's a fair assumption to just assume that when a workload moves into the cloud, it exists in the cloud without any support or care and feeding around it. So the implication that perhaps a workload moving to the cloud completely cannibalizes revenue is not entirely, I think, accurate, at least based on the technology that's available today and what we see. I think more importantly though -- so that's one dimension of the answer. The other dimension of the answer I would say is that, look, over the time horizons that you talked about, 10, 15 years, the amount of data and the number of devices that are going to exist in the ecosystem is going to explode. It's going to increase absolutely exponentially. And so all of that complexity is going to require, in my opinion, far more management, far more maintenance, far more deployment help. There's all of these other services that will be required to manage that degree of complexity as data and devices explode. And so I think when you look over the time horizons that you're looking at, I'll come back to the answer I gave to one of the earlier questions, which is that the world is going to become more technology-intensive, not less technology-intensive. It's going to become more data-intensive, not less data-intensive. And it's going to become more device-intensive, and these devices are going to be much more heterogeneous than they are today. All of that complexity is going to require a lot of services to manage and maintain. And I think we're very well positioned as that transition occurs."

So I would say that if you think about our Financial Services portfolio, the bulk of our Financial Services portfolio are clients that we've worked with over many, many, many years. And if you look historically at our performance in Financial Services, I think you'll see that our Financial Services performance and portfolio has delivered very consistent results and solid growth year-over-year sequentially over many, many quarters. The reason for that is that I think we've got great relationships with these clients. We tend to be very embedded with these clients as they plan their annual operating budgets and their annual operating plans, their project portfolios and so on and so forth. And they work very closely with us as they're planning that to make sure that we have the capacity and the talent available to meet their demands. So we tend to have very good visibility with these clients. We knew of a slowdown in Q1. We told you about the slowdown in Financial Services when we gave you our first look into the first quarter. And that was as a result of the fact that we had been given that heads-up in working with a lot of these clients. And as we've gone through the first quarter and we continue that process with them, we now feel comfortable that we've got visibility that -- and we'll return Financial Services to positive sequential growth for the rest of this year. So with that, Gordon, do you want to comment on attrition?"

And the nature of the work we're doing and our leadership in digital provides for really interesting work. So we've redoubled our efforts on employee engagement. We are very clear to our employees. We share the company's success with them. We paid out very healthy bonuses for 2015. We've rolled out our career architecture, so people can understand what does it take to move up in the organization, so they can self-manage their career. We've improved rotational experiences. We've invested -- doubled down again in investment in training for our people. So I think what's happened is as people -- as our employees have experienced what we've talked about and as we've refocused on it again, we've seen improvements. There's a little bit of seasonality in Q1 because of bonus payouts. But clearly, the trend is very much headed in the right direction.

We've now shifted that to a combination of revenue and earnings to balance it out a bit more and in line with what other companies are doing. The second thing is for the grants that we've issued in early 2016, we're moving to a 2-year measurement period instead of a 1-year measurement period. So what this does is it further differentiates the measurements on the annual bonus from the measurements for the PSUs. And obviously, the PSUs then there's a fairly long tail afterwards before they actually vest. But we wanted to make sure that the incentives are aligned with revenue and earnings and that they're multiyear. So it's more aligning to what others in the industry are doing. That's the primary purpose of that."

So I would say -- I'll remind you that our primary access in going to market has been, for the better part of a decade, maybe longer, the industry vertical. So we take everything to market through an industry vertical lens. We view that as being an incredibly important and significant part of our differentiation to have deep domain expertise around the industries that we serve and taking all of our services into a client through the industry lens. Behind the industry groups, we have essentially what you might think of as lines of service. The lines of service are -- fall into different categories. These are the traditional services, the Horizon 2 services or rather the BPO, IT Infrastructure Services and consulting and also the new digital services. And all of these services go to market through the verticals. The Three Horizon model is how we manage investments across the business. So both across verticals and the horizontals, if you go to [ph] the lines of service, we apply the Three Horizon model to say how do we allocate capital? How do we make investments across both the verticals and the horizontals? And actually, there's a third dimension, which are the geographies in which we operate. So the Three Horizon model is a very clear and crisp way for us to say, across the 3 legs of our matrix: the verticals, the lines of service and the geographies in which we operate; how do we allocate capital to the places where we're going to get the best returns, where the growth potential is the best? And so Three Horizons for us is less of an internal organizational construct. We don't have a Horizon 1, a Horizon 2 and a Horizon 3 organization. What we have is an investment model that are follows the Three Horizon and layers on top of the 3 vectors that I just talked about, which are the 3 legs of the matrix are the real organizational vectors: the verticals, the geographies and the lines of service. So I hope that clarifies it a little bit. And I think that's our last question. So with that, let me thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions.

Thanks for joining us today. Our Q2 revenue was $3.37 billion, up 5.2% from Q1 and 9.2% from a year ago and was within our guided range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion.
Against the backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment and market environment and a slow start to the year, we executed well last quarter and we continue to gain market share. The quarterly sequential dollar growth was one of the strongest in our history as we added incremental revenues of almost $170 million. This performance represented broad-based growth across service lines, geographies and industries.
As we had anticipated, after slow start in Q1, our Financial Services and Healthcare segments turned in positive sequential growth in Q2. As we entered the second half of the year, we see certain macroeconomic factors as well as some softness in client's discretionary spending that will affect our revenue growth primarily for Financial Services and Healthcare clients. Additionally, we anticipate further negative revenue impact of approximately $40 million for the second half of the year due to the weakening of the pound sterling following the Brexit vote.
For these reasons, we're revising our full year revenue growth guidance to a range of $13.47 billion to $13.6 billion while maintaining our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance within a range of $3.32 to $3.44. Gordon, Rod and Karen will expand more on the cyclical weakness that we're facing in the short term. As you listen to their comments, I'd like to emphasize that the medium- to long-term fundamentals of our business are strong. We continue to see significant market opportunity and more importantly, gain market share. Digital transformation continues to be a strong driver for demand as clients look for new solutions that allow them to defend their businesses against digital disruptors while innovating to create new areas of growth and differentiation.
Given this context, we continue to invest in 3 strategic areas based on the conviction that true digital transformation requires businesses to make fundamental changes throughout their organizations from the front office through the middle office and to the back office systems. These 3 areas will provide the framework for how we think about growing our business going forward.
The first strategic initiative is to help our clients build you front end capabilities enabled by digital technologies that create personalized experiences for their customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. Clients recognize our strong digital capabilities, having called out the trend in SMAC over 5 years ago. We continue to see great success in building out our digital capabilities through investing organically as well as through select acquisitions. We just announced the acquisition of Idea Couture, [ph] which will become part of Cognizant Digital Works. As you will recall, Cognizant Digital Works brings together human insight, strategy, design, technology and industry expertise to create innovative solutions at enterprise scale to help clients succeed in this new digital economy. Idea Couture is a digital innovation firm that operate at the intersection of strategy and technology and specializes in designing and prototyping products, services and business models for growth and competitive advantage. Ideal Culture serves some of the largest firms in the world, including Samsung, ConAgra Foods and Pepsi. This was our sixth investment in the digital space, building on prior acquisitions of Kadian, K base, I Taz and Odyssey in addition to our recent strategic investment in ReD Associates. Collectively, we have deployed over $200 million in capital across these digital investments.
The second strategic initiative is to drive new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the core transaction processing operations of our clients by building platform-based solutions and industry utilities. These solutions are offered to clients in the business process as a service, or BPaaS model, that allow clients to shift from buying a service to buying an outcome. We've developed a number of platform-based solutions across our industry practices and the result of these investments is best illustrated by our significant progress in the Healthcare vertical, where we've been able to successfully combine TriZetto software with Cognizant's technology and operations capabilities. Since our TriZetto acquisition, we have signed several large platform-based deals with a combined TCV or total contract value approaching $2 billion, including the program at EmblemHealth that we spoke about last quarter, and we're pursuing a number of additional similar opportunities in the market.
The third strategic initiative is to transform client's existing IT systems and infrastructure to next-generation IT to help them harness the potential from digital technologies. This includes the solicitation of how applications are developed and delivered along with the standardization of the IT infrastructure to ensure simplicity and flexibility at an appropriate cost. We're making good progress in each of these areas, and we're confident that this framework will differentiate our services and solutions in the marketplace now and in the future.
In closing, I'd like to emphasize that we've been through periods of market volatility in the past. While macroeconomic factors such as what we experience this quarter are not within our control, we're confident that we will execute well through this cycle and continue to get market share.
So with that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss the current demand environment and, to discuss our business performance and to Karen to provide more financial details. Gordon?"
386024,374878260,1026611,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by providing some additional context on the specific short-term headwinds that are leading us to revise this year's revenue guidance.First, as we indicated on our last 2 earnings calls, dis",832,"Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by providing some additional context on the specific short-term headwinds that are leading us to revise this year's revenue guidance.
First, as we indicated on our last 2 earnings calls, discretionary spending in the banking sector remained soft, weighed down by macroeconomic concerns and a prolonged low interest rate environment. While we did see a return to healthy sequential growth in the second quarter, we expect banking discretionary spending during the second half of 2016 [ph] to be slower than we anticipated 3 months ago. Complicating the situation, of course, is the uncertainty arising from the Brexit vote in the U.K. Economic growth forecast and short to medium term interest rate projections have generally been revised down since the vote. Given this new development, we see the banking sector being more cautious in spending over the near term and therefore, we believe it is prudent to err on the side of caution and banking financial services revenue planning for the remainder of this year.
Second, the sharp weakening of the pound sterling will have a negative impact on our second quarter revenue of approximately $4 million, assuming the currency holds at current levels. As you know, the pound sterling has seen a 12% depreciation since the Brexit vote.
Third, as we indicated to you at the beginning of this year, consolidation within the U.S. healthcare industry has impacted the revenue growth of our healthcare practice. Given the status of the M&A regulatory approval process, we anticipate that project spending will continue to slow for clients involved in these consolidations for the remainder of the year.
Finally, we're also seeing customer pull back on discretionary spending in other pockets of our business. For example, some clients within our information services practice are taking more moderate approach to spending as we go into the back half of the year.
While we're taking a cautious approach to our revenue expectations for the remainder of 2016, we believe that the medium- to long-term outlook for our business remains as strong as ever. The pipeline is healthy and we continue to making investments in skills and capabilities that will help us meet our clients' evolving need to simultaneously run better and run different. 
I'd like to take a moment to outline 3 trends that are driving client demand and our optimism for the medium and long-term outlook for our business. You'll see that these trends are the basis for the investment areas that Frank described a few moments ago. First, in the shift to digital, there's a greater sense of urgency among CXMs to build new innovative models to drive revenue growth and create differentiation in the market. I see this in almost every client meeting I attend regardless of industry. These conversations have evolved from a discussion of SMAC, which is now table stakes, to the exploration and execution in areas such as artificial intelligence, IoT ecosystems, augmented reality, adapted manufacturing and block chain, just to name a few. Digital is no longer about deploying new technologies. Rather, it's integration of insights, strategy, design, technology and industry knowledge to create new capabilities that can distinguish a client in a market. We've invested heavily over the past several years in building a true leading world-class and achievement, which has now begun to become well-recognized in the market. 
Second, there's a growing realization that there's a difference between doing digital and being digital. For example, clients understand that the mobile enablement of an enterprise app, while necessary, is not sufficient to take on digital disruptors in the industry. Digital transformation requires a fundamental change, not just glides front-office capabilities but across their entire business and technology architectures in both their mid- and back offices to create nimble, efficient and innovative ways to meet customer demands. Given the existing infrastructure investments of our enterprise clients, we believe that the winning model for many is a hybrid model, combining aspects of their heritage or legacy infrastructure with new digital technologies. This belief is core to our strategy going forward. Our intimate knowledge of core business and legacy infrastructure and business processes across our clients' mid- and back offices combined with our leading edge digital capabilities as required in the front office give us a highly differentiated offering and a value proposition in the market today. 
Finally, to drive for getting continued efficiencies from existing IT infrastructure to be able to fund innovation projects remains absolutely essential to almost every client. This in turn leads to demand for more automation, simplified application development methods, process efficiencies, platform-based solutions and industry utilities. Our strong vertical presence and investments in building sharply-focused industry-specific platforms allow clients to obtain these efficiencies by shifting from buying a service to buying an outcome. These trends will continue to open opportunities for us over the coming years. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Raj to provide additional details on our business performance."

I'm delighted to be here today, and we look forward to interacting more with the investment community going forward. Let me now provide some additional color on our performance across industries and geographies.
Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 5.1% sequentially, 8.1% year-over-year. As expected, Banking and Financial Services returned to positive sequential growth in Q2. Due to the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and a prolonged low interest rate environment, we expect spending within banking to be sluggish during the second half of 2016 and revenue for our BFS segment to be up slightly sequentially for Q3 and Q4.
Within our insurance practice, demand remains solid, particularly for solutions, which help transform the claims and underwriting processes and deliver greater efficiencies, increasingly through managed services or other outcome-based arrangements. In addition, we've seen an increasing demand for solutions, which help clients rationalize and transform their infrastructure landscape. 
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients grew 4.9% sequentially and 6.9% year-over-year. The industry consolidation among several of our largest U.S. payers continues to weigh on our health care payer practice. However, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the payer segment as the industry embarks in a fundamental change in the business model. This is driven by the Affordable Care Act, a changing regulatory environment, consumerization of healthcare and increased focus on medical costs. In this rapidly changing environment, it is critical that payers have solutions in place that can both drive efficiencies and adapt to ongoing regulatory and technology changes.
We're able to offer clients solutions through our combined TriZetto software with Cognizant services. Last quarter, we spoke about a large healthcare deal that we launched with EmblemHealth, leveraging the TriZetto platform. This program continues to ramp up as expected.
Moving on to our Life Science business. We saw strong demand in the quarter driven by a trend towards multiservice line deals, leveraging cloud technologies and platforms as well as advanced data analytics. As drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, we expect this to drive demand in our Life Sciences projects.
Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 4.4% sequentially and 14.2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in manufacturing and logistics. We're seeing growing demand for solutions, which leverage our ability to integrate multiple service lines as front end digital technologies, such as IoT, are being scaled and integrated across the organization. We are building deeper partnerships with many of our manufacturing clients by proposing innovative solutions, which harness the power of data from connected products to help them optimize their product portfolios, addressing key business problems and driving new sources of revenue growth.
For example, our client, one of the world's largest auto manufacturers, is rolling out the deployment of telematics across all new cars by next year. As you know, telematics track the variety of items relative to driving, including maintenance, driver safety and road emergencies. While the client is looking to enhance its relationship with its customers, they're also concerned with the risk associated with the rollout of this new digital technology at an enterprise scale. Cognizant will combine its design, technology and business process expertise to create a scalable solution that manages both customer satisfaction and helps run the transaction processing and telematics operations efficiently. Additionally, we will leverage predictive analytics to anticipate issues and create valuable insight to support future product development. 
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 8.1% sequentially and 11.2% year-over-year driven by both telecom and technology clients as we continue to expand our range of services.
Let me now quickly turn to our Horizon 2 service lines, cognizant Business Consulting, Infrastructure Services and Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 strategy has worked with all 3 service lines, having reached a critical mass at a combined $3 billion run rate and continuing to grow faster than the company average. These services are an integral part of the digital platform and next generation IT solutions we are building out for our clients. 
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 5.1% sequentially and 8.3% year-over-year. Europe was up 4.1% sequentially and 8.9% over last year after a 2.9% negative currency impact. Growth in Europe was driven primarily by the ramp-up of work with recent wins, particularly in markets such as Germany and the Nordics. The U.K. grew 4% sequentially and 4.4% year-over-year, and Continental Europe grew 4.4% sequentially and 15.5% over the prior year. Finally, we saw continued traction in the rest of the world, which is -- which was up 10.8% sequentially and 25. -- 25% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in the key markets such as Singapore, India and Australia. 
With that, I'll turn over the call to Karen."

Second quarter revenue of $3.37 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of almost $170 million or 5.2% sequentially. Revenue increased by 9.2% year-over-year, including a negative currency impact of $25 million or 80 basis points.
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related expenses was 20.3%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. This positions us well to absorb our compensation increases, which will take effect during the third quarter.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.87 was also above our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.82 due to a slightly lower tax rate and stronger operating margins.
During the quarter, we executed a onetime remittance of cash from India to the U.S. and to other international markets. This will provide additional financial flexibility in funding our strategic investments to drive long-term growth for Cognizant. 
Let me provide you some additional color on this transaction. In May, our India subsidiary received approval to repurchase stock worth $2.8 billion from certain of its shareholders, which are non-Indian Cognizant entities. This repurchase resulted in a onetime remittance of $1 billion to the U.S. net of taxes with the other $1.6 billion to other non-India overseas locations. This buyback also resulted in a onetime tax impact of $190 million in the second quarter with approximately $24 million incremental tax impact expected in each of the third and fourth quarters this year. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.31 per share impact on our Q2 GAAP EPS but was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the nonrecurring nature of this transaction.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.5% and 42.5% of revenue respectfully for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 4.6% sequentially and 9.3% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 6.2% sequentially and 9.1% from Q2 a year ago.
During the second quarter, 37.6% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts. And as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 315. 
We added 11,300 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 17.1% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 200 basis points from the year-ago period. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 244,300 employees globally, of which 229,400 were service delivery staff. Offshore utilization was 73%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was 79% and on-site utilization was 91% during the quarter.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by $30 million from the quarter ending March 31. In addition to a payment of $134 million for withholding taxes related to the aforementioned share repurchase of our India subsidiary, we also paid down $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver during the quarter. Our cash and short-term investments net of debt were up by $1.1 billion from the year-ago period.
Moving on to receivables, which were $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO including unbilled receivables of 74 days. This is flat with last quarter and up from 72 days in Q2 of 2015. Our unbilled receivables balance was $451 million, up from $432 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 55% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $909 million at the end of the quarter. There were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated $360 million, financing activities were $143 million use of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were $75 million during the quarter. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased just over 840,000 shares for a total cost of $50 million and our diluted share count decreased to 608.8 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had repurchased 46.3 million shares for a total cost of $1.9 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. Our Board of Directors has approved an increase of the company's stock repurchase program by $1 billion from $2 billion to $3 billion and an extension of the program until December 31, 2018. This reflects our confidence in our business and our commitment to driving shareholder value. 
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3, and the full year. And the week since Brexit, there have been significant fluctuations in global exchange rates, and particularly the British pound, which has declined 12% versus the U.S. dollar since June 23, and 14% year-over-year. The guidance that we provide is based on the exchange rates of that time, which we're providing the guidance and does not consider potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year. 
For the full year 2016, we have revised our revenue expectation to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.6 billion, which represents growth of approximately 8.5% to 9.5%. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.43 billion to $3.47 billion. During the third quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.82 to $0.85. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition related expenses and amortization. For the remainder of the year, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the India share buyback transaction. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 610 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 30.5%, including an approximate $24 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance. 
For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 610.2 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 36%, including an approximate $238 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance.

I think looking at percentage growth rate is only one part of the equation because that doesn't adjust for size of organization. I think a very interesting number to look at in that context is incremental dollars added. If you look, for example, this quarter, we added to close to $170 million of incremental revenue in the quarter.

In terms of regulatory approvals, EmblemHealth's really best positioned to discuss regulatory requirements for their business, but from our perspective, for the work we're doing for them, we've obtained all the necessary approvals to move ahead with our work. When we look more broadly at health care and end to end solutions, we're seeing a lot of interest in the market. And the reason why is health plans are under tremendous pressure right now to keep rate reductions as low as possible, and we can really help them with that, with the regulatory compliance, with not having to make investments on their own. So we're seeing increasing interest as we roll out our healthcare platform-based solutions. We talked about 2 big deals this year, one of them obviously, we just discussed. The other one continue to move along. I think in terms of when it will close, that's probably towards the very end of the year. But since we talked last 3 months ago and I looked at the pipeline of activities, that continues to increase very nicely. Obviously, that will be revenue for next year. But as -- we just recently sat down and did a review of our Healthcare strategy, and we concluded, we really have identified a market with the need and it's based on the changing dynamics in the industry and based on the unique capabilities that Cognizant has with the combination of the leading healthcare administration platform and just incredible domain expertise and technical expertise. So we feel really good about Healthcare over the medium- to long-term. Obviously, there are specific payers in the M&A process that are headwind in the short term."

The platform business that I spoke about, we think there's a tremendous potential to take the success we've seen in Healthcare to all of our other industries -- on the other industry groups that we serve. I would say that the TriZetto experience has been ahead of anything that we would've imagined it to be. We've ramped up TriZetto faster than we anticipated when we did the acquisition, and I think that gives us a sense of confidence that the model works, that we can execute against the model so there's opportunity to take that to other industries. And then, of course, the third area is so-called NexGen IT where we can, as Raj said, we continue to feel like there's opportunities for us as our clients face tough macro environment for us to continue to optimize and bringing new ways and innovative ways for them to be more efficient in how they run IT. So that's sort of where I think our focus is in the medium term. If you look at over the very long run, clearly, our objective is to build -- to continue to build out in the non-Healthcare and financial services parts of the economy. So if you look at our manufacturing and logistics business, that's been doing well. We'll continue to invest there, both inorganically and organically. And I would say over the very long run, this business needs to have a reasonable representation of our revenue coming from the sources of global GDP.

We look at acquisitions for industry expertise, we look at acquisitions for geographic footprint, and we look at acquisitions for service line and technology capability. We are doing -- we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities in the digital space. These all tend to be smaller tuck-in acquisitions. We also have a nice pipeline of opportunities in the consulting space across industries as well as strength in our geographic footprint, particularly in Europe. So what I think you'll see is you'll see a pickup in the pace of acquisitions, but I'll be clear. These continue to be small, tuck-in acquisitions. We're getting really good at integrating these and capturing the value from acquisitions. We have that -- we really have that down to a science now. So we've expanded the team in these areas, but the core Cognizant growth will continue to be organic. But when we look at where acquisitions can supplement our capabilities and make us strong in the market, we'll clearly do that. And then, the final thing just to comment on is platform acquisitions. There, we'll look at those absolutely. We did the TriZetto acquisition almost 2 years ago. And platforms, certainly, you have to make sure if you're going to do a platform acquisition, you get enough that have a base to build off of. So those probably won't be as consistent or steady, but we'll certainly look at opportunities because we know in particular areas, we want to be a leader in platforms. Now some of that will be we build it ourselves. Some of it is we'll partner with customers and take their systems and commercialize them and some like TriZetto will be we'll go out and buy a leader in the market. So you'll see all that happen. But certainly, in the tuck unders, you'll see a pickup in the pace."

If anything, I would characterize IT budgets as flat to moderately up over time. There may -- in some clients, as we said in our prepared comments, there might be sort of short-term pressure. Discretionary spending gets put off because of something going on in the macro. But as a big picture, I don't see any evidence that says that budgets are down. I would characterize them as flat to up. I think if you look inside of that and unpack it a little bit, there is a shift going on. We are seeing the clients looking to be more efficient, drive better total cost of ownership on what I consider to be run the business kind of activities so that they can redeploy them into the change the business or digital or cloud kinds of activities. I think that, that shift benefits IT services firms, frankly. When you look at the landscape on digital, that technology landscape in digital is very fragmented. There are no clear leaders in digital right now in the technology landscape from an underlying stack standpoint. And so, that requires almost every digital deployment to be a -- requires it to have very heavy integration kinds of work. And so, when you look at the digital landscape, there's a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done, both from an upfront strategy, design, human sciences standpoint to envision the future with the client, but then equally importantly, on the downstream, build, integrate, test, deploy, all of that creates tremendous opportunities for services firms. So I think that net-net, there's a shift going on. Budgets aren't shrinking meaningfully. There's a shift going on inside of budgets and I think firms that have capabilities on both sides they, what we've been calling run the business and change the business or run better, run different sides of the business, really stand the benefit from that migration."

What happens with the interest rate environment for our Financial Services clients will be a very important because Financial Services clients know they have to spend a lot on innovation but are under tremendous cost pressure right now. That's both in insurance and banking. The pace of which we actually close these new end-to-end services deals will be important. All those can be big drivers or big variables in revenue growth for next year. It's just too early to know.

Obviously, as Gordon said earlier to one of the earlier questions, it's premature for us to comment specifically on 2017. But what I will say is that we continue to remain very optimistic about the fundamentals of the industry and of our business. From an industry standpoint, as I've said many times, the key I think factor to look at is the world is becoming more technology intensive, not less technology intensive. Across the industries we serve and also industries where we are less present, more energy and attention is being focused on technology than ever before. Technology has become not just a way of driving efficiency and operational effectiveness for businesses, but it's become a core to most clients' ability to differentiate, to grow revenue and to survive in the marketplace. So given that backdrop, we feel that there's a tremendous opportunity for IT services in general and for Cognizant in particular, given the tremendous investment that we've been making. We feel that the investments that we've made in the digital, on the front end, process and platforms in the middle office and our next-generation IT services in the back end really positions us well. And I'll just finish by saying that we feel that the portfolio of businesses that we have, whether you look at the industry portfolio or the exposure we have in different geographies in the world represent some of the most progressive and advanced users of digital technologies. And so, we feel that the fundamentals remain strong as we look to the medium term.

Thanks for joining us today.

Thanks for joining us today. Our Q2 revenue was $3.37 billion, up 5.2% from Q1 and 9.2% from a year ago and was within our guided range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion.
Against the backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment -- market environment and a slow start to the year, we executed well last quarter, and we continue to gain market share. The quarterly sequential dollar growth was one of the strongest in our history as we added incremental revenues of almost $170 million. This performance represented broad-based growth across service lines, geographies and industries.
As we had anticipated, after a slow start in Q1, our Financial Services and Healthcare segments turned in positive sequential growth in Q2. As we entered the second half of the year, we see certain macroeconomic factors as well as some softness in clients' discretionary spending that will affect our revenue growth, primarily for Financial Services and Healthcare clients. Additionally, we anticipate a further negative revenue impact of approximately $40 million for the second half of the year due to the weakening of the pound sterling following the Brexit vote. For these reasons, we're revising our full year revenue growth guidance to a range of $13.47 billion to $13.6 billion while maintaining our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance within a range of $3.32 to $3.44. 
Gordon, Raj and Karen will expand more on the cyclical weakness that we're facing in the short term. As you listen to their comments, I'd like to emphasize that the medium- to long-term fundamentals of our business are strong. We continue to see significant market opportunity and more importantly, gain market share. Digital transformation continues to be a strong driver for demand as clients look for new solutions that allow them to defend their businesses against digital disruptors while innovating to create new areas of growth and differentiation. Given this context, we continue to invest in 3 strategic areas based on the conviction that true digital transformation requires businesses to make fundamental changes throughout their organizations from the front office through the middle office and to the back office systems. These 3 areas will provide the framework for how we think about growing our business going forward.
The first strategic initiative is to help our clients build new front-end capabilities enabled by digital technologies that create personalized experiences for their customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. Clients recognize our strong digital capabilities, having called out the trend in SMAC over 5 years ago. We continue to see great success in building out our digital capabilities through investing organically as well as through select acquisitions. We just announced the acquisition of Idea Couture, which will become part of Cognizant Digital Works. As you will recall, Cognizant Digital Works brings together human insight, strategy, design, technology and industry expertise to create innovative solutions at enterprise scale to help clients succeed in this new digital economy. Idea Couture is a digital innovation firm that operates at the intersection of strategy and technology and specializes in designing and prototyping products, services and business models for growth and competitive advantage. Idea Culture serves some of the largest firms in the world, including Samsung, ConAgra Foods and Pepsi. This was our sixth investment in the digital space, building on prior acquisitions of Cadient, KBACE, itaas and Odecee in addition to our recent strategic investment in ReD Associates. Collectively, we have deployed over $200 million in capital across these digital investments.
The second strategic initiative is to drive new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the core transaction processing operations of our clients by building platform-based solutions and industry utilities. These solutions are offered to clients in a Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, model that allows clients to shift from buying a service to buying an outcome. We've developed a number of platform-based solutions across our industry practices, and the result of these investments is best illustrated by our significant progress in the health care vertical, where we've been able to successfully combine TriZetto software with Cognizant's technology and operations capabilities. Since our TriZetto acquisition, we have signed several large platform-based deals with a combined TCV, or total contract value, approaching $2 billion, including the program at EmblemHealth that we spoke about last quarter. And we're pursuing a number of additional similar opportunities in the market.
The third strategic initiative is to transform clients' existing IT systems and infrastructure to next-generation IT to help them harness the potential from digital technologies. This includes the simplification of how applications are developed and delivered, along with the standardization of the IT infrastructure to ensure simplicity and flexibility at an appropriate cost. We're making good progress in each of these areas, and we're confident that this framework will differentiate our services and solutions in the marketplace now and in the future.
In closing, I'd like to emphasize that we've been through periods of market volatility in the past. While macroeconomic factors such as what we experienced this quarter are not within our control, we're confident that we will execute well through this cycle and continue to gain market share.
So with that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss the current demand environment, to Raj to discuss our business performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. Gordon?"

I'd like to start by providing some additional context on the specific short-term headwinds that are leading us to revise this year's revenue guidance.First, as we indicated on our last 2 earnings calls, d",844,"Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start by providing some additional context on the specific short-term headwinds that are leading us to revise this year's revenue guidance.
First, as we indicated on our last 2 earnings calls, discretionary spending in the banking sector remained soft, weighed down by macroeconomic concerns and a prolonged low interest rate environment. While we did see a return to healthy sequential growth in the second quarter, we expect banking discretionary spending during the second half of 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] to be slower than we anticipated 3 months ago. Complicating the situation, of course, is the uncertainty arising from the Brexit vote in the U.K. Economic growth forecasts and short to medium-term interest rate projections have generally been revised down since the vote. Given this new development, we see the banking sector being more cautious in spending over the near term. And therefore, we believe it is prudent to err on the side of caution in banking financial services revenue planning for the remainder of this year.
Second, the sharp weakening of the pound sterling will have a negative impact on our second quarter revenue of approximately $40 million, assuming the currency holds at current levels. As you know, the pound sterling has seen a 12% depreciation since the Brexit vote.
Third, as we indicated to you at the beginning of this year, consolidation within the U.S. health care industry has impacted the revenue growth of our health care practice. Given the status of the M&A regulatory approval process, we anticipate that project spending will continue to slow for clients involved in these consolidations for the remainder of the year.
Finally, we're also seeing customer pullback on discretionary spending in other pockets of our business. For example, some clients within our information services practice are taking a more moderate approach to spending as we go into the back half of the year.
While we're taking a cautious approach to our revenue expectations for the remainder of 2016, we believe that the medium- to long-term outlook for our business remains as strong as ever. The pipeline is healthy, and we continue to make investments in skills and capabilities that will help us meet our clients' evolving need to simultaneously run better and run different. 
I'd like to take a moment to outline 3 trends that are driving client demand and our optimism for the medium- and long-term outlook for our business. You'll see that these trends are the basis for the investment areas that Frank described a few moments ago. First, in the shift to digital, there's a greater sense of urgency among CxOs to build new innovative models to drive revenue growth and create differentiation in the market. I see this in almost every client meeting I attend regardless of industry. These conversations have evolved from a discussion of SMAC, which is now table stakes, to the exploration and execution in areas, such as artificial intelligence, IoT ecosystems, augmented reality, adaptive manufacturing and block chain, just to name a few. Digital is no longer about deploying new technologies. Rather, it's an integration of insight, strategy, design, technology and industry knowledge to create new capabilities that can distinguish a client in a market. We've invested heavily over the past several years in building a true leading world-class digital capabilities, an achievement which has now begun to become well recognized in the market. 
Second, there's a growing realization that there's a difference between doing digital and being digital. For example, clients understand that the mobile enablement of an enterprise app, while necessary, is not sufficient to take on digital disruptors in their industry. Digital transformation requires a fundamental change not just to the clients' front-office capabilities, but across their entire business and technology architectures in both their mid- and back offices to create nimble, efficient and innovative ways to meet customer demands. Given the existing infrastructure investments of our enterprise clients, we believe that the winning model for many is a hybrid model, combining aspects of their heritage or legacy infrastructure with new digital technologies. This belief is core to our strategy going forward. Our intimate knowledge of core business and legacy infrastructure and business processes across our clients' mid- and back offices, combined with our leading-edge digital capabilities as required in the front office, give us a highly differentiated offering and a value proposition in the market today. 
Finally, the drive for getting continued efficiencies from existing IT infrastructure to be able to fund innovation projects remains absolutely essential to almost every client. This, in turn, leads to a demand for more automation, simplified application development methods, process efficiencies, platform-based solutions and industry utilities. Our strong vertical presence and investments in building sharply focused industry-specific platforms allow clients to obtain these efficiencies by shifting from buying a service to buying an outcome. These trends will continue to open opportunities for us over the coming years. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Raj to provide additional details on our business performance."

I'm delighted to be here today and look forward to interacting more with the investment community going forward. Let me now provide some additional color on our performance across industries and geographies.
Our banking and Financial Services segment was up 5.1% sequentially, 8.1% year-over-year. As expected, banking and Financial Services returned to positive sequential growth in Q2. Due to the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and a prolonged low interest rate environment, we expect spending within banking to be sluggish during the second half of 2016 and revenue for our BFS segment to be up slightly sequentially for Q3 and Q4.
Within our insurance practice, demand remains solid, particularly for solutions which help transform the claims and underwriting processes and deliver greater efficiencies increasingly through managed services or other outcome-based arrangements. In addition, we've seen an increasing demand for solutions, which help clients rationalize and transform their infrastructure landscape. 
Our healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 4.9% sequentially and 6.9% year-over-year. The industry consolidation among several of our largest U.S. payers continues to weigh on our health care payer practice. However, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the payer segment as the industry embarks on a fundamental change in the business model. This is driven by the Affordable Care Act, a changing regulatory environment, consumerization of health care and increased focus on medical cost. In this rapidly changing environment, it is critical that payers have solutions in place that can both drive efficiencies and adapt to ongoing regulatory and technological changes.
We're able to offer clients such solutions through our combined TriZetto software with Cognizant services. Last quarter, we spoke about a large health care deal that we launched with EmblemHealth leveraging the TriZetto platform. This program continues to ramp up as expected.
Moving on to our Life Science business. We saw strong demand in the quarter, driven by a trend towards multiservice line deals, leveraging cloud technologies and platforms as well as advanced data analytics. As drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, we expect this to drive demand in our Life Sciences practice.
Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 4.4% sequentially and 14.2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in manufacturing and logistics. We're seeing growing demand for solutions, which leverage our ability to integrate multiple service lines as front-end digital technologies, such as IoT, are being scaled and integrated across the organization. We are building deeper partnerships with many of our manufacturing clients by proposing innovative solutions, which harness the power of data from connected products to help them optimize their product portfolios, addressing key business problems and driving new sources of revenue growth.
For example, our client, one of the world's largest auto manufacturers, is rolling out the deployment of telematics across all new cars by next year. As you know, telematics tracks the variety of items relative to driving, including maintenance, driver safety and road emergencies. While the client is looking to enhance its relationship with its customers, they are also concerned with the risk associated with the rollout of this new digital technology at an enterprise scale. Cognizant will combine its design, technology and business process expertise to create a scalable solution that manages both customer satisfaction and helps run the transaction processing and telematics operations efficiently. Additionally, we will leverage predictive analytics to anticipate issues and create valuable insight to support future product development. 
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 8.1% sequentially and 11.2% year-over-year, driven by both telecom and technology clients as we continue to expand our range of services.
Let me now quickly turn to our Horizon 2 service lines, Cognizant Business Consulting, Infrastructure Services and Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 strategy has worked with all 3 service lines, having reached a critical mass at a combined $3 billion run rate and continuing to grow faster than the company average. These services are an integral part of the digital platform and next-generation IT solutions we are building out for our clients. 
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 5.1% sequentially and 8.3% year-over-year. Europe was up 4.1% sequentially and 8.9% over last year after a 2.9% negative currency impact. Growth in Europe was driven primarily by the ramp-up of work with recent wins, particularly in markets such as Germany and the Nordics. The U.K. grew 4% sequentially and 4.4% year-over-year, and Continental Europe grew 4.4% sequentially and 15.5% over the prior year. 
Finally, we saw continued traction in the rest of the world, which is -- which was up 10.8% sequentially and 25 point -- 25% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in the key markets such as Singapore, India and Australia. 
With that, I'll turn over the call to Karen."

Second quarter revenue of $3.37 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of almost $170 million or 5.2% sequentially. Revenue increased by 9.2% year-over-year, including a negative currency impact of $25 million or 80 basis points.
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 20.3%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. This positions us well to absorb our compensation increases, which will take effect during the third quarter.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.87 was also above our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.82 due to a slightly lower tax rate and stronger operating margins.
During the quarter, we executed a onetime remittance of cash from India to the U.S. and to other international markets. This will provide additional financial flexibility in funding our strategic investments to drive long-term growth for Cognizant. 
Let me provide you some additional color on this transaction. In May, our India subsidiary received approval to repurchase stock worth $2.8 billion from certain of its shareholders, which are non-Indian Cognizant entities. This repurchase resulted in a onetime remittance of $1 billion to the U.S. net of taxes, with the other $1.6 billion to other non-India overseas locations. This buyback also resulted in a onetime tax impact of $190 million in the second quarter, with approximately $24 million incremental tax impact expected in each of the third and fourth quarters this year. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.31 per share impact on our Q2 GAAP EPS but was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the nonrecurring nature of this transaction.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.5% and 42.5% of revenue, respectfully, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 4.6% sequentially and 9.3% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 6.2% sequentially and 9.1% from Q2 a year ago.
During the second quarter, 37.6% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts. And as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 315. 
We added 11,300 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 17.1% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 200 basis points from the year ago period. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 244,300 employees globally, of which 229,400 were service delivery staff. 
Offshore utilization was 73%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was 79%. And on-site utilization was 91% during the quarter.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by $30 million from the quarter ending March 31. In addition to a payment of $134 million for withholding taxes related to the aforementioned share repurchase of our India subsidiary, we also paid down the $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver during the quarter. Our cash and short-term investments net of debt were up by $1.1 billion from the year ago period.
Moving on to receivables, which were $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 74 days. This is flat with last quarter and up from 72 days in Q2 of 2015. Our unbilled receivables balance was $451 million, up from $432 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 55% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $909 million at the end of the quarter. There were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated $360 million. Financing activities were $143 million use of cash during the quarter. And capital expenditures were $75 million during the quarter. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased just over 840,000 shares for a total cost of $50 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 608.8 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had repurchased 46.3 million shares for a total cost of $1.9 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. Our Board of Directors has approved an increase of the company's stock repurchase program by $1 billion from $2 billion to $3 billion and an extension of the program until December 31, 2018. This reflects our confidence in our business and our commitment to driving shareholder value. 
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full year. In the weeks since Brexit, there have been significant fluctuations in global exchange rates and particularly, the British pound, which has declined 12% versus the U.S. dollar since June 23 and 14% year-over-year. The guidance that we provide is based on the exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not consider potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year. 
For the full year 2016, we have revised our revenue expectation to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.6 billion, which represents growth of approximately 8.5% to 9.5%. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.43 billion to $3.47 billion. 
During the third quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.82 to $0.85. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. For the remainder of the year, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the India share buyback transaction. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 610 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 30.5%, including an approximate $24 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance. 
For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 610.2 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 36%, including an approximate $238 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance.

So that sort of thing is tough to predict. Obviously, some of the uncertainty around the U.S. elections create some uncertainty. In terms of structural things for us, the business, when you think about digital and so forth, tends to be more -- a little bit more project-oriented, but those are swings we go back and forth on. So I wouldn't argue that there's any long-term structural change in the ability to predict the business. Short term, there is a bit."

I think looking at percentage growth rate is only one part of the equation because that doesn't adjust for size of organization. I think a very interesting number to look at in that context is incremental dollars added. If you look, for example, this quarter, we added close to $170 million of incremental revenue in the quarter. And so if you, in a sense, think about that as being a proxy for market share gain, I think it tells the story that supports our thesis, that we can continue to grow and take market share ahead of competition by investing in the business."

In terms of regulatory approvals, Emblem is really best positioned to discuss regulatory requirements for their business. But from our perspective, for the work we're doing for them, we've obtained all the necessary approvals to move ahead with our work. When we look more broadly at health care and end-to-end solutions, we're seeing a lot of interest in the market. And the reason why is health plans are under tremendous pressure right now to keep rate reductions as low as possible, and we can really help them with that in -- with the regulatory compliance, with not having to make investments on their own. So we're seeing increasing interest as we roll out our health care platform-based solutions. We talked about 2 big deals this year. One of them, obviously, we just discussed. The other one continues to move along. I think in terms of when it will close, we're -- that's probably towards the very end of the year. But since we talked last 3 months ago and I look at the pipeline of activities, that continues to increase very nicely. Obviously, that will be revenue for next year. But as -- we just recently sat down and did a review of our healthcare strategy, and we concluded we really have identified a market with a need in it based on the changing dynamics in the industry and based on the unique capabilities that Cognizant has with the combination of the leading health care administration platform and just incredible domain expertise and technical expertise. So we feel really good about health care over the medium to long term. Obviously, there are specific payers in the M&A process that are a headwind in the short term."

It takes us -- it takes time to put all of these pieces together, but we think long term, that's a good opportunity for us to continue to drive synergy. But more importantly, I think in the financial services sector, we're seeing great traction right now in digital, especially around customer experience and the data analytics behind that. In addition to that, many of our clients now are looking at the private cloud, and we're helping many of these large financial services customers in that effort.

Digital is a macro theme that I think has a lot of wings -- a lot of wind under the -- under its wings. I think we should -- we will continue to invest organically and inorganically. The platforms business that I spoke about, we think there's a tremendous potential to take the success we've seen in health care to all of our other industries -- all of the other industry groups that we serve. I would say that the TriZetto experience has been ahead of anything that we would've imagined it to be. It's -- we've ramped up TriZetto faster than we anticipated when we did the acquisition, and I think that gives us a sense of confidence that the model works, that we can execute against the model, so there's opportunity to take that to other industries. And then, of course, the third area is so-called next-gen IT, where we can, as Raj said, we continue to feel like there's opportunities for us as our clients face tough macro environments for us to continue to optimize and bring new ways and innovative ways for them to be more efficient in how they run IT. So that's sort of where I think our focus is in the medium term. If you look at it over the very long run, clearly, our objective is to build -- to continue to build out in the non-health care and financial services parts of the economy. So if you look at our manufacturing and logistics business, that's been doing well. We will continue to invest there, both inorganically and organically. And I would say, over the very long run, this business needs to have a reasonable representation of our revenue coming from the sources of global GDP. And so we have to continue to shift the business model. But that -- obviously, that's not something that happens overnight. That's a 5- to 10-year journey."

We also have a nice pipeline of opportunities in the consulting space across industries as well as strength in our geographic footprint, particularly in Europe. So what I think you'll see is you'll see a pickup in the pace of acquisitions. But I want to be clear. These continue to be small tuck-in acquisitions. We're getting really good at integrating these and capturing the value from acquisitions. We have that down -- we really have that down to a science now. So we've expanded the team in these areas, but the core Cognizant growth will continue to be organic. But when we look at where acquisitions can supplement our capabilities to make us stronger in the market, we'll clearly do that. And then the final thing just to comment on is platform acquisitions. There, we'll look at those absolutely. We did the TriZetto acquisition almost 2 years ago. And platforms, certainly, you have to make sure, if you're going to do a platform acquisition, you get enough that -- you have a base to build off of. So those probably won't be as consistent or steady, but we'll certainly look at opportunities because we know in particular areas, we want to be a leader in platforms. Now some of that will be we build it ourselves. Some of it is we'll partner with customers and take their systems and commercialize them. And some like TriZetto will be we'll go out and buy a leader in the market. So you'll see all that happen. But certainly, in the tuck-unders, you'll see a pickup in the pace."

If anything, I would characterize IT budgets as flat to moderately up over time. There may -- in some clients, as we said in our prepared comments, there might be sort of short-term pressure. Discretionary spending gets put off because of something going on in the macro. But as a big picture, I don't see any evidence that says that budgets are down. I would characterize them as flat to up. I think if you look inside of that and unpack it a little bit, there is a shift going on. We are seeing the clients looking to be more efficient, drive better total cost of ownership on what I consider to be the run-the-business kind of activity so that they can redeploy them into the change the business or digital or cloud kinds of activity. I think that, that shift benefits IT services firms, frankly. When you look at the landscape on digital, the technology landscape in digital is very fragmented. There are no clear leaders in digital right now in the technology landscape from an underlying stack standpoint. And so that requires almost every digital deployment to be a -- requires it to have very heavy integration kinds of work. And so when you look at the digital landscape, there's a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done, both from an upfront strategy, design, human sciences standpoint to envision the future with the client, but then equally importantly, on the downstream, build, integrate, test, deploy. All of that creates tremendous opportunities for services firms. So I think that net-net, there's a shift going on. Budgets aren't shrinking meaningfully. There's a shift going on inside of budgets. And I think firms that have capabilities on both sides, they -- what we've been calling run the business and change the business or run better, run different sides of the business really stand to benefit from that migration."

So we wanted to make sure we adjusted it enough that we're well positioned for any additional surprises that may happen because of uncertainty around the elections, Brexit and so forth. So we wanted to be conservative when we cut. So we cut just once or at least, just this one additional time."

Obviously, as Gordon said earlier to one of the earlier questions, it's premature for us to comment specifically on 2017. But what I will say is that we continue to remain very optimistic about the fundamentals of the industry and of our business. From an industry standpoint, as I've said many times, the key, I think, factor to look at is that the world is becoming more technology intensive, not less technology intensive. Across the industries we serve and also industries where we are less present, more energy and attention is being focused on technology than ever before. Technology has become not just a way of driving efficiency and operational effectiveness for businesses, but it's become a core to most clients' ability to differentiate, to grow revenue and to survive in the marketplace. So given that backdrop, we feel that there's a tremendous opportunity for IT services in general and for Cognizant in particular, given the tremendous investments that we've been making. We feel that the investments that we've made in the digital, on the front end, process and platforms in the middle office and our next-generation IT services in the back end really positions us well. And I'll just finish by saying that we feel that the portfolio of businesses that we have, whether you look at the industry portfolio or the exposure we have in different geographies in the world, represent some of the most progressive and advanced users of digital technologies. And so we feel that the fundamentals remain strong as we look to the medium term. 
So on that note, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. Thank you very much for your questions. And as always, we all look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

Thanks for joining us today. Our Q2 revenue was $3.37 billion, up 5.2% from Q1 and 9.2% from a year ago and was within our guided range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion.
Against a backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment and market environment and a slow start to the year, we executed well last quarter, and we continue to gain market share. The quarterly sequential dollar growth was one of the strongest in our history as we added incremental revenues of almost $170 million. This performance represented broad-based growth across service lines, geographies and industries.
As we had anticipated, after a slow start in Q1, our Financial Services and Healthcare segments turned in positive sequential growth in Q2. As we entered the second half of the year, we see certain macroeconomic factors as well as some softness in clients' discretionary spending that will affect our revenue growth, primarily for Financial Services and Healthcare clients. Additionally, we anticipate a further negative revenue impact of approximately $40 million for the second half of the year due to the weakening of the pound sterling following the Brexit vote. For these reasons, we're revising our full year revenue growth guidance to a range of $13.47 billion to $13.6 billion while maintaining our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance within a range of $3.32 to $3.44. 
Gordon, Raj and Karen will expand more on the cyclical weakness that we're facing in the short term. As you listen to their comments, I'd like to emphasize that the medium- to long-term fundamentals of our business are strong. We continue to see significant market opportunity and more importantly, gain market share. Digital transformation continues to be a strong driver for demand as clients look for new solutions that allow them to defend their businesses against digital disruptors while innovating to create new areas of growth and differentiation. Given this context, we continue to invest in 3 strategic areas based on the conviction that true digital transformation requires businesses to make fundamental changes throughout their organizations from the front office, through the middle office and to the back office systems. These 3 areas will provide the framework for how we think about growing our business going forward.
The first strategic initiative is to help our clients build new front-end capabilities enabled by digital technologies that create personalized experiences for their customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. Clients recognize our strong digital capabilities, having called out the trend in SMAC over 5 years ago. We continue to see great success in building out our digital capabilities through investing organically as well as through select acquisitions. We just announced the acquisition of Idea Couture, which will become part of Cognizant Digital Works. As you will recall, Cognizant Digital Works brings together human insight, strategy, design, technology and industry expertise to create innovative solutions at enterprise scale to help clients succeed in this new digital economy. Idea Couture is a digital innovation firm that operates at the intersection of strategy and technology and specializes in designing and prototyping products, services and business models for growth and competitive advantage. Idea Culture serves some of the largest firms in the world, including Samsung, ConAgra Foods and Pepsi. This was our sixth investment in the digital space, building on prior acquisitions of Cadient, KBACE, itaas and Odecee in addition to our recent strategic investment in ReD Associates. Collectively, we have deployed over $200 million in capital across these digital investments.
The second strategic initiative is to drive new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the core transaction processing operations of our clients by building platform-based solutions and industry utilities. These solutions are offered to clients in a Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, model that allows clients to shift from buying a service to buying an outcome. We've developed a number of platform-based solutions across our industry practices, and the result of these investments is best illustrated by our significant progress in the health care vertical, where we've been able to successfully combine TriZetto software with Cognizant's technology and operations capabilities. Since our TriZetto acquisition, we have signed several large platform-based deals with a combined TCV, or total contract value, approaching $2 billion, including the program at EmblemHealth that we spoke about last quarter. And we're pursuing a number of additional similar opportunities in the market.
The third strategic initiative is to transform clients' existing IT systems and infrastructure to next-generation IT to help them harness the potential from digital technologies. This includes the simplification of how applications are developed and delivered, along with the standardization of the IT infrastructure to ensure simplicity and flexibility at an appropriate cost. We're making good progress in each of these areas, and we're confident that this framework will differentiate our services and solutions in the marketplace now and in the future.
In closing, I'd like to emphasize that we've been through periods of market volatility in the past. While macroeconomic factors such as what we experienced this quarter are not within our control, we're confident that we will execute well through this cycle and continue to gain market share.
So with that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss the current demand environment, to Raj to discuss our business performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. Gordon?"
386024,374878260,1027092,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start by providing some additional context on the specific short-term headwinds that are leading us to revise this year's revenue guidance.First, as we indicated on our last 2 earnings calls, d",843,"Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start by providing some additional context on the specific short-term headwinds that are leading us to revise this year's revenue guidance.
First, as we indicated on our last 2 earnings calls, discretionary spending in the banking sector remains soft, weighed down by macroeconomic concerns and a prolonged low interest rate environment. While we did see a return to healthy sequential growth in the second quarter, we expect banking discretionary spending during the second half of 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] to be slower than we anticipated 3 months ago. Complicating the situation, of course, is the uncertainty arising from the Brexit vote in the U.K. Economic growth forecasts and short to medium-term interest rate projections have generally been revised down since the vote. Given this new development, we see the banking sector being more cautious in spending over the near term. And therefore, we believe it is prudent to err on the side of caution in banking and financial services revenue planning for the remainder of this year.
Second, the sharp weakening of the pound sterling will have a negative impact on our second quarter revenue of approximately $40 million, assuming the currency holds at current levels. As you know, the pound sterling has seen a 12% depreciation since the Brexit vote.
Third, as we indicated to you at the beginning of this year, consolidation within the U.S. health care industry has impacted the revenue growth of our health care practice. Given the status of the M&A regulatory approval process, we anticipate that project spending will continue to slow for clients involved in these consolidations for the remainder of the year.
Finally, we're also seeing customer pullback on discretionary spending in other pockets of our business. For example, some clients within our information services practice are taking a more moderate approach to spending as we go into the back half of the year.
While we're taking a cautious approach to our revenue expectations for the remainder of 2016, we believe that the medium- to long-term outlook for our business remains as strong as ever. The pipeline is healthy, and we continue to make investments in skills and capabilities that will help us meet our clients' evolving need to simultaneously run better and run different. 
I'd like to take a moment to outline 3 trends that are driving client demand and our optimism for the medium- and long-term outlook for our business. You'll see that these trends are the basis for the investment areas that Frank described a few moments ago. First, in the shift to digital, there's a greater sense of urgency among CxOs to build new innovative models to drive revenue growth and create differentiation in the market. I see this in almost every client meeting I attend regardless of industry. These conversations have evolved from a discussion of SMAC, which is now table stakes, to the exploration and execution in areas such as artificial intelligence, IoT ecosystems, augmented reality, adaptive manufacturing and block chain, just to name a few. Digital is no longer about deploying new technologies. Rather, it's an integration of insight, strategy, design, technology and industry knowledge to create new capabilities that can distinguish a client in a market. We've invested heavily over the past several years in building true, leading, world-class digital capabilities, an achievement which has now begun to become well recognized in the market. 
Second, there's a growing realization that there's a difference between doing digital and being digital. For example, clients understand that the mobile enablement of an enterprise app, while necessary, is not sufficient to take on digital disruptors in their industry. Digital transformation requires a fundamental change not just to the clients' front-office capabilities, but across their entire business and technology architectures in both their mid- and back offices to create nimble, efficient and innovative ways to meet customer demands. Given the existing infrastructure investments of our enterprise clients, we believe that the winning model for many is a hybrid model, combining aspects of their heritage or legacy infrastructure with new digital technologies. This belief is core to our strategy going forward. Our intimate knowledge of core business and legacy infrastructure and business processes across our clients' mid- and back offices, combined with our leading-edge digital capabilities, as required in the front office, give us a highly differentiated offering and value proposition in the market today. 
Finally, the drive for getting continued efficiencies from existing IT infrastructure to be able to fund innovation projects remains absolutely essential to almost every client. This, in turn, leads to a demand for more automation, simplified application development methods, process efficiencies, platform-based solutions and industry utilities. Our strong vertical presence and investments in building sharply focused industry-specific platforms allow clients to obtain these efficiencies by shifting from buying a service to buying an outcome. These trends will continue to open opportunities for us over the coming years. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Raj to provide additional details on our business performance."

I'm delighted to be here today and look forward to interacting more with the investment community going forward. Let me now provide some additional color on our performance across industries and geographies.
Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 5.1% sequentially and 8.1% year-over-year. As expected, Banking and Financial Services returned to positive sequential growth in Q2. Due to the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and the prolonged low interest rate environment, we expect spending within banking to be sluggish during the second half of 2016 and revenue for our BFS segment to be up slightly sequentially for Q3 and Q4.
Within our insurance practice, demand remains solid, particularly for solutions which help transform the claims and underwriting processes and deliver greater efficiencies increasingly through managed services or other outcome-based arrangements. In addition, we've seen an increasing demand for solutions which help clients rationalize and transform their infrastructure landscape. 
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 4.9% sequentially and 6.9% year-over-year. The industry consolidation among several of our largest U.S. payers continues to weigh on our health care payer practice. However, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the payer segment as the industry embarks on a fundamental change in the business model. This is driven by the Affordable Care Act, a changing regulatory environment, consumerization of health care and increased focus on medical cost. In this rapidly changing environment, it is critical that payers have solutions in place that can both drive efficiencies and adapt to ongoing regulatory and technological changes.
We're able to offer clients such solutions through our combined TriZetto software with Cognizant services. Last quarter, we spoke about a large health care deal that we launched with EmblemHealth leveraging the TriZetto platform. This program continues to ramp up as expected.
Moving on to our Life Science business. We saw strong demand in the quarter, driven by a trend towards multiservice line deals, leveraging cloud technologies and platforms as well as advanced data analytics. As drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, we expect this to drive demand in our Life Sciences practice.
Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 4.4% sequentially and 14.2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in manufacturing and logistics. We're seeing growing demand for solutions, which leverage our ability to integrate multiple service lines as front-end digital technologies, such as IoT, are being scaled and integrated across the organization. We are building deeper partnerships with many of our manufacturing clients by proposing innovative solutions which harness the power of data from connected products to help them optimize their product portfolios, addressing key business problems and driving new sources of revenue growth.
For example, our client, one of the world's largest auto manufacturers, is rolling out the deployment of telematics across all new cars by next year. As you know, telematics tracks a variety of items relative to driving, including maintenance, driver safety and road emergencies. While the client is looking to enhance its relationship with its customers, they are also concerned with the risks associated with the rollout of this new digital technology at an enterprise scale. Cognizant will combine its design, technology and business process expertise to create a scalable solution that manages both customer satisfaction and helps run their transaction processing and telematics operations efficiently. Additionally, we will leverage predictive analytics to anticipate issues and create valuable insight to support future product development. 
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 8.1% sequentially and 11.2% year-over-year, driven by both telecom and technology clients as we continue to expand our range of services.
Let me now quickly turn to our Horizon 2 service lines, Cognizant Business Consulting, Infrastructure Services and Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 strategy has worked with all 3 service lines, having reached a critical mass at a combined $3 billion run rate and continuing to grow faster than the company average. These services are an integral part of the digital platform and next-generation IT solutions we are building out for our clients. 
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 5.1% sequentially and 8.3% year-over-year. Europe was up 4.1% sequentially and 8.9% over last year after a 2.9% negative currency impact. Growth in Europe was driven primarily by the ramp-up of work with recent wins, particularly in markets such as Germany and the Nordics. The U.K. grew 4% sequentially and 4.4% year-over-year, and Continental Europe grew 4.4% sequentially and 15.5% over the prior year. 
Finally, we saw continued traction in the rest of the world, which is -- which was up 10.8% sequentially and 25 point -- 25% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in the key markets such as Singapore, India and Australia. 
With that, I'll turn over the call to Karen."

Second quarter revenue of $3.37 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of almost $170 million or 5.2% sequentially. Revenue increased by 9.2% year-over-year, including a negative currency impact of $25 million or 80 basis points.
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 20.3%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. This positions us well to absorb our compensation increases, which will take effect during the third quarter.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.87 was also above our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.82 due to a slightly lower tax rate and stronger operating margins.
During the quarter, we executed a onetime remittance of cash from India to the U.S. and to other international markets. This will provide additional financial flexibility in funding our strategic investments to drive long-term growth for Cognizant. 
Let me provide you some additional color on this transaction. In May, our India subsidiary received approval to repurchase stock worth $2.8 billion from certain of its shareholders, which are non-Indian Cognizant entities. This repurchase resulted in a onetime remittance of $1 billion to the U.S. net of taxes, with the other $1.6 billion to other non-India overseas locations. This buyback also resulted in a onetime tax impact of $190 million in the second quarter, with approximately $24 million incremental tax impact expected in each of the third and fourth quarters this year. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.31 per share impact on our Q2 GAAP EPS but was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the nonrecurring nature of this transaction.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.5% and 42.5% of revenue, respectfully, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 4.6% sequentially and 9.3% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 6.2% sequentially and 9.1% from Q2 a year ago.
During the second quarter, 37.6% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts. And as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 315. 
We added 11,300 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 17.1% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 200 basis points from the year ago period. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 244,300 employees globally, of which 229,400 were service delivery staff. 
Offshore utilization was 73%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was 79%. And on-site utilization was 91% during the quarter.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by $30 million from the quarter ending March 31. In addition to a payment of $134 million for withholding taxes related to the aforementioned share repurchase of our India subsidiary, we also paid down the $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver during the quarter. Our cash and short-term investments net of debt were up by $1.1 billion from the year ago period.
Moving on to receivables, which were $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 74 days. This is flat with last quarter and up from 72 days in Q2 of 2015. Our unbilled receivables balance was $451 million, up from $432 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 55% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $909 million at the end of the quarter. There were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated $360 million. Financing activities were a $143 million use of cash during the quarter. And capital expenditures were $75 million during the quarter. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased just over 840,000 shares for a total cost of $50 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 608.8 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had repurchased 46.3 million shares for a total cost of $1.9 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. Our Board of Directors has approved an increase of the company's stock repurchase program by $1 billion from $2 billion to $3 billion and an extension of the program until December 31, 2018. This reflects our confidence in our business and our commitment to driving shareholder value. 
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full year. In the weeks since Brexit, there have been significant fluctuations in global exchange rates and particularly, the British pound, which has declined 12% versus the U.S. dollar since June 23 and 14% year-over-year. The guidance that we provide is based on the exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not consider potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year. 
For the full year 2016, we have revised our revenue expectation to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.6 billion, which represents growth of approximately 8.5% to 9.5%. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.43 billion to $3.47 billion. 
During the third quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.82 to $0.85. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. For the remainder of the year, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the India share buyback transaction. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 610 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 30.5%, including an approximate $24 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance. 
For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 610.2 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 36%, including an approximate $238 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance.

So that sort of thing is tough to predict. Obviously, some of the uncertainty around the U.S. elections creates some uncertainty. In terms of structural things for us, the business, when you think about digital and so forth, tends to be more -- a little bit more project-oriented, but those are swings we go back and forth on.

I think looking at percentage growth rates is only one part of the equation because that doesn't adjust for size of organization. I think a very interesting number to look at in that context is incremental dollars added. If you look, for example, this quarter, we added close to $170 million of incremental revenue in the quarter. And so if you, in a sense, think about that as being a proxy for market share gain, I think it tells the story that supports our thesis, that we can continue to grow and take market share ahead of competition by investing in the business."

When we look more broadly at health care and end-to-end solutions, we're seeing a lot of interest in the market. And the reason why is health plans are under tremendous pressure right now to keep rate reductions as low as possible, and we can really help them with that, with the regulatory compliance, with not having to make investments on their own. So we're seeing increasing interest as we roll out our health care platform-based solutions. We talked about 2 big deals this year. One of them, obviously, we just discussed. The other one continues to move along. I think in terms of when it will close, we're -- that's probably towards the very end of the year. But since we talked last, 3 months ago, and I look at the pipeline of activities, that continues to increase very nicely. Obviously, that will be revenue for next year. But as -- we just recently sat down and did a review of our healthcare strategy, and we concluded we really have identified a market with a need in it based on the changing dynamics in the industry and based on the unique capabilities that Cognizant has with the combination of the leading health care administration platform and just incredible domain expertise and technical expertise.

The platforms business that I spoke about, we think there's a tremendous potential to take the success we've seen in health care to all of our other industries -- all of the other industry groups that we serve. I would say that the TriZetto experience has been ahead of anything that we would've imagined it to be. It's -- we've ramped up TriZetto faster than we anticipated when we did the acquisition and I think that gives us a sense of confidence that the model works, that we can execute against the model, so there's opportunity to take that to other industries. And then, of course, the third area is so-called next-gen IT, where we can, as Raj said, we continue to feel like there's opportunities for us, as our clients face tough macro environments, for us to continue to optimize and bring new ways and innovative ways for them to be more efficient in how they run IT. So that's sort of where I think our focus is in the medium term. If you look at it over the very long run, clearly, our objective is to build -- to continue to build out in the non-health care and financial services parts of the economy. So if you look at our manufacturing and logistics business, that's been doing well. We'll continue to invest there, both inorganically and organically. And I would say, over the very long run, this business needs to have a reasonable representation of our revenue coming from the sources of global GDP.

We're getting really good at integrating these and capturing the value from acquisitions. We have that down -- we really have that down to a science now. So we've expanded the team in these areas, but the core Cognizant growth will continue to be organic. But when we look at where acquisitions can supplement our capabilities and make us stronger in the market, we'll clearly do that. And the final thing just to comment on is platform acquisitions. There, we'll look at those, absolutely. We did the TriZetto acquisition almost 2 years ago. And platforms, certainly, you have to make sure, if you're going to do a platform acquisition, you get enough that you have a base to build off of. So those probably won't be as consistent or steady, but we'll certainly look at opportunities because we know in particular areas, we want to be a leader in platforms. Now some of that will be we build it ourselves. Some of it is we'll partner with customers and take their systems and commercialize them. And some like TriZetto will be we'll go out and buy a leader in the market. So you'll see all that happen. But certainly, in the tuck-unders, you'll see a pickup in the pace."

And so when you look at the digital landscape, there's a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done, both from an upfront strategy, design, human sciences standpoint to envision the future with the client, but then equally importantly, on the downstream: build, integrate, test, deploy. All of that creates tremendous opportunities for services firms. So I think that net-net, there's a shift going on. Budgets aren't shrinking meaningfully. There's a shift going on inside of budgets. And I think firms that have capabilities on both sides, they -- what we've been calling run the business and change the business or run better, run different sides of the business really stand to benefit from that migration."

Certainly, what happens with health care M&A, that's one piece. What happens with the interest rate environment for our financial services clients will be very important because financial services clients know they have to spend a lot on innovation but are under tremendous cost pressure right now. That's both in insurance and banking. The pace of which we actually close these new end-to-end services deals will be important, and all those can be big drivers -- or big variables in revenue growth for next year. It's just too early to know. I think the election will have some impact, general macroeconomic trends and then some regulatory stuff. But as we've all mentioned, when we look at the medium- and long-term prospects for the business, we remain very bullish. We -- this strategy of looking to front, middle and back office and really building up our capabilities to serve clients across all 3 of those dimensions, I think is going to position us very well.

Obviously, as Gordon said earlier to one of the earlier questions, it's premature for us to comment specifically on 2017. But what I will say is that we continue to remain very optimistic about the fundamentals of the industry and of our business. From an industry standpoint, as I've said many times, the key, I think, factor to look at is that the world is becoming more technology intensive, not less technology intensive. Across the industries we serve and also industries where we are less present, more energy and attention is being focused on technology than ever before. Technology has become not just a way of driving efficiency and operational effectiveness for businesses but it's become a core to most clients' ability to differentiate, to grow revenue and to survive in the marketplace. So given that backdrop, we feel that there's a tremendous opportunity for IT services in general and for Cognizant in particular, given the tremendous investments that we've been making. We feel that the investments that we've made in the digital, on the front end, process and platforms in the middle office and our next-generation IT services in the back end really positions us well. And I'll just finish by saying that we feel that the portfolio of businesses that we have, whether you look at the industry portfolio or the exposure we have to different geographies in the world, represent some of the most progressive and advanced users of digital technologies. And so we feel that the fundamentals remain strong as we look to the medium term.

Thanks for joining us today. Our Q2 revenue was $3.37 billion, up 5.2% from Q1 and 9.2% from a year ago and was within our guided range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion.
Against a backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment and market environment and a slow start to the year, we executed well last quarter, and we continue to gain market share. The quarterly sequential dollar growth was one of the strongest in our history as we added incremental revenues of almost $170 million. This performance represented broad-based growth across service lines, geographies and industries.
As we had anticipated, after a slow start in Q1, our Financial Services and Healthcare segments turned in positive sequential growth in Q2. As we entered the second half of the year, we see certain macroeconomic factors as well as some softness in clients' discretionary spending that will affect our revenue growth, primarily for Financial Services and Healthcare clients. Additionally, we anticipate a further negative revenue impact of approximately $40 million for the second half of the year due to the weakening of the pound sterling following the Brexit vote. For these reasons, we're revising our full year revenue growth guidance to a range of $13.47 billion to $13.6 billion while maintaining our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance within a range of $3.32 to $3.44. 
Gordon, Raj and Karen will expand more on the cyclical weakness that we're facing in the short term. As you listen to their comments, I'd like to emphasize that the medium- to long-term fundamentals of our business are strong. We continue to see significant market opportunity and more importantly, gain market share. Digital transformation continues to be a strong driver for demand as clients look for new solutions that allow them to defend their businesses against digital disruptors while innovating to create new areas of growth and differentiation. Given this context, we continue to invest in 3 strategic areas based on the conviction that true digital transformation requires businesses to make fundamental changes throughout their organizations from the front office, through the middle office and to the back office systems. These 3 areas will provide the framework for how we think about growing our business going forward.
The first strategic initiative is to help our clients build new front-end capabilities enabled by digital technologies that create personalized experiences for their customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. Clients recognize our strong digital capabilities, having called out the trend in SMAC over 5 years ago. We continue to see great success in building out our digital capabilities through investing organically as well as through select acquisitions. We just announced the acquisition of Idea Couture, which will become part of Cognizant Digital Works. As you will recall, Cognizant Digital Works brings together human insight, strategy, design, technology and industry expertise to create innovative solutions at enterprise scale to help clients succeed in this new digital economy. Idea Couture is a digital innovation firm that operates at the intersection of strategy and technology and specializes in designing and prototyping products, services and business models for growth and competitive advantage. Idea Culture serves some of the largest firms in the world, including Samsung, ConAgra Foods and Pepsi. This was our sixth investment in the digital space, building on prior acquisitions of Cadient, KBACE, itaas and Odecee in addition to our recent strategic investment in ReD Associates. Collectively, we have deployed over $200 million in capital across these digital investments.
The second strategic initiative is to drive new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the core transaction processing operations of our clients by building platform-based solutions and industry utilities. These solutions are offered to clients in a Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, model that allows clients to shift from buying a service to buying an outcome. We've developed a number of platform-based solutions across our industry practices, and the result of these investments is best illustrated by our significant progress in the health care vertical, where we've been able to successfully combine TriZetto software with Cognizant's technology and operations capabilities. Since our TriZetto acquisition, we have signed several large platform-based deals with a combined TCV, or total contract value, approaching $2 billion, including the program at EmblemHealth that we spoke about last quarter. And we're pursuing a number of additional similar opportunities in the market.
The third strategic initiative is to transform clients' existing IT systems and infrastructure to next-generation IT to help them harness the potential from digital technologies. This includes the simplification of how applications are developed and delivered, along with the standardization of the IT infrastructure to ensure simplicity and flexibility at an appropriate cost. We're making good progress in each of these areas, and we're confident that this framework will differentiate our services and solutions in the marketplace now and in the future.
In closing, I'd like to emphasize that we've been through periods of market volatility in the past. While macroeconomic factors such as what we experienced this quarter are not within our control, we're confident that we will execute well through this cycle and continue to gain market share.
So with that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss the current demand environment, to Raj to discuss our business performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. Gordon?"
386024,374878260,1028051,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start by providing some additional context on the specific short-term headwinds that are leading us to revise this year's revenue guidance.First, as we indicated on our last 2 earnings calls, d",843,"Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to start by providing some additional context on the specific short-term headwinds that are leading us to revise this year's revenue guidance.
First, as we indicated on our last 2 earnings calls, discretionary spending in the banking sector remains soft, weighed down by macroeconomic concerns and a prolonged low interest rate environment. While we did see a return to healthy sequential growth in the second quarter, we expect banking discretionary spending during the second half of 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] to be slower than we anticipated 3 months ago. Complicating the situation, of course, is the uncertainty arising from the Brexit vote in the U.K. Economic growth forecasts and short to medium-term interest rate projections have generally been revised down since the vote. Given this new development, we see the banking sector being more cautious in spending over the near term. And therefore, we believe it is prudent to err on the side of caution in banking and financial services revenue planning for the remainder of this year.
Second, the sharp weakening of the pound sterling will have a negative impact on our second quarter revenue of approximately $40 million, assuming the currency holds at current levels. As you know, the pound sterling has seen a 12% depreciation since the Brexit vote.
Third, as we indicated to you at the beginning of this year, consolidation within the U.S. health care industry has impacted the revenue growth of our health care practice. Given the status of the M&A regulatory approval process, we anticipate that project spending will continue to slow for clients involved in these consolidations for the remainder of the year.
Finally, we're also seeing customer pullback on discretionary spending in other pockets of our business. For example, some clients within our information services practice are taking a more moderate approach to spending as we go into the back half of the year.
While we're taking a cautious approach to our revenue expectations for the remainder of 2016, we believe that the medium- to long-term outlook for our business remains as strong as ever. The pipeline is healthy, and we continue to make investments in skills and capabilities that will help us meet our clients' evolving need to simultaneously run better and run different. 
I'd like to take a moment to outline 3 trends that are driving client demand and our optimism for the medium- and long-term outlook for our business. You'll see that these trends are the basis for the investment areas that Frank described a few moments ago. First, in the shift to digital, there's a greater sense of urgency among CxOs to build new innovative models to drive revenue growth and create differentiation in the market. I see this in almost every client meeting I attend regardless of industry. These conversations have evolved from a discussion of SMAC, which is now table stakes, to the exploration and execution in areas such as artificial intelligence, IoT ecosystems, augmented reality, adaptive manufacturing and block chain, just to name a few. Digital is no longer about deploying new technologies. Rather, it's an integration of insight, strategy, design, technology and industry knowledge to create new capabilities that can distinguish a client in a market. We've invested heavily over the past several years in building true, leading, world-class digital capabilities, an achievement which has now begun to become well recognized in the market. 
Second, there's a growing realization that there's a difference between doing digital and being digital. For example, clients understand that the mobile enablement of an enterprise app, while necessary, is not sufficient to take on digital disruptors in their industry. Digital transformation requires a fundamental change not just to the clients' front-office capabilities, but across their entire business and technology architectures in both their mid- and back offices to create nimble, efficient and innovative ways to meet customer demands. Given the existing infrastructure investments of our enterprise clients, we believe that the winning model for many is a hybrid model, combining aspects of their heritage or legacy infrastructure with new digital technologies. This belief is core to our strategy going forward. Our intimate knowledge of core business and legacy infrastructure and business processes across our clients' mid- and back offices, combined with our leading-edge digital capabilities, as required in the front office, give us a highly differentiated offering and value proposition in the market today. 
Finally, the drive for getting continued efficiencies from existing IT infrastructure to be able to fund innovation projects remains absolutely essential to almost every client. This, in turn, leads to a demand for more automation, simplified application development methods, process efficiencies, platform-based solutions and industry utilities. Our strong vertical presence and investments in building sharply focused industry-specific platforms allow clients to obtain these efficiencies by shifting from buying a service to buying an outcome. These trends will continue to open opportunities for us over the coming years. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Raj to provide additional details on our business performance."

I'm delighted to be here today and look forward to interacting more with the investment community going forward. Let me now provide some additional color on our performance across industries and geographies.
Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 5.1% sequentially and 8.1% year-over-year. As expected, Banking and Financial Services returned to positive sequential growth in Q2. Due to the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and the prolonged low interest rate environment, we expect spending within banking to be sluggish during the second half of 2016 and revenue for our BFS segment to be up slightly sequentially for Q3 and Q4.
Within our insurance practice, demand remains solid, particularly for solutions which help transform the claims and underwriting processes and deliver greater efficiencies increasingly through managed services or other outcome-based arrangements. In addition, we've seen an increasing demand for solutions which help clients rationalize and transform their infrastructure landscape. 
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 4.9% sequentially and 6.9% year-over-year. The industry consolidation among several of our largest U.S. payers continues to weigh on our health care payer practice. However, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the payer segment as the industry embarks on a fundamental change in the business model. This is driven by the Affordable Care Act, a changing regulatory environment, consumerization of health care and increased focus on medical cost. In this rapidly changing environment, it is critical that payers have solutions in place that can both drive efficiencies and adapt to ongoing regulatory and technological changes.
We're able to offer clients such solutions through our combined TriZetto software with Cognizant services. Last quarter, we spoke about a large health care deal that we launched with EmblemHealth leveraging the TriZetto platform. This program continues to ramp up as expected.
Moving on to our Life Science business. We saw strong demand in the quarter, driven by a trend towards multiservice line deals, leveraging cloud technologies and platforms as well as advanced data analytics. As drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, we expect this to drive demand in our Life Sciences practice.
Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 4.4% sequentially and 14.2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in manufacturing and logistics. We're seeing growing demand for solutions, which leverage our ability to integrate multiple service lines as front-end digital technologies, such as IoT, are being scaled and integrated across the organization. We are building deeper partnerships with many of our manufacturing clients by proposing innovative solutions which harness the power of data from connected products to help them optimize their product portfolios, addressing key business problems and driving new sources of revenue growth.
For example, our client, one of the world's largest auto manufacturers, is rolling out the deployment of telematics across all new cars by next year. As you know, telematics tracks a variety of items relative to driving, including maintenance, driver safety and road emergencies. While the client is looking to enhance its relationship with its customers, they are also concerned with the risks associated with the rollout of this new digital technology at an enterprise scale. Cognizant will combine its design, technology and business process expertise to create a scalable solution that manages both customer satisfaction and helps run their transaction processing and telematics operations efficiently. Additionally, we will leverage predictive analytics to anticipate issues and create valuable insight to support future product development. 
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 8.1% sequentially and 11.2% year-over-year, driven by both telecom and technology clients as we continue to expand our range of services.
Let me now quickly turn to our Horizon 2 service lines, Cognizant Business Consulting, Infrastructure Services and Business Process Services. Our Horizon 2 strategy has worked with all 3 service lines, having reached a critical mass at a combined $3 billion run rate and continuing to grow faster than the company average. These services are an integral part of the digital platform and next-generation IT solutions we are building out for our clients. 
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 5.1% sequentially and 8.3% year-over-year. Europe was up 4.1% sequentially and 8.9% over last year after a 2.9% negative currency impact. Growth in Europe was driven primarily by the ramp-up of work with recent wins, particularly in markets such as Germany and the Nordics. The U.K. grew 4% sequentially and 4.4% year-over-year, and Continental Europe grew 4.4% sequentially and 15.5% over the prior year. 
Finally, we saw continued traction in the rest of the world, which is -- which was up 10.8% sequentially and 25 point -- 25% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in the key markets such as Singapore, India and Australia. 
With that, I'll turn over the call to Karen."

Second quarter revenue of $3.37 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of almost $170 million or 5.2% sequentially.

Second quarter revenue of $3.37 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of almost $170 million or 5.2% sequentially. Revenue increased by 9.2% year-over-year, including a negative currency impact of $25 million or 80 basis points.
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 20.3%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. This positions us well to absorb our compensation increases, which will take effect during the third quarter.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.87 was also above our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.82 due to a slightly lower tax rate and stronger operating margins.
During the quarter, we executed a onetime remittance of cash from India to the U.S. and to other international markets. This will provide additional financial flexibility in funding our strategic investments to drive long-term growth for Cognizant. 
Let me provide you some additional color on this transaction. In May, our India subsidiary received approval to repurchase stock worth $2.8 billion from certain of its shareholders, which are non-Indian Cognizant entities. This repurchase resulted in a onetime remittance of $1 billion to the U.S. net of taxes, with the other $1.6 billion to other non-India overseas locations. This buyback also resulted in a onetime tax impact of $190 million in the second quarter, with approximately $24 million incremental tax impact expected in each of the third and fourth quarters this year. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.31 per share impact on our Q2 GAAP EPS but was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the nonrecurring nature of this transaction.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.5% and 42.5% of revenue, respectfully, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 4.6% sequentially and 9.3% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 6.2% sequentially and 9.1% from Q2 a year ago.
During the second quarter, 37.6% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts. And as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 315. 
We added 11,300 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 17.1% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 200 basis points from the year ago period. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 244,300 employees globally, of which 229,400 were service delivery staff. 
Offshore utilization was 73%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was 79%. And on-site utilization was 91% during the quarter.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by $30 million from the quarter ending March 31. In addition to a payment of $134 million for withholding taxes related to the aforementioned share repurchase of our India subsidiary, we also paid down the $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver during the quarter. Our cash and short-term investments net of debt were up by $1.1 billion from the year ago period.
Moving on to receivables, which were $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 74 days. This is flat with last quarter and up from 72 days in Q2 of 2015. Our unbilled receivables balance was $451 million, up from $432 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 55% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $909 million at the end of the quarter. There were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated $360 million. Financing activities were a $143 million use of cash during the quarter. And capital expenditures were $75 million during the quarter. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased just over 840,000 shares for a total cost of $50 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 608.8 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had repurchased 46.3 million shares for a total cost of $1.9 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion. Our Board of Directors has approved an increase of the company's stock repurchase program by $1 billion from $2 billion to $3 billion and an extension of the program until December 31, 2018. This reflects our confidence in our business and our commitment to driving shareholder value. 
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full year. In the weeks since Brexit, there have been significant fluctuations in global exchange rates and particularly, the British pound, which has declined 12% versus the U.S. dollar since June 23 and 14% year-over-year. The guidance that we provide is based on the exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not consider potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year. 
For the full year 2016, we have revised our revenue expectation to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.6 billion, which represents growth of approximately 8.5% to 9.5%. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.43 billion to $3.47 billion. 
During the third quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.82 to $0.85. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. For the remainder of the year, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the India share buyback transaction. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 610 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 30.5%, including an approximate $24 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance. 
For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.44. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 610.2 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 36%, including an approximate $238 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance.

So that sort of thing is tough to predict. Obviously, some of the uncertainty around the U.S. elections creates some uncertainty. In terms of structural things for us, the business, when you think about digital and so forth, tends to be more -- a little bit more project-oriented, but those are swings we go back and forth on. So I wouldn't argue that there's any long-term structural change in the ability to predict the business. Short term, there is a bit."

I think, certainly, we will look to continue to drive growth both organically and inorganically. As we've said, we clearly look to increase the volume of M&A transactions that we're doing. We continue to believe there is significant opportunity in the market for us to grow and continue to take market share.

I think looking at percentage growth rates is only one part of the equation because that doesn't adjust for size of organization. I think a very interesting number to look at in that context is incremental dollars added. If you look, for example, this quarter, we added close to $170 million of incremental revenue in the quarter. And so if you, in a sense, think about that as being a proxy for market share gain, I think it tells the story that supports our thesis, that we can continue to grow and take market share ahead of competition by investing in the business."

When we look more broadly at health care and end-to-end solutions, we're seeing a lot of interest in the market. And the reason why is health plans are under tremendous pressure right now to keep rate reductions as low as possible, and we can really help them with that, with the regulatory compliance, with not having to make investments on their own. So we're seeing increasing interest as we roll out our health care platform-based solutions. We talked about 2 big deals this year. One of them, obviously, we just discussed. The other one continues to move along. I think in terms of when it will close, we're -- that's probably towards the very end of the year. But since we talked last, 3 months ago, and I look at the pipeline of activities, that continues to increase very nicely. Obviously, that will be revenue for next year. But as -- we just recently sat down and did a review of our healthcare strategy, and we concluded we really have identified a market with a need in it based on the changing dynamics in the industry and based on the unique capabilities that Cognizant has with the combination of the leading health care administration platform and just incredible domain expertise and technical expertise.

I would say that we continue to -- I would say, if you look at the medium term, the playbook is to really build out the 3 broad areas that I spoke about. Digital is a macro theme that I think has a lot of wings -- a lot of wind under the -- under its wings. I think we should -- we will continue to invest organically and inorganically. The platforms business that I spoke about, we think there's a tremendous potential to take the success we've seen in health care to all of our other industries -- all of the other industry groups that we serve. I would say that the TriZetto experience has been ahead of anything that we would've imagined it to be. It's -- we've ramped up TriZetto faster than we anticipated when we did the acquisition and I think that gives us a sense of confidence that the model works, that we can execute against the model, so there's opportunity to take that to other industries. And then, of course, the third area is so-called next-gen IT, where we can, as Raj said, we continue to feel like there's opportunities for us, as our clients face tough macro environments, for us to continue to optimize and bring new ways and innovative ways for them to be more efficient in how they run IT. So that's sort of where I think our focus is in the medium term. If you look at it over the very long run, clearly, our objective is to build -- to continue to build out in the non-health care and financial services parts of the economy. So if you look at our manufacturing and logistics business, that's been doing well. We'll continue to invest there, both inorganically and organically. And I would say, over the very long run, this business needs to have a reasonable representation of our revenue coming from the sources of global GDP. And so we have to continue to shift the business model. But obviously, that's not something that happens overnight. That's a 5- to 10-year journey."

We also have a nice pipeline of opportunities in the consulting space across industries as well as strength in our geographic footprint, particularly in Europe. So what I think you'll see is you'll see a pickup in the pace of acquisitions. But I want to be clear. These continue to be small tuck-in acquisitions. We're getting really good at integrating these and capturing the value from acquisitions. We have that down -- we really have that down to a science now. So we've expanded the team in these areas, but the core Cognizant growth will continue to be organic. But when we look at where acquisitions can supplement our capabilities and make us stronger in the market, we'll clearly do that. And the final thing just to comment on is platform acquisitions. There, we'll look at those, absolutely. We did the TriZetto acquisition almost 2 years ago. And platforms, certainly, you have to make sure, if you're going to do a platform acquisition, you get enough that you have a base to build off of. So those probably won't be as consistent or steady, but we'll certainly look at opportunities because we know in particular areas, we want to be a leader in platforms. Now some of that will be we build it ourselves. Some of it is we'll partner with customers and take their systems and commercialize them. And some like TriZetto will be we'll go out and buy a leader in the market. So you'll see all that happen. But certainly, in the tuck-unders, you'll see a pickup in the pace."

If anything, I would characterize IT budgets as flat to moderately up over time. There may -- in some clients, as we said in our prepared comments, there might be sort of short-term pressure. Discretionary spending gets put off because of something going on in the macro. But as a big picture, I don't see any evidence that says that budgets are down. I would characterize them as flat to up. I think if you look inside of that and unpack it a little bit, there is a shift going on. We are seeing the clients looking to be more efficient, drive better total cost of ownership on what I consider to be the run-the-business kind of activity so that they can redeploy them into the change the business or digital or cloud kinds of activities. I think that, that shift benefits IT services firms, frankly. When you look at the landscape on digital, the technology landscape in digital is very fragmented. There are no clear leaders in digital right now in the technology landscape from an underlying stack standpoint. And so that requires almost every digital deployment to be a -- requires it to have very heavy integration kinds of work. And so when you look at the digital landscape, there's a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done, both from an upfront strategy, design, human sciences standpoint to envision the future with the client, but then equally importantly, on the downstream: build, integrate, test, deploy. All of that creates tremendous opportunities for services firms. So I think that net-net, there's a shift going on. Budgets aren't shrinking meaningfully. There's a shift going on inside of budgets. And I think firms that have capabilities on both sides, they -- what we've been calling run the business and change the business or run better, run different sides of the business really stand to benefit from that migration."

Certainly, what happens with health care M&A, that's one piece. What happens with the interest rate environment for our financial services clients will be very important because financial services clients know they have to spend a lot on innovation but are under tremendous cost pressure right now. That's both in insurance and banking. The pace of which we actually close these new end-to-end services deals will be important, and all those can be big drivers -- or big variables in revenue growth for next year. It's just too early to know. I think the election will have some impact, general macroeconomic trends and then some regulatory stuff.

Obviously, as Gordon said earlier to one of the earlier questions, it's premature for us to comment specifically on 2017. But what I will say is that we continue to remain very optimistic about the fundamentals of the industry and of our business. From an industry standpoint, as I've said many times, the key, I think, factor to look at is that the world is becoming more technology intensive, not less technology intensive. Across the industries we serve and also industries where we are less present, more energy and attention is being focused on technology than ever before. Technology has become not just a way of driving efficiency and operational effectiveness for businesses but it's become a core to most clients' ability to differentiate, to grow revenue and to survive in the marketplace. So given that backdrop, we feel that there's a tremendous opportunity for IT services in general and for Cognizant in particular, given the tremendous investments that we've been making. We feel that the investments that we've made in the digital, on the front end, process and platforms in the middle office and our next-generation IT services in the back end really positions us well. And I'll just finish by saying that we feel that the portfolio of businesses that we have, whether you look at the industry portfolio or the exposure we have to different geographies in the world, represent some of the most progressive and advanced users of digital technologies.

Thanks for joining us today. Our Q3 revenue was $3.45 billion, up 2.5% from Q2 and 8.4% from a year ago. This is within our guided range of $3.42 billion to $3.47 billion. These results were driven by growth a",1350,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our Q3 revenue was $3.45 billion, up 2.5% from Q2 and 8.4% from a year ago. This is within our guided range of $3.42 billion to $3.47 billion. These results were driven by growth across all of our industries. This was encouraging given the weakness in the pound sterling and the softness we've seen this year in our Financial Services segment stemming from macroeconomic concerns and in our health care payer segment due to industry consolidation. 
Turning to guidance. We're trimming the high end of our full year revenue expectation and now expect our revenue to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.53 billion. This guidance includes the absorption of an incremental $18 million negative impact due to the recent weakening of the pound sterling. We're tightening our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $3.38 to $3.41. I'll talk more about the business in a moment and why we're well positioned going into 2017. 
I'd like to take a moment to update you on the internal investigation we announced at the end of September. The investigation is focused on payments relating to permits for certain company-owned facilities in India and whether such payments were made improperly and in possible violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws. First, I think it's important to note that we do not anticipate any impact on our ability to continue to provide the quality services our clients expect from us. 
Second, as disclosed in the Form 10-Q we filed this morning, we've identified approximately $5 million in potentially improper payments to date. We've evaluated the effect of such payments and concluded that they are not material and do not require a restatement of our historical financial statements. Karen will provide additional details on this in a few minutes. 
Third and also disclosed this morning, we discovered in the course of the investigation that certain members of senior management may have been aware or participated in the matters under investigation. Any such conduct would be inconsistent with our core values. Based on the results of the investigation to date, those who may have been involved are no longer with the company or in the senior management position. 
Finally, I would like to reaffirm our strong commitment to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We voluntarily disclosed the matters under investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in September, and we've been fully cooperating with both agencies. Based on the results of the investigation to date, we have already started and will continue to enhance our internal controls and compliance programs. 
Let me now turn to the rest of the business. Today and moving forward, what remains most essential to Cognizant's success is our unwavering focus on our clients. Their changing needs are the inspiration for our strategy, and we are actively executing that strategy. As we look ahead, we believe our market opportunity has never been greater. That's because with more technology in every product built and behind every customer experience and more data generated at every turn, our clients' businesses are and will continue to become increasingly technology-intensive. Our opportunity then is to work with these clients to help them win by making the fundamental technology-enabled changes throughout their organizations that are required for them to compete in this new technology and data-intensive world. 
We have spoken to you in past calls about our 3 strategic initiatives designed to enable this kind of work across our clients' businesses from front to back. We recently took an important step in executing this strategy by aligning and branding all our capabilities into 3 practice areas: Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technology. 
Our Cognizant digital business practice works with clients to reshape their products and business models and the resulting impact on how organizations interact with their customers, employees and partners. Our approach combines data science, design thinking and deep industry and process knowledge with solid technology capabilities to unite the physical and virtual aspects of a company's offerings seamlessly across every channel. Together, we identify insights, develop business strategies and design prototype and scale meaningful experiences. 
Our Cognizant digital operations practice helps clients reengineer, digitize, manage and operate their most essential business processes, lowering operating costs, improving user experiences and delivering better outcomes and top line growth. Across the practice, we are creating automated data-driven platforms and industry utilities. We help clients run better by applying traditional optimization levers, and we help them run differently by creating competitive advantage through process excellence, which often leads to more effective operating models and corresponding top line revenue growth. 
And our Cognizant digital systems and technology practice works with clients to simplify, modernize and secure IT infrastructure and applications, unlocking the power trapped in their technology environments. We help clients create and evolve systems that meet their needs in the modern enterprise by delivering industry-leading standards of performance, cost and flexibility. 
Now the names of these practices -- of these practice areas reflect our belief that digital technology must be embedded as an integral part of all our offerings. All 3 practice areas work in close partnership with our vertical and geographic businesses and with Cognizant Business Consulting to ensure tight alignment and market relevance. 
Let me underscore how central this is to what differentiates Cognizant. When we say digital, we're not talking just about building user interfaces or implementing digital marketing, but about creating industry-specific solutions woven deeply into the workings of an organization to create new levels of value enterprise-wide. 
In summary, our clients are finding it unique and differentiating that Cognizant can consult with them to build digital businesses, operations and systems. For example, we're helping insurance companies go beyond managing claims to preventing losses with the power of predictive analytics. We're working with health care companies to bring payers, providers and patients together on an integrated platform that reduces waste and improves health outcomes. And we're helping manufacturers evolve from using stand-alone goods to orchestrating entire ecosystems of smart, connected products. 
But as much as we are focused on the opportunities of today, looking ahead of evolving clients needs is one of Cognizant's core strengths. We continue to develop innovative products and services, part of what you've heard us refer to as our Horizon 3 capabilities, through an internal investment program that powers long-term growth opportunities for Cognizant and our clients. 
First, the Cognizant global technology office identifies the emerging technologies with the potential to create real business value. Then, Cognizant accelerates and scales the most promising technologies, product-izing services solutions and business models and speeding them to market. Together, these teams have spearheaded our entry into SMAC and IoT, for example, and today, they are working to realize the potential of developing technologies like artificial intelligence, block chain and to incubate new IP-based offerings. 
As we plan for 2017 and beyond, in addition to continuing to scale our comprehensive services portfolio, we're expanding our vertical and geographic focus as well. We're seeing increased traction with clients across Continental Europe, Asia Pacific and the public sector who are finding our comprehensive capabilities unique in their markets. In closing, it's clear that, today, our clients realize digital should be an enterprise-wide endeavor and that they need a comprehensive partner like Cognizant capable of working across every aspect of the organization that technology should enrich: business, operations and systems. 
Let me now turn the call over to our new President, Raj Mehta. On our last earnings call, we introduced you to Raj, a long-standing Cognizant leader. He's been a Cognizant associate since 1997, building strong relationships with clients throughout his 20 years at Cognizant and leading many of our market-facing and delivery teams in driving industry-leading growth. Now as President, he has direct responsibility for the overall P&L of Cognizant operations. 
Raj will talk to you about the success we're already having in executing our strategy from his perspective running these businesses. Raj?"

I'm glad to be here and honored to be taking the role of President at this important time in Cognizant's journey. Anyone who has followed the company over the years know that we stand for 3 things: a relentless focus on our clients, making sure we have world-class teams that deliver consistently for them and scaling our capabilities to address new client needs. I know we're succeeding when clients tell me that working with us feels different. As we help clients with the shift they need to make in the digital era, I'm doubling down on the principles that had made us successful so far: client focus, world-class teams and scaling capabilities while maintaining our flexible collaborative way of working. 
In working closely with clients across our industry businesses, we see that they face many of the same underlying challenges. They need to deliver the convenient experiences people expect today across their complex organizations. They need to develop the operational agility to respond to fast-changing business needs. They need to free up dollars to invest in innovation and transformation by optimizing and modernizing their legacy IT systems. 
It's these challenges that our practices, Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technologies, are focused on, helping clients answer. Working closely with the Cognizant Business Consulting and domain experts from our industry businesses, we are creating frameworks, platforms and solutions that clients are finding valuable as they pursue next level of savings and new revenue streams. 
Now I'll review the performance of each of our industry verticals, highlighting key trends and some of the areas we're focusing on with our clients.  Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 1.8% sequentially and 7.1% year-over-year. During Q3, the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and the prolonged low rate interest environment that we have commented on throughout 2016 continue to moderate spending at several of our larger banking clients. Our super regional banking businesses continued to perform well as many of those clients look to us for solutions, which both optimize costs and generate revenue. While we've seen a slowdown in spending in recent months with several of our insurance clients who are also pressured by the low interest rate environment, demand has remained solid over the past year. Clients have been particularly interested in Cognizant digital operations solutions that transform underwriting and claims processes through managed services or other outcome-based delivery models. 
Our health care segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 3.5% sequentially and 5.7% year-over-year. The industry consolidation among several of the largest U.S. payers continues to weigh on our health care payer practice. Still, we remain positive that the fundamental shifts underway in the market will create long-term opportunities. Through solutions from our Cognizant digital operations practice that combine TriZetto software and Cognizant services, we are well positioned to help clients deal effectively with this disruption. 
In our Life Sciences business, demand has picked up steadily over the past year as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. In particular, we're seeing a trend towards multiservice line deals, leveraging analytics, cloud technologies and platforms. 
Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 2.8% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Strength in manufacturing helped to offset ongoing softness in retail. A number of retail clients have moderated their discretionary spending over this past year as consumer spending has been weak. Cognizant digital business has seen growing demand among manufacturing clients who wanted help in transforming the products they make through sensors, IoT and analytics. They're also looking for solutions that increase the productivity of core IT infrastructure and application services. 
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.7% sequentially and 13.6% year-over-year. Last quarter, we highlighted that macroeconomic uncertainty was causing a slowdown in decision-making for our information, media and entertainment clients. This has largely been offset by a rebound in our communications business. 
Let me give you a few examples how Cognizant is partnering with clients in engagements that are pivoting their businesses and shifting their industries in meaningful ways. Let's talk first about KeyBank. Cognizant's partnered with KeyBank on a variety of different initiatives over the past 10 years, assisting in significant projects like the recent integration of their acquisition of First Niagara Bank. Today, KeyBank wants to leverage digital to compete and lead in their category, and they started that journey with Cognizant. We are working together to simplify the way they do business and offer their customers streamlined experiences, financial wellness tools and digital product offers and services. 
Cognizant is helping with the implementation of a transition to the Oracle Banking Platform. As part of our work, we're helping and delivering improved digital experiences on web and mobile interfaces, reengineering business processes and enabling new technology architecture for the bank's retail digital channel. This retail digital channel modernization is the first wave of the transformation, but we'll expand the use of this platform to manage other core processes and to deliver new differentiated services to customers within the coming year. 
Let me tell you about another project we're doing in the manufacturing space, helping a top 5 auto manufacturer change what people expect from their cars. As sales in developed markets plateau, our client is looking to serve new needs of their customers by offering a range of transportation services and solutions. We are their strategic partner, helping to develop a strategy and user experiences and to build the platform that will be the backbone of an evolving new ecosystem of offerings. While this platform will initially focus on areas such as parking, vehicle health and retail and rewards program, the data captured by the platform will eventually be used to model how people will move differently in the future. We will work with our client to develop this and other potential opportunities to expand the services that they offer to their customers. 
Finally, I would like to highlight a growing part of Cognizant digital systems and technology, where our deep knowledge of clients' legacy environments enable us to modernize their IT by migrating to cloud-based solutions, utilizing providers such as AWS. A couple of recent examples. We recently worked with LexisNexis to develop a cloud-based solution on AWS that support search capabilities on a database of over 2 billion searchable documents on their news archive platform. For Sotheby's, we migrated their critical business applications, including their flagship website, from an on-premise data center to AWS. For both clients, this is a major step towards -- for towards the modernization of their IT infrastructure. In future calls, you'll continue to hear more from me about what Cognizant and our clients are focusing on together, how we're building world-class teams to serve them better and how we're scaling our capabilities to meet changing needs. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Karen to discuss our financial performance."
386024,407279165,1077753,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. As Raj mentioned, the business performed within expectations as third quarter revenue of $3.45 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of 2.5% and a year-over-year increase of 8.4%.",1263,"Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. As Raj mentioned, the business performed within expectations as third quarter revenue of $3.45 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of 2.5% and a year-over-year increase of 8.4%. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $24 million or approximately 70 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $42 million or 130 basis points. 
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.3%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 was $0.01 above our guidance range of $0.82 to $0.85. As a reminder, the remittance of cash from India to the U.S. that occurred in the second quarter had an incremental tax impact of $24 million in quarter 3 and is expected to have a similar impact in the fourth quarter. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.04 per share impact on our Q3 GAAP EPS that was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the nonrecurring nature of the transaction. 
Before I provide a detailed commentary on the quarter's performance, let me provide some additional color on the ongoing internal investigation, which is being overseen by our audit committee. As Frank noted, based on the results of the investigation to date, we are not restating our historical financial statements. At present, the investigation has identified a total of approximately $5 million in potentially improper payments for certain company-owned facilities in India. Of that amount, based on the preliminary results of the investigation to date and as disclosed in our Form 10-Q and earnings release, we determined that it was appropriate at this time to record an out-of-period correction of $3.1 million related to certain of these payments. 
Also, as disclosed in the Form 10-Q, we announced a determination of a material weakness as of December 31, 2015, and the subsequent interim period as based on the results of the investigation to date, certain members of senior management may have participated in or failed to take action to prevent the making of potentially improper payments by either overwriting or failing to enforce the controls established by the company relating to real estate and procurement principally in connection with permits for certain facilities in India. We have already taken and continue to take remediation measures in the areas of procurement and accounts payable as they relate to real estate transactions in India. 
Now turning to third quarter performance. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.4% and 42.6% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 2.4% sequentially and 6.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 2.6% sequentially and 10.3% from Q3 a year ago, driven by strength across digital operations and the infrastructure portion of Cognizant digital systems and technology. 
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 3.3% sequentially and 7.9% year-over-year. Europe declined 1.7% sequentially after a 4.4% negative currency impact and grew 5.6% from last year after an 8.3% negative currency impact. Growth in Europe was driven primarily by the ramp-up work coming from recent wins, particularly in markets such as Germany and the Nordics. The U.K. declined 5.7% sequentially and 2.3% year-over-year after a 7% and a 13.9% negative currency impact respectfully. Continental Europe grew 3.5% sequentially and 17% over the prior year. We have established a solid foothold on the continent and expect this to continue to be a driver of future growth. Finally, we saw continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up 3.8% sequentially and 23.2% year-over-year. 
During the third quarter, 37.5% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 322. 
We added 11,500 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 16.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 350 basis points from the year-ago period. While attrition remained slightly elevated, we are pleased with the year-over-year decline as we continue to enhance our various employee engagement initiatives. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 255,800 employees globally, of which 239,500 were service delivery staff. Offshore utilization was 73%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates in our training program was 79%, and on-site utilization was 90% during the quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this was up by $390 million from the quarter ending June 30 and up by $861 million from the year-ago period. 
Moving on to receivables, which were $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 74.5 days. This is roughly flat with last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $424 million, down from $451 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 58% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October, and the decrease in unbilled receivables is primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance is $900 million at the end of the quarter, and there were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. 
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated $594 million. Financing activities were a $119 million use of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were $74 million during the quarter. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased just over 2.5 million shares for a total cost of $145 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 608.5 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q3, we had repurchased 48.8 million shares for a total cost of $2 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $3 billion. We have approximately $1 billion remaining unutilized. 
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we are trimming the high end of our revenue expectations to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.53 billion, which represents growth of approximately 8.5% to 9%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.51 billion, including $18 million of incremental negative currency impact due to the recent weakening of the pound sterling. As is the typical pattern in the fourth quarter, client furloughs, seasonality of our retail practice and pure billing days will have an impact on sequential revenue growth. 
During the fourth quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.88. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. For the remainder of the year, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the India share buyback transaction. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 609 million shares. 
For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.38 to $3.41. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 609.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 35%, including an approximate $238 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance.

Look, I think the health care business at Cognizant -- let me -- before I talk about the specifics, let me just back us up, right? I think that health care, particularly as it relates to the health care payers, is really a core area of deep, deep strength at Cognizant. It has historically been one of our strongest verticals. And with the addition of the capabilities from the TriZetto acquisition, I think has further strengthened our position there. The combination of Cognizant's services capabilities with TriZetto's platform capabilities has enabled us to create a truly unique platform-based offering in that marketplace, and we continue to see good traction in services and solutions that combine TriZetto software and Cognizant's core services capabilities. The pipeline of opportunities around that area remains robust, and I continue to be optimistic about the opportunities there. Offsetting that, as we've said to you over the course of this year, is some slowness in the spending from the biggest payers who are particularly the ones that are involved in the potential large combinations. My -- it's a little too early to forecast what happens with those payers as we go into 2017. But as a general matter, I would say that we've seen them slow spending, discretionary spending through this period of uncertainty. And so as those situations get resolved one way or the other, my expectation is that we have a great portfolio of services to offer that group of customers, and we will be as relevant, if not more relevant, than we've ever been to serving those needs of those customers."

So let me start with the 3 practice areas that we discussed on the call today. We've refocused and rebranded our offerings under these 3 broad practice areas: Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technology. And it's not an oversight that where digital appears in all 3 of their practice names. The reason is as we've said to you for quite some time now, our core and fundamental belief is that digital technology is really embedded in all areas and all aspects of our business in some way, shape or form. And so Cognizant digital business uses digital technologies to create and deliver meaningful business experiences for clients. Cognizant digital operations uses digital technology to enable and automate core business operations in our clients' core transaction processing areas. And then, of course, Cognizant digital systems and technology is focused on modernizing securing and scaling legacy technology environments. All of -- digital exists in all those places. To your question is about CBC, or Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Business Consulting is really an enabler across all 3 of those practice areas. The business consulting capability is woven in across all of those 3 practice areas. And really, a lot of the work that we are doing today in Cognizant business consulting is what I consider to be tip of the spear kind of work that then leads to downstream work in one or more of those 3 big practice areas. We've clearly seen digital move beyond just high-end Consulting to implementation. Raj, for example, spoke in his prepared comments about the work we're doing to migrate down to the clients to cloud-based AWS environments. That's an example of what I think of is core technology work that's enabled by new digital technologies and like that come across all their practices we're seeing, not just the tip of the spear consulting work, but also downstream implementation work that relates to digital."

So on the first one, on digital, as we talked about, and I think we demonstrated in our conversation today around the script, right, we think digital is becoming really an enterprise-wide initiative. And as we've said, we think that the definition of digital and how people think about digital revenue will continue to evolve in the coming months and quarters. And so we have been reluctant frankly to define digital because we don't think there's a clear digital definition across the industry today, and we've talked about this notion of digital started in the front office and now has increasingly moved to the mid-office and the back office and hence, the alignment of our 3 practices that we talked around digital business, digital operations and digital systems and technology, which I think start to get at that notion that it really has become an enterprise-wide initiative for both clients and ourselves. And increasingly, we think it will impact all of the segments of the business. In fact, it already is today. So we have been reluctant to break out what's digital because how do you define a project, whether that's a digital component to it or is that the entire project digital? So I think those definitions in the market will continue to evolve, and we'll continue to focus on that. I think in terms of margins, clearly, we have talked about staying in the 19% to 20% range. We have done that historically. And I think certainly for the foreseeable future, people should expect that, that us accountable range for us to operate in. Obviously gives us room to make investments to grow the business. Those investments continue to shift as we look at more platforms, as that business continues to expand as we continue to expand, new skill sets and you offerings to support the digital marketplace. Those are most of the investments that we continue to focus on. But I think from a modeling perspective, you should expect to us to stay in the 19% to 20% range. From a capital allocation perspective, there's really no change in our strategy there. I think as we've said in the past, people should expect that over the course of the year, we will essentially maintain share neutrality. We have the buyback program available to us, and we will use that as and when we think it's appropriate to do that. And obviously, we demonstrated that with the number of shares that we bought back in Q3 and we [indiscernible] about $1 billion left under that program as we look forward into Q4 and beyond."

I'll try to get to each of them. I would say that at a macro level, the -- our industry is one -- well, first of all, the world continues to become more technology and data intensive. So that sort of the 50,000-foot view, technology is becoming more complex to implement the skill set us much pointed out in his prepared -- in his, I think, Q&A a minute ago is we have a much broader range of skills that are required to implement new technologies today. And so we believe that, that makes services firms like Cognizant as relevant, if not more relevant, than we've been in the past. It's also a fragmented industry so the opportunity to gain market share and the opportunity to capture markets is very much there. And we believe that if you drill down further, that when you look at our footprint of industries that we serve, if you look at the footprint of geographies that we currently operate in, there remain significant growth opportunities in places where we are underpenetrated. And so when you put all of that together, we believe that we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us that our ability to invest to capture those growth opportunities exists in the company with our financial formula. And so that's our -- that forms the core thesis and a quarter basis for how we think it about the business going forward. As it relates to acquisitions, we said that we will continue to focus. We have a robust M&A program. We look at traditionally smaller tuck-in acquisitions of that's been the primary focus. We will continue to do that. I would expect that as we go forward, you'll see us focused those kind of acquisitions. I would expect that we would be more focused on digital and making digital acquisitions as we look to the next few quarters to bolster our digital capability -- I think we've got good strong digital capabilities, but particularly, as we look to new industries and geographies, I think you'll see us using inorganic means to grow faster there. Typically, when we do small acquisitions, the margin profile of those companies may not be where the Cognizant margin profile is. But through our ability to -- largely, Keith, to cross-sell their services into our core business, we have rapidly able to bring them to Cognizant average margins. And so I expect we'll continue to do that. For the small tuck-ins, if there's an acquisitions that when we buy it, not a Cognizant margins, I'm not too concerned about that because we've shown that we can bring those back up the Cognizant levels through our ability to cross-sell."

I think in the business environment, I wouldn't actually say there's really been any change in the last 3 months. So obviously, early in the year, we had talked about sluggishness in Financial Services and Healthcare and then over the summer, post the Brexit vote while we haven't seen disruption, I would say specific to Brexit, we certainly saw some concern among insurance, clients as well as financial services, and we talked about that on our last call. I wouldn't say there's really been any change in that environment or the duration of the environment. I think it's continued as it was in the quarter or in Q3. Obviously, the pound has deteriorated, and so that resulted in an additional $18 million negative headwind as we went into Q4 based on that. And if we had looked if we had left the range where it was for Q4, obviously, it would have been a very broad range and certainly more significant growth than we've ever added in Q4. And we thought it was appropriate to taper the top end of the growth range down into something that we thought was more reasonable they've done on typical buying patterns in Q4, given the fact that there are lower bill days. There are furloughs. The retail practice as you know, shuts down quite significantly in Q4 as retail clients get ready for the holiday. They shut down all discretionary spending typically right about now. So I think what we're seeing in Q4 is a very typical seasonal pattern for the business other than the impact of the FX.

We were able to get to a place where we thought it was appropriate to record the $3.1 million of the $5 million as now a period adjustment in Q3, but we will continue the investigation until we're confident that we've tracked it all down."

Thanks for joining us today. Our Q3 revenue was $3.45 billion, up 2.5% from Q2 and 8.4% from a year ago. This is within our guided range of $3.42 billion to $3.47 billion. These results were driven by growth a",1350,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our Q3 revenue was $3.45 billion, up 2.5% from Q2 and 8.4% from a year ago. This is within our guided range of $3.42 billion to $3.47 billion. These results were driven by growth across all of our industries. This was encouraging given the weakness in the pound sterling and the softness we've seen this year in our Financial Services segment stemming from macroeconomic concerns and in our health care payer segment due to industry consolidation. 
Turning to guidance. We're trimming the high end of our full year revenue expectation and now expect our revenue to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.53 billion. This guidance includes the absorption of an incremental $18 million negative impact due to the recent weakening of the pound sterling. We're tightening our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $3.38 to $3.41. I'll talk more about the business in a moment and why we're well positioned going into 2017. 
I'd like to take a moment to update you on the internal investigation we announced at the end of September. The investigation is focused on payments relating to permits for certain company-owned facilities in India and whether such payments were made improperly and in possible violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws. First, I think it's important to note that we do not anticipate any impact on our ability to continue to provide the quality services our clients expect from us. 
Second, as disclosed in the Form 10-Q we filed this morning, we've identified approximately $5 million in potentially improper payments to date. We've evaluated the effect of such payments and concluded that they are not material and do not require a restatement of our historical financial statements. Karen will provide additional details on this in a few minutes. 
Third and also disclosed this morning, we discovered in the course of the investigation that certain members of senior management may have been aware or participated in the matters under investigation. Any such conduct would be inconsistent with our core values. Based on the results of the investigation to date, those who may have been involved are no longer with the company or in the senior management position. 
Finally, I would like to reaffirm our strong commitment to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We voluntarily disclosed the matters under investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in September, and we've been fully cooperating with both agencies. Based on the results of the investigation to date, we have already started and will continue to enhance our internal controls and compliance programs. 
Let me now turn to the rest of the business. Today and moving forward, what remains most essential to Cognizant's success is our unwavering focus on our clients. Their changing needs are the inspiration for our strategy, and we are actively executing that strategy. As we look ahead, we believe our market opportunity has never been greater. That's because with more technology in every product built and behind every customer experience and more data generated at every turn, our clients' businesses are and will continue to become increasingly technology-intensive. Our opportunity then is to work with these clients to help them win by making the fundamental technology-enabled changes throughout their organizations that are required for them to compete in this new technology and data-intensive world. 
We have spoken to you in past calls about our 3 strategic initiatives designed to enable this kind of work across our clients' businesses from front to back. We recently took an important step in executing this strategy by aligning and branding all our capabilities into 3 practice areas: Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technology. 
Our Cognizant digital business practice works with clients to reshape their products and business models and the resulting impact on how organizations interact with their customers, employees and partners. Our approach combines data science, design thinking and deep industry and process knowledge with solid technology capabilities to unite the physical and virtual aspects of a company's offerings seamlessly across every channel. Together, we identify insights, develop business strategies and design prototype and scale meaningful experiences. 
Our Cognizant digital operations practice helps clients reengineer, digitize, manage and operate their most essential business processes, lowering operating costs, improving user experiences and delivering better outcomes and top line growth. Across the practice, we are creating automated data-driven platforms and industry utilities. We help clients run better by applying traditional optimization levers, and we help them run differently by creating competitive advantage through process excellence, which often leads to more effective operating models and corresponding top line revenue growth. 
And our Cognizant digital systems and technology practice works with clients to simplify, modernize and secure IT infrastructure and applications, unlocking the power trapped in their technology environments. We help clients create and evolve systems that meet their needs in the modern enterprise by delivering industry-leading standards of performance, cost and flexibility. 
Now the names of these practices -- of these practice areas reflect our belief that digital technology must be embedded as an integral part of all our offerings. All 3 practice areas work in close partnership with our vertical and geographic businesses and with Cognizant Business Consulting to ensure tight alignment and market relevance. 
Let me underscore how central this is to what differentiates Cognizant. When we say digital, we're not talking just about building user interfaces or implementing digital marketing, but about creating industry-specific solutions woven deeply into the workings of an organization to create new levels of value enterprise-wide. 
In summary, our clients are finding it unique and differentiating that Cognizant can consult with them to build digital businesses, operations and systems. For example, we're helping insurance companies go beyond managing claims to preventing losses with the power of predictive analytics. We're working with health care companies to bring payers, providers and patients together on an integrated platform that reduces waste and improves health outcomes. And we're helping manufacturers evolve from using stand-alone goods to orchestrating entire ecosystems of smart, connected products. 
But as much as we are focused on the opportunities of today, looking ahead of evolving clients needs is one of Cognizant's core strengths. We continue to develop innovative products and services, part of what you've heard us refer to as our Horizon 3 capabilities, through an internal investment program that powers long-term growth opportunities for Cognizant and our clients. 
First, the Cognizant global technology office identifies the emerging technologies with the potential to create real business value. Then, Cognizant accelerates and scales the most promising technologies, product-izing services solutions and business models and speeding them to market. Together, these teams have spearheaded our entry into SMAC and IoT, for example, and today, they are working to realize the potential of developing technologies like artificial intelligence, block chain and to incubate new IP-based offerings. 
As we plan for 2017 and beyond, in addition to continuing to scale our comprehensive services portfolio, we're expanding our vertical and geographic focus as well. We're seeing increased traction with clients across Continental Europe, Asia Pacific and the public sector who are finding our comprehensive capabilities unique in their markets. In closing, it's clear that, today, our clients realize digital should be an enterprise-wide endeavor and that they need a comprehensive partner like Cognizant capable of working across every aspect of the organization that technology should enrich: business, operations and systems. 
Let me now turn the call over to our new President, Raj Mehta. On our last earnings call, we introduced you to Raj, a long-standing Cognizant leader. He's been a Cognizant associate since 1997, building strong relationships with clients throughout his 20 years at Cognizant and leading many of our market-facing and delivery teams in driving industry-leading growth. Now as President, he has direct responsibility for the overall P&L of Cognizant operations. 
Raj will talk to you about the success we're already having in executing our strategy from his perspective running these businesses. Raj?"

I'm glad to be here and honored to be taking the role of President at this important time in Cognizant's journey. Anyone who has followed the company over the years know that we stand for 3 things: a relentless focus on our clients, making sure we have world-class teams that deliver consistently for them and scaling our capabilities to address new client needs. I know we're succeeding when clients tell me that working with us feels different. As we help clients with the shift they need to make in the digital era, I'm doubling down on the principles that had made us successful so far: client focus, world-class teams and scaling capabilities while maintaining our flexible collaborative way of working. 
In working closely with clients across our industry businesses, we see that they face many of the same underlying challenges. They need to deliver the convenient experiences people expect today across their complex organizations. They need to develop the operational agility to respond to fast-changing business needs. They need to free up dollars to invest in innovation and transformation by optimizing and modernizing their legacy IT systems. 
It's these challenges that our practices, Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technologies, are focused on, helping clients answer. Working closely with the Cognizant Business Consulting and domain experts from our industry businesses, we are creating frameworks, platforms and solutions that clients are finding valuable as they pursue next level of savings and new revenue streams. 
Now I'll review the performance of each of our industry verticals, highlighting key trends and some of the areas we're focusing on with our clients.  Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 1.8% sequentially and 7.1% year-over-year. During Q3, the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and the prolonged low rate interest environment that we have commented on throughout 2016 continue to moderate spending at several of our larger banking clients. Our super regional banking businesses continued to perform well as many of those clients look to us for solutions, which both optimize costs and generate revenue. While we've seen a slowdown in spending in recent months with several of our insurance clients who are also pressured by the low interest rate environment, demand has remained solid over the past year. Clients have been particularly interested in Cognizant digital operations solutions that transform underwriting and claims processes through managed services or other outcome-based delivery models. 
Our health care segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 3.5% sequentially and 5.7% year-over-year. The industry consolidation among several of the largest U.S. payers continues to weigh on our health care payer practice. Still, we remain positive that the fundamental shifts underway in the market will create long-term opportunities. Through solutions from our Cognizant digital operations practice that combine TriZetto software and Cognizant services, we are well positioned to help clients deal effectively with this disruption. 
In our Life Sciences business, demand has picked up steadily over the past year as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. In particular, we're seeing a trend towards multiservice line deals, leveraging analytics, cloud technologies and platforms. 
Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 2.8% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Strength in manufacturing helped to offset ongoing softness in retail. A number of retail clients have moderated their discretionary spending over this past year as consumer spending has been weak. Cognizant digital business has seen growing demand among manufacturing clients who wanted help in transforming the products they make through sensors, IoT and analytics. They're also looking for solutions that increase the productivity of core IT infrastructure and application services. 
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.7% sequentially and 13.6% year-over-year. Last quarter, we highlighted that macroeconomic uncertainty was causing a slowdown in decision-making for our information, media and entertainment clients. This has largely been offset by a rebound in our communications business. 
Let me give you a few examples how Cognizant is partnering with clients in engagements that are pivoting their businesses and shifting their industries in meaningful ways. Let's talk first about KeyBank. Cognizant's partnered with KeyBank on a variety of different initiatives over the past 10 years, assisting in significant projects like the recent integration of their acquisition of First Niagara Bank. Today, KeyBank wants to leverage digital to compete and lead in their category, and they started that journey with Cognizant. We are working together to simplify the way they do business and offer their customers streamlined experiences, financial wellness tools and digital product offers and services. 
Cognizant is helping with the implementation of a transition to the Oracle Banking Platform. As part of our work, we're helping and delivering improved digital experiences on web and mobile interfaces, reengineering business processes and enabling new technology architecture for the bank's retail digital channel. This retail digital channel modernization is the first wave of the transformation, but we'll expand the use of this platform to manage other core processes and to deliver new differentiated services to customers within the coming year. 
Let me tell you about another project we're doing in the manufacturing space, helping a top 5 auto manufacturer change what people expect from their cars. As sales in developed markets plateau, our client is looking to serve new needs of their customers by offering a range of transportation services and solutions. We are their strategic partner, helping to develop a strategy and user experiences and to build the platform that will be the backbone of an evolving new ecosystem of offerings. While this platform will initially focus on areas such as parking, vehicle health and retail and rewards program, the data captured by the platform will eventually be used to model how people will move differently in the future. We will work with our client to develop this and other potential opportunities to expand the services that they offer to their customers. 
Finally, I would like to highlight a growing part of Cognizant digital systems and technology, where our deep knowledge of clients' legacy environments enable us to modernize their IT by migrating to cloud-based solutions, utilizing providers such as AWS. A couple of recent examples. We recently worked with LexisNexis to develop a cloud-based solution on AWS that support search capabilities on a database of over 2 billion searchable documents on their news archive platform. For Sotheby's, we migrated their critical business applications, including their flagship website, from an on-premise data center to AWS. For both clients, this is a major step towards -- for towards the modernization of their IT infrastructure. In future calls, you'll continue to hear more from me about what Cognizant and our clients are focusing on together, how we're building world-class teams to serve them better and how we're scaling our capabilities to meet changing needs. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Karen to discuss our financial performance."
386024,407279165,1077841,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. As Raj mentioned, the business performed within expectations as third quarter revenue of $3.45 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of 2.5% and a year-over-year increase of 8.4%.",1263,"Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. As Raj mentioned, the business performed within expectations as third quarter revenue of $3.45 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of 2.5% and a year-over-year increase of 8.4%. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $24 million or approximately 70 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $42 million or 130 basis points. 
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.3%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 was $0.01 above our guidance range of $0.82 to $0.85. As a reminder, the remittance of cash from India to the U.S. that occurred in the second quarter had an incremental tax impact of $24 million in quarter 3 and is expected to have a similar impact in the fourth quarter. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.04 per share impact on our Q3 GAAP EPS that was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the nonrecurring nature of the transaction. 
Before I provide a detailed commentary on the quarter's performance, let me provide some additional color on the ongoing internal investigation, which is being overseen by our audit committee. As Frank noted, based on the results of the investigation to date, we are not restating our historical financial statements. At present, the investigation has identified a total of approximately $5 million in potentially improper payments for certain company-owned facilities in India. Of that amount, based on the preliminary results of the investigation to date and as disclosed in our Form 10-Q and earnings release, we determined that it was appropriate at this time to record an out-of-period correction of $3.1 million related to certain of these payments. 
Also, as disclosed in the Form 10-Q, we announced a determination of a material weakness as of December 31, 2015, and the subsequent interim period as based on the results of the investigation to date, certain members of senior management may have participated in or failed to take action to prevent the making of potentially improper payments by either overwriting or failing to enforce the controls established by the company relating to real estate and procurement principally in connection with permits for certain facilities in India. We have already taken and continue to take remediation measures in the areas of procurement and accounts payable as they relate to real estate transactions in India. 
Now turning to third quarter performance. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.4% and 42.6% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 2.4% sequentially and 6.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 2.6% sequentially and 10.3% from Q3 a year ago, driven by strength across digital operations and the infrastructure portion of Cognizant digital systems and technology. 
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 3.3% sequentially and 7.9% year-over-year. Europe declined 1.7% sequentially after a 4.4% negative currency impact and grew 5.6% from last year after an 8.3% negative currency impact. Growth in Europe was driven primarily by the ramp-up work coming from recent wins, particularly in markets such as Germany and the Nordics. The U.K. declined 5.7% sequentially and 2.3% year-over-year after a 7% and a 13.9% negative currency impact respectfully. Continental Europe grew 3.5% sequentially and 17% over the prior year. We have established a solid foothold on the continent and expect this to continue to be a driver of future growth. Finally, we saw continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up 3.8% sequentially and 23.2% year-over-year. 
During the third quarter, 37.5% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 322. 
We added 11,500 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 16.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 350 basis points from the year-ago period. While attrition remained slightly elevated, we are pleased with the year-over-year decline as we continue to enhance our various employee engagement initiatives. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 255,800 employees globally, of which 239,500 were service delivery staff. Offshore utilization was 73%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates in our training program was 79%, and on-site utilization was 90% during the quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this was up by $390 million from the quarter ending June 30 and up by $861 million from the year-ago period. 
Moving on to receivables, which were $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 74.5 days. This is roughly flat with last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $424 million, down from $451 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 58% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October, and the decrease in unbilled receivables is primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance is $900 million at the end of the quarter, and there were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. 
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated $594 million. Financing activities were a $119 million use of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were $74 million during the quarter. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased just over 2.5 million shares for a total cost of $145 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 608.5 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q3, we had repurchased 48.8 million shares for a total cost of $2 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $3 billion. We have approximately $1 billion remaining unutilized. 
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we are trimming the high end of our revenue expectations to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.53 billion, which represents growth of approximately 8.5% to 9%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.51 billion, including $18 million of incremental negative currency impact due to the recent weakening of the pound sterling. As is the typical pattern in the fourth quarter, client furloughs, seasonality of our retail practice and pure billing days will have an impact on sequential revenue growth. 
During the fourth quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.88. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. For the remainder of the year, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the India share buyback transaction. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 609 million shares. 
For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.38 to $3.41. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 609.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 35%, including an approximate $238 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance.

Look, I think the health care business at Cognizant -- let me -- before I talk about the specifics, let me just back us up, right? I think that health care, particularly as it relates to the health care payers, is really a core area of deep, deep strength at Cognizant. It has historically been one of our strongest verticals. And with the addition of the capabilities from the TriZetto acquisition, I think has further strengthened our position there. The combination of Cognizant's services capabilities with TriZetto's platform capabilities has enabled us to create a truly unique platform-based offering in that marketplace, and we continue to see good traction in services and solutions that combine TriZetto software and Cognizant's core services capabilities. The pipeline of opportunities around that area remains robust, and I continue to be optimistic about the opportunities there. Offsetting that, as we've said to you over the course of this year, is some slowness in the spending from the biggest payers who are particularly the ones that are involved in the potential large combinations. My -- it's a little too early to forecast what happens with those payers as we go into 2017. But as a general matter, I would say that we've seen them slow spending, discretionary spending through this period of uncertainty. And so as those situations get resolved one way or the other, my expectation is that we have a great portfolio of services to offer that group of customers, and we will be as relevant, if not more relevant, than we've ever been to serving those needs of those customers."

So let me start with the 3 practice areas that we discussed on the call today. We've refocused and rebranded our offerings under these 3 broad practice areas: Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technology. And it's not an oversight that the word digital appears in all 3 of the practice names. The reason is that we -- as we've said to you for quite some time now, our core and fundamental belief is that digital technology is really embedded in all areas and all aspects of our business in some way, shape or form. And so Cognizant digital business uses digital technologies to create and deliver meaningful business experiences for clients. Cognizant digital operations uses digital technology to enable and automate core business operations in our clients' core transaction processing areas. And then, of course, Cognizant digital systems and technology is focused on modernizing, securing and scaling legacy technology environments. All of -- digital exists in all those places. To your question about CBC or Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Business Consulting is really an enabler across all 3 of those practice areas. The business consulting capability is woven in across all of those 3 practice areas. And really, a lot of the work that we are doing today in Cognizant Business Consulting is what I consider to be tip of the spear kind of work that then leads to downstream work in one or more of those 3 big practice areas. We've clearly seen digital move beyond just high-end consulting to implementation. Raj, for example, spoke in his prepared comments about the work we are doing to migrate -- we've done to migrate 2 big clients to cloud-based AWS environments. That's an example of what I think of as core technology work that's enabled by new digital technologies. And like that, across all the practices we're seeing not just sort of tip of the spear consulting work, but also downstream implementation work that relates to digital."

So on the first one, on digital, as we've talked about and, I think, we demonstrated in our conversation today around the script, right, we think that digital is becoming really an enterprise-wide initiative. And as we've said, we think that the definition of digital and how people think about digital revenue will continue to evolve in the coming months and quarters. And so we have been reluctant, frankly, to define digital because we don't think there is a clear digital definition across the industry today. And we've talked about this notion of digital, started in the front office and now has increasingly moved to the mid-office and the back office and hence, the alignment of our 3 practices that we talked around, around digital business, digital operations and digital systems and technology, which, I think, start to get at that notion that it really has become an enterprise-wide initiative for both clients and ourselves. And increasingly, we think it will impact all of the segments of the business. In fact, it already is today. So we have been reluctant to break out what's digital because how do you define a project whether it's got a digital component to it or is the entire project digital. So I think those definitions in the market will continue to evolve, and we'll continue to focus on that. I think in terms of margins, clearly, we have talked about staying in the 19% to 20% range. We have done that historically. And I think, certainly, for the foreseeable future, people should expect that, that is a comfortable range for us to operate in. It obviously gives us room to make investments to grow the business. Those investments continue to shift as we look at more platforms, as that business continues to expand as we continue to expand, new skill sets and new offerings to support the digital marketplace. Those are most of the investments that we continue to focus on. But I think, from a modeling perspective, you should expect us to stay in the 19% to 20% range. From a capital allocation perspective, there's really no change in our strategy there. I think, as we've said in the past, people should expect that, over the course of a year, we will essentially maintain share neutrality. We have the buyback program available to us, and we will use that as and when we think it's appropriate to do that. And obviously, we demonstrated that with the number of shares that we bought back in Q3, and we still have about $1 billion left under that program as we look forward into Q4 and beyond."

I'll try to get to each of them. I would say that at a macro level, the -- our industry is one where -- well, first of all, the world continues to become more technology- and data-intensive. So that's sort of the 50,000-foot view. Technology is becoming more complex to implement the skill set -- as Raj pointed out in his prepared -- in his, I think, Q&A a minute ago, is we have a much broader range of skills that are required to implement new technologies today. And so we believe that, that makes services firms like Cognizant as relevant, if not more relevant than we've been in the past. It's also a fragmented industry, so the opportunity to gain market share and the opportunity to capture markets is very much there. And we believe that -- if you drill down further, that when you look at our footprint of industries that we serve, if you look at the footprint of geographies that we currently operate in, there remains significant growth opportunities in places where we are underpenetrated. And so when you put all of that together, we believe that we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us, that our ability to invest to capture those growth opportunities exists in the company with our financial formula. And so that's our -- that forms a core thesis and a core basis for how we think about the business going forward. As it relates to acquisitions, we said that we will continue to focus. We have a robust M&A program. We look at, traditionally, smaller tuck-in acquisitions. That's been the primary focus. We will continue to do that. I would expect that, as we go forward, you'll see us focused on those kinds of acquisitions. I would expect that we would be more focused on digital and making digital acquisitions as we look to the next few quarters to bolster our digital capability. I think we've got good strong digital capabilities, but particularly, as we look to new industries and geographies, I think you'll see us using inorganic means to grow faster there. Typically, when we do small acquisitions, the margin profile of those companies may not be where the Cognizant margin profile is. But through our ability to -- largely, Keith, to cross-sell their services into our core business, we are rapidly able to bring them to Cognizant average margins. And so I expect we'll continue to do that. For the small tuck-ins, if there's an acquisitions that's, when we buy it, not at Cognizant margins, I'm not too concerned about that because we've shown that we can bring those back up to Cognizant levels through our ability to cross-sell."

I wouldn't say there's really been any change in that environment or deterioration in that environment. I think it's continued as it was in the quarter or in Q3. Obviously, the pound has deteriorated, and so that resulted in an additional $18 million negative headwind as we went into Q4 based on that. And if you had looked -- if we had left the range where it was for Q4, obviously, it would have been a very broad range and, certainly, in fact, more significant growth than we'd ever added in Q4. And we thought it was appropriate to taper the top end of the growth range down into something that we thought was more reasonable based on typical buying patterns in Q4, given the fact that there are lower bill days, there are furloughs. The retail practice, as you know, shuts down quite significantly in Q4. As retail clients get ready for the holiday, they shut down all discretionary spending, typically right about now. So I think what we're seeing in Q4 is a very typical seasonal pattern for the business other than the impact of the FX. And I'm sorry, can you repeat your question about the FCPA investigation?"

Thanks for joining us today. Our Q3 revenue was $3.45 billion, up 2.5% from Q2 and 8.4% from a year ago. This is within our guided range of $3.42 billion to $3.47 billion. These results were driven by growth a",1349,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our Q3 revenue was $3.45 billion, up 2.5% from Q2 and 8.4% from a year ago. This is within our guided range of $3.42 billion to $3.47 billion. These results were driven by growth across all of our industries. This was encouraging given the weakness in the pound sterling and the softness we've seen this year in our Financial Services segment stemming from macroeconomic concerns and in our health care payer segment due to industry consolidation. 
Turning to guidance. We're trimming the high end of our full year revenue expectation and now expect our revenue to be in a range of $13.47 billion to $13.53 billion. This guidance includes the absorption of an incremental $18 million negative impact due to the recent weakening of the pound sterling. We're tightening our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $3.38 to $3.41. I'll talk more about the business in a moment and why we're well positioned going into 2017. 
I'd like to take a moment to update you on the internal investigation we announced at the end of September. The investigation is focused on payments relating to permits for certain company-owned facilities in India and whether such payments were made improperly and in possible violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws. First, I think it's important to note that we do not anticipate any impact on our ability to continue to provide the quality services our clients expect from us. 
Second, as disclosed in the Form 10-Q we filed this morning, we've identified approximately $5 million in potentially improper payments to date. We've evaluated the effect of such payments and concluded that they are not material and do not require a restatement of our historical financial statements. Karen will provide additional details on this in a few minutes. 
Third and also disclosed this morning, we discovered in the course of the investigation that certain members of senior management may have been aware of or participated in the matters under investigation. Any such conduct would be inconsistent with our core values. Based on the results of the investigation to date, those who may have been involved are no longer with the company or in a senior management position. 
Finally, I would like to reaffirm our strong commitment to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We voluntarily disclosed the matters under investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in September, and we've been fully cooperating with both agencies. Based on the results of the investigation to date, we have already started and will continue to enhance our internal controls and compliance programs. 
Let me now turn to the rest of the business. Today and moving forward, what remains most essential to Cognizant's success is our unwavering focus on our clients. Their changing needs are the inspiration for our strategy, and we are actively executing that strategy. As we look ahead, we believe our market opportunity has never been greater. That's because with more technology in every product built and behind every customer experience and more data generated at every turn, our clients' businesses are and will continue to become increasingly technology intensive. Our opportunity then is to work with these clients to help them win by making the fundamental technology-enabled changes throughout their organizations that are required for them to compete in this new technology and data-intensive world. 
We have spoken to you in past calls about our 3 strategic initiatives designed to enable this kind of work across our clients' businesses from front to back. We recently took an important step in executing this strategy by aligning and branding all our capabilities into 3 practice areas: Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technology. 
Our Cognizant digital business practice works with clients to reshape their products and business models and the resulting impact on how organizations interact with their customers, employees and partners. Our approach combines data science, design thinking and deep industry and process knowledge with solid technology capabilities to unite the physical and virtual aspects of a company's offerings seamlessly across every channel. Together, we identify insights, develop business strategies and design prototype and scale meaningful experiences. 
Our Cognizant digital operations practice helps clients reengineer, digitize, manage and operate their most essential business processes, lowering operating costs, improving user experiences and delivering better outcomes and top line growth. Across the practice, we are creating automated data-driven platforms and industry utilities. We help clients run better by applying traditional optimization levers, and we help them run differently by creating competitive advantage through process excellence, which often leads to more effective operating models and corresponding top line revenue growth. 
And our Cognizant digital systems and technology practice works with clients to simplify, modernize and secure IT infrastructure and applications, unlocking the power trapped in their technology environments. We help clients create and evolve systems that meet their needs in the modern enterprise by delivering industry-leading standards of performance, cost and flexibility. 
Now the names of these practices -- of these practice areas reflect our belief that digital technology must be embedded as an integral part of all our offerings. All 3 practice areas work in close partnership with our vertical and geographic businesses and with Cognizant Business Consulting to ensure tight alignment and market relevance. 
Let me underscore how central this is to what differentiates Cognizant. When we say digital, we're not talking just about building user interfaces or implementing digital marketing, but about creating industry-specific solutions woven deeply into the workings of an organization to create new levels of value enterprise-wide. 
In summary, our clients are finding it unique and differentiating that Cognizant can consult with them to build digital businesses, operations and systems. For example, we're helping insurance companies go beyond managing claims to preventing losses with the power of predictive analytics. We're working with health care companies to bring payers, providers and patients together on an integrated platform that reduces waste and improves health outcomes. And we're helping manufacturers evolve from producing stand-alone goods to orchestrating entire ecosystems of smart, connected products. 
But as much as we are focused on the opportunities of today, looking ahead of evolving client needs is one of Cognizant's core strengths. We continue to develop innovative products and services, part of what you've heard us refer to as our Horizon 3 capabilities, through an internal investment program that powers long-term growth opportunities for Cognizant and our clients. 
First, the Cognizant global technology office identifies emerging technologies with the potential to create real business value. Then, Cognizant Accelerator scales the most promising technologies, product-izing services solutions and business models and speeding them to market. Together, these teams have spearheaded our entry into SMAC and IoT, for example, and today, they are working to realize the potential of developing technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain and to incubate new IP-based offerings. 
As we plan for 2017 and beyond, in addition to continuing to scale our comprehensive services portfolio, we're expanding our vertical and geographic focus as well. We're seeing increased traction with clients across Continental Europe, Asia Pacific and the public sector who are finding our comprehensive capabilities unique in their markets. In closing, it's clear that, today, our clients realize digital should be an enterprise-wide endeavor and that they need a comprehensive partner like Cognizant capable of working across every aspect of the organization that technology should enrich: business, operations and systems. 
Let me now turn the call over to our new President, Raj Mehta. On our last earnings call, we introduced you to Raj, a long-standing Cognizant leader. He's been a Cognizant associate since 1997, building strong relationships with clients throughout his 20 years at Cognizant and leading many of our market-facing and delivery teams in driving industry-leading growth. Now as President, he has direct responsibility for the overall P&L of Cognizant's operations. 
Raj will talk to you about the success we're already having in executing our strategy from his perspective running these businesses. Raj?"

I'm glad to be here and honored to be taking the role of President at this important time in Cognizant's journey. Anyone who has followed the company over the years knows that we stand for 3 things: a relentless focus on our clients, making sure we have world-class teams that deliver consistently for them and scaling our capabilities to address new client needs. I know we're succeeding when clients tell me that working with us feels different. As we help clients with the shifts they need to make in the digital era, I'm doubling down on the principles that have made us successful so far: client focus, world-class teams and scaling capabilities, while maintaining our flexible collaborative way of working. 
In working closely with clients across our industry businesses, we see that they face many of the same underlying challenges. They need to deliver the convenient experiences people expect today across their complex organizations. They need to develop the operational agility to respond to fast-changing business needs. They need to free up dollars to invest in innovation and transformation by optimizing and modernizing their legacy IT systems. 
It's these challenges that our practices, Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technologies are focused on helping clients answer. Working closely with Cognizant Business Consulting and domain experts from our industry businesses, we are creating frameworks, platforms and solutions that clients are finding valuable as they pursue next-level savings and new revenue streams. 
Now I'll review the performance of each of our industry verticals, highlighting key trends and some of the areas we're focusing on with our clients.  Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 1.8% sequentially and 7.1% year-over-year. During Q3, the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and the prolonged low-rate interest environment that we have commented on throughout 2016 continued to moderate spending at several of our larger banking clients. Our super-regional banking businesses continued to perform well as many of those clients look to us for solutions which both optimize costs and generate revenue. While we've seen a slowdown in spending in recent months with several of our insurance clients who are also pressured by the low interest rate environment, demand has remained solid over the past year. Clients have been particularly interested in Cognizant digital operations solutions that transform underwriting and claims processes through managed services or other outcome-based delivery models. 
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 3.5% sequentially and 5.7% year-over-year. The industry consolidation among several of the largest U.S. payers continues to weigh on our healthcare payer practice. Still, we remain positive that the fundamental shifts underway in the market will create long-term opportunities. Through solutions from our Cognizant digital operations practice that combine TriZetto software and Cognizant services, we are well positioned to help clients deal effectively with this disruption. 
In our Life Sciences business, demand has picked up steadily over the past year as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. In particular, we're seeing a trend towards multiservice line deals, leveraging analytics, cloud technologies and platforms. 
Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 2.8% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Strength in manufacturing helped to offset ongoing softness in retail. A number of retail clients have moderated their discretionary spending over this past year as consumer spending has been weak. Cognizant digital business has seen growing demand among manufacturing clients who wanted help in transforming the products they make through sensors, IoT and analytics. They're also looking for solutions that increase the productivity of core IT infrastructure and application services. 
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.7% sequentially and 13.6% year-over-year. Last quarter, we highlighted that macroeconomic uncertainty was causing a slowdown in decision-making for our information, media and entertainment clients. This has largely been offset by a rebound in our communications business. 
Let me give you a few examples how Cognizant is partnering with clients in engagements that are pivoting their businesses and shifting their industries in meaningful ways. Let's talk first about KeyBank. Cognizant has partnered with KeyBank on a variety of different initiatives over the past 10 years, assisting in significant projects like the recent integration of their acquisition of First Niagara Bank. Today, KeyBank wants to leverage digital to compete and lead in their category, and they have started that journey with Cognizant. We are working together to simplify the way they do business and offer their customers streamlined experiences, financial wellness tools and digital product offers and services. 
Cognizant is helping with the implementation of a transition to the Oracle Banking Platform. As part of our work, we're helping and delivering improved digital experiences on web and mobile interfaces, reengineering business processes and enabling new technology architecture for the bank's retail digital channel. This retail digital channel modernization is the first wave of the transformation, but we'll expand the use of this platform to manage other core processes and to deliver new differentiated services to customers within the coming year. 
Let me tell you about another project we're doing in the manufacturing space, helping a top 5 auto manufacturer change what people expect from their cars. As sales in developed markets plateau, our client is looking to serve new needs of their customers by offering a range of transportation services and solutions. We are their strategic partner, helping to develop the strategy and user experiences and to build the platform that will be the backbone of an evolving new ecosystem of offerings. While this platform will initially focus on areas such as parking, vehicle health and retail and rewards program, the data captured by the platform will eventually be used to model how people will move differently in the future. We will work with our client to develop this and other potential opportunities to expand the services that they offer to their customers. 
Finally, I would like to highlight a growing part of Cognizant digital systems and technology, where our deep knowledge of clients' legacy environments enable us to modernize their IT by migrating to cloud-based solutions, utilizing providers such as AWS. A couple of recent examples. We recently worked with LexisNexis to develop a cloud-based solution on AWS that supports search capabilities on a database of over 2 billion searchable documents on their news archive platform. For Sotheby's, we migrated their critical business applications, including their flagship website, from an on-premise data center to AWS. For both clients, this is a major step towards -- forward towards the modernization of their IT infrastructure. In future calls, you'll continue to hear more from me about what Cognizant and our clients are focusing on together, how we're building world-class teams to serve them better and how we're scaling our capabilities to meet changing needs. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Karen to discuss our financial performance."
386024,407279165,1078225,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. As Raj mentioned, the business performed within expectations as third quarter revenue of $3.45 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of 2.5% and a year-over-year increase of 8.4%.",1272,"Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. As Raj mentioned, the business performed within expectations as third quarter revenue of $3.45 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of 2.5% and a year-over-year increase of 8.4%. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $24 million or approximately 70 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $42 million or 130 basis points. 
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.3%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 was $0.01 above our guidance range of $0.82 to $0.85. As a reminder, the remittance of cash from India to the U.S. that occurred in the second quarter had an incremental tax impact of $24 million in quarter 3 and is expected to have a similar impact in the fourth quarter. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.04 per share impact on our Q3 GAAP EPS that was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the nonrecurring nature of the transaction. 
Before I provide a detailed commentary on the quarter's performance, let me provide some additional color on the ongoing internal investigation, which is being overseen by our audit committee. As Frank noted, based on the results of the investigation to date, we are not restating our historical financial statements. At present, the investigation has identified a total of approximately $5 million in potentially improper payments for certain company-owned facilities in India. Of that amount, based on the preliminary results of the investigation to date and as disclosed in our Form 10-Q and earnings release, we determined that it was appropriate at this time to record an out-of-period correction of $3.1 million related to certain of these payments. 
Also, as disclosed in the Form 10-Q, we announced a determination of a material weakness as of December 31, 2015 and the subsequent interim periods. As based on the results of the investigation to date, certain members of senior management may have participated in or failed to take action to prevent the making of potentially improper payments by either overwriting or failing to enforce the controls established by the company relating to real estate and procurement, principally in connection with permits for certain facilities in India. We have already taken and continue to take remediation measures in the areas of procurement and accounts payable as they relate to real estate transactions in India. 
Now turning to third quarter performance. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.4% and 42.6% of revenue, respectfully (sic) [ respectively ], for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 2.4% sequentially and 6.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 2.6% sequentially and 10.3% from Q3 a year ago, driven by strength across digital operations and the infrastructure portion of Cognizant digital systems and technology. 
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 3.3% sequentially and 7.9% year-over-year. Europe declined 1.7% sequentially after a 4.4% negative currency impact and grew 5.6% from last year after an 8.3% negative currency impact. Growth in Europe was driven primarily by the ramp of work coming from recent wins, particularly in markets such as Germany and the Nordics. The U.K. declined 5.7% sequentially and 2.3% year-over-year after a 7% and a 13.9% negative currency impact respectfully (sic) [ respectively ]. Continental Europe grew 3.5% sequentially and 17% over the prior year. We have established a solid foothold on the continent and expect this to continue to be a driver of future growth. Finally, we saw continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up 3.8% sequentially and 23.2% year-over-year. 
During the third quarter, 37.5% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 322. 
We added 11,500 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 16.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 350 basis points from the year-ago period. While attrition remains slightly elevated, we are pleased with the year-over-year decline as we continue to enhance our various employee engagement initiatives. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 255,800 employees globally, of which 239,500 were service delivery staff. Offshore utilization was 73%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates in our training program was 79%, and on-site utilization was 90% during the quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this was up by $390 million from the quarter ending June 30 and up by $861 million from the year-ago period. 
Moving on to receivables, which were $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 74.5 days. This is roughly flat with last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $424 million, down from $451 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 58% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October, and the decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $900 million at the end of the quarter, and there were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. 
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated $594 million. Financing activities were a $119 million use of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were $74 million during the quarter. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased just over 2.5 million shares for a total cost of $145 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 608.5 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q3, we had repurchased 48.8 million shares for a total cost of $2 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $3 billion. We had approximately $1 billion remaining unutilized. 
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we are trimming the high end of our revenue expectation to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.53 billion, which represents growth of approximately 8.5% to 9%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.51 billion, including $18 million of incremental negative currency impact due to the recent weakening of the pound sterling. As is the typical pattern in the fourth quarter, client furloughs, seasonality of our retail practice and fewer billing days will have an impact on sequential revenue growth. 
During the fourth quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.88. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. For the remainder of the year, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the India share buyback transaction. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 609 million shares. 
For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.38 to $3.41. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 609.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 35%, including an approximate $238 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance.

Look, I think the healthcare business at Cognizant -- let me -- before I talk about the specifics, let me just back us up, right? I think that healthcare, particularly as it relates to the healthcare payers, is really a core area of deep, deep strength at Cognizant. It has historically been one of our strongest verticals. And with the addition of the capabilities from the TriZetto acquisition, I think has further strengthened our position there. The combination of Cognizant's services capabilities with TriZetto's platform capabilities has enabled us to create a truly unique platform-based offering in that marketplace, and we continue to see good traction in services and solutions that combine TriZetto software and Cognizant's core services capabilities. The pipeline of opportunities around that area remains robust, and I continue to be optimistic about the opportunities there. Offsetting that, as we've said to you over the course of this year, is some slowness in the spending from the biggest payers who are particularly the ones that are involved in the potential large combinations. My -- it's a little too early to forecast what happens with those payers as we go into 2017. But as a general matter, I would say that we've seen them slow spending, discretionary spending through this period of uncertainty. And so as those situations get resolved one way or the other, my expectation is that we have a great portfolio of services to offer that group of customers, and we will be as relevant, if not more relevant, than we've ever been to serving those needs of those customers."

So let me start with the 3 practice areas that we discussed on the call today. We've refocused and rebranded our offerings under these 3 broad practice areas: Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technology. And it's not an oversight that the word digital appears in all 3 of the practice names. The reason is that we -- as we've said to you for quite some time now, our core and fundamental belief is that digital technology is really embedded in all areas and all aspects of our business in some way, shape or form. And so Cognizant digital business uses digital technologies to create and deliver meaningful business experiences for clients. Cognizant digital operations uses digital technology to enable and automate core business operations in our clients' core transaction processing areas. And then, of course, Cognizant digital systems and technology is focused on modernizing, securing and scaling legacy technology environments. All of -- digital exists in all those places. To your question about CBC or Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Business Consulting is really an enabler across all 3 of those practice areas. The business consulting capability is woven in across all of those 3 practice areas. And really, a lot of the work that we are doing today in Cognizant Business Consulting is what I consider to be tip of the spear kind of work that then leads to downstream work in one or more of those 3 big practice areas. We've clearly seen digital move beyond just high-end consulting to implementation. Raj, for example, spoke in his prepared comments about the work we are doing to migrate -- that we've done to migrate 2 big clients to cloud-based AWS environments. That's an example of what I think of as core technology work that's enabled by new digital technologies. And like that, across all the practices we're seeing not just sort of tip of the spear consulting work, but also downstream implementation work that relates to digital."

So on the first one, on digital, as we've talked about and, I think, we demonstrated in our conversation today around the script, right, we think that digital is becoming really an enterprise-wide initiative. And as we've said, we think that the definition of digital and how people think about digital revenue will continue to evolve in the coming months and quarters. And so we have been reluctant, frankly, to define digital because we don't think there is a clear digital definition across the industry today. And we've talked about this notion of digital. It started in the front office and now has increasingly moved to the mid-office and the back office and hence, the alignment of our 3 practices that we talked around, around digital business, digital operations and digital systems and technology, which, I think, start to get at that notion that it really has become an enterprise-wide initiative for both clients and ourselves. And increasingly, we think it will impact all of the segments of the business. In fact, it already is today. So we have been reluctant to break out what's digital because how do you define a project whether it's got a digital component to it or is the entire project digital. So I think those definitions in the market will continue to evolve, and we'll continue to focus on that. I think in terms of margins, clearly, we have talked about staying in the 19% to 20% range. We have done that historically. And I think, certainly, for the foreseeable future, people should expect that, that is a comfortable range for us to operate in. It obviously gives us room to make investments to grow the business. Those investments continue to shift as we look at more platforms, as that business continues to expand as we continue to expand new skill sets and new offerings to support the digital marketplace. Those are most of the investments that we continue to focus on. But I think, from a modeling perspective, you should expect us to stay in the 19% to 20% range. From a capital allocation perspective, there's really no change in our strategy there. I think, as we've said in the past, people should expect that, over the course of a year, we will essentially maintain share neutrality. We have the buyback program available to us, and we will use that as and when we think it's appropriate to do that. And obviously, we demonstrated that with the number of shares that we bought back in Q3, and we still have about $1 billion left under that program as we look forward into Q4 and beyond."

And so as we begin to reflect on calendar year '17, I'm wondering, what's different as we look at '17 that's going to allow Cognizant to grow at something better than 8%?

I'll try to get to each of them. I would say that at a macro level, the -- our industry is one where -- well, first of all, the world continues to become more technology- and data-intensive. So that's sort of the 50,000-foot view. Technology is becoming more complex to implement the skill sets. As Raj pointed out in his prepared -- in his, I think, Q&A a minute ago, is we have a much broader range of skills that are required to implement new technologies today. And so we believe that, that makes services firms like Cognizant as relevant, if not more relevant than we've been in the past. It's also a fragmented industry, so the opportunity to gain market share and the opportunity to capture markets is very much there. And we believe that -- if you drill down further, that when you look at our footprint of industries that we serve, if you look at the footprint of geographies that we currently operate in, there remains significant growth opportunities in places where we are underpenetrated. And so when you put all of that together, we believe that we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us, that our ability to invest to capture those growth opportunities exists in the company with our financial formula. And so that's our -- that forms a core thesis and a core basis for how we think about the business going forward. As it relates to acquisitions, we've said that we will continue to focus. We have a robust M&A program. We look at, traditionally, smaller tuck-in acquisitions. That's been the primary focus. We will continue to do that. I would expect that, as we go forward, you'll see us focus on those kinds of acquisitions. I would expect that we would be more focused on digital and making digital acquisitions as we look to the next few quarters to bolster our digital capability. I think we've got good strong digital capabilities, but particularly, as we look to new industries and geographies, I think you'll see us using inorganic means to grow faster there. Typically, when we do small acquisitions, the margin profile of those companies may not be where the Cognizant margin profile is. But through our ability to -- largely, Keith, to cross-sell their services into our core business, we are rapidly able to bring them to Cognizant average margins. And so I expect we'll continue to do that. For the small tuck-ins, if there's an acquisition that's, when we buy it, not at Cognizant margins, I'm not too concerned about that because we've shown that we can bring those back up to Cognizant levels through our ability to cross-sell."

I think in terms of the business environment, I wouldn't actually say there's really been any change in the last 3 months. So obviously, earlier in the year, we had talked about sluggishness in Financial Services and health care. And then, over the summer, post the Brexit vote, while we haven't seen disruption, I would say, specific to Brexit, we certainly saw some concern among insurance clients as well as Financial Services, and we talked about that on our last call. I wouldn't say there's really been any change in that environment or deterioration in that environment. I think it's continued as it was in the quarter -- or in Q3. Obviously, the pound has deteriorated, and so that resulted in an additional $18 million negative headwind as we went into Q4 based on that. And if you had looked -- if we had left the range where it was for Q4, obviously, it would have been a very broad range, and certainly more significant growth than we'd ever added in Q4. And we thought it was appropriate to taper the top end of the growth range down into something that we thought was more reasonable based on typical buying patterns in Q4, given the fact that there are lower bill days, there are furloughs. The retail practice, as you know, shuts down quite significantly in Q4. As retail clients get ready for the holiday, they shut down all discretionary spending, typically right about now. So I think what we're seeing in Q4 is a very typical seasonal pattern for the business other than the impact of the FX. And I'm sorry, can you repeat your question about the FCPA investigation?"

Thanks for joining us today. Our Q3 revenue was $3.45 billion, up 2.5% from Q2 and 8.4% from a year ago. This is within our guided range of $3.42 billion to $3.47 billion. These results were driven by growth a",1349,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our Q3 revenue was $3.45 billion, up 2.5% from Q2 and 8.4% from a year ago. This is within our guided range of $3.42 billion to $3.47 billion. These results were driven by growth across all of our industries. This was encouraging given the weakness in the pound sterling and the softness we've seen this year in our Financial Services segment stemming from macroeconomic concerns and in our health care payer segment due to industry consolidation. 
Turning to guidance. We're trimming the high end of our full year revenue expectation and now expect our revenue to be in a range of $13.47 billion to $13.53 billion. This guidance includes the absorption of an incremental $18 million negative impact due to the recent weakening of the pound sterling. We're tightening our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $3.38 to $3.41. I'll talk more about the business in a moment and why we're well positioned going into 2017. 
I'd like to take a moment to update you on the internal investigation we announced at the end of September. The investigation is focused on payments relating to permits for certain company-owned facilities in India and whether such payments were made improperly and in possible violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws. First, I think it's important to note that we do not anticipate any impact on our ability to continue to provide the quality services our clients expect from us. 
Second, as disclosed in the Form 10-Q we filed this morning, we've identified approximately $5 million in potentially improper payments to date. We've evaluated the effect of such payments and concluded that they are not material and do not require a restatement of our historical financial statements. Karen will provide additional details on this in a few minutes. 
Third and also disclosed this morning, we discovered in the course of the investigation that certain members of senior management may have been aware of or participated in the matters under investigation. Any such conduct would be inconsistent with our core values. Based on the results of the investigation to date, those who may have been involved are no longer with the company or in a senior management position. 
Finally, I would like to reaffirm our strong commitment to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We voluntarily disclosed the matters under investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in September, and we've been fully cooperating with both agencies. Based on the results of the investigation to date, we have already started and will continue to enhance our internal controls and compliance programs. 
Let me now turn to the rest of the business. Today and moving forward, what remains most essential to Cognizant's success is our unwavering focus on our clients. Their changing needs are the inspiration for our strategy, and we are actively executing that strategy. As we look ahead, we believe our market opportunity has never been greater. That's because with more technology in every product built and behind every customer experience and more data generated at every turn, our clients' businesses are and will continue to become increasingly technology intensive. Our opportunity then is to work with these clients to help them win by making the fundamental technology-enabled changes throughout their organizations that are required for them to compete in this new technology and data-intensive world. 
We have spoken to you in past calls about our 3 strategic initiatives designed to enable this kind of work across our clients' businesses from front to back. We recently took an important step in executing this strategy by aligning and branding all our capabilities into 3 practice areas: Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technology. 
Our Cognizant digital business practice works with clients to reshape their products and business models and the resulting impact on how organizations interact with their customers, employees and partners. Our approach combines data science, design thinking and deep industry and process knowledge with solid technology capabilities to unite the physical and virtual aspects of a company's offerings seamlessly across every channel. Together, we identify insights, develop business strategies and design prototype and scale meaningful experiences. 
Our Cognizant digital operations practice helps clients reengineer, digitize, manage and operate their most essential business processes, lowering operating costs, improving user experiences and delivering better outcomes and top line growth. Across the practice, we are creating automated data-driven platforms and industry utilities. We help clients run better by applying traditional optimization levers, and we help them run differently by creating competitive advantage through process excellence, which often leads to more effective operating models and corresponding top line revenue growth. 
And our Cognizant digital systems and technology practice works with clients to simplify, modernize and secure IT infrastructure and applications, unlocking the power trapped in their technology environments. We help clients create and evolve systems that meet their needs in the modern enterprise by delivering industry-leading standards of performance, cost and flexibility. 
Now the names of these practices -- of these practice areas reflect our belief that digital technology must be embedded as an integral part of all our offerings. All 3 practice areas work in close partnership with our vertical and geographic businesses and with Cognizant Business Consulting to ensure tight alignment and market relevance. 
Let me underscore how central this is to what differentiates Cognizant. When we say digital, we're not talking just about building user interfaces or implementing digital marketing, but about creating industry-specific solutions woven deeply into the workings of an organization to create new levels of value enterprise-wide. 
In summary, our clients are finding it unique and differentiating that Cognizant can consult with them to build digital businesses, operations and systems. For example, we're helping insurance companies go beyond managing claims to preventing losses with the power of predictive analytics. We're working with health care companies to bring payers, providers and patients together on an integrated platform that reduces waste and improves health outcomes. And we're helping manufacturers evolve from producing stand-alone goods to orchestrating entire ecosystems of smart, connected products. 
But as much as we are focused on the opportunities of today, looking ahead of evolving client needs is one of Cognizant's core strengths. We continue to develop innovative products and services, part of what you've heard us refer to as our Horizon 3 capabilities, through an internal investment program that powers long-term growth opportunities for Cognizant and our clients. 
First, the Cognizant global technology office identifies emerging technologies with the potential to create real business value. Then, Cognizant Accelerator scales the most promising technologies, product-izing services solutions and business models and speeding them to market. Together, these teams have spearheaded our entry into SMAC and IoT, for example, and today, they are working to realize the potential of developing technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain and to incubate new IP-based offerings. 
As we plan for 2017 and beyond, in addition to continuing to scale our comprehensive services portfolio, we're expanding our vertical and geographic focus as well. We're seeing increased traction with clients across Continental Europe, Asia Pacific and the public sector who are finding our comprehensive capabilities unique in their markets. In closing, it's clear that, today, our clients realize digital should be an enterprise-wide endeavor and that they need a comprehensive partner like Cognizant capable of working across every aspect of the organization that technology should enrich: business, operations and systems. 
Let me now turn the call over to our new President, Raj Mehta. On our last earnings call, we introduced you to Raj, a long-standing Cognizant leader. He's been a Cognizant associate since 1997, building strong relationships with clients throughout his 20 years at Cognizant and leading many of our market-facing and delivery teams in driving industry-leading growth. Now as President, he has direct responsibility for the overall P&L of Cognizant's operations. 
Raj will talk to you about the success we're already having in executing our strategy from his perspective running these businesses. Raj?"

I'm glad to be here and honored to be taking the role of President at this important time in Cognizant's journey. Anyone who has followed the company over the years knows that we stand for 3 things: a relentless focus on our clients, making sure we have world-class teams that deliver consistently for them and scaling our capabilities to address new client needs. I know we're succeeding when clients tell me that working with us feels different. As we help clients with the shifts they need to make in the digital era, I'm doubling down on the principles that have made us successful so far: client focus, world-class teams and scaling capabilities, while maintaining our flexible collaborative way of working. 
In working closely with clients across our industry businesses, we see that they face many of the same underlying challenges. They need to deliver the convenient experiences people expect today across their complex organizations. They need to develop the operational agility to respond to fast-changing business needs. They need to free up dollars to invest in innovation and transformation by optimizing and modernizing their legacy IT systems. 
It's these challenges that our practices, Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technologies are focused on helping clients answer. Working closely with Cognizant Business Consulting and domain experts from our industry businesses, we are creating frameworks, platforms and solutions that clients are finding valuable as they pursue next-level savings and new revenue streams. 
Now I'll review the performance of each of our industry verticals, highlighting key trends and some of the areas we're focusing on with our clients.  Our Banking and Financial Services segment was up 1.8% sequentially and 7.1% year-over-year. During Q3, the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and the prolonged low-rate interest environment that we have commented on throughout 2016 continued to moderate spending at several of our larger banking clients. Our super-regional banking businesses continued to perform well as many of those clients look to us for solutions which both optimize costs and generate revenue. While we've seen a slowdown in spending in recent months with several of our insurance clients who are also pressured by the low interest rate environment, demand has remained solid over the past year. Clients have been particularly interested in Cognizant digital operations solutions that transform underwriting and claims processes through managed services or other outcome-based delivery models. 
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 3.5% sequentially and 5.7% year-over-year. The industry consolidation among several of the largest U.S. payers continues to weigh on our healthcare payer practice. Still, we remain positive that the fundamental shifts underway in the market will create long-term opportunities. Through solutions from our Cognizant digital operations practice that combine TriZetto software and Cognizant services, we are well positioned to help clients deal effectively with this disruption. 
In our Life Sciences business, demand has picked up steadily over the past year as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. In particular, we're seeing a trend towards multiservice line deals, leveraging analytics, cloud technologies and platforms. 
Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 2.8% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Strength in manufacturing helped to offset ongoing softness in retail. A number of retail clients have moderated their discretionary spending over this past year as consumer spending has been weak. Cognizant digital business has seen growing demand among manufacturing clients who wanted help in transforming the products they make through sensors, IoT and analytics. They're also looking for solutions that increase the productivity of core IT infrastructure and application services. 
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.7% sequentially and 13.6% year-over-year. Last quarter, we highlighted that macroeconomic uncertainty was causing a slowdown in decision-making for our information, media and entertainment clients. This has largely been offset by a rebound in our communications business. 
Let me give you a few examples how Cognizant is partnering with clients in engagements that are pivoting their businesses and shifting their industries in meaningful ways. Let's talk first about KeyBank. Cognizant has partnered with KeyBank on a variety of different initiatives over the past 10 years, assisting in significant projects like the recent integration of their acquisition of First Niagara Bank. Today, KeyBank wants to leverage digital to compete and lead in their category, and they have started that journey with Cognizant. We are working together to simplify the way they do business and offer their customers streamlined experiences, financial wellness tools and digital product offers and services. 
Cognizant is helping with the implementation of a transition to the Oracle Banking Platform. As part of our work, we're helping and delivering improved digital experiences on web and mobile interfaces, reengineering business processes and enabling new technology architecture for the bank's retail digital channel. This retail digital channel modernization is the first wave of the transformation, but we'll expand the use of this platform to manage other core processes and to deliver new differentiated services to customers within the coming year. 
Let me tell you about another project we're doing in the manufacturing space, helping a top 5 auto manufacturer change what people expect from their cars. As sales in developed markets plateau, our client is looking to serve new needs of their customers by offering a range of transportation services and solutions. We are their strategic partner, helping to develop the strategy and user experiences and to build the platform that will be the backbone of an evolving new ecosystem of offerings. While this platform will initially focus on areas such as parking, vehicle health and retail and rewards program, the data captured by the platform will eventually be used to model how people will move differently in the future. We will work with our client to develop this and other potential opportunities to expand the services that they offer to their customers. 
Finally, I would like to highlight a growing part of Cognizant digital systems and technology, where our deep knowledge of clients' legacy environments enable us to modernize their IT by migrating to cloud-based solutions, utilizing providers such as AWS. A couple of recent examples. We recently worked with LexisNexis to develop a cloud-based solution on AWS that supports search capabilities on a database of over 2 billion searchable documents on their news archive platform. For Sotheby's, we migrated their critical business applications, including their flagship website, from an on-premise data center to AWS. For both clients, this is a major step towards -- forward towards the modernization of their IT infrastructure. In future calls, you'll continue to hear more from me about what Cognizant and our clients are focusing on together, how we're building world-class teams to serve them better and how we're scaling our capabilities to meet changing needs. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Karen to discuss our financial performance."
386024,407279165,1079117,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. As Raj mentioned, the business performed within expectations as third quarter revenue of $3.45 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of 2.5% and a year-over-year increase of 8.4%.",1272,"Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. As Raj mentioned, the business performed within expectations as third quarter revenue of $3.45 billion was within our guided range and represented sequential growth of 2.5% and a year-over-year increase of 8.4%. We had a negative currency headwind which impacted sequential revenue growth by $24 million or approximately 70 basis points and year-over-year revenue growth by $42 million or 130 basis points. 
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.3%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 was $0.01 above our guidance range of $0.82 to $0.85. As a reminder, the remittance of cash from India to the U.S. that occurred in the second quarter had an incremental tax impact of $24 million in quarter 3 and is expected to have a similar impact in the fourth quarter. The tax impact of this transaction had a $0.04 per share impact on our Q3 GAAP EPS that was excluded from our non-GAAP EPS calculation due to the nonrecurring nature of the transaction. 
Before I provide a detailed commentary on the quarter's performance, let me provide some additional color on the ongoing internal investigation, which is being overseen by our audit committee. As Frank noted, based on the results of the investigation to date, we are not restating our historical financial statements. At present, the investigation has identified a total of approximately $5 million in potentially improper payments for certain company-owned facilities in India. Of that amount, based on the preliminary results of the investigation to date and as disclosed in our Form 10-Q and earnings release, we determined that it was appropriate at this time to record an out-of-period correction of $3.1 million related to certain of these payments. 
Also, as disclosed in the Form 10-Q, we announced a determination of a material weakness as of December 31, 2015 and the subsequent interim periods. As based on the results of the investigation to date, certain members of senior management may have participated in or failed to take action to prevent the making of potentially improper payments by either overwriting or failing to enforce the controls established by the company relating to real estate and procurement, principally in connection with permits for certain facilities in India. We have already taken and continue to take remediation measures in the areas of procurement and accounts payable as they relate to real estate transactions in India. 
Now turning to third quarter performance. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57.4% and 42.6% of revenue, respectfully (sic) [ respectively ], for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 2.4% sequentially and 6.9% year-over-year. Outsourcing services revenue grew 2.6% sequentially and 10.3% from Q3 a year ago, driven by strength across digital operations and the infrastructure portion of Cognizant digital systems and technology. 
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 3.3% sequentially and 7.9% year-over-year. Europe declined 1.7% sequentially after a 4.4% negative currency impact and grew 5.6% from last year after an 8.3% negative currency impact. Growth in Europe was driven primarily by the ramp of work coming from recent wins, particularly in markets such as Germany and the Nordics. The U.K. declined 5.7% sequentially and 2.3% year-over-year after a 7% and a 13.9% negative currency impact respectfully (sic) [ respectively ]. Continental Europe grew 3.5% sequentially and 17% over the prior year. We have established a solid foothold on the continent and expect this to continue to be a driver of future growth. Finally, we saw continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up 3.8% sequentially and 23.2% year-over-year. 
During the third quarter, 37.5% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 322. 
We added 11,500 net new hires in the quarter. Annualized attrition of 16.6% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was down 350 basis points from the year-ago period. While attrition remains slightly elevated, we are pleased with the year-over-year decline as we continue to enhance our various employee engagement initiatives. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 255,800 employees globally, of which 239,500 were service delivery staff. Offshore utilization was 73%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates in our training program was 79%, and on-site utilization was 90% during the quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this was up by $390 million from the quarter ending June 30 and up by $861 million from the year-ago period. 
Moving on to receivables, which were $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 74.5 days. This is roughly flat with last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $424 million, down from $451 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 58% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October, and the decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $900 million at the end of the quarter, and there were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. 
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated $594 million. Financing activities were a $119 million use of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were $74 million during the quarter. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased just over 2.5 million shares for a total cost of $145 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 608.5 million shares for the quarter. As of the end of Q3, we had repurchased 48.8 million shares for a total cost of $2 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $3 billion. We had approximately $1 billion remaining unutilized. 
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year. For the full year 2016, we are trimming the high end of our revenue expectation to be in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.53 billion, which represents growth of approximately 8.5% to 9%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.51 billion, including $18 million of incremental negative currency impact due to the recent weakening of the pound sterling. As is the typical pattern in the fourth quarter, client furloughs, seasonality of our retail practice and fewer billing days will have an impact on sequential revenue growth. 
During the fourth quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.88. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. For the remainder of the year, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the India share buyback transaction. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 609 million shares. 
For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.38 to $3.41. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 609.6 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 35%, including an approximate $238 million impact from the incremental tax from the India remittance.

We continue to believe that the benefits of outsourcing, including the ability to attract talent, scale efficiently and bring deep technology and domain knowledge have not changed, and the benefits clients can -- they can't replicate that on their own. So in summary, right, the range of skills that are required and the technology has broadened and not narrowed, and we're still very looking forward in terms of continue to growing these businesses in that respect."

Look, I think the healthcare business at Cognizant -- let me -- before I talk about the specifics, let me just back us up, right? I think that healthcare, particularly as it relates to the healthcare payers, is really a core area of deep, deep strength at Cognizant. It has historically been one of our strongest verticals. And with the addition of the capabilities from the TriZetto acquisition, I think has further strengthened our position there. The combination of Cognizant's services capabilities with TriZetto's platform capabilities has enabled us to create a truly unique platform-based offering in that marketplace, and we continue to see good traction in services and solutions that combine TriZetto software and Cognizant's core services capabilities. The pipeline of opportunities around that area remains robust, and I continue to be optimistic about the opportunities there. Offsetting that, as we've said to you over the course of this year, is some slowness in the spending from the biggest payers who are particularly the ones that are involved in the potential large combinations. My -- it's a little too early to forecast what happens with those payers as we go into 2017. But as a general matter, I would say that we've seen them slow spending, discretionary spending through this period of uncertainty. And so as those situations get resolved one way or the other, my expectation is that we have a great portfolio of services to offer that group of customers, and we will be as relevant, if not more relevant, than we've ever been to serving those needs of those customers."

So let me start with the 3 practice areas that we discussed on the call today. We've refocused and rebranded our offerings under these 3 broad practice areas: Cognizant digital business, Cognizant digital operations and Cognizant digital systems and technology. And it's not an oversight that the word digital appears in all 3 of the practice names. The reason is that we -- as we've said to you for quite some time now, our core and fundamental belief is that digital technology is really embedded in all areas and all aspects of our business in some way, shape or form. And so Cognizant digital business uses digital technologies to create and deliver meaningful business experiences for clients. Cognizant digital operations uses digital technology to enable and automate core business operations in our clients' core transaction processing areas. And then, of course, Cognizant digital systems and technology is focused on modernizing, securing and scaling legacy technology environments. All of -- digital exists in all those places. To your question about CBC or Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Business Consulting is really an enabler across all 3 of those practice areas. The business consulting capability is woven in across all of those 3 practice areas. And really, a lot of the work that we are doing today in Cognizant Business Consulting is what I consider to be tip of the spear kind of work that then leads to downstream work in one or more of those 3 big practice areas. We've clearly seen digital move beyond just high-end consulting to implementation. Raj, for example, spoke in his prepared comments about the work we are doing to migrate -- that we've done to migrate 2 big clients to cloud-based AWS environments. That's an example of what I think of as core technology work that's enabled by new digital technologies. And like that, across all the practices we're seeing not just sort of tip of the spear consulting work, but also downstream implementation work that relates to digital."

So on the first one, on digital, as we've talked about and, I think, we demonstrated in our conversation today around the script, right, we think that digital is becoming really an enterprise-wide initiative. And as we've said, we think that the definition of digital and how people think about digital revenue will continue to evolve in the coming months and quarters. And so we have been reluctant, frankly, to define digital because we don't think there is a clear digital definition across the industry today. And we've talked about this notion of digital. It started in the front office and now has increasingly moved to the mid-office and the back office and hence, the alignment of our 3 practices that we talked around, around digital business, digital operations and digital systems and technology, which, I think, start to get at that notion that it really has become an enterprise-wide initiative for both clients and ourselves. And increasingly, we think it will impact all of the segments of the business. In fact, it already is today. So we have been reluctant to break out what's digital because how do you define a project whether it's got a digital component to it or is the entire project digital. So I think those definitions in the market will continue to evolve, and we'll continue to focus on that. I think in terms of margins, clearly, we have talked about staying in the 19% to 20% range. We have done that historically. And I think, certainly, for the foreseeable future, people should expect that, that is a comfortable range for us to operate in. It obviously gives us room to make investments to grow the business. Those investments continue to shift as we look at more platforms, as that business continues to expand as we continue to expand new skill sets and new offerings to support the digital marketplace. Those are most of the investments that we continue to focus on. But I think, from a modeling perspective, you should expect us to stay in the 19% to 20% range. From a capital allocation perspective, there's really no change in our strategy there. I think, as we've said in the past, people should expect that, over the course of a year, we will essentially maintain share neutrality. We have the buyback program available to us, and we will use that as and when we think it's appropriate to do that. And obviously, we demonstrated that with the number of shares that we bought back in Q3, and we still have about $1 billion left under that program as we look forward into Q4 and beyond."

I'll try to get to each of them. I would say that at a macro level, the -- our industry is one where -- well, first of all, the world continues to become more technology- and data-intensive. So that's sort of the 50,000-foot view. Technology is becoming more complex to implement the skill sets. As Raj pointed out in his prepared -- in his, I think, Q&A a minute ago, is we have a much broader range of skills that are required to implement new technologies today. And so we believe that, that makes services firms like Cognizant as relevant, if not more relevant than we've been in the past. It's also a fragmented industry, so the opportunity to gain market share and the opportunity to capture markets is very much there. And we believe that -- if you drill down further, that when you look at our footprint of industries that we serve, if you look at the footprint of geographies that we currently operate in, there remains significant growth opportunities in places where we are underpenetrated. And so when you put all of that together, we believe that we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us, that our ability to invest to capture those growth opportunities exists in the company with our financial formula. And so that's our -- that forms a core thesis and a core basis for how we think about the business going forward. As it relates to acquisitions, we've said that we will continue to focus. We have a robust M&A program. We look at, traditionally, smaller tuck-in acquisitions. That's been the primary focus. We will continue to do that. I would expect that, as we go forward, you'll see us focus on those kinds of acquisitions. I would expect that we would be more focused on digital and making digital acquisitions as we look to the next few quarters to bolster our digital capability. I think we've got good strong digital capabilities, but particularly, as we look to new industries and geographies, I think you'll see us using inorganic means to grow faster there. Typically, when we do small acquisitions, the margin profile of those companies may not be where the Cognizant margin profile is. But through our ability to -- largely, Keith, to cross-sell their services into our core business, we are rapidly able to bring them to Cognizant average margins. And so I expect we'll continue to do that. For the small tuck-ins, if there's an acquisition that's, when we buy it, not at Cognizant margins, I'm not too concerned about that because we've shown that we can bring those back up to Cognizant levels through our ability to cross-sell."

It perhaps is a combination of sort of being in the midpoint of the range this quarter. But more broadly, I just want to get a sense for the business environment, both fundamentally and overall from a macro perspective relative to, let's say, 3 months ago. And maybe at a high level, sort of maybe Karen can describe why the high end of the guide comes down. Obviously, we've got the incremental FX in there, but any other factors? And as it relates to the FCPA investigation, are we confident at this point that it's been fully scoped at that kind of $5 million-or-so range? And I guess I was surprised at how quickly you've sort of gotten clarity on this."

I think in terms of the business environment, I wouldn't actually say there's really been any change in the last 3 months. So obviously, earlier in the year, we had talked about sluggishness in Financial Services and health care. And then, over the summer, post the Brexit vote, while we haven't seen disruption, I would say, specific to Brexit, we certainly saw some concern among insurance clients as well as Financial Services, and we talked about that on our last call. I wouldn't say there's really been any change in that environment or deterioration in that environment. I think it's continued as it was in the quarter -- or in Q3. Obviously, the pound has deteriorated, and so that resulted in an additional $18 million negative headwind as we went into Q4 based on that. And if you had looked -- if we had left the range where it was for Q4, obviously, it would have been a very broad range, and certainly more significant growth than we'd ever added in Q4. And we thought it was appropriate to taper the top end of the growth range down into something that we thought was more reasonable based on typical buying patterns in Q4, given the fact that there are lower bill days, there are furloughs. The retail practice, as you know, shuts down quite significantly in Q4. As retail clients get ready for the holiday, they shut down all discretionary spending, typically right about now. So I think what we're seeing in Q4 is a very typical seasonal pattern for the business other than the impact of the FX. And I'm sorry, can you repeat your question about the FCPA investigation?"

We were able to get to a place where we thought it was appropriate to record the $3.1 million of the $5 million as an out-of-period adjustment in Q3, but we will continue the investigation until we're confident that we've tracked it all down."
