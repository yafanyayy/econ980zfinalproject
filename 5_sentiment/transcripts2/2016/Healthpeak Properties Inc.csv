Joining me this morning are Tim Schoen, Chief Financial Officer; Justin Hutchens, Chief Investment Officer of Senior Housing and Care; and John Lu, EVP of Corporate Finance and Investments.  
2015 was a very active year for us on almost every front, and we are proud of the performance we achieved in our operating portfolio. I will be covering these accomplishments later in the call, but I'd like to start with HCR ManorCare. 
As many of you are aware, the postacute and skilled nursing industry has transformed remarkably over the past 5 years, beginning with the 2011 RUGs-IV cuts. The 3 most impactful trends have been: lower reimbursement rates, accelerated payer mix shift towards managed care and increased regulation and risk management requirements for patient care delivery.
These changes have prompted operators to become more efficient while continuing to provide their quality care. Over the long term, these changes should ultimately benefit patients, payers and quality providers like HCR ManorCare, whose core operations have a high quality and mix and better margins compared to their peers.
We are seeing heightened volatility in the public postacute operators due to these industrywide changes and headwinds. HCR's the same challenges, which resulted in their normalized fixed charge coverage declining 4 basis points to 1.07x for calendar year 2015.
Both we and HCR management were disappointed with HCR's results in the fourth quarter, which is typically a seasonally strong quarter. These results were impacted by core operating performance weakness and $14 million of unfavorable nonroutine items, including short-term disruption related to the sales process of the 50 nonstrategic assets, 33 which have closed to date with 17 still in process, so some disruptions will continue into the first half of this year, as well as legal costs associated with the Department of Justice defense. 
For 2016, HCR anticipates normalized EBITDAR of $577 million before the temporary impact of the pending asset sales and Department of Justice defense costs. After adjusting for these items, HCP estimates 2016 EBITDAR to be $555 million, supporting their ability to meet the master lease obligations.  
Furthermore, we have applied sensitivities to key assumptions in their forecast to produce a potential range of outcomes. Our forecast for HCR's 2016 EBITDAR ranges from $505 million to $555 million, resulting in a fixed charge coverage range of 1.06x to 1.16x. Our range includes the contractual -- current contractual rent and the 3% increase that goes into effect in April.
With the declining trend of operating performance in the second half of 2015, the DS investment has been placed on cash basis effective January 1. In addition, given the lower growth outlook over the next few years, the carrying value of our HCR real estate portfolio was reduced by over $800 million to $5.2 billion as of year-end. Tim will cover the financial details shortly.
Our other objectives outlined in the April 2015 lease amendment are proceeding on track. We have received fee ownership in 7 of HCR's 9 recently built postacute facilities, with the remaining to close by April. And we have sold 33 of 50 properties, generating proceeds of $280 million.  The remaining facilities are all under contract and scheduled to close over the next 2 quarters, which will bring total proceeds to $350 million.
Resolving the HCR ManorCare portfolio issue is our highest priority. Our goals in resolving the HCR ManorCare challenges are: reduce our concentration to HCR as an operator, improve the coverage and credit quality of our lease and ensure HCR's high quality care and service delivery continues. We have engaged Capital as our financial adviser to pursue discussions with HCR ManorCare's management team to jointly explore all solutions to achieve our goals.
Now let me turn the call over to Tim to discuss our financial results and 2016 guidance."

Let me start with our fourth quarter results. For the quarter, we reported a NAREIT FFO loss of $0.99 per share, reflecting noncash impairments of $836 million related to our HCR ManorCare investments. The impairments reduced the carrying value o f our HCR ManorCare DSO real estate portfolio from $6 billion to $5.2 billion at year-end, which approximates the fair value of the assets based on market level coverage and cap rate assumptions. In addition, the carrying value of our 9% equity investment in OpCo was reduced by $19 million.
Excluding the effect of impairments and other items totaling $1.79 per share for the quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.80 and FAD of $0.67 per share, representing growth rates of 1% and 2% respectively compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The results benefited from accretive acquisitions closed in 2015.
Fourth quarter same-store cash NOI performance declined 30 basis points compared to prior year due to the HCR ManorCare lease amendment in April 2015. Excluding the HCR ManorCare portfolio, we achieved solid same-store cash and NOI growth of 3.5%, led by a 7.8% increase in life science and a 6.6% increase in RIDEA, which Justin will cover in a few minutes.  Also benefiting the quarter was a $0.01 per share gain from monetizing our senior housing development project in Olney, Maryland.
Turning to our full year 2015 results. We reported a full year 2015 NAREIT FFO loss of $0.02 per share that was primarily impacted by noncash impairments related to HCR ManorCare. Excluding the effects of impairments and other items, 2015 FFO as adjusted was $3.16 and FAD was $2.72 per share, representing year-over-year growth rates of 4% and 6% respectively.  The earnings performance, despite the amended HCR ManorCare lease, was driven by same-store cash NOI growth of 3.7% from 75% of our portfolio and accretive acquisitions totaling $4 billion since 2014. 
In addition, the results included a $0.04 of onetime gains from monetizing 3 senior housing development loans. Absent these gains on a recurring basis, FFO as adjusted per share increased 3% and FAD increased 4% in 2015.  
Overall, same-store cash NOI for the year increased 50 basis points, consistent with our last guidance. Our 2015 cash dividend of $2.26 per share resulted in a FAD payout ratio of 83%.
Moving on to financing activities and balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, we raised $600 million of senior unsecured loans at a 4% coupon. Proceeds were used to refinance a $500 million bond maturity last week, representing 36% of our 2016 total maturities, and to pay down on the revolver. During 2015, we successfully raised $2.3 billion of debt at an attractive blended rate of 3.5%.
We continued to deliver on the capital recycling front, generating $430 million of additional proceeds during the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $560 million. Proceeds for the quarter included $208 million from the sale of HCR ManorCare's nonstrategic assets, $110 million from creation of a new institutional JV on our Memorial Hermann MOB portfolio and $45 million from monetizing our interest on MOB Ventures 3 and 4.  
We improved our liquidity and financial leverage with these proceeds, although the benefit to financial leverage is offset by our fourth quarter noncash impairments.  Leverage ended the year at 45%.
Fixed charge coverage and net debt to adjusted EBITDA for 2015 were 3.9x and 5.6x respectively.  Secured debt ratio improved to 4.4% as we continued to refinance higher-rate mortgage maturities with lower cost on secured notes. 
At year-end, we had $1.6 billion of liquidity.
Next, our full year 2016 guidance and dividend. The majority of our portfolio continues to generate organic growth, complemented by recent accretive investments, but our earnings continues to be moderated by the HCR ManorCare lease restructure as we enter 2016. Before providing our 2016 guidance, I would like to discuss a few important assumptions reflected in our projections that impact year-over-year comparison.
First, beginning January 2016, income from our HCR ManorCare investments will be recognized on a cash basis, resulting in a reduction to our FFO run rate totaling $150 million or $0.32 per share, $90 million of which was previously recognized in revenue, with the remaining $60 million in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures.  There is no impact to our cash performance metrics including same-store and FAD. 
Our 2016 guidance reflects contractual rent of $456 million from our HCR ManorCare real estate portfolio, inclusive of a scheduled 3% increase in April.  In addition, our guidance reflects $130 million of proceeds in the first half of 2016, bringing total proceeds from HCR ManorCare's nonstrategic asset sales to $350 million.
Second, you will recall that as part of our 2014 Brookdale transaction, Brookdale agreed to pay $55 million of lease restructure payments and installments over a 3-year period as consideration to convert 49 assets from a triple-net lease to RIDEA. Starting in July 2016, the payments stepped down and will be phased out by the third quarter of 2017. Also as part of this transaction, we have a rent reduction of $6.5 million this year in exchange for canceling 49 purchase options on Brookdale's triple-net portfolio.
Third, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Genentech, who exercised their purchase option on our life science campus in South San Francisco. The first tranche of the transaction will close in November for a price of $310 million and the second tranche closing in 2018 for $270 million.  Proceeds will be reinvested to fund our development at the Cove in South San Francisco, including the recently commenced Phase 2.
Lastly, in 2016, we will continue to reflect our Four Seasons unsecured note on nonaccrual status, and we'll record interest payments received as a reduction to our investment.
Our guidance does not include the impact of any future acquisitions or dispositions other than what I just mentioned. 
With these assumptions, we expect full year 2016 FFO to range from $2.74 to $2.80 per share, which reflects placing our HCR ManorCare portfolio on a cash basis; FAD to range from $2.62 to $2.68 per share; same-store cash NOI growth to increase between 1.5% and 2.5%; the remaining 75% of our portfolio, excluding HCR ManorCare, to increase between 2.3% and 3.3%.
The midpoint of our same-store growth rates by asset class include: senior housing at 1.75%, which is impacted by the Brookdale triple-net portfolio I just mentioned and reflects RIDEA growth of 3.5%. Postacute SNF is forecasted to decline by 60 basis points due to the HCR ManorCare lease amendment in April 2015. In our operating office platform, life science is projected to grow 6.7% and MOB at 2.4%. And finally, our hospital segment is projected to grow 2.2%.
Allow me to quickly run through a few other assumptions. G&A is forecasted to be $87 million including stock-based compensation of $20 million; amortization of below-market lease intangibles and deferred revenue of $4 million; amortization of deferred financing costs of $21 million; straight-line rents of $16 million; other depreciation and amortization of $12 million; lease restructure payments of $17 million related to the 2014 Brookdale transaction, reflecting a step down in the installments payments starting in the second half of 2016; our 49% share of FFO contribution attrition from the CCRC joint venture to range from $28 million to $30 million; and FAD contribution to range from $45 million to $49 million inclusive of nonrefundable interest fees; leasing cost and generation tenant capital expenditures of $90 million, representing 5% of cash NOI; in addition, total development, redevelopment and first-generation capital investment of $410 million, including $150 million in 2016 for the completion of Phase 1 and commencement of Phase 2 life science development at the Cove South San Francisco.
I'll conclude with a few words on our 2016 dividend. Last month, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.565 to $0.575 per share, marking the 31st consecutive year of dividend increases and continuing HCP's representation in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index. The annualized dividend of $2.30 represents an increase of $0.04 per share over 2015. 
After taking into account the increase in the dividend and based on the midpoint of our guidance, our projected 2016 payout ratio is in the mid-80% range. As a result, we expect to retain $165 million in cash flow after dividends and recurring capital expenditures to continue growing our portfolio.
With that summary of our financial results, I will now turn the call over to Justin. Justin?"

Let me start by highlighting our senior housing portfolio performance. Our total senior housing same-store cash NOI grew 3.7% in 2015, driven largely by rent steps and in part to our Brookdale RIDEA portfolio. We are encouraged by Brookdale's indication that their merger integration is in their rearview mirror and by the recent additions to their senior management team. These factors, along with a significant program max CapEx investment, have contributed to the recent improvement in growth in our RIDEA properties, and we expect them to have a positive impact on the triple-net portfolio.  We are in regular communication with Brookdale management regarding ways to work together to create value through asset repositioning, operating and market analytics and identifying opportunities to call the portfolio.
Our same-store RIDEA platform reported a very strong fourth quarter, with year-over-year same-store growth of 6.6% driven by improved occupancy rate and expense management. We are encouraged by this performance and are particularly pleased to see positive momentum, where fourth quarter occupancy grew 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis and 70 basis points on a sequential basis, outperforming the average by 90 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points sequentially. The entire Brookdale RIDEA portfolio has performed consistent with the solid results.
Our triple-net senior housing portfolio has a trailing 12-month cash flow coverage of 1.07x, down 2 basis points from the prior quarter. The triple-net portfolio is largely represented by the leases with Brookdale, where the coverage in 2016 is expected to improve by 2 basis points due to a contractual rent reduction that was committed in conjunction with the 2014 transaction with Brookdale that Tim mentioned earlier.  We remain actively engaged with our operators through our asset management platform, continuously reviewing local market dynamics, operating trends and the physical condition of our properties. 
We continue to monitor new supply in our senior housing markets and have included a new presentation of this information, which is featured on Page 27 of the supplemental. We measure new supply using a 5-mile radius based on a recent study showing that the average time a consumer is willing to travel to a local business is approximately 15 minutes. Our internal research indicates that a 5-mile analysis is generally consistent with that of a 15-minute drive time. 21.2% of our RIDEA NOI or 2.7% of our total portfolio income has new construction or expansions of similar care types within a 5-mile radius. The large majority of this new supply will open in 2016.  We are mindful of the potential pressure on pricing and occupancy that new supply could cause in these markets. However, we like our market position relative to the new higher-cost competitors.
Moving on to investments. During the fourth quarter, we expanded our relationship with Brookdale and MBK with $57 million of investments in 4 senior housing communities, all stabilized with occupancy above 90%. Our priority pipeline includes $400 million of senior housing communities with new and existing operator relationships. We plan to fund these investments from the capital recycling and the assumption of in-place debt. We are primarily focused on acquiring private pay communities that offer both assisted living and memory care services and located in targeted markets with favorable supply-demand characteristics.
I would like to emphasize that we remain conservative and selective as we advanced capital and the senior housing assets. As part of our underwriting and due diligence process, we carefully scrutinize operators' track record, financial alignment and local market industry fundamentals, including potential impact from wage pressures and new supply.
And now Lauralee will cover our medical office, life science and international portfolios."

As I opened, 2015 was a very active year for us on almost every front, and we are proud of the performance we've achieved despite operator challenges. In 2015, we sourced over $2 billion of accretive investments at a blended 6.8% cash yield across 4 of our property sectors, bringing our 2-year investment total to $4 billion at a blended 7.3%. These investments are performing at or above our underwriting, including our CCRC and Chartwell portfolios managed by Brookdale; our international investment with HC-One and Maria Mallaband; our medical office acquisitions of on-campus MOBs in Philadelphia and Houston; and our premier life science development, the Cove. We accomplished also 90% of our 2015 growth through our existing partners, but we also added new high-quality relationships, including Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, MBK Senior Living and several companies within our life science portfolio. 
We remain selective and disciplined in allocating capital, with 3/4 of our 2015 investments concentrated in private pay senior housing and on-campus medical office buildings. And more than half of our investments were completed through joint venture partnerships, emphasizing our focus on mutual alignment. 
One common theme we have seen over the past year is strong increases in occupancy across our operating portfolio, supported by the location of our properties and their competitive position in their markets. We delivered occupancy growth in our RIDEA, life science and medical operations portfolios. 
Justin already covered RIDEA portfolio growth, so I will focus my comments on our office platform.
Our life science portfolio has had strong leasing momentum this year, driving occupancy to a new all-time high of over 98%, a 300 basis point improvement over prior year. We have now preleased half of our state-of-the-art development at The Cove with Cytomix Therapeutics and Dinali Therapeutics as lead tenants. Cytomix will lease 76,000 square feet beginning in the fourth quarter. They've recently had a successful IPO based on their cancer fighting research. Dinali will lease 38,000 square feet beginning in the third quarter. Led by former Genentech neuroscience leadership, Dinali is a private company focused on neurodegenerative diseases and seeded with over 200 million, the largest first round venture financing in biotech history. We are very pleased to welcome both Cytomix and Dinali as our first 2 clients at the Cove, and we look forward to continue to build more relationships with innovative and growing companies like them. 
In response to our Phase 1 leasing success and continued strong demand from life science users in South San Francisco, where direct vacancy is still below 1%, we recently commenced the $185 million development of Phase 2, which will add 2 Class A buildings totaling up to 200 to 3,000 square feet and is expected to be delivered by the third quarter of 2017. We acquired Edgewater Science and Technology Park in South San Francisco for $83 million. The 6-building campus was recently renovated and is 100% occupied. 
Our medical office portfolio also had a solid year of leasing with year-end occupancy close to 92%, representing 110 basis points of growth over the prior year driven by our strong retention rates of 83% and recent acquisitions. We have expanded our MOB platform by over 20% over the past 2 years, primarily with on-campus buildings while adding 11 new health system partners and expanding 2 existing relationships. We are partners with top-notch health systems in every regional area where we have a strong presence. For example, HCA, our largest relationship, has significant market share in 7 of our top 12 markets where we have at least 500,000 square feet of office space.
We won the Trust Memorial at Hermann, a leading hospital system in Houston with a 24% market share, who selected us as their partner to execute the monetization of their on-campus MOB portfolio. And they continued to select HCP as a capital partner. In January, we broke ground on a 170,000 square foot development on the campus of Memorial Hermann's Hospital. The development is 100% preleased and represents our third on-campus development project underway with them. 
In total, we have 6 MOBs under development or redevelopment, totaling 760,000 square feet, of which 5 are expected to be completed during the first half of the year.  Our MOB portfolio remains in great shape, with 40% of this year's lease expirations already addressed or in negotiations. We achieved solid growth in our non-HCR ManorCare portfolio, which represents 3/4 of HCP's business.
In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that solving the HCR ManorCare lease issue is our highest priority.

Firstly, we share enthusiasm about his new management team. offer a fresh perspective and very relevant experience on their respective backgrounds. And elevating Mary Sue , who has 25-plus years of senior housing operating experience, and her with seemed a great fit. So we're impressed with the management team, and we're optimistic about their ability to carry out their plan. They've talked about putting a more efficient operating structure in place, have a community-level feedback loop that's going to help them make decisions that simplify the business. They're tightening their use of incentives and going more shorter term than longer term in terms of price incentives. And the economies of scale that have as a large software operator in this space should come in purchasing power and reducing insurance costs. And so if you look at our triple-net portfolio, it was impacted significantly after integration because we have largely legacy Emeritus properties. Certainly the integration is behind us. We do think that there will be some new wage supply in, wage pressure on the fringes that, that portfolio will face. From HCP's standpoint, we're enhancing our asset management. We're going to have a similar focus on our triple-net portfolio that we've had on our RIDEA portfolio. And one example of that would be to continue to work out with Brookdale to deploy capital expenditures. There's about $50 million available for Brookdale to draw to invest in the triple-net portfolio. That would be a significant investment of a few thousand dollars per unit. Certainly, we've proven that, that has an impact on our RIDEA portfolio performance. We will look for some similar results in the triple-net portfolio over time. Having said all of that, a lot of this is fresh. I know Brookdale's talked about using 2016 as a year to really put the business plan in place and take advantage of their ability to execute on all the things I just mentioned. So we're not expecting a big pop, by any means, in the triple-net portfolio. But we're optimistic that they'll be stable, and we look forward to seeing the results of their business plan over time."

And that's impacted actually to compare to that 2.7%, only about 1.3% of our portfolio income. You know from our RIDEA results that we moved the growth rate to the impact.

Let me just step back a little bit on their business plan, and I'll talk about a number of things that relates to that question. If you step back to why they are where there are, I think it's important to look at this. Their senior management team has a tenure, and this is senior and divisional managers, of over 20 years. And the business plan that they've executed over a 20-year period has put themselves in position to be the market leader in terms of clinical and rehabilitation care and services. They've successfully done so. In the 11 market clusters where they operate, they are a leader in 9 of those. They're in second place in 2 of those. To your point, they achieved about a 66% percentage of the revenue that's in Medicare and in managed care. And if you take that 66% number, it's about twice the industry average. So they're uniquely impacted by this shift to managed care and reduced length of stay. And certainly, they've had to work through that. In some ways, they've done that. They have the hospice business that Lauralee mentioned earlier. They have an assisted living business that's been growing. They are looking in some tertiary markets to dedicate some beds to the memory care program that would accept Medicaid reimbursement to help stabilize cash flow. But they do remain committed to their core business. And if you're interested in how that plays out in a mature managed care market, can look at California. California is a state where they operate 7 properties and they have about 1,000 beds, so pretty good sample size. The length of stay in that portfolio is about 18% less than the rest of their company. They have only 40% of their admissions are coming from Medicare and 60% of managed care. So they would describe this is a mature managed care market. They actually grew admissions in California about 2.5% over this past year, and they grew operating income as well. So they found the the payer sources and they've been able to grow the business. And then I'd add another point to the core business. If you look at their business across the company, they've actually grown their admissions 1% a year, each of the last 4 years. So they are in fact, expanding market share. However, it has not been enough to overcome the reduced length of stay."

Joining me this morning are Tim Schoen, Chief Financial Officer; Justin Hutchens, Chief Investment Officer of Senior Housing and Care; and John Lu, EVP of Corporate Finance and Investments. 
2015 was a very active year for us on almost every front, and we are proud of the performance we achieved in our operating portfolio. I will be covering these accomplishments later in the call, but I'd like to start with HCR ManorCare. As many of you are aware, the post-acute and skilled nursing industry has transformed remarkably over the past 5 years, beginning with the 2011 RUGs-IV cuts. The 3 most impactful trends have been: lower reimbursement rates, accelerated payer mix shift towards managed care and increased regulation and risk management requirements for patient care delivery. These changes have prompted operators to become more efficient while continuing to provide their quality care. Over the long term, these changes should ultimately benefit patients, payers and quality providers like HCR ManorCare, whose core operations have a high-quality mix and better margins compared to their peers. 
We are seeing heightened volatility in the public post-acute operators due to these industry-wide changes and headwinds. HCR is confronting the same challenges, which resulted in their normalized fixed charge coverage declining 4 basis points to 1.07x for calendar year 2015. Both we and HCR management were disappointed with HCR's results in the fourth quarter, which is typically a seasonally stronger quarter. These results were impacted by core operating performance weakness and $14 million of unfavorable nonroutine items, including short-term disruption related to the sales process of the 50 nonstrategic assets, 33 of which have closed to date with 17 still in process so some disruptions will continue into the first half of this year; as well as legal costs associated with the Department of Justice defense. 
For 2016, HCR anticipates normalized EBITDAR of $577 million before the temporary impact from the pending asset sales and Department of Justice defense costs. After adjusting for these items, HCP estimates 2016 EBITDAR to be $555 million, supporting their ability to meet the master lease obligations. Furthermore, we have applied sensitivities to key census assumptions in their forecast to produce a potential range of outcomes. Our forecast for HCR's 2016 EBITDAR ranges from $505 million to $555 million, resulting in a fixed charge coverage range of 1.06x to 1.16x. Our range includes the contractual -- current contractual rent and the 3% increase that goes into effect in April.
With the declining trend of operating performance in the second half of 2015, the DFL investment has been placed on cash basis effective January 1. In addition, given the lower growth outlook over the next few years, the carrying value of our HCR real estate portfolio was reduced by over $800 million to $5.2 billion as of year-end. Tim will cover the financial details shortly.
Our other objectives outlined in the April 2015 lease amendment are proceeding on track. We have received fee ownership in 7 of HCR's 9 recently built post-acute facilities, with the remaining to close by April, and we have sold 33 of the 50 properties, generating proceeds of $280 million. The remaining facilities are all under contract and scheduled to close over the next 2 quarters, which will bring total proceeds to $350 million.
Resolving the HCR ManorCare portfolio issue is our highest priority. Our goals in resolving the HCR ManorCare challenges are: reduce our concentration to HCR as an operator, improve the coverage and credit quality of our lease and ensure HCR's high-quality care and service delivery continues. We have engaged Barclays Capital as our financial adviser to pursue discussions with HCR ManorCare's management team to jointly explore all solutions to achieve our goals.
Now let me turn the call over to Tim to discuss our financial results and 2016 guidance."

For the quarter, we reported a NAREIT FFO loss of $0.99 per share, reflecting noncash impairments of $836 million related to our HCR ManorCare investments. 
The impairments reduced the carrying value of our HCR ManorCare DFL real estate portfolio from $6 billion to $5.2 billion at year-end, which approximates the fair value of the assets based on market-level coverage and cap rate assumptions. In addition, the carrying value of our 9% equity investment in opco was reduced by $19 million. Excluding the impact of impairments and other items totaling $1.79 per share for the quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.80 and FAD of $0.67 per share, representing growth rates of 1% and 2%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The results benefited from accretive acquisitions closed in 2015.
Fourth quarter same-store cash NOI performance declined 30 basis points compared to prior year due to the HCR ManorCare lease amendment in April 2015. Excluding the HCR ManorCare portfolio, we achieved solid same-store cash NOI growth of 3.5%, led by a 7.8% increase in life science and a 6.6% increase in RIDEA, which Justin will cover in a few minutes. Also benefiting the quarter was a $0.01 per share gain from monetizing our senior housing development project in Olney, Maryland.
Turning to our full year 2015 results. We reported a full year 2015 NAREIT FFO loss of $0.02 per share that was primarily impacted by noncash impairments related to HCR ManorCare. Excluding the impact of impairments and other items, 2015 FFO as adjusted was $3.16 and FAD was $2.72 per share, representing year-over-year growth rates of 4% and 6%, respectively. The earnings performance, despite the amended HCR ManorCare lease, was driven by same-store cash NOI growth of 3.7% from 75% of our portfolio and accretive acquisitions totaling $4 billion since 2014. In addition, the results included a $0.04 of onetime gains from monetizing 3 senior housing development loans. 
Absent these gains, on a recurring basis, FFO as adjusted per share increased 3% and FAD increased 4% in 2015. Overall, same-store cash NOI for the year increased 50 basis points, consistent with our last guidance. Our 2015 cash dividend of $2.26 per share resulted in an FAD payout ratio of 83%.
Moving on to financing activities and balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, we raised $600 million of senior unsecured notes at a 4% coupon. Proceeds were used to refinance a $500 million bond maturity last week, representing 36% of our 2016 total maturities, and to pay down on the revolver. During 2015, we successfully raised $2.3 billion of debt at an attractive blended rate of 3.5%. 
We continued to deliver on the capital recycling front, generating $430 million of additional proceeds during the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $560 million. Proceeds for the quarter included $208 million from the sale of HCR ManorCare's nonstrategic assets, $110 million from creation of a new institutional JV on our Memorial Hermann MOB portfolio and $45 million from monetizing our interest in MOB Ventures III and IV. We improved our liquidity and financial leverage with these proceeds, although the benefit to financial leverage is offset by our fourth quarter noncash impairments. Leverage ended the year at 45%.
Fixed charge coverage and net debt to adjusted EBITDA for 2015 were 3.9x and 5.6x, respectively. Secured debt ratio improved to 4.4% as we continue to refinance higher-rate mortgage maturities with lower-cost unsecured notes. 
At year-end, we had $1.6 billion of liquidity.
Next, our full year 2016 guidance and dividend. The majority of our portfolio continues to generate organic growth, complemented by recent accretive investments, but our earnings continues to be moderated by the HCR ManorCare lease restructure as we enter 2016. Before providing our 2016 guidance, I would like to discuss a few important assumptions reflected in our projections that impact year-over-year comparison. 
First, beginning January 2016, income from our HCR ManorCare investments will be recognized on a cash basis, resulting in a reduction to our FFO run rate totaling $150 million or $0.32 per share, $90 million of which was previously recognized in DFL revenue, with the remaining $60 million in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures. There is no impact to our cash performance metrics, including same-store and FAD. Our 2016 guidance reflects contractual rent of $456 million from our HCR ManorCare real estate portfolio, inclusive of a scheduled 3% increase in April.  In addition, our guidance reflects $130 million of proceeds in the first half of 2016, bringing total proceeds from HCR ManorCare's nonstrategic asset sales to $350 million.
Second, you will recall that as part of our 2014 Brookdale transaction, Brookdale agreed to pay $55 million of lease restructure payments and installments over a 3-year period as consideration to convert 49 assets from a triple-net lease to RIDEA. Starting in July 2016, the payments step down and will be phased out by the third quarter of 2017. Also, as part of this transaction, we have a rent reduction of $6.5 million this year in exchange for canceling 49 purchase options on Brookdale's triple-net portfolio.
Third, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Genentech, who exercised their purchase option on our life science campus in south San Francisco. The first tranche of the transaction will close in November for a price of $310 million and the second tranche closing in 2018 for $270 million. Proceeds will be reinvested to fund our development at The Cove in south San Francisco, including the recently commenced Phase 2.
Lastly, in 2016, we will continue to reflect our Four Seasons unsecured note on nonaccrual status, and we'll record interest payments received as a reduction to our investment. Our guidance does not include the impact of any future acquisitions or dispositions other than what I just mentioned. 
With these assumptions, we expect full year 2016 FFO to range from $2.74 to $2.80 per share, which reflects placing our HCR ManorCare portfolio on a cash basis; FAD to range from $2.62 to $2.68 per share; same-store cash NOI growth to increase between 1.5% and 2.5%; the remaining 75% of our portfolio, excluding HCR ManorCare, to increase between 2.3% and 3.3%.
The midpoint of our same-store growth rates by asset class include: senior housing at 1.75%, which is impacted by the Brookdale triple-net portfolio I just mentioned and reflects RIDEA growth of 3.5%. Post-acute SNF is forecasted to decline by 60 basis points due to the HCR ManorCare lease amendment in April 2015. In our operating office platform, life science is projected to grow 6.7% and MOB at 2.4%. And finally, our hospital segment is projected to grow 2.2%.
Allow me to quickly run through a few other assumptions. G&A is forecasted to be $87 million, including stock-based compensation of $20 million; amortization of below-market lease intangibles and deferred revenue of $4 million; amortization of deferred financing costs of $21 million; straight-line rents of $16 million; other depreciation and amortization of $12 million; lease restructure payments of $17 million related to the 2014 Brookdale transaction, reflecting a step down in the installment payments starting in the second half of 2016; our 49% share of FFO contribution from the CCRC joint venture to range from $28 million to $30 million; and FAD contribution to range from $45 million to $49 million, inclusive of nonrefundable interest fees; leasing costs and second-generation tenant and capital expenditures of $90 million, representing 5% of cash NOI; in addition, total development, redevelopment and first-generation capital investment of $410 million, including $150 million in 2016 for the completion of Phase 1 and commencement of Phase 2 life science development at The Cove in south San Francisco.
I'll conclude with a few words on our 2016 dividend. Last month, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.565 to $0.575 per share, marking the 31st consecutive year of dividend increases and continuing HCP's representation in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index. The annualized dividend of $2.30 represents an increase of $0.04 per share over 2015. 
After taking into account the increase in the dividend and based on the midpoint of our guidance, our projected 2016 payout ratio is in the mid-80% range. As a result, we expect to retain $165 million in cash flow after dividends and recurring capital expenditures to continue growing our portfolio.
With that summary of our financial results, I will now turn the call over to Justin. Justin?"

Let me start by highlighting our senior housing portfolio performance. 
Our total senior housing same-store cash NOI grew 3.7% in 2015, driven largely by rent steps and in part by our Brookdale RIDEA portfolio. We are encouraged by Brookdale's indication that their merger integration is in their rearview mirror and by the recent additions to their senior management team. These factors, along with a significant Program Max CapEx investment, have contributed to the recent improvement in growth in our RIDEA properties, and we expect them to have a positive impact on the triple-net portfolio. We are in regular communication with Brookdale management regarding ways to work together to create value through asset repositioning, operating and market analytics and identifying opportunities to cull the portfolio.
Our same-store RIDEA platform reported a very strong fourth quarter, with year-over-year same-store growth of 6.6%, driven by improved occupancy rate and expense management. We are encouraged by this performance and are particularly pleased to see positive momentum, where fourth quarter occupancy grew 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis and 70 basis points on a sequential basis, outperforming the NIC average by 90 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points sequentially. The entire Brookdale RIDEA portfolio has performed consistent with these solid results.
Our triple-net senior housing portfolio has a trailing 12-month cash flow coverage of 1.07x, down 2 basis points from the prior quarter. The triple-net portfolio is largely represented by the leases with Brookdale, where the coverage in 2016 is expected to improve by 2 basis points due to a contractual rent reduction that was committed in conjunction with the 2014 transaction with Brookdale that Tim mentioned earlier. We remain actively engaged with our operators through our asset management platform, continuously reviewing local market dynamics, operating trends and the physical condition of our properties. 
We continue to monitor new supply in our senior housing markets and have included a new presentation of this information, which is featured on Page 27 of the supplemental. We measure new supply using a 5-mile radius based on a recent study showing that the average time a consumer is willing to travel to a local business is approximately 15 minutes. Our internal research indicates that a 5-mile analysis is generally consistent with that of a 15-minute drive time. 21.2% of our RIDEA NOI or 2.7% of our total portfolio income has new construction or expansions of similar care types within a 5-mile radius. A large majority of this new supply will open in 2016. We are mindful of the potential pressure on pricing and occupancy that the new supply could cause in these markets. However, we like our market position relative to the new higher-cost competitors.
Moving on to investments. During the fourth quarter, we expanded our relationship with Brookdale and MBK with $57 million of investments in 4 senior housing communities, all stabilized with occupancy above 90%. Our priority pipeline includes $400 million of senior housing communities with new and existing operator relationships. We plan to fund these investments from the capital recycling and the assumption of in-place debt. We are primarily focused on acquiring private-pay communities that offer both assisted living and memory care services and located in targeted markets with favorable supply-demand characteristics.
I would like to emphasize that we remain conservative and selective as we advance capital into senior housing assets. As part of our underwriting and due diligence process, we carefully scrutinize operators' track record, financial alignment and local-market industry fundamentals, including potential impact from wage pressures and new supply.
Now Lauralee will cover our medical office, life science and international portfolios."

As I opened, 2015 was a very active year for us on almost every front, and we are proud of the performance we have achieved despite operator challenges. In 2015, we sourced over $2 billion of accretive investments at a blended 6.8% cash yield across 4 of our property sectors, bringing our 2-year investment total to $4 billion at a blended 7.3%. These investments are performing at or above our underwriting, including our CCRC and Chartwell portfolios managed by Brookdale; our international investments with HC-One and Maria Mallaband; our medical office acquisitions of on-campus MOBs in Philadelphia and Houston; and our premier life science development, The Cove. 
We accomplished almost 90% of our 2015 growth through our existing partners, but we also added new high-quality relationships, including Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, MBK Senior Living and several companies within our life science portfolio. We remain selective and disciplined in allocating capital, with 3/4 of our 2015 investments concentrated in private-pay senior housing and on-campus medical office buildings, and more than half of our investments were completed through joint venture partnerships, emphasizing our focus on mutual alignment. 
One common theme we have seen over the past year is strong increases in occupancy across our operating portfolios, supported by the location of our properties and their competitive position in their markets. We delivered occupancy growth in our RIDEA, life science and medical office portfolios.  Justin already covered RIDEA portfolio growth, so I will focus my comments on our office platform.
Our life science portfolio has had strong leasing momentum this year, driving occupancy to a new all-time high of over 98%, a 300 basis point improvement over prior year. We have now pre-leased half of our state-of-the-art development at The Cove with CytomX Therapeutics and Denali Therapeutics as lead tenants. CytomX will lease 76,000 square feet beginning in the fourth quarter. They recently had a successful IPO based on their cancer-fighting research. Denali will lease 38,000 square feet beginning in the third quarter. Led by former Genentech neuroscience leadership, Denali is a private company focused on neurodegenerative diseases and seeded with over $200 million, the largest first-round venture financing in biotech history. We are very pleased to welcome both CytomX and Denali as our first 2 clients at The Cove, and we look forward to continuing to build more relationships with innovative and growing companies like these. 
In response to our Phase 1 leasing success and continued strong demand from life science users in South San Francisco, where direct vacancy is still below 1%, we recently commenced the $185 million development of Phase 2, which will add 2 Class A buildings totaling up to 230,000 square feet and is expected to be delivered by the third quarter of 2017. We acquired Edgewater Science and Technology Park in south San Francisco for $83 million. The 6-building campus was recently renovated and is 100% occupied. 
Our medical office portfolio also had a solid year of leasing, with year-end occupancy close to 92%, representing 110 basis points of growth over the prior year, driven by our strong retention rates of 83% and recent acquisitions. We have expanded our MOB platform by over 20% over the past 2 years, primarily with on-campus buildings, while adding 11 new health system partners and expanding 2 existing relationships. We are partners with top-notch health systems in every regional area where we have a strong presence. For example, HCA, our largest relationship, has significant market share in 7 of our top 12 markets where we have at least 500,000 square feet of office space.
We won the trust of Memorial Hermann, a leading hospital system in Houston with a 24% market share, who selected us as their partner to execute the monetization of their on-campus MOB portfolio, and they continue to select HCP as a capital partner. In January, we broke ground on a 170,000 square foot development on the campus of Memorial Hermann's Woodlands hospital. The development is 100% pre-leased and represents our third on-campus development project underway with them. 
In total, we have 6 MOBs under development or redevelopment, totaling 760,000 square feet, of which 5 are expected to be completed during the first half of the year. Our MOB portfolio remains in great shape, with 40% of this year's lease expirations already addressed or in negotiations. We have achieved solid growth in our non-HCR ManorCare portfolio, which represents 3/4 of HCP's business.

Labeed and Cindy offer a fresh perspective and a very relevant experience in their respective backgrounds. And elevating Mary Sue  Patchett, who has 25-plus years of senior housing operating experience, and marrying her with Labeed just seemed like a great fit. So we're impressed with the management team, and we're optimistic about their ability to carry out their plan. They've talked about putting a more efficient operating structure in place, have a community-level feedback loop that's going to help them to make decisions to simplify the business. They're tightening their use of incentives and going more shorter term than longer term in terms of price incentives. And the economies of scale that they have as a large operator in the space should come into play, purchasing power and reducing insurance costs. And so if you look at our triple-net portfolio, it was impacted significantly after integration because you have largely legacy emeritus properties. Certainly, the integration is behind us. We do think that there'll be some new supply and wage pressure on the fringes that, that portfolio will face. From HCP's standpoint, we're enhancing our asset management. We're going to have a similar focus on our triple-net portfolio that we've had on our RIDEA portfolio, and one example of that would be to continue to work with Brookdale to deploy capital expenditures. There's about $50 million available for Brookdale to draw to invest in the triple-net portfolio. That'd be a significant investment of a few thousand dollars per unit. Certainly, we've proven that, that has an impact in our RIDEA portfolio performance, so we would look for some similar results in the triple-net portfolio over time. Having said all of that, a lot of this is fresh. I know Brookdale's talked about using 2016 as a year to really put the business plan in place and take advantage of their ability to execute on all of the things I just mentioned.

I'll give you an example of how the new supply has impacted us. If you look at the last 2 years, we've had 18 openings within a 5-mile radius. And that's impacted actually to compare to that 2.7%, only about 1.3% of our portfolio income. You know from our RIDEA results that we moved growth rate through the impact.

Let me just step back a little bit on their business plan, and I'll talk about a number of things that relates to that question. If you step back to why they are where there are, I think it's important to look at this. Their senior management team has a tenure, and this is senior divisional managers of over 20 years. And the business plan that they've executed over a 20-year period would put themselves in position to be the market leader in terms of clinical and rehabilitation care and services. They've successfully done so. In the 11 market clusters where they operate, they are a leader in 9 of those. They're in second place in 2 of those. To your point, that they achieved about a 66% percentage of the revenue, that's in Medicare and in managed care. And if you take that 66% number, it's about twice the industry average. So they're uniquely impacted by the shift to managed care and a reduced length of stay. And certainly, they've had to work through that. In some ways, they've done that. They have the hospice business that Lauralee mentioned earlier. They have an assisted living business that's been growing. They are looking in some other tertiary markets to dedicate some beds to the memory care program that would accept Medicaid reimbursement to help stabilize cash flow. But they do remain committed to their core business. And if you're interested in how that plays out in a mature managed care market, you can look at California. California is a state where they operate 7 properties and they have about 1,000 beds, so pretty good sample size. The length of stay in that portfolio is about 18% less than the rest of their company. They have only 40% of their admissions are coming from Medicare and 60% of managed care. So they would describe this as a mature managed care market. They actually grew admissions in California about 2.5% over this past year, and they grew operating income as well. So they found stability in the payer sources. They've been able to grow the business. And then I'd add another point to the core business. If you look at their business across the company, they've actually grown their admissions 1% a year, each of the last 4 years. So they are in fact, expanding market share. However, it has not been enough to overcome the reduced length of stay."

Joining me this morning are Tim Schoen, Chief Financial Officer; Justin Hutchens, Chief Investment Officer of Senior Housing and Care; and John Lu, EVP of Corporate Finance and Investments. 
2015 was a very active year for us on almost every front, and we are proud of the performance we achieved in our operating portfolio. I will be covering these accomplishments later in the call, but I'd like to start with HCR ManorCare. As many of you are aware, the post-acute and skilled nursing industry has transformed remarkably over the past 5 years, beginning with the 2011 RUGs-IV cuts. The 3 most impactful trends have been: lower reimbursement rates, accelerated payer mix shift towards managed care and increased regulation and risk management requirements for patient care delivery. These changes have prompted operators to become more efficient while continuing to provide their quality care. Over the long term, these changes should ultimately benefit patients, payers and quality providers like HCR ManorCare, whose core operations have a high-quality mix and better margins compared to their peers. 
We are seeing heightened volatility in the public post-acute operators due to these industry-wide changes and headwinds. HCR is confronting the same challenges, which resulted in their normalized fixed charge coverage declining 4 basis points to 1.07x for calendar year 2015. Both we and HCR management were disappointed with HCR's results in the fourth quarter, which is typically a seasonally stronger quarter. These results were impacted by core operating performance weakness and $14 million of unfavorable nonroutine items, including short-term disruption related to the sales process of the 50 nonstrategic assets, 33 of which have closed to date with 17 still in process so some disruptions will continue into the first half of this year; as well as legal costs associated with the Department of Justice defense. 
For 2016, HCR anticipates normalized EBITDAR of $577 million before the temporary impact from the pending asset sales and Department of Justice defense costs. After adjusting for these items, HCP estimates 2016 EBITDAR to be $555 million, supporting their ability to meet the master lease obligations. Furthermore, we have applied sensitivities to key census assumptions in their forecast to produce a potential range of outcomes. Our forecast for HCR's 2016 EBITDAR ranges from $505 million to $555 million, resulting in a fixed charge coverage range of 1.06x to 1.16x. Our range includes the contractual -- current contractual rent and the 3% increase that goes into effect in April.
With the declining trend of operating performance in the second half of 2015, the DFL investment has been placed on cash basis effective January 1. In addition, given the lower growth outlook over the next few years, the carrying value of our HCR real estate portfolio was reduced by over $800 million to $5.2 billion as of year-end. Tim will cover the financial details shortly.
Our other objectives outlined in the April 2015 lease amendment are proceeding on track. We have received fee ownership in 7 of HCR's 9 recently built post-acute facilities, with the remaining to close by April, and we have sold 33 of the 50 properties, generating proceeds of $280 million. The remaining facilities are all under contract and scheduled to close over the next 2 quarters, which will bring total proceeds to $350 million.
Resolving the HCR ManorCare portfolio issue is our highest priority. Our goals in resolving the HCR ManorCare challenges are: reduce our concentration to HCR as an operator; improve the coverage and credit quality of our lease; and ensure HCR's high-quality care and service delivery continues. We have engaged Barclays Capital as our financial adviser to pursue discussions with HCR ManorCare's management team to jointly explore all solutions to achieve our goals.
Now let me turn the call over to Tim to discuss our financial results and 2016 guidance."

The impairments reduced the ca",1412,"Thank you, Lauralee. Let me start with our fourth quarter results. For the quarter, we reported a NAREIT FFO loss of $0.99 per share, reflecting noncash impairments of $836 million related to our HCR ManorCare investments. 
The impairments reduced the carrying value of our HCR ManorCare DFL real estate portfolio from $6 billion to $5.2 billion at year-end, which approximates the fair value of the assets based on market-level coverage and cap rate assumptions. In addition, the carrying value of our 9% equity investment in opco was reduced by $19 million. Excluding the impact of impairments and other items totaling $1.79 per share for the quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.80 per share and FAD of $0.67 per share, representing growth rates of 1% and 2%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The results benefited from accretive acquisitions closed in 2015.
Fourth quarter same-store cash NOI performance declined 30 basis points compared to prior year due to the HCR ManorCare lease amendment in April 2015. Excluding the HCR ManorCare portfolio, we achieved solid same-store cash NOI growth of 3.5%, led by a 7.8% increase in life science and a 6.6% increase in RIDEA, which Justin will cover in a few minutes. Also benefiting the quarter was a $0.01 per share gain from monetizing our senior housing development project in Olney, Maryland.
Turning to our full year 2015 results. We reported a full year 2015 NAREIT FFO loss of $0.02 per share that was primarily impacted by noncash impairments related to HCR ManorCare. Excluding the impact of impairments and other items, 2015 FFO as adjusted was $3.16 and FAD was $2.72 per share, representing year-over-year growth rates of 4% and 6%, respectively. The earnings performance, despite the amended HCR ManorCare lease, was driven by same-store cash NOI growth of 3.7% from 75% of our portfolio and accretive acquisitions totaling $4 billion since 2014. In addition, the results included a $0.04 of onetime gains from monetizing 3 senior housing development loans. 
Absent these gains, on a recurring basis, FFO as adjusted per share increased 3% and FAD increased 4% in 2015. Overall, same-store cash NOI for the year increased 50 basis points, consistent with our last guidance. Our 2015 cash dividend of $2.26 per share resulted in an FAD payout ratio of 83%.
Moving on to financing activities and balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, we raised $600 million of senior unsecured notes at a 4% coupon. Proceeds were used to refinance a $500 million bond maturity last week, representing 36% of our 2016 total maturities, and to pay down on the revolver. During 2015, we successfully raised $2.3 billion of debt at an attractive blended rate of 3.5%. 
We continued to deliver on the capital recycling front, generating $430 million of additional proceeds during the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $560 million. Proceeds for the quarter included $208 million from the sale of HCR ManorCare's nonstrategic assets, $110 million from creation of a new institutional JV on our Memorial Hermann MOB portfolio and $45 million from monetizing our interest in MOB Ventures III and IV. We improved our liquidity and financial leverage with these proceeds, although the benefit to financial leverage was offset by our fourth quarter noncash impairments. Leverage ended the year at 45%.
Fixed charge coverage and net debt to adjusted EBITDA for 2015 were 3.9x and 5.6x, respectively. Secured debt ratio improved to 4.4% as we continued to refinance higher-rate mortgage maturities with lower-cost unsecured notes. 
At year-end, we had $1.6 billion of liquidity.
Next, our full year 2016 guidance and dividend. The majority of our portfolio continues to generate organic growth, complemented by recent accretive investments, but our earnings continue to be moderated by the HCR ManorCare lease restructure as we enter 2016. Before providing our 2016 guidance, I would like to discuss a few important assumptions reflected in our projections that impact year-over-year comparison. 
First, beginning January 2016, income from our HCR ManorCare investments will be recognized on a cash basis, resulting in a reduction to our FFO run rate totaling $150 million or $0.32 per share, $90 million of which was previously recognized in DFL revenue, with the remaining $60 million in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures. There is no impact to our cash performance metrics, including same-store and FAD. Our 2016 guidance reflects contractual rent of $456 million from our HCR ManorCare real estate portfolio, inclusive of a scheduled 3% increase in April.  In addition, our guidance reflects $130 million of proceeds in the first half of 2016, bringing total proceeds from HCR ManorCare's nonstrategic asset sales to $350 million.
Second, you will recall that as part of our 2014 Brookdale transaction, Brookdale agreed to pay $55 million of lease restructure payments and installments over a 3-year period as consideration to convert 49 assets from a triple-net lease to RIDEA. Starting in July 2016, the payments step down and will be phased out by the third quarter of 2017. Also, as part of this transaction, we have a rent reduction of $6.5 million this year in exchange for canceling 49 purchase options on Brookdale's triple-net portfolio.
Third, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Genentech, who exercised their purchase option on our life science campus in south San Francisco. The first tranche of the transaction will close in November for a price of $310 million and the second tranche closing in 2018 for $270 million. Proceeds will be reinvested to fund our development at The Cove in south San Francisco, including the recently commenced Phase 2.
Lastly, in 2016, we will continue to reflect our Four Seasons unsecured note on nonaccrual status, and we'll record interest payments received as a reduction to our investment. Our guidance does not include the impact of any future acquisitions or dispositions other than what I just mentioned. 
With these assumptions, we expect full year 2016 FFO to range from $2.74 to $2.80 per share, which reflects placing our HCR ManorCare portfolio on a cash basis; FAD to range from $2.62 to $2.68 per share; same-store cash NOI growth to increase between 1.5% and 2.5%; the remaining 75% of our portfolio, excluding HCR ManorCare, to increase between 2.3% and 3.3%.
The midpoint of our same-store growth rates by asset class include: senior housing at 1.75%, which is impacted by the Brookdale triple-net portfolio I just mentioned and reflects RIDEA growth of 3.5%. Post-acute SNF is forecasted to decline by 60 basis points due to the HCR ManorCare lease amendment in April 2015. In our operating office platform, life science is projected to grow 6.7% and MOB at 2.4%. And finally, our hospital segment is projected to grow 2.2%.
Allow me to quickly run through a few other assumptions. G&A is forecasted to be $87 million, including stock-based compensation of $20 million; amortization of below-market lease intangibles and deferred revenue of $4 million; amortization of deferred financing costs of $21 million; straight-line rents of $16 million; other depreciation and amortization of $12 million; lease restructure payments of $17 million related to the 2014 Brookdale transaction, reflecting a step down in the installment payments starting in the second half of 2016; our 49% share of FFO contribution from the CCRC joint venture to range from $28 million to $30 million; and FAD contribution to range from $45 million to $49 million, inclusive of nonrefundable interest fees; leasing costs and second-generation tenant and capital expenditures of $90 million, representing 5% of cash NOI; in addition, total development, redevelopment and first-generation capital investments of $410 million, including $150 million in 2016 for the completion of Phase 1 and commencement of Phase 2 life science development at The Cove in south San Francisco.
I'll conclude with a few words on our 2016 dividend. Last month, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.565 to $0.575 per share, marking the 31st consecutive year of dividend increases and continuing HCP's representation in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index. The annualized dividend of $2.30 represents an increase of $0.04 per share over 2015. 
After taking into account the increase in the dividend and based on the midpoint of our guidance, our projected 2016 payout ratio is in the mid-80% range. As a result, we expect to retain $165 million in cash flow after dividends and recurring capital expenditures to continue growing our portfolio.
With that summary of our financial results, I will now turn the call over to Justin. Justin?"

We are encouraged by Brookdale's indication that their merger integration is in their rearview mirror and by the recent additions to their senior management team. These factors, along with a significant Program Max CapEx investment, have contributed to the recent improvement in growth in our RIDEA properties, and we expect them to have a positive impact on the triple-net portfolio. We are in regular communication with Brookdale management regarding ways to work together to create value through asset repositioning, operating and market analytics and identifying opportunities to cull the portfolio.
Our same-store RIDEA platform reported a very strong fourth quarter, with year-over-year same-store growth of 6.6%, driven by improved occupancy rate and expense management. We are encouraged by this performance and are particularly pleased to see positive momentum, where fourth quarter occupancy grew 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis and 70 basis points on a sequential basis, outperforming the NIC average by 90 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points sequentially. The entire Brookdale RIDEA portfolio has performed consistent with these solid results.
Our triple-net senior housing portfolio has a trailing 12-month cash flow coverage of 1.07x, down 2 basis points from the prior quarter. The triple-net portfolio is largely represented by the leases with Brookdale, where the coverage in 2016 is expected to improve by 2 basis points due to a contractual rent reduction that was committed in conjunction with the 2014 transaction with Brookdale that Tim mentioned earlier. We remain actively engaged with our operators through our asset management platform, continuously reviewing local market dynamics, operating trends and the physical condition of our properties. 
We continue to monitor new supply in our senior housing markets and have included a new presentation of this information, which is featured on Page 27 of the supplemental. We measure new supply using a 5-mile radius based on a recent study showing that the average time a consumer is willing to travel to a local business is approximately 15 minutes. Our internal research indicates that a 5-mile analysis is generally consistent with that of a 15-minute drive time. 21.2% of our RIDEA NOI or 2.7% of our total portfolio income has new construction or expansions of similar care types within a 5-mile radius. A large majority of this new supply will open in 2016. We are mindful of the potential pressure on pricing and occupancy that the new supply could cause in these markets. However, we like our market position relative to the new higher-cost competitors.
Moving on to investments. During the fourth quarter, we expanded our relationship with Brookdale and MBK with $57 million of investments in 4 senior housing communities, all stabilized with occupancy above 90%. Our priority pipeline includes $400 million of senior housing communities with new and existing operator relationships. We plan to fund these investments from the capital recycling and the assumption of in-place debt. We are primarily focused on acquiring private-pay communities that offer both assisted living and memory care services and located in targeted markets with favorable supply-demand characteristics.
I would like to emphasize that we remain conservative and selective as we advance capital into senior housing assets. As part of our underwriting and due diligence process, we carefully scrutinize operators' track record, financial alignment and local-market industry fundamentals, including potential impact from wage pressures and new supply.
Now Lauralee will cover our medical office, life science and international portfolios."

As I opened, 2015 was a very active year for us on almost every front, and we are proud of the performance we have achieved despite operator challenges.

As I opened, 2015 was a very active year for us on almost every front, and we are proud of the performance we have achieved despite operator challenges. In 2015, we sourced over $2 billion of accretive investments at a blended 6.8% cash yield across 4 of our property sectors, bringing our 2-year investment total to $4 billion at a blended 7.3%. These investments are performing at or above our underwriting, including our CCRC and Chartwell portfolios managed by Brookdale; our international investments with HC-One and Maria Mallaband; our medical office acquisitions of on-campus MOBs in Philadelphia and Houston; and our premier life science development, The Cove. 
We accomplished almost 90% of our 2015 growth through our existing partners, but we also added new high-quality relationships, including Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, MBK Senior Living and several companies within our life science portfolio. We remain selective and disciplined in allocating capital, with 3/4 of our 2015 investments concentrated in private-pay senior housing and on-campus medical office buildings, and more than half of our investments were completed through joint venture partnerships, emphasizing our focus on mutual alignment. 
One common theme we have seen over the past year is strong increases in occupancy across our operating portfolios, supported by the location of our properties and their competitive position in their markets. We delivered occupancy growth in our RIDEA, life science and medical office portfolios.  Justin already covered RIDEA portfolio growth, so I will focus my comments on our office platform.
Our life science portfolio has had strong leasing momentum this year, driving occupancy to a new all-time high of over 98%, a 300 basis point improvement over prior year. We have now pre-leased half of our state-of-the-art development at The Cove with CytomX Therapeutics and Denali Therapeutics as lead tenants. CytomX will lease 76,000 square feet beginning in the fourth quarter. They recently had a successful IPO based on their cancer-fighting research. Denali will lease 38,000 square feet beginning in the third quarter. Led by former Genentech neuroscience leadership, Denali is a private company focused on neurodegenerative diseases and seeded with over $200 million, the largest first-round venture financing in biotech history. We are very pleased to welcome both CytomX and Denali as our first 2 clients at The Cove, and we look forward to continuing to build more relationships with innovative and growing companies like these. 
In response to our Phase 1 leasing success and continued strong demand from life science users in South San Francisco, where direct vacancy is still below 1%, we recently commenced the $185 million development of Phase 2, which will add 2 Class A buildings totaling up to 230,000 square feet and is expected to be delivered by the third quarter of 2017. We acquired Edgewater Science and Technology Park in south San Francisco for $83 million. The 6-building campus was recently renovated and is 100% occupied. 
Our medical office portfolio also had a solid year of leasing, with year-end occupancy close to 92%, representing 110 basis points of growth over the prior year, driven by our strong retention rates of 83% and recent acquisitions. We have expanded our MOB platform by over 20% over the past 2 years, primarily with on-campus buildings, while adding 11 new health system partners and expanding 2 existing relationships. We are partners with top-notch health systems in every regional area where we have a strong presence. For example, HCA, our largest relationship, has significant market share in 7 of our top 12 markets where we have at least 500,000 square feet of office space.
We won the trust of Memorial Hermann, a leading hospital system in Houston with a 24% market share, who selected us as their partner to execute the monetization of their on-campus MOB portfolio, and they continue to select HCP as a capital partner. In January, we broke ground on a 170,000 square foot development on the campus of Memorial Hermann's Woodlands hospital. The development is 100% pre-leased and represents our third on-campus development project underway with them. 
In total, we have 6 MOBs under development or redevelopment, totaling 760,000 square feet, of which 5 are expected to be completed during the first half of the year. Our MOB portfolio remains in great shape, with 40% of this year's lease expirations already addressed or in negotiations. We have achieved solid growth in our non-HCR ManorCare portfolio, which represents 3/4 of HCP's business. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that solving the HCR ManorCare lease issue is our highest priority.

Labeed and Cindy offer a fresh perspective and a very relevant experience in their respective backgrounds. And elevating Mary Sue  Patchett, who has 25-plus years of senior housing operating experience, and marrying her with Labeed just seemed like a great fit. So we're impressed with the management team, and we're optimistic about their ability to carry out their plan. They've talked about putting a more efficient operating structure in place, have a community-level feedback loop that's going to help them to make decisions to simplify the business. They're tightening their use of incentives and going more shorter term than longer term in terms of price incentives. And the economies of scale that they have as the largest operator in the space should come into play, purchasing power and reducing insurance costs. And so if you look at our triple-net portfolio, it was impacted significantly after integration because you have largely legacy emeritus properties. Certainly, the integration is behind us. We do think that there'll be some new supply and wage pressure on the fringes that, that portfolio will face. From HCP's standpoint, we're enhancing our asset management. We're going to have a similar focus on our triple-net portfolio that we've had on our RIDEA portfolio, and one example of that would be to continue to work with Brookdale to deploy capital expenditures. There's about $50 million available for Brookdale to draw to invest in the triple-net portfolio. That'd be a significant investment of a few thousand dollars per unit. Certainly, we've proven that, that has impact in our RIDEA portfolio performance, so we would look for some similar results in the triple-net portfolio over time. Having said all of that, a lot of this is fresh. I know Brookdale's talked about using 2016 as a year to really put the business plan in place and take advantage of their ability to execute on all of the things I just mentioned. And so we're not expecting a big pop, by any means, in the triple-net portfolio, but we're optimistic that it'll be stable.

Let me just step back a little bit on their business plan, and I'll talk about a number of things that relates to that question. If you step back to why they are where there are, I think it's important to look at this. Their senior management team has a tenure, and this is senior and divisional managers of over 20 years. And the business plan that they've executed over a 20-year period was to put themselves in position to be the market leader in terms of clinical and rehabilitation care and services. They've successfully done so. In the 11 market clusters where they operate, they are a leader in 9 of those. They're in second place in 2 of those. To your point, they achieved about a 66% percentage of their revenue, that's in Medicare and in managed care. And if you take that 66% number, it's about twice the industry average. So they're uniquely impacted by the shift to managed care and a reduced length of stay. And certainly, they've had to work through that. In some ways, they've done that. They have the hospice business that Lauralee mentioned earlier. They have an assisted living business that's been growing. They are looking in some other tertiary markets to dedicate some beds to a memory care program that would accept Medicaid reimbursement to help stabilize cash flow. But they do remain committed to their core business. And if you're interested in how that plays out in a mature managed care market, you can look at California. California is a state where they operate 7 properties and they have about 1,000 beds, so pretty good sample size. The length of stay in that portfolio is about 18% less than the rest of their company. They have only 40% of their admissions are coming from Medicare and 60% are managed care. So they would describe this as a mature managed care market. They actually grew admissions in California about 2.5% over this past year, and they grew operating income as well. So they found stability in the payer sources. They've been able to grow the business. And then I'd add another point to their core business. If you look at their business across the company, they've actually grown their admissions 1% a year, each of the last 4 years. So they are in fact, expanding market share. However, it has not been enough to overcome their reduced length of stay."

We've got left, Vikram, about $900 million in contractual debt maturities this year. So that sort of gives you the liquidity picture. And then in terms of the debt coming due, we've actually got an average coupon of anywhere from mid- to high 5s in the near term and into the low 6s as we look out into '17 and '18. So we've still got refinancing tailwind. And then finally, if we were to go to market today, obviously you followed the credit markets the last couple of weeks, you'd probably be in the mid-4 range on long-term 10-year debt -- 10-year unsecured debt."

We have a lot to cover today. First, let me highlight some additions and changes to our leadership team. First, as I mentioned, Mike McKee has been elected Executive Chairman of the company. Mike has been one of our longest tenured board members and have served as Nonexecutive Chairman of the board since 2013. He's the former Vice Chairman and CEO of the Irvine company and recently has been CEO of Kennedy, a leading real estate investment manager. 
Mike and I have worked closely together since I became CEO, and I look forward to working even more closely with him in his new role at this important point in the company's history. I'm also pleased to announce in the promotion of Justin Hutchens to Chief Investment Officer. Justin continues to be an increasingly valuable contributor to our strategy and execution. 
In addition, we announced Kai Hsiao, former CEO of Holiday Retirement, has joined HCP as EVP, Senior Housing Asset Management. As most of you know, after a decade of outstanding service to HCP, Tim Schoen has accepted a new position as President of BioMed Realty. This will be his last earnings call with us as our CFO. We sincerely thank him for all the best in his new opportunity. I'm also pleased to report the recruitment process for Tim's replacement is well underway, and we hope to have definitive news soon.
Today, we are announcing a major step in addressing issues related to our HCR ManorCare portfolio investment and want to describe in some detail what impact that step will have on HCP going forward. And of course, we will address our quarterly results and update you on other important initiatives. 
Before we begin, please go to the Investor Relations section of our website where we posted a presentation, which we will refer to during our remarks. Let me turn the call over to Mike to begin our discussion of the spinoff transaction."

I want to start by expressing my gratitude to Lauralee, our board, our executive team and the stellar group of financial and legal advisers who have been working exceptionally hard in preparation for today and the days to come. Sinc",628,"Thank you, Lauralee. I want to start by expressing my gratitude to Lauralee, our board, our executive team and the stellar group of financial and legal advisers who have been working exceptionally hard in preparation for today and the days to come. 
Since its inception, I have been a big believer in HCP, and more than anytime in our history, I believe the best days for this company are ahead. For a number of months now, our team has conducted a comprehensive review of all of our available options regarding our HCR ManorCare portfolio concentration. As part of that process, we also have engaged Carlyle and HCR ManorCare leadership in our discussions. 
As we reviewed our options, we landed on 2 key goals as we endeavored to maximize value to our shareholders. First, we believe as fiduciaries, we are stewards of the inherent value existing in our HCR ManorCare holdings, and we need to preserve and realize as much of that value as possible. And second, we need to eliminate the overhang that exists from the current challenges facing HCR ManorCare so that the rest of our business can flourish. 
As we focused on those goals and reviewed our options, for many reasons, it became clear to the board that the best pathway forward was to pursue a spinoff transaction. We do not see the spin as an end in itself but as a means to an end. So let me run through the logic briefly, which we've outlined on Slides 1 and 2 of the presentation.
With the long-term perspective, we believe there is significant value embedded in our HCR portfolio that is presently not being recognized by the market. We are long-term believers in the post-acute and skilled space. Just several weeks ago, the federal government announced a proposed increase in rates for care in this space and highlighted the essential services that are provided in the continuum of care by post-acute and SNF facilities. 
As we explored our options for addressing HCR ManorCare's challenges, it was apparent to us that HCP is not the optimal investment vehicle to maximize the value in our HCR ManorCare real estate. In comparison, SpinCo, as a standalone business, focused on its post-acute and senior housing assets with a dedicated management team, will be able to employ a wider range of strategies with optionality to manage, sell or transition assets as desired, providing an attractive investment alternative for investors.
So the spin transaction results in the creation of 2 separate business platforms, each with a more strategic focus, strong management teams, a distinct business strategy and investment profile and an appropriate capital structure to support each company's independent objectives. 
Before I turn it over to Lauralee to give you more details on the spin and the impact it will have on HCP post-spin, let me highlight 2 important points: first, we are very pleased to announce that Mark Ordan is joining our team to play a critical role in executing the spin. Mark has joined us as a senior advisor as we prepare for the spin and will become CEO of SpinCo upon execution. 
Many of you know Mark from his days as CEO of Sunrise Senior Living and more recently, our Chairman of WP Glimcher, among other significant roles. In identifying and realizing the embedded value locked in HCR ManorCare, we believe we have the best, the most experienced leader available to take on this assignment. 
And lastly, I would note that like any spin, we expect SpinCo to be successful. But moreover, we look forward to returning HCP to a healthy, competitive and growing capital provider in the evolving world of health care. So now let me turn it back to Lauralee to give you some more background."
277966,330708834,978341,"HCP, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike.

Let me draw your attention to Slide 3 of the presentation. SpinCo's portfolio will be primarily concentrated in HCR ManorCare's post-acute and assisted living facilities and will also include the $250 million deferred rent obligation that was negotiated in connection with the March 2015 lease amendment as well as the 9% investment in HCR's operating company. 
With a singular focus on a portfolio of primarily post-acute and senior housing assets, a flexible capital structure and a focused management team led by Mark, we believe SpinCo will be well positioned to take advantage of dynamics that are unique to the skilled nursing space and provide investors with an attractive investment return for the risk profile. 
SpinCo is intended to be conservatively capitalized to withstand potential uncertainty from its tenant concentration. Proceeds from the SpinCo debt financing will be distributed to HCP. And importantly, SpinCo would have expanded flexibility to manage, sell or transition assets as required in a tax-efficient manner. 
HCP's shareholders are expected to receive shares of SpinCo via a pro rata distribution. Following the distribution, HCP shareholders will own shares in both HCP and SpinCo, and the number of HCP shares owned by each shareholder will not change. SpinCo expects to file its initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC in the next 30 days, and the spinoff is expected to be completed in the second half of this year.
Turning to the highlights for HCP on Page 4. We believe this spin gives HCP ability to reconfirm ourselves as a blue-chip, innovative relationship-oriented health care REIT. We will have a strong financial profile, a hallmark at HCP, for most of our 31-year history, with a premier portfolio weighted towards private pay. We'll be focused on our core growth businesses: senior housing, medical office and life science. 
The quality of our portfolio income post-spin increases tremendously with the younger, well-located assets, improved tenant concentration and a more stable income stream that is 95% private pay. Importantly, with an investment grade balance sheet and an improvement in our cost of capital over time, we will be well positioned to accelerate our accretive external growth opportunities.
Slide 5 puts a framework around HCP's financial profile -- pro forma for the spin transaction. The cash proceeds generated from borrowings of SpinCo and our planned asset sales will be used to repay higher coupon debt, allowing HCP to maintain a credit profile that supports this growth going forward, with substantial liquidity and no debt maturities through the end of 2018, an improved weighted average cost of debt and an extended term on remaining debt maturities. 
Our financing plan targets a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the mid-6x range, with a manageable amount of asset sales. And we are in the process of evaluating opportunities for an additional capital recycling activity to further reduce leverage to our target ratio of 6x. 
Now turning to Slide 6. I will walk you through a snapshot of each of our asset classes in pro forma HCP post-spin. This is an important discussion because for quite some time, a disproportionate amount of our conversations with you have been dominated by questions around our HCR ManorCare investment. We can now focus on the strength of our remaining portfolio. 
Let me start with our life science business, which is led by John Bergschneider, who has been with this portfolio for 16 years. Life science had an exceptional quarter with 9.6% same-store growth. Occupancy is 98%, and we've already addressed or are in negotiations for 2/3 of our 2016 lease maturities. Our $3.7 billion portfolio of 7 million square feet is concentrated in premier biotech clusters. We are the largest owner of lab space in the West Coast, with leading positions in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area, including the most active south San Francisco submarket with 30-plus percent market share.
Our income is diversified among more than 130 tenants, with 86% of our income from public or well-established private companies. The current health of the life science industry is one of the strongest we've seen in recent history, driven by 3 industry fundamentals: access to capital, consolidation and collaboration among research companies and a streamlined FDA process, which has resulted in an increase in the number of drug approvals. 
Looking ahead, our recent leasing success and strong tenant demand will continue to result in accelerated organic growth. In addition to the development project underway, we have ample development capacity in coastal, land constrained markets in San Francisco and San Diego where we can expand and build an additional 2.6 million square feet of product.
Next, medical office. Our $3.6 billion medical office portfolio also delivered a solid quarter with 3.3% same-store growth. Demand for medical office space has increased significantly over the past several years, and our strong retention rates have helped keep our medical office portfolio consistently above 90% for 10 consecutive quarters. 
Our leasing momentum continued in the first quarter with more than half of this year's lease expirations already addressed or in negotiations. We have one of the largest medical office platforms in the country, with over 17 million square feet, led by Tom Klaritch, who has run this portfolio for 17 years. 
Medical office is a relationship-centered business. We have relationships with over 200 hospitals and health systems. 95% of our buildings are affiliated with a health system, and 83% are located on campus with a hospital. Our goal is to be affiliated with the top 1 or 2 hospital systems in each market.
In addition, we currently have 4 on-campus properties under construction, and we've seen interest from various health systems to add additional on-campus space. These development projects were off-market transactions, the result of our relationship with the affiliated hospital system. Looking at sector fundamentals, medical office is a stable asset class with a positive outlook for demand.
Finally, our senior housing portfolio is led by Kendall Young, who has been with HCP for 6 years. We have a $9.6 billion portfolio of primarily private pay, senior housing communities, geographically diversified across the United States and the U.K. We are partnered with leading operators such as Brookdale and Sunrise in the U.S. and in the U.K.  And we continue to expand our portfolio with both existing and new relationships. 
Given the sector's fundamentals, catering to an aging demographic, senior housing will continue to be a core focus for HCP, as evidenced by the $1.7 billion of investments we have made in this space since the beginning of 2015. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Justin to discuss our senior housing transactions and performance."

As Lauralee mentioned earlier, he has joined us as the EVP of Senior Housing Asset Management. Kai brings a wealth of operating experience to our team. He has spent the past 7 years with Holiday Retirement Corporation, the nation's largest operator of independent living communities, including 3 years as the company's CEO. 
He made significant contributions leading the company's return to market leadership by boosting occupancy and margin. Kai will oversee the performance management of our portfolio, with an emphasis on value creation through business analytics, market analysis, financial oversight and asset repositioning. He's literally been in the shoes of our customers and will be a perfect complement to the HCP brand promise of building healthy partnerships. I am confident that Kai's operating expertise, combined with the investment savvy of Kendall Young, our EVP of Senior Housing Investments, will accelerate our senior housing platform for success.
Now I'll discuss transactions demonstrating diversification of our operators. During the quarter, we acquired a portfolio of 5 private pay communities and 1 skilled nursing facility for $95 million. All the communities were developed within the past 2 years and are triple-net leased. We entered into definitive agreements to acquire a portfolio of 7 private pay assisted-living communities for $190 million, with an expectation to close in the second half of the year. The portfolio will be managed by Senior Lifestyle Corporation in a RIDEA joint venture. 
With these 2 transactions, we are adding 5 new relationships with 2 national operators and 3 regional operators. We have also agreed to the sale of half of our 80% ownership interest in our Brookdale RIDEA II joint venture portfolio to a fund operated by Columbia Pacific Advisors. We expect this transaction to close during the year. This transaction results in reduced Brookdale concentration as well as the addition of a well-capitalized joint venture partner with significant industry knowledge and future coinvestment opportunities.
Moving on to our portfolio performance. Our entire indoor triple-net portfolio has an EBITDARM coverage of 1.27 and EBITDAR coverage of 1.07. Relative to Brookdale, we are in advanced discussions with them regarding up to 25 nonstrategic communities, which we intend to sell or transfer to other operators. We expect the lease coverage in 2016 to improve upon removing these communities. It's important to emphasize that all of our leases are backed by Brookdale's corporate guarantee. 
Our operating portfolio continues to perform well, with solid sequential gains in occupancy and NOI. Our same-store operating portfolio reported a very strong first quarter with year-over-year growth of 9.2%, driven by improved occupancy, rate and expense management. Occupancy has improved the last 3 consecutive quarters, and the Q1 annual rate increase was the strongest we've seen in several years. We remain actively engaged with all of our operators who are active asset management platform continuously reviewing local market dynamics, operating trends and the physical condition of our portfolio. 
Our strategic capital expenditures set us apart as a capital partner and distinguishes our communities to the residents as a high-quality product and an attractive price point. Our operating portfolio is concentrated in markets with strong demographics and population growth higher than both the industry and our peer group averages for the 75-plus cohort and total population. 
Only 6% of our portfolio is located within the top 10 MSAs for new construction. And at a local level, we continue to perform well. We have positioned our portfolio with appropriate affordability to residents in our local markets, which has resulted in strong growth and prospects for future growth despite increased supply for the broader MSAs.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim to talk about our financial results and updated guidance."

Let me start with our first quarter results. For the quarter, we reported NAREIT FFO of $0.68 per share, which includes $0.01 per share of transaction-related costs in connection with our investment activities. Excluding transaction-rel",649,"Thank you, Justin. Let me start with our first quarter results. For the quarter, we reported NAREIT FFO of $0.68 per share, which includes $0.01 per share of transaction-related costs in connection with our investment activities. Excluding transaction-related costs, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.69 per share and FAD of $0.66 per share. Both metrics are lower than prior year, primarily impacted by items that we have previously announced related to HCR ManorCare. Specifically, the lease amendment that took effect on April 1 last year and the 33 asset sales that we have closed to date reduced both FFO and FAD by $0.03 per share. FFO was further reduced by $0.08 per share from placing the HCR lease on cash basis beginning on January 1 this year.
First quarter same-store cash NOI performance declined 50 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the HCR ManorCare lease amendment in April 2015. Excluding the HCR ManorCare portfolio, we achieved solid same-store cash NOI growth of 3.2% from our higher growth private pay segment of senior housing, life science and medical office, representing 75% of our portfolio, led by a 9.6% increase in life science and 9.2% increase in RIDEA.
Moving on to capital recycling and balance sheet. We have announced $1.3 billion of capital recycling and refinancing activities for 2016, which will be used to permanently fund our year-to-date acquisitions and reduce future debt maturities, including $740 million of expected proceeds from the anticipated RIDEA II joint venture transaction that Justin just discussed, from selling a 40% stake in the venture and financing with third-party debt. 
In addition, we received $90 million from the sale of a noncore life science asset and medical office building in April. And we previously announced we expect $310 million from the first tranche of Genentech's purchase option on our life science campus in south San Francisco, which is expected to close in November and $130 million from the sale of HCR ManorCare's nonstrategic assets during the year, inclusive of $62 million from assets sold during the first quarter. In total, we still anticipate proceeds of $350 million after selling the remaining assets. 
Our financial leverage increased 50 basis points to 45.5%, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA increased to 6.2x at quarter end as we temporarily financed our first quarter acquisitions in our revolver. After paying down debt using the proceeds from our committed sales transactions just discussed, we expect these metrics to improve. Further, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of liquidity. 
Finally, our increased 2016 guidance. The 2016 guidance updated today represents our performance expectations for our entire HCP portfolio and does not reflect the spin transaction announced this morning. Our guidance does reflect the impact of the RIDEA II transaction and our announced investment and capital recycling activities. 
With that said, the portfolio continues to perform well and, combined with our recent acquisition activity, we are raising guidance and expect HCP's full year 2016 NAREIT FFO to range from $2.76 to $2.82 per share. Excluding transaction-related items, we expect FFO as adjusted to range from $2.77 to $2.83 per share. And we are raising our FAD guidance to range between $2.65 and $2.71 per share. 
We are reaffirming our same-store cash NOI growth forecast of 1.5% to 2.5%, and we are projecting the majority 75% of our portfolio from the private pay senior housing, life science and medical office segment to increase between 2.3% and 3.3% when you exclude HCR ManorCare.
Let me close by expressing my gratitude to the HCP team. I worked alongside many of you in a variety of roles and feel fortunate to have been part of a talented industry-leading group of professionals that grew and expanded the HCP portfolio over the past decade. So let me end by simply saying thank you and turn the call back over to Lauralee for her concluding remarks."

We are proud of our high-quality diversified health care portfolio. We differentiate ourselves in the market with our building healthy partnership's approach, executed by seasoned sector leaders and investment teams with operating experience and knowledge. We further confirmed this differentiation with our announcement of Kai Hsiao joining our team. 
Pro forma HCP has an investment grade balance sheet with significant liquidity supported by a higher-quality portfolio income from a stable, private pay income stream. We are eliminating exposure to an industry with reimbursement models in transition while our shareholders have the opportunity to realize substantial upside potential in SpinCo as an investment vehicle to optimize the long-term solution for the HCR ManorCare assets. 
By capitalizing on the difference in cost of capital between HCP's and SpinCo's respective health care sectors, HCP will be better positioned to deliver consistent returns while accelerating our internal and external growth profile. In summary, HCP's approach of building healthy partnerships, combined with an improved cost of capital, will lead to accretive investment growth. 
With that, I'll now ask the operator to open the lines for questions."

But if I go to that $2 billion and think about Spin, what we've been told by advisers is that there is debt out there in the marketplace that definitely can be achieved at about a 5x leverage at market level rents. And so what we've assumed is we can get proceeds on that basis, and the additional amount that gets to the $2 billion will be asset sales that HCP will do that will then focus us on about a 6.5x leverage. Relative to dividend, I'll answer that both HCP and spin. Until the spin happens, our current dividend policy will continue. Post-spin, obviously, the dividend policy for Spin will be set by the board of that company. But if I think about HCP post-spin, going back to our investment thesis, will be a very high-quality private pay portfolio, definitely focused on having a very strong investment grade balance sheet. And I expect that we will have a dividend policy that is focused on total shareholder return, which means growth in the company and growth in our dividend.

We've announced my addition as an Executive Chair. We announced today, Kai Hsiao coming in, in his capacity. When you look at that team that has been assembled, one thing I would note is that 4 of these leaders have been CEOs of very notable organizations before they came together here as a team. And even on our P&L leadership front, I think you've heard in the past, we're very proud that Tom Klaritch, John Bergschneider and Kendall Young are very well known in their respective sectors. This team that's been assembled and transitioned has pretty impeccable real estate, health care, operating company, finance and investment credentials. And the board is very confident in the ability to -- of this team to work closely together and very well together, which is very important to us. My role is -- I see it as complementary. Lauralee and I have worked very closely together over the couple of years that she has been here. As you know, she stepped into quite a set of issues and has had her hands full. I think that when we look at this role, we noted that there's a lot going on, on many fronts. And we have a new team coalescing. We've got a number of strategic initiatives, one of which we announced today. We've got 75% of our business that we think can stand up to and may be, in our personal view, is as good as any health care portfolio in the world. And we want to grow that. So there is a lot to do around here. There's a lot that's been happening and I just see my role as complementary to working with this team. In terms of leadership development, let me just spend a second on that. It's our desire to, as a best practice, develop the leadership that we have. And that's just not at the top level but layers down. The board would very much like to have a successor or 2 for every key position we have in the company. We're not a big headcount type company so to be able to go do that will take time and emphasis, and we think that there are some tools that we can apply, which will take some top talent and bring them up to new levels of leadership. So I'll be spending some time on that as well. So we see all this as complementary. I think if you look at the dynamic nature of all the things that are going on in our business, we want to have the resources to address things real time on multiple fronts. And we think some of these changes are going to allow that."

And we went through a comprehensive process and looked at a lot of alternatives. A number of those alternatives remain open with SpinCo. And as we've tried to emphasize today, we think that, that vehicle is a much more flexible vehicle to open up a full menu of options that aren't as easily accommodated at HCP. So we look forward to executing the spin and then having Mark Ordan and his team continue to keep open avenues that could go after that value. So I can assure you that there have been hundreds of hours of analysis, discussion, pros and cons. Obviously, some of that stayed in the boardroom. But I can certainly assure you it's been quite comprehensive."

Certainly, our operating portfolio's seeing really good results, but we're mindful of concentrations and capital recycling. So the RIDEA II transaction I mentioned presented an opportunity for us. Meanwhile, we're in regular discussions with Brookdale in terms of how to unlock value within our triple-net portfolio. I mentioned 25 assets. The valuation relative to those assets hasn't really been determined. I can tell you our intention is to either sell assets or in the event that those noncore assets for Brookdale are, in fact, a core asset for a regional operator, we may place those with a new operator. The intent is to be cash flow neutral. There'll be a little bit of tick-up due to some of the performance of the assets. And so we're actually expecting a slight improvement in our cash flow coverage about 1x to 1.5x as a result of the transaction. But a lot of the details are still being discussed and we'll have more down the road as that materializes."

As we said in our prepared remarks, we think that over the long term, this is a necessary area, one that the government will support and one that will be even more important long term in the continuum of care as there's an emphasis of moving patients who can't go home out of hospitals and into this kind of care. But right now, the issues facing the industry are complex and many. And we can't predict at this time how long it will take for the industry to stabilize. And we have been rather patient at HCP, in my opinion, about trying to see if there's some recovery on the horizon. But right now, we can't predict when that is. So one of the motivations in moving to the spin was the recognition that if you can't predict that and you have an overhang on the 75% of the business, which we think is pretty terrific, the spin just makes a lot of sense to us to not only to give more flexibility around options but also to recognize this is likely to take some time."

Some have done well, some not so well, you've referenced a couple. I guess what I would focus on here is that a number of spins are spinning off assets that are not well received in the marketplace really for reasons that aren't related to some of the reasons that we're dealing with post-acute and SNF here. In one case, it was B malls. And in other case, it might be lesser quality facilities. We really are dealing here with an industry leader, and you can talk about the industry being in some stress. But I don't think anybody would say that this is bad real estate or that, that kind of quality of care that's going on here isn't top quality. So there's a lot to work with here. It is -- in its purest form, it is a workout type of situation. But I would say that in some of the brainstorming we've done, there are lots of options out in the marketplace because the whole space is in transition and trying to cope with many of the same problems. So we think that there's a wide array of strategies that could be considered once it's in a dedicated vehicle. So I think the basic answer in my prior life, we had an opening fund that was consistently in the third quartile on performance. We did a look and we were way overweighted to suburban office for historical reasons. We've completely flipped that and got out of it and now have top performance, top quartile performance. I think when Simon did their spin, they were looking at the B malls. B malls are in a tough space right now. So I don't think you can kind of correlate one asset class to another. I think you've got to look at the dynamics of each one on their merits. And I think we believe that there's a lot to work with here."

We're also putting our DRO into SpinCo, which the marketplace has not valued, yet it has a great deal of value when you think about trades and so forth into the operating company.

And we've also given it a capability that have a basis in the assets, which we did not have before that it can do more things with the assets in terms of selling them, et cetera. So there's just a lot of tools. But in HCP, our shareholders expect consistency. And that's very hard to deliver when there's an unknown expectation.

I gave some examples earlier of some transactions that are bringing new operators to our company. We anticipate more of that. And then in regards to the triple-net discussions, there's been 25 noncore assets identified so far with Brookdale. There'll be more discussions with Brookdale.

We think we've got the right plan, the right people in place that it opens up optional tea and more importantly, we think that it puts HCP on the right course to really be a very, very competitive force in this market. So we want to exploit some of those relationships that we've built where we've had some handcuffs on it we take the handcuffs off. So that's why we're announcing this and even take a little time what we're telling you a good bit about HCP, what -- how you evaluate SpinCo will happen over the next couple of months, and it will be iterative. But we thought it was really the right course to go ahead and announce its."

Joining me this morning are Mike McKee who we announced this morning, has been elected Executive Chairman; Tim Schoen, Chief Financial Officer; Justin Hutchens, Chief Investment Officer; and John Lu, EVP of Corporate Finance and Investments. 
We have a lot to cover today. First, let me highlight some additions and changes to our leadership team. First, as I mentioned, Mike McKee has been elected Executive Chairman of the Company. Mike has been one of our longest tenured board members and have served as Nonexecutive Chairman of the Board since 2013. He's the former Vice Chairman and CEO of the Irvine Company and recently has been CEO of Bentall Kennedy, a leading real estate investment manager. 
Mike and I have worked closely together since I became CEO, and I look forward to working even more closely with him in his new role at this important point in the company's history. I'm also pleased to announce the promotion of Justin Hutchens to Chief Investment Officer. Justin continues to be an increasingly valuable contributor to our strategy and execution. 
In addition, we announced Kai Hsiao, former CEO of Holiday Retirement, has joined HCP as EVP, Senior Housing Asset Management. As most of you know, after a decade of outstanding service to HCP, Tim Schoen has accepted a new position as President of BioMed Realty. This will be his last earnings call with us as our CFO. We sincerely thank him for all the best in his new opportunity. I'm also pleased to report the recruitment process for Tim's replacement is well underway, and we hope to have definitive news soon.
Today, we are announcing a major step in addressing issues related to our HCR ManorCare portfolio investment and want to describe in some detail what impact that step will have on HCP going forward. And of course, we will address our quarterly results and update you on other important initiatives. 
Before we begin, please go to the Investor Relations section of our website where we posted a presentation, which we will refer to during our remarks. Let me turn the call over to Mike to begin our discussion of the spinoff transaction."
277966,330708834,978856,"HCP, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lauralee. I want to start by expressing my gratitude to Lauralee, our board, our executive team and the stellar group of financial and legal advisers, who've been working exceptionally hard in preparation for today and the days to come. Since",627,"Thank you, Lauralee. I want to start by expressing my gratitude to Lauralee, our board, our executive team and the stellar group of financial and legal advisers, who've been working exceptionally hard in preparation for today and the days to come. 
Since its inception, I have been a big believer in HCP, and more than anytime in our history, I believe the best days for this company are ahead. For a number of months now, our team has conducted a comprehensive review of all of our available options regarding our HCR ManorCare portfolio concentration. As part of that process, we also have engaged Carlyle and HCR ManorCare leadership in our discussions. 
As we reviewed our options, we landed on 2 key goals as we endeavored to maximize value to our shareholders. First, we believe as fiduciaries, we are stewards of the inherent value existing in our HCR ManorCare holdings, and we need to preserve and realize as much of that value as possible. And second, we need to eliminate the overhang that exists from the current challenges facing HCR ManorCare so that the rest of our business can flourish. 
As we focused on those goals and reviewed our options, for many reasons, it became clear to the board that the best pathway forward was to pursue a spinoff transaction. We do not see the spin as an end in itself, but as a means to an end. So let me run through the logic briefly, which we've outlined on Slides 1 and 2 of the presentation.
With the long-term perspective, we believe there is significant value embedded in our HCR portfolio that is presently not being recognized by the market. We are long-term believers in the post-acute and skilled space. Just several weeks ago, the federal government announced a proposed increase in rates for care in this space and highlighted the essential services that are provided in the continuum of care by post-acute and SNF facilities. 
As we explored our options for addressing HCR ManorCare's challenges, it was apparent to us that HCP is not the optimal investment vehicle to maximize the value in our HCR ManorCare real estate. In comparison, SpinCo, as a stand-alone business, focused on its post-acute and senior housing assets with a dedicated management team, will be able to employ a wider range of strategies with optionality to manage, sell or transition assets as desired, providing an attractive investment alternative for investors.
So the Spin transaction results in the creation of 2 separate business platforms, each with a more strategic focus, strong management teams, a distinct business strategy and investment profile and an appropriate capital structure to support each company's independent objectives. 
Before I turn it over to Lauralee to give you more details on the spin and the impact it will have on HCP post-spin, let me highlight 2 important points: first, we are very pleased to announce that Mark Ordan is joining our team to play a critical role in executing the spin. Mark has joined us as a  Senior Advisor, as, we prepare for the spin and will become CEO of SpinCo upon execution. 
Many of you know Mark from his days as CEO of Sunrise Senior Living and more recently, as Chairman of WP Glimcher, among other significant roles. In identifying and realizing the embedded value locked in HCR ManorCare, we believe we have the best, the most experienced leader available to take on this assignment. 
And lastly, I would note that like any spin, we expect SpinCo to be successful. But moreover, we look forward to returning HCP to a healthy, competitive and growing capital provider in the evolving world of health care. So now let me turn it back to Lauralee to give you some more background."
277966,330708834,978856,"HCP, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Let me draw your attention to Slide 3 of the presentation. SpinCo's portfolio will be primarily concentrated in HCR ManorCare's post-acute and assisted-living facilities and will also include the $250 million deferred rent obligation that",1106,"Thank you, Mike. Let me draw your attention to Slide 3 of the presentation. SpinCo's portfolio will be primarily concentrated in HCR ManorCare's post-acute and assisted-living facilities and will also include the $250 million deferred rent obligation that was negotiated in connection with the March 2015 lease amendment as well as the 9% investment in HCR's operating company. 
With a singular focus on a portfolio of primarily post-acute and senior housing assets, a flexible capital structure and a focused management team led by Mark, we believe SpinCo will be well positioned to take advantage of dynamics that are unique to the skilled nursing space and provide investors with an attractive investment return for the risk profile. 
SpinCo is intended to be conservatively capitalized to withstand potential uncertainty from its tenant concentration. Proceeds from the SpinCo debt financing will be distributed to HCP. And importantly, SpinCo would have expanded flexibility to manage, sell or transition assets as required in a tax-efficient manner. 
HCP's shareholders are expected to receive shares of SpinCo via a pro rata distribution. Following the distribution, HCP shareholders will own shares in both HCP and SpinCo, and the number of HCP shares owned by each shareholder will not change. SpinCo expects to file its initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC in the next 30 days, and the spinoff is expected to be completed in the second half of this year.
Turning to the highlights for HCP on Page 4. We believe this spin gives HCP the ability to reconfirm ourselves as a blue-chip, innovative relationship-oriented health care REIT. We will have a strong financial profile, a hallmark of HCP, for most of our 31-year history, with a premier portfolio weighted towards private pay. We'll be focused on our core growth businesses: senior housing, medical office and life science. 
The quality of our portfolio income post-spin increases tremendously with the younger, well-located assets, improved tenant concentration and a more stable income stream that is 95% private pay. Importantly, with an investment grade balance sheet and an improvement in our cost of capital over time, we will be well positioned to accelerate our accretive external growth opportunities.
Slide 5 puts a framework around HCP's financial profile -- pro forma for the Spin transaction. The cash proceeds generated from borrowings of SpinCo and our planned asset sales will be used to repay higher coupon debt, allowing HCP to maintain a credit profile that supports this growth going forward, with substantial liquidity and no debt maturities through the end of 2018, an improved weighted average cost of debt and an extended term on remaining debt maturities. 
Our financing plan targets a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the mid-6x range, with a manageable amount of asset sales. And we are in the process of evaluating opportunities for an additional capital recycling activities to further reduce leverage to our target ratio of 6x. 
Now turning to Slide 6. I will walk you through a snapshot of each of our asset classes in pro forma HCP post-spin. This is an important discussion because for quite some time, a disproportionate amount of our conversations with you have been dominated by questions around our HCR ManorCare investment. We can now focus on the strength of our remaining portfolio. 
Let me start with our life science business, which is led by Jon Bergschneider, who has been with this portfolio for 16 years. Life science had an exceptional quarter with 9.6% same-store growth. Occupancy is 98%, and we've already addressed or in negotiations for 2/3 of our 2016 lease maturities. Our $3.7 billion portfolio of 7 million square feet is concentrated in premier biotech clusters. We are the largest owner of lab space in the West Coast, with leading positions in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area, including the most active south San Francisco submarket with 30-plus percent market share.
Our income is diversified among more than 130 tenants, with 86% of our income from public or well-established private companies. The current health of the life science industry is one of the strongest we've seen in recent history, driven by 3 industry fundamentals: access to capital, consolidation and collaboration among research companies and a streamlined FDA process, which has resulted in an increase in the number of drug approvals. 
Looking ahead, our recent leasing success and strong tenant demand will continue to result in accelerated organic growth. In addition to the codevelopment project underway, we have ample development capacity in coastal, land constrained markets in San Francisco and San Diego, where we can expand and build an additional 2.6 million square feet of product.
Next, medical office. Our $3.6 billion medical office portfolio also delivered a solid quarter with 3.3% same-store growth. Demand for medical office space has increased significantly over the past several years, and our strong retention rates have helped keep our medical office portfolio occupancy consistently above 90% for 10 consecutive quarters. 
Our leasing momentum continued in the first quarter with more than half of this year's lease expirations already addressed or in negotiations. We have one of the largest medical office platforms in the country, with over 17 million square feet, led by Tom Klaritch, who has run this portfolio for 17 years. 
Medical office is a relationship-centered business. We have relationships with over 200 hospitals and health systems. 95% of our buildings are affiliated with a health system, and 83% are located on-campus with a hospital. Our goal is to be affiliated with the top 1 or 2 hospital systems in each market.
In addition, we currently have 4 on-campus properties under construction, and we've seen interest from various health systems to add additional on-campus space. These development projects were off-market transactions, the result of our relationship with the affiliated hospital system. Looking at sector fundamentals, medical office is a stable asset class with a positive outlook for demand.
Finally, our senior housing portfolio is led by Kendall Young, who has been with HCP for 6 years. We have a $9.6 billion portfolio of primarily private pay, senior housing communities, geographically diversified across the United States and the U.K. We are partnered with leading operators such as Brookdale and Sunrise in the U.S. and Maria Mallaband in the U.K.  And we continued to expand our portfolio with both existing and new relationships. 
Given this sector's fundamentals, catering to an aging demographic, senior housing will continue to be a core focus for HCP, as evidenced by the $1.7 billion of investments we have made in this space since the beginning of 2015. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Justin to discuss our senior housing transactions and performance."

I'll start by offering a very warm welcome to Kai Hsiao. I've known Kai for a number of years. As Lauralee mentioned earlier, he has joined us as the EVP of Senior Housing Asset Management.

As Lauralee mentioned earlier, he has joined us as the EVP of Senior Housing Asset Management. Kai brings a wealth of operating experience to our team. He has spent the past 7 years with Holiday Retirement Corporation, the nation's largest operator of independent living communities, including 3 years as the company's CEO. 
He made significant contributions leading the company's return to market leadership by boosting occupancy and margin. Kai will oversee the performance management of our portfolio, with an emphasis on value creation through business analytics, market analysis, financial oversight and asset repositioning. He's literally been in the shoes of our customers and will be a perfect complement to the HCP brand promise of building healthy partnerships. I am confident that Kai's operating expertise, combined with the investment savvy of Kendall Young, our EVP of Senior Housing Investments, will accelerate our senior housing platform for a success.
Now I'll discuss transactions demonstrating diversification of our operators. During the quarter, we acquired a portfolio of 5 private pay communities and 1 skilled nursing facility for $95 million. All the communities were developed within the past 2 years and are triple-net leased. We entered into definitive agreements to acquire a portfolio of 7 private pay assisted-living communities for $190 million, with an expectation to close in the second half of the year. The portfolio will be managed by Senior Lifestyle Corporation in a RIDEA joint venture. 
With these 2 transactions, we are adding 5 new relationships with 2 national operators and 3 regional operators. We have also agreed to the sale of half of our 80% ownership interest in our Brookdale RIDEA II joint venture portfolio through a fund operated by Columbia Pacific Advisors. We expect this transaction to close during the year. This transaction results in reduced Brookdale concentration as well as the addition of a well-capitalized joint venture partner with significant industry knowledge and future coinvestment opportunities.
Moving on to our portfolio performance. Our entire triple-net portfolio has an EBITDARM coverage of 1.27 and EBITDAR coverage of 1.07. Relative to Brookdale, we are in advanced discussions with them regarding up to 25 nonstrategic communities, which we intend to sell or transfer to other operators. We expect the lease coverage in 2016 to improve upon removing these communities. It's important to emphasize that all of our leases are backed by Brookdale's corporate guarantee. 
Our operating portfolio continues to perform well, with solid sequential gains in occupancy and NOI. Our same-store operating portfolio reported a very strong first quarter with year-over-year growth of 9.2%, driven by improved occupancy, rate and expense management. Occupancy has improved the last 3 consecutive quarters, and the Q1 annual rate increase was the strongest we've seen in several years. We remain actively engaged with all of our operators, who have active asset management platform, continuously reviewing local market dynamics, operating trends and the physical condition of our portfolio. 
Our strategic capital expenditures set us apart as a capital partner and distinguishes our communities to the residents as a high-quality product and an attractive price point. Our operating portfolio is concentrated in markets with strong demographics and population growth higher than both the industry and our peer group averages for the 75-plus cohort and total population. 
Only 6% of our portfolio is located within the top 10 MSAs for new construction. And at a local level, we continue to perform well. We have positioned our portfolio with appropriate affordability to residents in our local markets, which has resulted in strong growth and prospects for future growth despite increased supply for the broader MSAs.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim to talk about our financial results and updated guidance."
277966,330708834,978856,"HCP, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Justin. Let me start with our first quarter results.

For the quarter, we reported NAREIT FFO of $0.68 per share, which includes $0.01 per share of transaction-related costs in connection with our investment activities. Excluding transaction-related costs, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.69 per share and FAD of $0.66 per share. Both metrics are lower than prior year, primarily impacted by items that we have previously announced related to HCR ManorCare. Specifically, the lease amendment that took effect on April 1 last year and the 33 asset sales that we have closed to date reduced both FFO and FAD by $0.03 per share. FFO was further reduced by $0.08 per share from placing the HCR lease on cash basis beginning on January 1 this year.
First quarter same-store cash NOI performance declined 50 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the HCR ManorCare lease amendment in April 2015. Excluding the HCR ManorCare portfolio, we achieved solid same-store cash NOI growth of 3.2% from our higher growth private pay segments of senior housing, life science and medical office, representing 75% of our portfolio, led by a 9.6% increase in life science and 9.2% increase in RIDEA.
Moving on to capital recycling and balance sheet. We have announced $1.3 billion of capital recycling and refinancing activities for 2016, which will be used to permanently fund our year-to-date acquisitions and reduce future debt maturities, including $740 million of expected proceeds from the anticipated RIDEA II joint venture transaction that Justin just discussed, from selling a 40% stake in the venture and financing with third-party debt. 
In addition, we received $90 million from the sale of a noncore life science asset and medical office building in April. And we previously announced we expect $310 million from the first tranche of Genentech's purchase option on our life science campus in south San Francisco, which is expected to close in November and $130 million from the sale of HCR ManorCare's nonstrategic assets during the year, inclusive of $62 million from assets sold during the first quarter. In total, we still anticipate proceeds of $350 million after selling the remaining assets. 
Our financial leverage increased 50 basis points to 45.5%, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA increased to 6.2x at quarter end as we temporarily financed our first quarter acquisitions in our revolver. After paying down debt using the proceeds from our committed sales transactions just discussed, we expect these metrics to improve. Further, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of liquidity. 
Finally, our increased 2016 guidance. The 2016 guidance updated today represents our performance expectations for our entire HCP portfolio and does not reflect the Spin transaction announced this morning. Our guidance does reflect the impact of the RIDEA II transaction and our announced investment and capital recycling activities. 
With that said, the portfolio continues to perform well and, combined with our recent acquisition activity, we are raising guidance and expect HCP's full year 2016 NAREIT FFO to range from $2.76 to $2.82 per share. Excluding transaction-related items, we expect FFO as adjusted to range from $2.77 to $2.83 per share. And we are raising our FAD guidance to range between $2.65 and $2.71 per share. 
We are reaffirming our same-store cash NOI growth forecast of 1.5% to 2.5%, and we are projecting the majority 75% of our portfolio from the private pay senior housing, life science and medical office segments to increase between 2.3% and 3.3% when you exclude HCR ManorCare.
Let me close by expressing my gratitude to the HCP team. I worked alongside many of you in a variety of roles and feel fortunate to have been part of a talented industry-leading group of professionals that grew and expanded the HCP portfolio over the past decade. So let me end by simply saying, thank you, and turn the call back over to Lauralee for her concluding remarks."

We are proud of our high-quality diversified health care portfolio. We differentiate ourselves in the market with our building healthy partnership's approach, executed by seasoned sector leaders and investment teams with operating experience and knowledge. We further confirmed this differentiation with our announcement of Kai Hsiao joining our team. 
Pro forma HCP has an investment grade balance sheet with significant liquidity supported by a higher-quality portfolio income from a stable, private pay income stream. We are eliminating exposure to an industry with reimbursement models in transition, while our shareholders have the opportunity to realize substantial upside potential in SpinCo as an investment vehicle to optimize the long-term solution for the HCR ManorCare assets. 
By capitalizing on the difference in cost of capital between HCP's and SpinCo's respective health care sectors, HCP will be better positioned to deliver consistent returns while accelerating our internal and external growth profile. In summary, HCP's approach of building healthy partnerships, combined with an improved cost of capital, will lead to accretive investment growth. 
With that, I'll now ask the operator to open the line for questions."

As we have in the deck that we presented to you, we will be raising, plus or minus, about $2.75 billion of proceeds, of which $740 million is RIDEA II as we think about HCP after. But if I go to that $2 billion and think about spin, what we've been told by advisers is that there is debt out there in the marketplace that definitely can be achieved at about a 5x leverage at market level rents. And so what we've assumed is, we can get proceeds on that basis, and the additional amount that gets to the $2 billion will be asset sales that HCP will do that will then focus us on about a 6.5x leverage. Relative to dividend, I'm going to answer that both HCP and spin. Until the spin happens, our current dividend policy will continue. Post-spin, obviously, the dividend policy for Spin will be set by the board of that company. But if I think about HCP post-spin, going back to our investment thesis, will be a very high-quality private pay portfolio, definitely focused on having a very strong investment grade balance sheet. And I expect that we will have a dividend policy that is focused on total shareholder return, which means growth in the company and growth in our dividend. And I think you had one more question that I might have lost. There was 3 in there."

When you look at that team that has been assembled, one thing I would note is that 4 of these leaders have been CEOs of very notable organizations before they came together here as a team.

We've got a number of strategic initiatives, one of which we announced today. We've got 75% of our business that we think can stand up to and may be, in our personal view, is as good as any health care portfolio in the world. And we want to grow that. So there is a lot to do around here. There's a lot that's been happening and I just see my role as complementary to working with this team. In terms of leadership development, let me just spend a second on that. It's our desire to, as a best practice, develop the leadership that we have. And that's just not at the top level, but layers down. The board would very much like to have a successor or 2 for every key position we have in the company. We're not a big headcount-type company so to be able to do that will take time and emphasis. And we think that there are some tools that we can apply, which will take some top talent and bring them up to new levels of leadership. So I'll be spending some time on that as well. So we see all this as complementary. I think if you look at the dynamic nature of all the things that are going on in our business, we want to have the resources to address things real-time on multiple fronts. And we think some of these changes are going to allow that."

Certainly, our operating portfolio has seen really good results, but we're mindful of concentrations and capital recycling. So the RIDEA II transaction I mentioned presented an opportunity for us. Meanwhile, we're in regular discussions with Brookdale in terms of how to unlock value within our triple-net portfolio. I mentioned 25 assets. The valuation relative to those assets hasn't really been determined. I can tell you, our intention is to either sell assets or in the event that those noncore assets for Brookdale are, in fact, a core asset for a regional operator, we may place those with a new operator. The intent is to be cash flow neutral. There'll be a little bit of tick-up due to some of the performance of the assets. And so we're actually expecting a slight improvement in our cash flow coverage about 1x to 1.5x as a result of the transaction.

But right now, the issues facing the industry are complex and many. And we can't predict at this time how long it will take for the industry to stabilize. And we have been rather patient at HCP, in my opinion, about trying to see if there is some recovery on the horizon. But right now, we can't predict when that is. So one of the motivations in moving to the spin was the recognition that if you can't predict that and you have an overhang on the 75% of the business, which we think is pretty terrific, the spin just makes a lot of sense to us, to not only to give more flexibility around options, but also to recognize this is likely to take some time."

Often, spins are motivated by a desire to separate off assets that are a drag on the overall business. And certainly, that's the case here. But having said that, as mentioned earlier, many still consider HCR ManorCare as a leader in this space based on their quality of care and clinical capabilities and the quality of the real estate. So there's a lot for Mark Ordan to work with here. And we believe in a dedicated vehicle, he'll be able to better translate to the market the potential in the platform. There's been a lot of focus on it, not just through us, but more generally, in the space. But we think the dedicated vehicle will allow more transparency to the extent we have it. Again, as a landlord, you're somewhat limited, you're not the operator. But nevertheless, we think that with his background in health care, in real estate, as CEO of several spins or turnarounds and a successful track record, that he's uniquely positioned to both translate to the market but also find the path of different alternatives that unlocks the most value."

Some have done well, some not so well. You've referenced a couple. I guess what I would focus on here is that a number of spins are spinning off assets that are not well received in the marketplace, really, for reasons that aren't related to some of the reasons that we're dealing with post-acute and SNF here. In one case, it was B malls. And in other case, it might be lesser quality facilities. We really are dealing here with an industry leader, and you can talk about the industry being in some stress. But I don't think anybody would say that this is bad real estate or that, that kind of quality of care that's going on here isn't top quality. So there's a lot to work with here. It is -- in its purest form, it is a workout-type of situation. But I would say that in some of the brainstorming we've done, there are lots of options out in the marketplace, because the whole space is in transition and trying to cope with many of the same problems. So we think that there's a wide array of strategies that could be considered once it's in a dedicated vehicle. So I think the basic answer, in my prior life, we had an opening fund that was consistently in the third quartile on performance. We did a look, and we were way overweighted to suburban office for historical reasons. We completely flipped that and got out of it and now have top performance, top quartile performance. I think when Simon did their spin, they were looking at the B malls. B malls are in a tough space right now. So I don't think you can kind of correlate one asset class to another. I think you've got to look at the dynamics of each one on their merits. And I think we believe that there's a lot to work with here."

So it was kind of a way to address concentration, address recycling, but still maintaining a relationship that we have a lot of confidence in. And that will be an ongoing dialogue we'll have with investors. Because as I said, we're probably going to be about down to 1/3 of our portfolio will be Brookdale post-spin. Certainly, to Mike's point and Lauralee's point, we will grow. Again, that's our intent, and that will help diversification. And I gave some examples earlier of some transactions that are bringing new operators to our company. We anticipate more of that. And then in regards to the triple-net discussions, there's been 25 noncore assets identified so far with Brookdale. There'll be more discussions with Brookdale. We have a great, very fluid dialogue with them, and we're in continuous and constant discussions about how to create value with that portfolio.

Joining me this morning are Mike McKee who we announced this morning, has been elected Executive Chairman; Tim Schoen, Chief Financial Officer; Justin Hutchens, Chief Investment Officer; and John Lu, EVP of Corporate Finance and Investments. 
We have a lot to cover today. First, let me highlight some additions and changes to our leadership team. First, as I mentioned, Mike McKee has been elected Executive Chairman of the Company. Mike has been one of our longest tenured board members and has served as Nonexecutive Chairman of the Board since 2013. He's the former Vice Chairman and CEO of The Irvine Company and recently has been CEO of Bentall Kennedy, a leading real estate investment manager. 
Mike and I have worked closely together since I became CEO, and I look forward to working even more closely with him in his new role at this important point in the company's history. I'm also pleased to announce the promotion of Justin Hutchens to Chief Investment Officer. Justin continues to be an increasingly valuable contributor to our strategy and execution. 
In addition, we announced Kai Hsiao, former CEO of Holiday Retirement, has joined HCP as EVP, Senior Housing Asset Management. As most of you know, after a decade of outstanding service to HCP, Tim Schoen has accepted a new position as President of BioMed Realty. This will be his last earnings call with us as our CFO. We sincerely thank him for all the best in this new opportunity. I'm also pleased to report the recruitment process for Tim's replacement is well underway, and we hope to have definitive news soon.
Today, we are announcing a major step in addressing issues related to our HCR ManorCare portfolio investment and want to describe in some detail what impact that step will have on HCP going forward. And of course, we will address our quarterly results and update you on other important initiatives. 
Before we begin, please go to the Investor Relations section of our website where we've posted a presentation, which we will refer to during our remarks. Let me turn the call over to Mike to begin our discussion of the spinoff transaction."
277966,330708834,979126,"HCP, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lauralee. I want to start by expressing my gratitude to Lauralee, our board, our executive team and the stellar group of financial and legal advisers, who've been working exceptionally hard in preparation for today and the days to come. Since",628,"Thank you, Lauralee. I want to start by expressing my gratitude to Lauralee, our board, our executive team and the stellar group of financial and legal advisers, who've been working exceptionally hard in preparation for today and the days to come. 
Since its inception, I have been a big believer in HCP, and more than any time in our history, I believe the best days for this company are ahead. For a number of months now, our team has conducted a comprehensive review of all of our available options regarding our HCR ManorCare portfolio concentration. As part of that process, we also have engaged Carlyle and HCR ManorCare leadership in our discussions. 
As we reviewed our options, we landed on 2 key goals as we endeavored to maximize value to our shareholders. First, we believe as fiduciaries, we are stewards of the inherent value existing in our HCR ManorCare holdings, and we need to preserve and realize as much of that value as possible. And second, we need to eliminate the overhang that exists from the current challenges facing HCR ManorCare so that the rest of our business can flourish. 
As we focused on those goals and reviewed our options, for many reasons, it became clear to the board that the best pathway forward was to pursue a spinoff transaction. We do not see the spin as an end in itself, but as a means to an end. So let me run through the logic briefly, which we've outlined on Slides 1 and 2 of the presentation.
With a long-term perspective, we believe there is significant value embedded in our HCR portfolio that is presently not being recognized by the market. We are long-term believers in the post-acute and skilled space. Just several weeks ago, the federal government announced a proposed increase in rates for care in this space and highlighted the essential services that are provided in the continuum of care by post-acute and SNF facilities. 
As we explored our options for addressing HCR ManorCare's challenges, it was apparent to us that HCP is not the optimal investment vehicle to maximize the value in our HCR ManorCare real estate. In comparison, SpinCo, as a stand-alone business, focused on its post-acute and senior housing assets with a dedicated management team, will be able to employ a wider range of strategies with optionality to manage, sell or transition assets as desired, providing an attractive investment alternative for investors.
So the Spin transaction results in the creation of 2 separate business platforms, each with a more strategic focus, strong management teams, a distinct business strategy and investment profile and an appropriate capital structure to support each company's independent objectives. 
Before I turn it over to Lauralee to give you more details on the spin and the impact it will have on HCP post-spin, let me highlight 2 important points: first, we are very pleased to announce that Mark Ordan is joining our team to play a critical role in executing the spin. Mark has joined us as a senior adviser, as, we prepare for the spin and will become CEO of SpinCo upon execution. 
Many of you know Mark from his days as CEO of Sunrise Senior Living and more recently, as Chairman of WP Glimcher, among other significant roles. In identifying and realizing the embedded value locked in HCR ManorCare, we believe we have the best, the most experienced leader available to take on this assignment. 
And lastly, I would note that like any spin, we expect SpinCo to be successful. But moreover, we look forward to returning HCP to a healthy, competitive and growing capital provider in the evolving world of health care. So now let me turn it back to Lauralee to give you some more background."
277966,330708834,979126,"HCP, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Let me draw your attention to Slide 3 of the presentation. SpinCo's portfolio will be primarily concentrated in HCR ManorCare's post-acute and assisted-living facilities and will also include the $250 million deferred rent obligation that",1107,"Thank you, Mike. Let me draw your attention to Slide 3 of the presentation. SpinCo's portfolio will be primarily concentrated in HCR ManorCare's post-acute and assisted-living facilities and will also include the $250 million deferred rent obligation that was negotiated in connection with the March 2015 lease amendment as well as the 9% investment in HCR's operating company. 
With a singular focus on a portfolio of primarily post-acute and senior housing assets, a flexible capital structure and a focused management team led by Mark, we believe SpinCo will be well positioned to take advantage of dynamics that are unique to the skilled nursing space and provide investors with an attractive investment return for the risk profile. 
SpinCo is intended to be conservatively capitalized to withstand potential uncertainty from its tenant concentration. Proceeds from the SpinCo debt financing will be distributed to HCP. And importantly, SpinCo would have expanded flexibility to manage, sell or transition assets as required in a tax-efficient manner. 
HCP's shareholders are expected to receive shares of SpinCo via a pro rata distribution. Following the distribution, HCP shareholders will own shares in both HCP and SpinCo, and the number of HCP shares owned by each shareholder will not change. SpinCo expects to file its initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC in the next 30 days, and the spinoff is expected to be completed in the second half of this year.
Turning to the highlights for HCP on Page 4. We believe this spin gives HCP the ability to reconfirm ourselves as a blue-chip, innovative relationship-oriented health care REIT. We will have a strong financial profile, a hallmark of HCP, for most of our 31-year history, with a premier portfolio weighted towards private pay. We'll be focused on our core growth businesses: senior housing, medical office and life science. 
The quality of our portfolio income post-spin increases tremendously with the younger, well-located assets, improved tenant concentration and a more stable income stream that is 95% private pay. Importantly, with an investment grade balance sheet and an improvement in our cost of capital over time, we will be well positioned to accelerate our accretive external growth opportunities.
Slide 5 puts a framework around HCP's financial profile -- pro forma for the Spin transaction. The cash proceeds generated from borrowings of SpinCo and our planned asset sales will be used to repay higher coupon debt, allowing HCP to maintain a credit profile that supports its growth going forward, with substantial liquidity and no debt maturities through the end of 2018, an improved weighted average cost of debt and an extended term on remaining debt maturities. 
Our financing plan targets a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the mid-6x range, with a manageable amount of asset sales. And we are in the process of evaluating opportunities for an additional capital recycling activities to further reduce leverage to our target ratio of 6x. 
Now turning to Slide 6. I will walk you through a snapshot of each of our asset classes in pro forma HCP post-spin. This is an important discussion because for quite some time, a disproportionate amount of our conversations with you have been dominated by questions around our HCR ManorCare investment. We can now focus on the strength of our remaining portfolio. 
Let me start with our life science business, which is led by Jon Bergschneider, who has been with this portfolio for 16 years. Life science had an exceptional quarter with 9.6% same-store growth. Occupancy is 98%, and we've already addressed or are in negotiations for 2/3 of our 2016 lease maturities. Our $3.7 billion portfolio of 7 million square feet is concentrated in premier biotech clusters. We are the largest owner of lab space on the West Coast, with leading positions in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area, including the most active South San Francisco submarket with 30-plus percent market share.
Our income is diversified among more than 130 tenants, with 86% of our income from public or well-established private companies. The current health of the life science industry is one of the strongest we've seen in recent history, driven by 3 industry fundamentals: access to capital, consolidation and collaboration among research companies and a streamlined FDA process, which has resulted in an increase in the number of drug approvals. 
Looking ahead, our recent leasing success and strong tenant demand will continue to result in accelerated organic growth. In addition to the codevelopment project underway, we have ample development capacity in coastal, land constrained markets in San Francisco and San Diego, where we can expand and build an additional 2.6 million square feet of product.
Next, medical office. Our $3.6 billion medical office portfolio also delivered a solid quarter with 3.3% same-store growth. Demand for medical office space has increased significantly over the past several years, and our strong retention rates have helped keep our medical office portfolio occupancy consistently above 90% for 10 consecutive quarters. 
Our leasing momentum continued in the first quarter with more than half of this year's lease expirations already addressed or in negotiations. We have one of the largest medical office platforms in the country, with over 17 million square feet, led by Tom Klaritch, who has run this portfolio for 17 years. 
Medical office is a relationship-centered business. We have relationships with over 200 hospitals and health systems. 95% of our buildings are affiliated with a health system, and 83% are located on-campus with a hospital. Our goal is to be affiliated with the top 1 or 2 hospital systems in each market.
In addition, we currently have 4 on-campus properties under construction, and we've seen interest from various health systems to add additional on-campus space. These development projects were off-market transactions, the result of our relationship with the affiliated hospital system. Looking at sector fundamentals, medical office is a stable asset class with a positive outlook for demand.
Finally, our senior housing portfolio is led by Kendall Young, who has been with HCP for 6 years. We have a $9.6 billion portfolio of primarily private pay, senior housing communities, geographically diversified across the United States and the U.K. We are partnered with leading operators such as Brookdale and Sunrise in the U.S. and Maria Mallaband in the U.K. And we continued to expand our portfolio with both existing and new relationships. 
Given this sector's fundamentals, catering to an aging demographic, senior housing will continue to be a core focus for HCP, as evidenced by the $1.7 billion of investments we have made in this space since the beginning of 2015. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Justin to discuss our senior housing transactions and performance."

I'll start by offering a very warm welcome to Kai Hsiao. I've known Kai for a number of years. As Lauralee mentioned earlier, he has joined us as the EVP of Senior Housing Asset Management.

As Lauralee mentioned earlier, he has joined us as the EVP of Senior Housing Asset Management. Kai brings a wealth of operating experience to our team. He has spent the past 7 years with Holiday Retirement Corporation, the nation's largest operator of independent living communities, including 3 years as the company's CEO. 
He made significant contributions leading the company's return to market leadership by boosting occupancy and margin. Kai will oversee the performance management of our portfolio, with an emphasis on value creation through business analytics, market analysis, financial oversight and asset repositioning. He's literally been in the shoes of our customers and will be a perfect complement to the HCP brand promise of building healthy partnerships. I am confident that Kai's operating expertise, combined with the investment savvy of Kendall Young, our EVP of Senior Housing Investments, will accelerate our senior housing platform for a success.
Now I'll discuss transactions demonstrating diversification of our operators. During the quarter, we acquired a portfolio of 5 private pay communities and 1 skilled nursing facility for $95 million. All the communities were developed within the past 2 years and are triple-net leased. We entered into definitive agreements to acquire a portfolio of 7 private pay assisted-living communities for $190 million, with an expectation to close in the second half of the year. The portfolio will be managed by Senior Lifestyle Corporation in a RIDEA joint venture. 
With these 2 transactions, we are adding 5 new relationships with 2 national operators and 3 regional operators. We have also agreed to the sale of half of our 80% ownership interest in our Brookdale RIDEA II joint venture portfolio to a fund operated by Columbia Pacific Advisors. We expect this transaction to close during the year. This transaction results in reduced Brookdale concentration as well as the addition of a well-capitalized joint venture partner with significant industry knowledge and future coinvestment opportunities.
Moving on to our portfolio performance. Our entire triple-net portfolio has an EBITDARM coverage of 1.27x and EBITDAR coverage of 1.07x. Relative to Brookdale, we are in advanced discussions with them regarding up to 25 nonstrategic communities, which we intend to sell or transfer to other operators. We expect the lease coverage in 2016 to improve upon removing these communities. It's important to emphasize that all of our leases are backed by Brookdale's corporate guarantee. 
Our operating portfolio continues to perform well, with solid sequential gains in occupancy and NOI. Our same-store operating portfolio reported a very strong first quarter with year-over-year growth of 9.2%, driven by improved occupancy, rate and expense management. Occupancy has improved the last 3 consecutive quarters, and the Q1 annual rate increase was the strongest we've seen in several years. We remain actively engaged with all of our operators through our active asset management platform, continuously reviewing local market dynamics, operating trends and the physical condition of our portfolio. 
Our strategic capital expenditures set us apart as a capital partner and distinguishes our communities to the residents as a high-quality product at an attractive price point. Our operating portfolio is concentrated in markets with strong demographics and population growth higher than both the industry and our peer group averages for the 75-plus cohort and total population. 
Only 6% of our portfolio is located within the top 10 MSAs for new construction. And at a local level, we continue to perform well. We have positioned our portfolio with appropriate affordability to residents in our local markets, which has resulted in strong growth and prospects for future growth despite increased supply for the broader MSAs.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim to talk about our financial results and updated guidance."

Let me start with our first quarter results. For the quarter, we reported NAREIT FFO of $0.68 per share, which includes $0.01 per share of transaction-related costs in connection with our investment activities. Excluding transaction-rel",649,"Thank you, Justin. Let me start with our first quarter results. For the quarter, we reported NAREIT FFO of $0.68 per share, which includes $0.01 per share of transaction-related costs in connection with our investment activities. Excluding transaction-related costs, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.69 per share and FAD of $0.66 per share. Both metrics are lower than prior year, primarily impacted by items that we have previously announced related to HCR ManorCare. Specifically, the lease amendment that took effect on April 1 last year and the 33 asset sales that we have closed to date reduced both FFO and FAD by $0.03 per share. FFO was further reduced by $0.08 per share from placing the HCR lease on cash basis beginning on January 1 this year.
First quarter same-store cash NOI performance declined 50 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the HCR ManorCare lease amendment in April 2015. Excluding the HCR ManorCare portfolio, we achieved solid same-store cash NOI growth of 3.2% from our higher growth private pay segments of senior housing, life science and medical office, representing 75% of our portfolio, led by a 9.6% increase in life science and 9.2% increase in RIDEA.
Moving on to capital recycling and balance sheet. We have announced $1.3 billion of capital recycling and refinancing activities for 2016, which will be used to permanently fund our year-to-date acquisitions and reduce future debt maturities, including $740 million of expected proceeds from the anticipated RIDEA II joint venture transaction that Justin just discussed, from selling a 40% stake in the venture and financing with third-party debt. 
In addition, we received $90 million from the sales of a noncore life science asset and medical office building in April. And we previously announced we expect $310 million from the first tranche of Genentech's purchase option on our life science campus in South San Francisco, which is expected to close in November and $130 million from the sale of HCR ManorCare's nonstrategic assets during the year, inclusive of $62 million from assets sold during the first quarter. In total, we still anticipate proceeds of $350 million after selling the remaining assets. 
Our financial leverage increased 50 basis points to 45.5%, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA increased to 6.2x at quarter end as we temporarily financed our first quarter acquisitions on our revolver. After paying down debt using the proceeds from our committed sales transactions just discussed, we expect these metrics to improve. Further, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of liquidity. 
Finally, our increased 2016 guidance. The 2016 guidance updated today represents our performance expectations for our entire HCP portfolio and does not reflect the Spin transaction announced this morning. Our guidance does reflect the impact of the RIDEA II transaction and our announced investment and capital recycling activities. 
With that said, the portfolio continues to perform well and, combined with our recent acquisition activity, we are raising guidance and expect HCP's full year 2016 NAREIT FFO to range from $2.76 to $2.82 per share. Excluding transaction-related items, we expect FFO as adjusted to range from $2.77 to $2.83 per share. And we are raising our FAD guidance to range between $2.65 and $2.71 per share. 
We are reaffirming our same-store cash NOI growth forecast of 1.5% to 2.5%, and we are projecting the majority 75% of our portfolio from the private pay senior housing, life science and medical office segments to increase between 2.3% and 3.3% when you exclude HCR ManorCare.
Let me close by expressing my gratitude to the HCP team. I worked alongside many of you in a variety of roles and feel fortunate to have been part of a talented industry-leading group of professionals that grew and expanded the HCP portfolio over the past decade. So let me end by simply saying, thank you, and turn the call back over to Lauralee for her concluding remarks."

We are proud of our high-quality diversified health care portfolio. We differentiate ourselves in the market with our building healthy partnership's approach, executed by seasoned sector leaders and investment teams with operating experience and knowledge. We further confirmed this differentiation with our announcement of Kai Hsiao joining our team. 
Pro forma HCP has an investment grade balance sheet with significant liquidity supported by a higher-quality portfolio income from a stable, private pay income stream. We are eliminating exposure to an industry with reimbursement models in transition, while our shareholders have the opportunity to realize substantial upside potential in SpinCo as an investment vehicle to optimize the long-term solution for the HCR ManorCare assets. 
By capitalizing on the difference in cost of capital between HCP's and SpinCo's respective health care sectors, HCP will be better positioned to deliver consistent returns while accelerating our internal and external growth profile. In summary, HCP's approach of building healthy partnerships, combined with an improved cost of capital, will lead to accretive investment growth. 
With that, I'll now ask the operator to open the line for questions."

As we have in the deck that we presented to you, we will be raising, plus or minus, about $2.75 billion of proceeds, of which $740 million is RIDEA II as we think about HCP after. But if I go to that $2 billion and think about Spin, what we've been told by advisers is that there is debt out there in the marketplace that definitely can be achieved at about a 5x leverage at market level rents. And so what we've assumed is, we can get proceeds on that basis, and the additional amount that gets to the $2 billion will be asset sales that HCP will do that will then focus us on about a 6.5x leverage. Relative to dividend, I'm going to answer that both HCP and Spin. Until the spin happens, our current dividend policy will continue. Post-spin, obviously, the dividend policy for Spin will be set by the board of that company. But if I think about HCP post-spin, going back to our investment thesis, we'll be a very high-quality private pay portfolio, definitely focused on having a very strong investment grade balance sheet. And I expect that we will have a dividend policy that is focused on total shareholder return, which means growth in the company and growth in our dividend. And I think you had one more question that I might have lost. There was 3 in there."

We've announced my addition as an Executive Chair. We announced today, Kai Hsiao coming in, in his capacity. When you look at that team that has been assembled, one thing I would note is that 4 of these leaders have been CEOs of very notable organizations before they came together here as a team. And even on our P&L leadership front, I think you've heard in the past, we're very proud that Tom Klaritch, Jon Bergschneider and Kendall Young are very well known in their respective sectors.

Lauralee and I have worked very closely together over the couple of years that she has been here. As you know, she stepped into quite a set of issues and has had her hands full. I think that when we looked at this role, we noted that there is a lot going on, on many fronts. And we have a new team coalescing. We've got a number of strategic initiatives, one of which we announced today. We've got 75% of our business that we think can stand up to and may be, in our personal view, is as good as any health care portfolio in the world. And we want to grow that. So there is a lot to do around here. There's a lot that's been happening and I just see my role as complementary to working with this team. In terms of leadership development, let me just spend a second on that. It's our desire to, as a best practice, develop the leadership that we have. And that's just not at the top level, but layers down. The board would very much like to have a successor or 2 for every key position we have in the company. We're not a big headcount-type company so to be able to do that will take time and emphasis. And we think that there are some tools that we can apply, which will take some top talent and bring them up to new levels of leadership. So I'll be spending some time on that as well. So we see all this as complementary. I think if you look at the dynamic nature of all the things that are going on in our business, we want to have the resources to address things real-time on multiple fronts. And we think some of these changes are going to allow that."

Certainly, our operating portfolio has seen really good results, but we're mindful of concentrations and capital recycling. So the RIDEA II transaction I mentioned presented an opportunity for us. Meanwhile, we're in regular discussions with Brookdale in terms of how to unlock value within our triple-net portfolio. I mentioned 25 assets. The valuation relative to those assets hasn't really been determined. I can tell you, our intention is to either sell assets or in the event that those noncore assets for Brookdale are, in fact, a core asset for a regional operator, we may place those with a new operator. The intent is to be cash flow neutral. There'll be a little bit of pick-up due to some of the performance of the assets. And so we're actually expecting a slight improvement in our cash flow coverage about 1.5x as a result of the transaction. But a lot of the details are still being discussed and we'll have more down the road as that materializes."

But right now, the issues facing the industry are complex and many. And we can't predict at this time how long it will take for the industry to stabilize. And we have been rather patient at HCP, in my opinion, about trying to see if there is some recovery on the horizon. But right now, we can't predict when that is. So one of the motivations in moving to the spin was the recognition that if you can't predict that and you have an overhang on the 75% of the business, which we think is pretty terrific, the spin just makes a lot of sense to us, to not only to give more flexibility around options, but also to recognize this is likely to take some time."

Some have done well, some not so well. You've referenced a couple. I guess what I would focus on here is that a number of spins are spinning off assets that are not well received in the marketplace, really, for reasons that aren't related to some of the reasons that we're dealing with post-acute and SNF here. In one case, it was B malls. And in other case, it might be lesser quality facilities. We really are dealing here with an industry leader, and you can talk about the industry being in some stress. But I don't think anybody would say that this is bad real estate or that, that kind of quality of care that's going on here isn't top quality. So there's a lot to work with here. It is -- in its purest form, it is a workout-type of situation. But I would say that in some of the brainstorming we've done, there are lots of options out in the marketplace, because the whole space is in transition and trying to cope with many of the same problems. So we think that there's a wide array of strategies that could be considered once it's in a dedicated vehicle. So I think the basic answer, in my prior life, we had an open-end fund that was consistently in the third quartile on performance. We did a look, and we were way overweighted to suburban office for historical reasons. We completely flipped that and got out of it and now have top performance, top quartile performance. I think when Simon did their spin, they were looking at the B malls. B malls are in a tough space right now. So I don't think you can kind of correlate one asset class to another. I think you've got to look at the dynamics of each one on their merits. And I think we believe that there's a lot to work with here."

So I think in terms of sales, you have to look at the inherent value, and it's a matter of timing. We've already been in the market with 50 properties. I think we've got 37 or 38 that have been sold. So we're pretty well aware of pricing and what's available out there. And anything that will be done on -- if -- in terms of more asset sales, will have to be done over time.

And perhaps in time, we might be interested in buying the assets back. We wouldn't rule that out. So it was kind of a way to address concentration, address recycling, but still maintaining a relationship that we have a lot of confidence in. And that will be an ongoing dialogue we'll have with investors. Because as I said, we're probably going to be about down to 1/3 of our portfolio will be Brookdale post-spin. Certainly, to Mike's point and Lauralee's point, we will grow. Again, that's our intent, and that will help diversification. And I gave some examples earlier of some transactions that are bringing new operators to our company. We anticipate more of that. And then in regards to the triple-net discussions, there's been 25 noncore assets identified so far with Brookdale. There'll be more discussions with Brookdale. We have a great, very fluid dialogue with them, and we're in continuous and constant discussions about how to create value with that portfolio.

Joining me today is Justin Hutchens, our Chief Investment Officer; and John Lu, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Finance. And I'm pleased to welcome back Tom Herzog on his first earnings call since returning as our Chief Financial Officer.
We look forward to sharing with you our quarterly results and updates on several significant initiatives. But before diving into the details, I want to step back for several minutes and give you some additional color on the rationale behind some major changes at the company. They have a purpose.
I will start by saying this is an exciting time at HCP. It's a renaissance of sorts. I've been referring recently to the stage we are entering into as HCP 3.0. I've been fortunate to be a witness to and a participant in each of the generational periods of HCP since its formation in 1985. 
The first generation was represented by our friend and founding CEO, Ken Roath. Well-known to many of you, Ken established our company as one of the first health care REITs and grew it significantly with a solid foundation and a stellar reputation. 
Jay Flaherty is identified with our second generation. Over his decade of leadership, he repositioned the company to a significant extent by moving away from properties reliant on government reimbursement and into larger transactions that provided scale as privatization and consolidation swept through the industry. 
Lessons learned, one large transaction that we all take responsibility for was our purchase of HCR ManorCare in 2011. At the time of the purchase, this leading skilled nursing post-acute company was widely acclaimed as best-in-class, but it was also heavily reliant on government reimbursement. All of you know that over the last 5 years, the skilled nursing post-acute space has been rocked by numerous sequential challenges. The cumulative impact has been strongly felt across the sector.
When these issues came more into focus, we asked Lauralee Martin to take the helm and bridge us to the next generation. We knew we were giving her a tough hand to play, but none of us were able to predict how difficult the last few years would be as this space continued to be jolted by one decision or another imposed on it primarily by the payer's shift toward Medicare Advantage and the net effect of sequestration cuts.
In the last few months, the board and I evaluated where we were and what the future could look like. In addition to the spin and the other initiatives in play, we determined that the best course was to move HCP 3.0 forward by starting to put the face on the team that would take the company forward into the next generation of evolution and growth. 
With the initiatives we have announced and some we will announce shortly, all of us are confident and excited about our prospects for near- and longer-term performance and growth. I want to express my heartfelt appreciation for the effort and contribution that Lauralee gave us, getting us to the point that we can now launch this next stage.
Let me also report that the team that will take us forward is coming together very well. There is some blending of new folks and encore appearance and those that have been around for many years. They are working marvelously together, and I am confident that you will see tangible positive results soon from the groundwork that is underway. 
In assembling this team, there is a method to our madness. It's been noted by many of you that we've added some key executives like Justin Hutchens and Kai Hsiao with strong reputations as leaders and operators of large health care companies. And we've added other new team members who aren't as publicly visible with similar backgrounds. 
Our long-tenured executives, Tom Klaritch and Jon Bergschneider, who run our Medical Office and Life Science platforms, are as well-regarded as anyone in their respective roles. And with Tom Herzog returning to our team, we have someone widely regarded for his conservative yet progressive thinking around balance sheet, cost of capital management and strategic capital allocation, will stack this talented team up against any in the industry.
Now looking ahead, one of the biggest questions we face like many REITs is how do you plan to grow going forward. Well, our assessment is that there is plenty of room to grow, but it will be a different strategic path than in recent -- in the recent past. Much of the growth in the future will come through affiliations with provider networks and picking experienced operators and partnering with them for growth. 
The good news is that the health care real estate market remains large, and in many areas, highly fragmented. HCP is being shaped to be the capital partner of choice because we understand the needs of the operator, and we know how operations either succeed or fail. We believe that our ability to attract and underwrite potential investments will benefit from the internal resources assembled, and we believe we will quickly become a trusted partner to selected new operators and emerging provider networks because we talk their language and have an appreciation of their needs.  
We understand business needs because we have run businesses. And we have walked in our tenants' shoes. So when we talk about a new generation, HCP 3.0, we are talking not just about change but strategic change to meet the market where it is and where it's going.
With that said, there are some key overhangs that we are aggressively addressing to position us for growth: First, we are obviously addressing the issues related to HCR ManorCare with the spin transaction; second, although we have a high degree of confidence in Brookdale Senior Living, we recognize reducing our portfolio concentration in Brookdale is a high priority; third, we have somewhat elevated leverage as compared to our peers and historical averages. We are prepared to improve our balance sheet metrics progressively over the next 2 to 3 years; fourth, as you continue to get to know our next generation of leaders, we believe that you will quickly gain confidence in our ability to execute and to grow prudently; and finally, as part of sustained credibility, we will be a leader in transparency, predictability and clarity to the fullest extent possible. 
Let me acknowledge upfront that this earnings call has some inherent limitations because some of what we are doing is still in progress, and detailed information in some areas is restricted by the fact that we are in registration with the SEC for our spin transaction and we are not yet effective. We will do the best we can to be responsive to your questions, but we really look forward to getting through the next several months when all of the things we are doing will become much clearer when the comprehensive plan we are implementing can be shared with you fully.
Today, we will cover details of our second quarter results and portfolio performance, and we'll give you an update on our spinoff of HCR ManorCare, which is well underway and expected to be completed early in the fourth quarter.
I'm happy to report that we now have a name for the new spin company. We call it Quality Care Properties or QCP. I'm also happy to report that the remaining 75% of our portfolio, which is predominantly private pay, is performing at or above plan and will anchor HCP's organic growth following the spin. Let me now turn things over to Tom Herzog, who will focus on our quarterly results and financial performance."
277966,372625672,1031222,"HCP, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Today, I will cover several topics: first, our second quarter results; second, an update on our dispositions and RIDEA 2 transaction; third, our balance sheet and financing plan; and finally, our updated 2016 guidance.I'll start with ou",1077,"Thank you, Mike. Today, I will cover several topics: first, our second quarter results; second, an update on our dispositions and RIDEA 2 transaction; third, our balance sheet and financing plan; and finally, our updated 2016 guidance.
I'll start with our results. During the second quarter, we reported NAREIT FFO of $0.71 per share, which included a negative $0.03 per share of transaction-related costs, substantially all of which were spin-related. Excluding these costs, we recorded FFO as adjusted of $0.74 per share and FAD of $0.72 per share. 
Also impacting the quarter were gains of $0.03 per share that resulted from monetizing our share in the appreciation of 2 participating development loans in our senior housing segment. Note that there was a similar gain of $0.02 per share in the prior year period.
Both NAREIT FFO and FFO as adjusted for the quarter reflect an $0.08 per share year-over-year reduction from placing the HCR ManorCare lease on cash basis beginning on January 1 of this year as discussed on our February earnings call. 
Looking at same property performance, our overall year-over-year same-store cash NOI grew at 4% in the second quarter. Excluding HCR ManorCare and the other 28 assets included in the spin to QCP, HCP RemainCo generated solid year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth of 4.4% for the quarter, led by strong leasing momentum in life science, which grew at 8.6%, driven by the burnoff of abatements, contractual rent steps and lease-up activities, bringing occupancy to a new all-time high of 98.7%, and strong RIDEA growth of 5.6% in the quarter, which Justin will cover momentarily.
Moving on to dispositions and RIDEA 2 transaction. We are on track to complete $1.25 billion of dispositions in 2016 inclusive of the previously announced RIDEA 2 transaction, of which $350 million has closed and the remaining $900 million is committed and expected to close by year-end. As will be further discussed in a moment, proceeds will be used primarily to reduce leverage and recycle into other investments. 
Significant transactions include: $130 million from the sale of a portfolio of 5 skilled nursing and 2 assisted living facilities operated by Trilogy, which closed in June; $50 million from the monetization of 2 senior housing development loans during the quarter; $470 million of total proceeds to HCP from the pending RIDEA 2 joint venture transaction announced last quarter from selling a 40% stake in the venture for $110 million and raising $360 million of new third-party debt. Note that this has been revised from a previously disclosed estimate of $740 million due to our decision to reduce the size of the new third-party mortgage debt, allowing us to reduce leverage more quickly compared to our previous plan. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter. 
The majority of the remaining $600 million of dispositions represents previously announced transactions, including Phase 1 of the Genentech purchase option expected to close November and the sales of life science facility, a medical office building and nonstrategic HCR ManorCare assets.
Next, our balance sheet and financing plan. During the quarter, we prepaid $200 million of mortgage debt at 6.6%. Our financial leverage improved by 90 basis points from the prior quarter to 44.6% at the end of second quarter. And we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of immediate liquidity from our revolver plus unrestricted cash. 
Now I'll provide an update on our overall financing plan for HCP and QCP. Our current financing plan anticipates raising up to $3.8 billion of proceeds in aggregate from a combination of: first, $0.9 billion from dispositions and the RIDEA 2 transaction during the second half of the year as reflected in our guidance, which I just discussed; and second, $2.9 billion not included in our guidance from QCP financing to be distributed to HCP and additional asset sales.
The $3.8 billion of proceeds will be used as follows: first, the repayment of $3.3 billion of debt consisting of $2.4 billion of bonds and secured debt maturities at a 6.3% blended rate, representing substantially all scheduled debt maturities to the end of 2018; plus $0.9 billion currently outstanding under our revolver; and the remaining proceeds of $0.5 billion will be used to finance pending acquisitions during the second half of 2016 totaling $0.2 billion, with the remainder used for spin transaction costs, debt prepayment costs and committed development funding. 
Our updated financing plan improves HCP RemainCo's balance sheet relative to our target communicated last quarter. Our target net debt-to-EBITDA is expected to improve from 6.6x to 6.25x and our target financial leverage to improve from 45.5% to 43.5%.
Finally, our 2016 guidance. Full year 2016 guidance updated today represents our performance expectations for the entire HCP portfolio and does not reflect the spin transaction. It does reflect the impact of the $1.25 billion of dispositions inclusive of RIDEA 2 that I just discussed, our announced investment activities and contractual rent from HCR ManorCare inclusive of the 3% rent escalator that took effect on April 1. 
With that said, HCP's portfolio continues to perform well, and we expect our full year 2016 NAREIT FFO to range from $2.72 to $2.78 per share, reflecting $0.08 per share of transaction costs, primarily for spin-related professional fees realized before completion, which are expensed as incurred, and $0.03 per share of previously announced severance-related charges in the third quarter.
Excluding the transaction cost and the severance-related charges, we are raising FFO as adjusted to $2.83 to $2.89 per share from the previous range of $2.77 to $2.83 per share, inclusive of the $0.03 per share gain I described earlier. 
We're also raising our FAD guidance to $2.68 to $2.74 per share from the previous range of $2.65 to $2.71 per share. We are reaffirming our overall same-store cash NOI year-over-year growth forecast of 1.5% to 2.5% and are projecting same-store growth for HCP RemainCo's portfolio, which primarily consists of private pay senior housing, life science and medical office assets, to increase between 2.3% and 3.3% when excluding the assets being spun off to QCP. 
While not reflected in our 2016 guidance, the incremental impact from the spin transaction will include transferring approximately $485 million of annual in-place rental income to QCP and prepaying HCP debt using cash proceeds raised by QCP and additional asset sales. Additional future spin transaction-related costs, including impacting EPS and NAREIT FFO, will be provided upon completion of the transaction. 
Now let me turn the call over to Justin."

In senior housing, as Tom mentioned, we had another quarter of strong growth in our 70-community same-store RIDEA portfolio of 5.6%, bringing our year-to-date growth to 7.5%, driven by occupancy improvement of 150 basis points in the quarter, which was 170 basis points above the overall industry. 
We were also able to achieve strong rate growth of 3.5%, again ahead of the industry average. The benefits of our revenue-enhancing capital investments are beginning to take shape, and we feel there is further room to grow in our markets. Our portfolio is positioned in markets with high senior population growth and has shown resilience to the threats of new supply. 
Fewer than 15% of our communities have been impacted by recent openings since the start of 2015. Occupancy in our top 5 markets improved 100 basis points in the second quarter from prior year to 91% while growth for the remaining portfolio was even stronger. Our diverse portfolio by geography and care mix allows us to mitigate the concentration risk of new supply and labor challenges.
Although our communities located in our top markets enjoyed NOI growth comparable to our peers, our communities located outside the primary markets enjoyed same-store NOI growth of 13% over the prior year. We firmly believe that quality returns are determined by local market fundamentals and the execution of the operations. 
As Mike mentioned, we value our Brookdale relationship. We are diversified within Brookdale across independent living, assisted living, memory care and continuing care retirement communities in a variety of structures, including triple-net leases and RIDEA joint ventures, and we are encouraged by the direction of the company. 
However, we're mindful of the Brookdale concentration post-spin and remain focused on the performance management of their communities through the team's efforts. We are focused with Brookdale in finding mutually beneficial ways to address our concentration and improve the overall quality of the portfolio. 
On the MOB front, 82% of our properties are located on-campus, with 95% affiliated with over 200 health systems. One of the hallmark characteristics of our MOB platform is its consistent and predictable performance, evidenced by having 75% tenant retention rate year-to-date and 2.7% same-store growth outlook for the year at the midpoint. We are the largest owner and developer of life science real estate on the West Coast, concentrated in 2 of the top 3 markets in the country where fundamentals continue to be very favorable. 
We reported another all-time high occupancy and strong same-store outlook for the year at a midpoint of 7.4%. The Cove development in South San Francisco continues to progress well. The Phase 1 buildings are substantially complete and steel is up on the second phase buildings. We are excited to welcome our first tenant, Denali Therapeutics, moving in this weekend [ph] Our -- we are on schedule for CytomX Therapeutics to take occupancy in early October. Demand continues to be strong and we look forward to providing further updates in the near future.
Now I'll cover the HCR ManorCare performance update. For the second quarter of 2016, HCR ManorCare reported normalized EBITDAR of $132 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $263 million. HCR ManorCare's normalized fixed charge coverage ratio for the trailing 12 months was 1.03x, down 3 basis points from Q1, driven by continued industry headwinds, a weaker flu season and a 3% rent increase effective in April. Note that fixed charge coverage was also burdened by $9 million of EBITDAR losses from the 33 announced strategic assets that have sold to date. 
Upon excluding these EBITDAR losses and the rent associated with the assets, the trailing 12-month normalized fixed charge coverage would have been 1.07x. As a reminder, there are 17 additional assets that are planned to be sold by early 2017. HCR ManorCare ended the quarter with $174 million of cash and cash equivalents.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

As Mike mentioned, we are progressing in every area necessary to launch the spin of our new company, Quality Care Properties or QCP. We have a highly experienced management team, with as our President and Chief Investment Officer and Mark",544,"Thank you, Mike. As Mike mentioned, we are progressing in every area necessary to launch the spin of our new company, Quality Care Properties or QCP. We have a highly experienced management team, with as our President and Chief Investment Officer and Mark Richards as our Chief Financial Officer. 
I worked closely with Greg and Mark for the past decade at several companies, most applicably, the turnaround of Sunrise Senior Living where we both owned and operated skilled nursing facilities and a major assisted living and memory care platform. We have a demonstrated track record of actively managing real estate and health care operations with a proven ability to work through challenging situations to reach an optimal outcome for our shareholders. We look forward to leading QCP. 
We have also made good progress on forming our Board of Directors. We will soon be announcing a highly-qualified board of 6 independent directors joining me, with experience across the health care, real estate investing, finance and legal sectors. 
As Mike mentioned, we are moving along toward arranging our debt financing which will be in place for the spin. And we will then be able to speak specifically to the debt cost and structure. QCP will emerge with an appropriate capital structure to support our business strategy. We will be a major player in a vital, irreplaceable and growing sector within health care.
At its inception, QCP will own a portfolio of 338 properties diversified across 30 states, primarily consisting of post-acute/skilled nursing and private pay senior housing facilities operated by HCR ManorCare. QCP's in-place rental income will be approximately $485 million, and we estimate our annual G&A run rate to be just over $20 million. Our near-term goal will be to manage actively our portfolio and relationship with HCR ManorCare in order to develop a comprehensive solution that will unlock the real estate value in the portfolio.
We have a wide variety of alternatives that we can pursue, and we will work with HCR ManorCare's management team to improve the portfolio's operating performance and lease coverage. 
The QCP dividend, of course, will be set by our independent board. I believe that given our high tenant concentration in one operator, with lease coverage that has declined in recent periods, it will be most important for QCP to build up near-term liquidity. Therefore, it's my expectation that we will most likely begin with a low to modest dividend. We will seek to maximize value for investors through total shareholder return. Of course, we'll have the option to grow into a higher dividend level over time at lease coverage stabilizes. 
I'll conclude by saying that I'm very pleased by the excellent collaboration among my team and the HCP board, management team and advisers to launch a first-class company, which will unlock value for HCP and future QCP shareholders. In my role as adviser to HCP, I've been able to see first-hand the company's careful determination to build its next chapter. Our time together has been a pleasure and we all look forward to the launch of QCP and to rolling up our sleeves to seek a comprehensive solution with HCR ManorCare.
We look forward to meeting with our investors and potential investors in the coming weeks and months. Mike?"

We think that ongoing discussions with Brookdale to call the portfolio can help the concentration and ultimately help the credit quality of the lease moving forward.

And again -- so that part doesn't change. What has changed is how we're financing the entity. So we have this partnership, along with another one, where we have partners that would like to receive some proceeds. And we don't prefer to receive proceeds at the HCP level because we're more geared toward wanting to bring our leverage down more rapidly and improve our net debt-to-EBITDA. So the way to accomplish that is to put in place a third-party debt for the partner's share of that financing. And then we provide debt at the same rate for our share, which gets eliminated in consolidation as if that debt doesn't even exist from our perspective. So our financial position remains unchanged. So we did -- we're doing that with a couple of our partnerships. We also have a GBP revolver outstanding for $450 million. We intend to prepay that because there's no prepayment penalties on that, and we can reduce our leverage fairly substantially. That's where we come up with those leverage numbers that I spoke to in the script of coming somewhere in the vicinity of 45.5% to 46% leverage post-spin, bring it down to 43.5% and from 6.6x net debt-to-EBITDA down to 6.25x net debt-to-EBITDA. It is that series of most. One last thing I'd add is in prepayment of that GBP debt, of course, we have to pay attention to the hedging that we have on our GBP investments. So we enter into a simple cross-currency swap against one of our unsecured notes so that we stay hedged. So that's how we're thinking about the revised financing plan."

It usually requires a fairly high cash on cash return in the front end, probably has an average life somewhere in the vicinity of 12 years, we're going to fine-tune this through our discussions. We're obviously going to want to underwrite to an IRR a certain number of basis points above our WAC to make sure that there's honesty and the projects that we approve, that there is a positive return to our investors and then have a view on the impact on the same-store portfolio growth, so that again, we've got a feel for what it does to the numbers.

We really start out more in the mid-3s as far as net debt-to-EBITDA based on current rents. And that 5.0x that you're referencing would be somebody in the streets looking at it and modifying or underwriting a rent at a 1.3x on the skilled and 1.1x on the assisted. That is not where we're at right now. So I would just start by saying it's more in that mid- to upper 3s as to where we stand on day 1 and -- but yet to be determined. As far as the different types of financing that could occur, we had looked at 3. I mean, we could enter into term loans, A and B notes, for instance CMBS, which really doesn't work that well and in skilled space, and of course, corporate bonds. We have explored all 3 with our bankers. I think the CMBS probably is not the route to go. It's good very well be a combination of term loans and corporate bonds. And we actually do have a path that we're looking at right now, but it would be premature for me to provide to our results on a because I like to see replays out over the next couple of weeks. As far as the rate of repayment of the debt, the 6.3% rate is what I said in my script. So is that accretive or dilutive? Well, let's put it this way. It comes at a -- what I would think a fairly modest prepayment penalty to clear out all of our debt or the vast majority of it for 2016, '17 and '18 at the HCP level. It's pretty high-level rate debt. And we have to see what that, that cost is at the QCP level to look at what it looks like across the combined enterprises, not that they won't totally trade separately but when you're just looking at the 2 together at period 0. So we'll see where that plays out. The other thing that I would mention is are probably wondering how did the high-yield market's look right now. The factors they look favorable. So I'll remind you, when you're comparing to other executions that are out there, that QCP is going to be a REIT, and it's backed by a full portfolio of real estate assets. There's been excellent activity over the last couple of weeks and before that. And that financing has been around LBOs acquisitions, opportunistic refinancings, et cetera so the transactions -- of these transactions have been very, very strong demand because investors are putting a lot of dollars to work. If you go back to the beginning of the year and you look at the single B index, and I'm not saying that's where we're at specifically, but investment grade at QCP. It is at 6. [ph] -- I think the number I got yesterday was about 6.7% versus 8.6% at the beginning of the year. So the markets have been quite favorable, and the indications that we get in our preliminary discussions are quite favorable as well."

We've had pretty good results where we face new supply to date. Occupancy typically comes under pressure. We've had an exception to that where we had an independent living portfolio that was concentrated in Houston, for instance, that performs quite well. What tends to happen is you'll have occupancy be impacted in the market, and therefore, in your community within that market but rate tends to hold. So we're still seeing EBITDAR growth and NOI growth in communities that are impacted by new supply to date. However, as we look forward and trying to predict performance, we're going to be conservative and anticipate some impact. On the wage front, we find it really interesting that our communities are located in the top 31 MSAs are actually more impacted by wage increases than our secondary markets. In fact, they're substantially more impacted so there's pressure there as well."

Joining me today is Justin Hutchens, our Chief Investment Officer; and John Lu, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Finance. And I'm pleased to welcome back Tom Herzog on his first earnings call since returning as our Chief Financial Officer.
We look forward to sharing with you our quarterly results and updates on several significant initiatives. But before diving into the details, I want to step back for several minutes and give you some additional color on the rationale behind some major changes at the company. They have a purpose.
I will start by saying this is an exciting time at HCP. It's a renaissance of sorts. I've been referring recently to the stage we are entering into as HCP 3.0. I've been fortunate to be a witness to and a participant in each of the generational periods of HCP since its formation in 1985.
The first generation was represented by our friend and founding CEO, Ken Roath. Well known to many of you, Ken established our company as one of the first health care REITs and grew it significantly with a solid foundation and a stellar reputation.
Jay Flaherty is identified with our second generation. Over his decade of leadership, he repositioned the company to a significant extent by moving away from properties reliant on government reimbursement and into larger transactions that provided scale as privatization and consolidation swept through the industry.
Lessons learned, one large transaction that we all take responsibility for was our purchase of HCR ManorCare in 2011. At the time of the purchase, this leading skilled nursing post-acute company was widely acclaimed as best in class, but it was also heavily reliant on government reimbursement. All of you know that over the last 5 years, the skilled nursing post-acute space has been rocked by numerous sequential challenges. The cumulative impact has been strongly felt across the sector.
When these issues came more into focus, we asked Lauralee Martin to take the helm and bridge us to the next generation. We knew we were giving her a tough hand to play, but none of us were able to predict how difficult the last few years would be as this space continued to be jolted by one decision or another imposed on it primarily by the payer shift toward Medicare Advantage and the net effect of sequestration cuts.
In the last few months, the board and I evaluated where we were and what the future could look like. In addition to the spin and the other initiatives in play, we determined that the best course was to move HCP 3.0 forward by starting to put the face on the team that would take the company forward into the next generation of evolution and growth.
With the initiatives we have announced and some we will announce shortly, all of us are confident and excited about our prospects for near- and longer-term performance and growth. I want to express my heartfelt appreciation for the effort and contribution that Lauralee gave us, getting us to the point that we can now launch this next stage.
Let me also report that the team that will take us forward is coming together very well. There is some blending of new folks and encore appearance and those that have been around for many years. They are working marvelously together, and I am confident that you will see tangible positive results soon from the groundwork that is underway.
In assembling this team, there is a method to our madness. It's been noted by many of you that we've added some key executives like Justin Hutchens and Kai Hsiao with strong reputations as leaders and operators of large health care companies. And we've added other new team members who aren't as publicly visible with similar backgrounds.
Our long-tenured executives, Tom Klaritch and John Bergschneider, who run our medical office and life science platforms, are as well regarded as anyone in their respective roles. And with Tom Herzog returning to our team, we have someone widely regarded for his conservative yet progressive thinking around balance sheet, cost of capital management and strategic capital allocation. We'll stack this talented team up against any in the industry.
Now looking ahead, one of the biggest questions we face like many REITs is how do you plan to grow going forward. Well, our assessment is that there is plenty of room to grow, but it will be a different strategic path than in recent -- in the recent past. Much of the growth in the future will come through affiliations with provider networks and picking experienced operators and partnering with them for growth.
The good news is that the health care real estate market remains large and in many areas, highly fragmented. HCP is being shaped to be the capital partner of choice because we understand the needs of the operator and we know how operations either succeed or fail. We believe that our ability to attract and underwrite potential investments will benefit from the internal resources assembled, and we believe we will quickly become a trusted partner to selected new operators and emerging provider networks because we talk their language and have an appreciation of their needs.
We understand business needs because we have run businesses and we have walked in our tenants' shoes. So when we talk about a new generation, HCP 3.0, we are talking not just about change but strategic change to meet the market where it is and where it's going.
With that said, there are some key overhangs that we are aggressively addressing to position us for growth. First, we are obviously addressing the issues related to HCR ManorCare with the spin transaction. Second, although we have a high degree of confidence in Brookdale Senior Living, we recognize reducing our portfolio concentration in Brookdale is a high priority.
Third, we have somewhat elevated leverage as compared to our peers and historical averages. We are prepared to improve our balance sheet metrics progressively over the next 2 to 3 years. Fourth, as you continue to get to know our next generation of leaders, we believe that you will quickly gain confidence in our ability to execute and to grow prudently. And finally, as part of sustained credibility, we will be a leader in transparency, predictability and clarity to the fullest extent possible.
Let me acknowledge upfront that this earnings call has some inherent limitations because some of what we are doing is still in progress, and detailed information in some areas is restricted by the fact that we are in registration with the SEC for our spin transaction and we are not yet effective. We will do the best we can to be responsive to your questions, but we really look forward to getting through the next several months when all of the things we are doing will become much clearer when the comprehensive plan we are implementing can be shared with you fully.
Today, we will cover details of our second quarter results and portfolio performance, and we'll give you an update on our spinoff of HCR ManorCare, which is well underway and expected to be completed early in the fourth quarter.
I'm happy to report that we now have a name for the new spin company. We call it Quality Care Properties or QCP. I'm also happy to report that the remaining 75% of our portfolio, which is predominantly private pay, is performing at or above plan and will anchor HCP's organic growth following the spin.
Let me now turn things over to Tom Herzog, who will focus on our quarterly results and financial performance."
277966,372625672,1031633,"HCP, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Today, I will cover several topics: first, our second quarter results; second, an update on our dispositions and RIDEA 2 transaction; third, our balance sheet and financing plan; and finally, our updated 2016 guidance.I'll start with ou",1084,"Thank you, Mike. Today, I will cover several topics: first, our second quarter results; second, an update on our dispositions and RIDEA 2 transaction; third, our balance sheet and financing plan; and finally, our updated 2016 guidance.
I'll start with our results. During the second quarter, we reported NAREIT FFO of $0.71 per share, which included a negative $0.03 per share of transaction-related costs, substantially all of which were spin related. Excluding these costs, we recorded FFO as adjusted of $0.74 per share and FAD of $0.72 per share.
Also impacting the quarter were gains of $0.03 per share that resulted from monetizing our share in the appreciation of 2 participating development loans in our senior housing segment. Note that there was a similar gain of $0.02 per share in the prior year period.
Both NAREIT FFO and FFO as adjusted for the quarter reflect an $0.08 per share year-over-year reduction from placing the HCR ManorCare lease on cash basis beginning on January 1 of this year, as discussed on our February earnings call.
Looking at same property performance, our overall year-over-year same-store cash NOI grew at 4% in the second quarter. Excluding HCR ManorCare and the other 28 assets included in the spin to QCP, HCP RemainCo generated solid year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth of 4.4% for the quarter, led by strong leasing momentum in life science, which grew at 8.6%, driven by the burnoff of rent abatements, contractual rent steps and lease-up activities, bringing occupancy to a new all-time high of 98.7%, and strong RIDEA growth of 5.6% in the quarter, which Justin will cover momentarily.
Moving on to dispositions and RIDEA 2 transaction. We are on track to complete $1.25 billion of dispositions in 2016, inclusive of the previously announced RIDEA 2 transaction, of which $350 million has closed and the remaining $900 million is committed and expected to close by year-end. As will be further discussed in a moment, proceeds will be used primarily to reduce leverage and recycle into other investments.
Significant transactions include: $130 million from the sale of a portfolio of 5 skilled nursing and 2 assisted living facilities operated by Trilogy, which closed in June; $50 million from the monetization of 2 senior housing development loans during the quarter; $470 million of total proceeds to HCP from the pending RIDEA 2 joint venture transaction announced last quarter from selling a 40% stake in the venture for $110 million and raising $360 million of new third-party debt.
Note that this has been revised from a previously disclosed estimate of $740 million due to our decision to reduce the size of the new third-party mortgage debt, allowing us to reduce leverage more quickly compared to our previous plan. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter. The majority of the remaining $600 million of dispositions represents previously announced transactions, including Phase 1 of the Genentech purchase option expected to close November and the sales of a life science facility, a medical office building and nonstrategic HCR ManorCare assets.
Next, our balance sheet and financing plan. During the quarter, we prepaid $200 million of mortgage debt at 6.6%. Our financial leverage improved by 90 basis points from the prior quarter to 44.6% at the end of second quarter. And we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of immediate liquidity from our revolver plus unrestricted cash.
Now I'll provide an update on our overall financing plan for HCP and QCP. Our current financing plan anticipates raising up to $3.8 billion of proceeds in aggregate from a combination of: first, $0.9 billion from dispositions and the RIDEA 2 transaction during the second half of the year as reflected in our guidance, which I just discussed; and second, $2.9 billion not included in our guidance from QCP financing to be distributed to HCP and additional asset sales.
The $3.8 billion of proceeds will be used as follows: first, the repayment of $3.3 billion of debt consisting of $2.4 billion of bonds and secured debt maturities at a 6.3% blended rate, representing substantially all scheduled debt maturities through the end of 2018 plus $0.9 billion currently outstanding under our revolver; and the remaining proceeds of $0.5 billion will be used to finance pending acquisitions during the second half of 2016 totaling $0.2 billion, with the remainder used for spin transaction costs, debt prepayment costs and committed development fundings.
Our updated financing plan improves HCP RemainCo's balance sheet relative to our targets communicated last quarter. Our target net debt to EBITDA is expected to improve from 6.6x to 6.25x and our target financial leverage to improve from 45.5% to 43.5%.
Finally, our 2016 guidance. Full year 2016 guidance updated today represents our performance expectations for the entire HCP portfolio and does not reflect the spin transaction. It does reflect the impact of the $1.25 billion of dispositions inclusive of RIDEA 2 that I just discussed, our announced investment activities and contractual rent from HCR ManorCare, inclusive of the 3% rent escalator that took effect on April 1.
With that said, HCP's portfolio continues to perform well, and we expect our full year 2016 NAREIT FFO to range from $2.72 to $2.78 per share, reflecting $0.08 per share of transaction costs, primarily for spin-related professional fees realized before completion, which are expensed as incurred, and $0.03 per share of previously announced severance-related charges in the third quarter.
Excluding the transaction costs and the severance-related charges, we are raising FFO as adjusted to $2.83 to $2.89 per share from the previous range of $2.77 to $2.83 per share, inclusive of the $0.03 per share gain I described earlier.
We're also raising our FAD guidance to $2.68 to $2.74 per share from the previous range of $2.65 to $2.71 per share. We are reaffirming our overall same-store cash NOI year-over-year growth forecast of 1.5% to 2.5% and are projecting same-store growth for HCP RemainCo's portfolio, which primarily consists of private pay senior housing, life science and medical office assets, to increase between 2.3% and 3.3% when excluding the assets being spun off to QCP.
While not reflected in our 2016 guidance, the incremental impact from the spin transaction will include transferring approximately $485 million of annual in-place rental income to QCP and prepaying HCP debt using cash proceeds raised by QCP and additional asset sales. Additional future spin transaction-related costs, including the impact in EPS and NAREIT FFO, will be provided upon completion of the transaction.
Now let me turn the call over to Justin."

We had a relatively quiet quarter, announcing $111 million of investments in the life science segment, bringing our year-to-date total investments to $475 million, substantially all in private pay sectors. But more importantly, let me highlight the performance of the remaining 75% of our portfolio that will anchor HCP's future organic growth and why we believe this portfolio stands up among the best in the industry.
HCP post spin will have 95% of our income derived from private pay sources across senior housing, life science and medical properties. In senior housing, as Tom mentioned, we had another quarter of strong growth in our 70-community same-store RIDEA portfolio of 5.6%, bringing our year-to-date growth to 7.5%, driven by occupancy improvement of 150 basis points in the quarter, which was 170 basis points above the overall industry.
We were also able to achieve strong rate growth of 3.5%, again ahead of the industry average. The benefits of our revenue-enhancing capital investments are beginning to take shape, and we feel there is further room to grow in our markets. Our portfolio is positioned in markets with high senior population growth and has shown resilience to the threats of new supply.
Fewer than 15% of our communities have been impacted by recent openings since the start of 2015. Occupancy in our top 5 markets improved 100 basis points in the second quarter from prior year to 91% while growth for the remaining portfolio was even stronger. Our diverse portfolio by geography and care mix allows us to mitigate the concentration risk of new supply and labor challenges.
Although our communities located in our top markets enjoyed NOI growth comparable to our peers, our communities located outside the primary markets enjoyed same-store NOI growth of 13% over the prior year. We firmly believe that quality returns are determined by local market fundamentals and the execution of the operations.
As Mike mentioned, we value our Brookdale relationship. We are diversified within Brookdale across independent living, assisted living, memory care and continuing care retirement communities in a variety of structures, including triple-net leases and RIDEA joint ventures, and we are encouraged by the direction of the company.
However, we are mindful of the Brookdale concentration post spin and remain focused on the performance management of their communities through the team's efforts. We are focused with Brookdale in finding mutually beneficial ways to address our concentration and improve the overall quality of the portfolio.
On the MOB front, 82% of our properties are located on campus, with 95% affiliated with over 200 health systems. One of the hallmark characteristics of our MOB platform is its consistent and predictable performance, evidenced by having 75% tenant retention rate year-to-date and 2.7% same-store growth outlook for the year at the midpoint. We are the largest owner and developer of life science real estate on the West Coast, concentrated in 2 of the top 3 markets in the country where fundamentals continue to be very favorable.
We reported another all-time high occupancy and strong same-store outlook for the year at a midpoint of 7.4%. The Cove development in South San Francisco continues to progress well. The Phase 1 buildings are substantially complete and steel is up on the second phase buildings. We are excited to welcome our first tenant, Denali Therapeutics, moving in this week and are -- we are on schedule for CytomX Therapeutics to take occupancy in early October. Demand continues to be strong, and we look forward to providing further updates in the near future.
Now I'll cover the HCR ManorCare performance update. For the second quarter of 2016, HCR ManorCare reported normalized EBITDAR of $132 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $263 million. HCR ManorCare's normalized fixed charge coverage ratio for the trailing 12 months was 1.03x, down 3 basis points from Q1, driven by continued industry headwinds, a weaker flu season and a 3% rent increase effective in April. Note that fixed charge coverage was also burdened by $9 million of EBITDAR losses from the 33 announced strategic assets that have sold to date.
Upon excluding these EBITDAR losses and the rent associated with the assets, the trailing 12-month normalized fixed charge coverage would have been 1.07x. As a reminder, there are 17 additional assets that are planned to be sold by early 2017. HCR ManorCare ended the quarter with $174 million of cash and cash equivalents.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

As Mike mentioned, we are progressing in every area necessary to launch the spin of our new company, Quality Care Properties or QCP. We have a highly experienced management team, with Greg Neeb as our President and Chief Investment Office",545,"Thank you, Mike. As Mike mentioned, we are progressing in every area necessary to launch the spin of our new company, Quality Care Properties or QCP. We have a highly experienced management team, with Greg Neeb as our President and Chief Investment Officer and Marc Richards as our Chief Financial Officer.
I worked closely with Greg and Mark for the past decade at several companies, most applicably, the turnaround of Sunrise Senior Living where we both owned and operated skilled nursing facilities and a major assisted living and memory care platform. We have a demonstrated track record of actively managing real estate and health care operations with a proven ability to work through challenging situations to reach an optimal outcome for our shareholders. We look forward to leading QCP.
We have also made good progress on forming our Board of Directors. We will soon be announcing a highly-qualified board of 6 independent directors joining me, with experience across the health care, real estate, investing, finance and legal sectors.
As Mike mentioned, we are moving along toward arranging our debt financing, which will be in place for the spin, and we will then be able to speak specifically to the debt cost and structure. QCP will emerge with an appropriate capital structure to support our business strategy. We will be a major player in a vital, irreplaceable and growing sector within health care.
At its inception, QCP will own a portfolio of 338 properties diversified across 30 states, primarily consisting of post-acute/skilled nursing and private pay senior housing facilities operated by HCR ManorCare. QCP's in-place rental income will be approximately $485 million, and we estimate our annual G&A run rate to be just over $20 million. Our near-term goal will be to manage actively our portfolio and relationship with HCR ManorCare in order to develop a comprehensive solution that will unlock the real estate value in the portfolio. We have a wide variety of alternatives that we can pursue, and we will work with HCR ManorCare's management team to improve the portfolio's operating performance and lease coverage.
The QCP dividend, of course, will be set by our independent board. I believe that given our high tenant concentration in one operator with lease coverage that has declined in recent periods, it'll be most important for QCP to build up near-term liquidity. Therefore, it's my expectation that we will most likely begin with a low to modest dividend. We will seek to maximize value for investors through total shareholder return. Of course, we'll have the option to grow into a higher dividend level over time as lease coverage stabilizes.
I'll conclude by saying that I'm very pleased by the excellent collaboration among my team and the HCP board, management team and advisers to launch a first-class company which will unlock value for HCP and future QCP shareholders. In my role as adviser to HCP, I've been able to see firsthand the company's careful determination to build its next chapter. Our time together has been a pleasure, and we all look forward to the launch of QCP and to rolling up our sleeves to seek a comprehensive solution with HCR ManorCare.
We look forward to meeting with our investors and potential investors in the coming weeks and months. Mike?"

We think that ongoing discussions with Brookdale to call the portfolio can help the concentration and ultimately help the credit quality of the lease moving forward.

So what we're looking at, as Justin indicated, regardless of how we finance it, we still have our same share in the real estate in that joint venture and it's at a 6.5% trailing cap rate. And again -- so that part doesn't change. What has changed is how we're financing the entity. So we have this partnership, along with another one, where we have partners that would like to receive some proceeds. And we don't prefer to receive proceeds at the HCP level because we're more geared toward wanting to bring our leverage down more rapidly and improve our net debt to EBITDA. So the way to accomplish that is to put in place a third-party debt for the partner's share of that financing. And then we provide debt at the same rate for our share, which gets eliminated in consolidation as if that debt doesn't even exist from our perspective. So our financial position remains unchanged. So we did -- we're doing that with a couple of our partnerships. We also have a GBP revolver outstanding for $450 million. We intend to prepay that because there's no prepayment penalties on that, and we can reduce our leverage fairly substantially. That's where we come up with those leverage numbers that I spoke to in the script of coming somewhere in the vicinity of 45.5% to 46% leverage post spin, bringing it down to 43.5%, and from 6.6x net debt-to-EBITDA down to 6.25x net debt to EBITDA. It is that series of moves. One other thing I'd add is in prepayment of that GBP debt, of course, we have to pay attention to the hedging that we have on our GBP investments. So we'd enter into a simple cross-currency swap against one of our unsecured notes so that we stay hedged. So that's how we're thinking about the revised financing plan."

Seasonally, Q4 is generally strong, although that's not always the case. So as we look at that and incorporated feedback from the company, we point to the lower end of that range at this point in time and a corresponding fixed charge cover, be it 1.07 and 1.10. If you take out the impact that was picked up from the asset sales or the drag from the asset sales, you're about at 1.04. Another way to look at it though is that we have more asset sales to go. There's about $65 million more in sales coming. $10 million are under contract; total proceeds, we estimate to be around $54 million; and then we have another $7 million now to pick up [ph] the remaining amount.

It usually requires a fairly high cash on cash return in the front end, probably has an average life somewhere in the vicinity of 12 years, we're going to fine-tune this through our discussions. We're obviously going to want to underwrite to an IRR a certain number of basis points above our WAC to make sure that there's honesty in the projects that we approve, that there is a positive return to our investors and then have a view on the impact on the same-store portfolio growth, so that again, we've got a feel for what it does to the numbers.

We really start out more in the mid-3s as far as net debt to EBITDA based on current rents. And that 5.0x that you're referencing would be somebody in the Street looking at it and modifying or underwriting a rent at a 1.3x on the skilled and 1.1x on the assisted. That is not where we're at right now. So I would just start by saying it's more in that mid to upper 3s as to where we'd stand on day 1 and -- but yet to be determined. As far as the different types of financing that could occur, we had looked at 3. I mean, we could enter into term loans, A and B notes, for instance, CMBS which really doesn't work that well in skilled space and of course, then there's corporate bonds. We have explored all 3 with our bankers. I think the CMBS probably is not the route to go. It could very well be a combination of term loans and corporate bonds. And we actually do have a path that we're looking at right now, but it would be premature for me to provide you our thoughts on because I'd like to see where it plays out over the next couple of weeks. As far as the rate of repayment of the debt, the 6.3% rate is what I said in my script. So is that accretive or dilutive? Well, let's put it this way. It comes at a -- what I would think a fairly modest prepayment penalty to clear out all of our debt or the vast majority of it for 2016, '17 and '18 at the HCP level. It's pretty high-level rate debt. And then we have to see what that debt cost is at the QCP level to look at what it looks like across the combined enterprises, not that they won't totally trade separately, but when you're just looking at the 2 together at period 0. So we'll see where that plays out. The other thing that I would mention is you're probably wondering how do the high-yield markets look right now. The fact is they look favorable. So I'll remind you, when you're comparing to other executions that are out there, that QCP is going to be a REIT, and it's backed by a full portfolio of real estate assets. There's been excellent activity over the last couple of weeks and before that. And that financing has been around LBOs, acquisitions, opportunistic refinancings, et cetera, so the transactions -- these transactions have been met with very, very strong demand because investors are putting a lot of dollars to work. If you go back to the beginning of the year and you look at the single B index, and I'm not saying that's where we're at specifically, but we'll be below investment grade at QCP, it's at 6 point [ph] -- I think the number I got yesterday was about 6.7% versus 8.6% at the beginning of the year. So the markets have been quite favorable, and the indications that we get in all preliminary discussions are quite favorable as well."

We've had pretty good results where we face new supply to date. Occupancy typically comes under pressure. We've had an exception to that where we had an independent living portfolio that was concentrated in Houston, for instance, that performs quite well. What tends to happen is you'll have occupancy be impacted in the market and therefore, in your community within that market, but rate tends to hold. So we're still seeing EBITDAR growth or NOI growth in communities that are impacted by new supply to date. However, as we look forward and trying to predict performance, we're going to be conservative and anticipate some impact. On the wage front, we find it really interesting that our communities that are located in the top 31 MSAs are actually more impacted by wage increases than our secondary markets. In fact, they're substantially more impacted, so there's pressure there as well."

Joining me today is Justin Hutchens, our Chief Investment Officer; and John Lu, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Finance. And I'm pleased to welcome back Tom Herzog on his first earnings call since returning as our Chief Financial Officer.
We look forward to sharing with you our quarterly results and updates on several significant initiatives. But before diving into the details, I want to step back for several minutes and give you some additional color on the rationale behind some major changes at the company. They have a purpose.
I will start by saying this is an exciting time at HCP. It's a renaissance of sorts. I've been referring recently to the stage we are entering into as HCP 3.0. I've been fortunate to be a witness to and a participant in each of the generational periods of HCP since its formation in 1985.
The first generation was represented by our friend and founding CEO, Ken Roath. Well known to many of you, Ken established our company as one of the first healthcare REITs and grew it significantly with a solid foundation and a stellar reputation.
Jay Flaherty is identified with our second generation. Over his decade of leadership, he repositioned the company to a significant extent by moving away from properties reliant on government reimbursement and into larger transactions that provided scale as privatization and consolidation swept through the industry.
Lessons learned, one large transaction that we all take responsibility for was our purchase of HCR ManorCare in 2011. At the time of the purchase, this leading skilled nursing post-acute company was widely acclaimed as best in class, but it was also heavily reliant on government reimbursement. All of you know that over the last 5 years, the skilled nursing post-acute space has been rocked by numerous sequential challenges. The cumulative impact has been strongly felt across the sector.
When these issues came more into focus, we asked Lauralee Martin to take the helm and bridge us to the next generation. We knew we were giving her a tough hand to play, but none of us were able to predict how difficult the last few years would be as this space continued to be jolted by one decision or another imposed on it primarily by the payer shift toward Medicare Advantage and the net effect of sequestration cuts.
In the last few months, the board and I evaluated where we were and what the future could look like. In addition to the spin and the other initiatives in play, we determined that the best course was to move HCP 3.0 forward by starting to put the face on the team that would take the company forward into the next generation of evolution and growth.
With the initiatives we have announced and some we will announce shortly, all of us are confident and excited about our prospects for near- and longer-term performance and growth. I want to express my heartfelt appreciation for the effort and contribution that Lauralee gave us, getting us to the point that we can now launch this next stage.
Let me also report that the team that will take us forward is coming together very well. There is some blending of new folks in encore appearance and those that have been around for many years. They are working marvelously together, and I am confident that you will see tangible positive results soon from the groundwork that is underway.
In assembling this team, there is a method to our madness. It's been noted by many of you that we've added some key executives like Justin Hutchens and Kai Hsiao with strong reputations as leaders and operators of large healthcare companies. And we've added other new team members, who aren't as publicly visible with similar backgrounds.
Our long-tenured executives, Tom Klaritch and John Bergschneider, who run our medical office and life science platforms, are as well regarded as anyone in their respective roles. And with Tom Herzog returning to our team, we have someone widely regarded for his conservative yet progressive thinking around balance sheet, cost of capital management and strategic capital allocation. We'll stack this talented team up against any in the industry.
Now, looking ahead, one of the biggest questions we face like many REITs is how do you plan to grow going forward. Well, our assessment is that there is plenty of room to grow, but it will be a different strategic path than in recent -- in the recent past. Much of the growth in the future will come through affiliations with provider networks and picking experienced operators and partnering with them for growth.
The good news is that the healthcare real estate market remains large and in many areas, highly fragmented. HCP is being shaped to be the capital partner of choice because we understand the needs of the operator and we know how operations either succeed or fail. We believe that our ability to attract and underwrite potential investments will benefit from the internal resources assembled, and we believe we will quickly become a trusted partner to selected new operators and emerging provider networks because we talk their language and have an appreciation of their needs.
We understand business needs because we have run businesses and we have walked in our tenants' shoes. So when we talk about a new generation, HCP 3.0, we are talking not just about change but strategic change to meet the market where it is and where it's going.
With that said, there are some key overhangs that we are aggressively addressing to position us for growth. First, we are obviously addressing the issues related to HCR ManorCare with the spin transaction. Second, although we have a high degree of confidence in Brookdale Senior Living, we recognize reducing our portfolio concentration in Brookdale is a high priority.
Third, we have somewhat elevated leverage as compared to our peers and historical averages. We are prepared to improve our balance sheet metrics progressively over the next 2 to 3 years. Fourth, as you continue to get to know our next generation of leaders, we believe that you will quickly gain confidence in our ability to execute and to grow prudently. And finally, as part of sustained credibility, we will be a leader in transparency, predictability and clarity to the fullest extent possible.
Let me acknowledge upfront that this earnings call has some inherent limitations because some of what we are doing is still in progress, and detailed information in some areas is restricted by the fact that we are in registration with the SEC for our spin transaction and we are not yet effective. We will do the best we can to be responsive to your questions, but we really look forward to getting through the next several months when all of the things we are doing will become much clearer when the comprehensive plan we are implementing can be shared with you fully.
Today, we will cover details of our second quarter results and portfolio performance, and we'll give you an update on our spinoff of HCR ManorCare, which is well underway and expected to be completed early in the fourth quarter.
I'm happy to report that we now have a name for the new spin company. We call it Quality Care Properties or QCP. I'm also happy to report that the remaining 75% of our portfolio, which is predominantly private pay, is performing at or above plan and will anchor HCP's organic growth following the spin.
Let me now turn things over to Tom Herzog, who will focus on our quarterly results and financial performance."
277966,372625672,1032060,"HCP, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Today, I will cover several topics: first, our second quarter results; second, an update on our dispositions and RIDEA II transaction; third, our balance sheet and financing plan; and finally, our updated 2016 guidance.I'll start with o",1083,"Thank you, Mike. Today, I will cover several topics: first, our second quarter results; second, an update on our dispositions and RIDEA II transaction; third, our balance sheet and financing plan; and finally, our updated 2016 guidance.
I'll start with our results. During the second quarter, we reported NAREIT FFO of $0.71 per share, which included a negative $0.03 per share of transaction-related costs, substantially all of which were spin related. Excluding these costs, we recorded FFO as adjusted of $0.74 per share and FAD of $0.72 per share.
Also impacting the quarter were gains of $0.03 per share that resulted from monetizing our share in the appreciation of 2 participating development loans in our senior housing segment. Note that there was a similar gain of $0.02 per share in the prior year period.
Both NAREIT FFO and FFO as adjusted for the quarter reflect an $0.08 per share year-over-year reduction from placing the HCR ManorCare lease on cash basis beginning on January 1 of this year, as discussed on our February earnings call.
Looking at same property performance, our overall year-over-year same-store cash NOI grew at 4% in the second quarter. Excluding HCR ManorCare and the other 28 assets included in the spin to QCP, HCP RemainCo generated solid year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth of 4.4% for the quarter, led by strong leasing momentum in life science, which grew at 8.6%, driven by the burn-off of rent abatements, contractual rent steps and lease-up activities, bringing occupancy to a new all-time high of 98.7%, and strong RIDEA growth of 5.6% in the quarter, which Justin will cover momentarily.
Moving on to dispositions and RIDEA II transaction. We are on track to complete $1.25 billion of dispositions in 2016, inclusive of the previously announced RIDEA II transaction, of which $350 million has closed and the remaining $900 million is committed and expected to close by year-end. As will be further discussed in a moment, proceeds will be used primarily to reduce leverage and recycle into other investments.
Significant transactions include: $130 million from the sale of a portfolio of 5 skilled nursing and 2 assisted living facilities operated by Trilogy, which closed in June; $50 million from the monetization of 2 senior housing development loans during the quarter; $470 million of total proceeds to HCP from the pending RIDEA II joint venture transaction announced last quarter from selling a 40% stake in the venture for $110 million and raising $360 million of new third-party debt.
Note that this has been revised from a previously disclosed estimate of $740 million due to our decision to reduce the size of the new third-party mortgage debt, allowing us to reduce leverage more quickly compared to our previous plan. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter. The majority of the remaining $600 million of dispositions represents previously announced transactions, including Phase I of the Genentech purchase option expected to close November and the sales of a life science facility, a medical office building and nonstrategic HCR ManorCare assets.
Next, our balance sheet and financing plan. During the quarter, we prepaid $200 millionof mortgage debt at 6.6%. Our financial leverage improved by 90 basis points from the prior quarter to 44.6% at the end of second quarter. And we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of immediate liquidity from our revolver plus unrestricted cash.
Now, I'll provide an update on our overall financing plan for HCP and QCP. Our current financing plan anticipates raising up to $3.8 billion of proceeds in aggregate from a combination of: first, $0.9 billion from dispositions and the RIDEA II transaction during the second half of the year as reflected in our guidance, which I just discussed; and second, $2.9 billion not included in our guidance from QCP financing to be distributed to HCP and additional asset sales.
The $3.8 billion of proceeds will be used as follows: first, the repayment of $3.3 billion of debt consisting of $2.4 billion of bonds and secured debt maturities at a 6.3% blended rate, representing substantially all scheduled debt maturities through the end of 2018, plus $0.9 billion currently outstanding under our revolver; and the remaining proceeds of $0.5 billion will be used to finance pending acquisitions during the second half of 2016 totaling $0.2 billion, with the remainder used for spin transaction costs, debt prepayment costs and committed development fundings.
Our updated financing plan improves HCP RemainCo's balance sheet relative to our targets communicated last quarter. Our target net debt to EBITDA is expected to improve from 6.6x to 6.25x, and our target financial leverage to improve from 45.5% to 43.5%.
Finally, our 2016 guidance. Full year 2016 guidance updated today represents our performance expectations for the entire HCP portfolio and does not reflect the spin transaction. It does reflect the impact of the $1.25 billion of dispositions inclusive of RIDEA II that I just discussed, our announced investment activities and contractual rent from HCR ManorCare, inclusive of the 3% rent escalator that took effect on April 1.
With that said, HCP's portfolio continues to perform well, and we expect our full year 2016 NAREIT FFO to range from $2.72 to $2.78 per share, reflecting $0.08 per share of transaction costs, primarily for spin-related professional fees realized before completion, which are expensed as incurred, and $0.03 per share of previously announced severance-related charges in the third quarter.
Excluding the transaction costs and the severance-related charges, we are raising FFO as adjusted to $2.83 to $2.89 per share from the previous range of $2.77 to $2.83 per share, inclusive of the $0.03 per share gain I described earlier.
We're also raising our FAD guidance to $2.68 to $2.74 per share from the previous range of $2.65 to $2.71 per share. We are reaffirming our overall same-store cash NOI year-over-year growth forecast of 1.5% to 2.5% and are projecting same-store growth for HCP RemainCo's portfolio, which primarily consists of private pay senior housing, life science and medical office assets, to increase between 2.3% and 3.3% when excluding the assets being spun off to QCP.
While not reflected in our 2016 guidance, the incremental impact from the spin transaction will include transferring approximately $485 million of annual in-place rental income to QCP and prepaying HCP debt using cash proceeds raised by QCP and additional asset sales. Additional future spin transaction-related costs, including the impact in EPS and NAREIT FFO, will be provided upon completion of the transaction.
Now let me turn the call over to Justin."

In senior housing, as Tom mentioned, we had another quarter of strong growth in our 70-community same-store RIDEA portfolio of 5.6%, bringing our year-to-date growth to 7.5%, driven by occupancy improvement of 150 basis points in the quarter, which was 170 basis points above the overall industry.
We were also able to achieve strong rate growth of 3.5%, again ahead of the industry average. The benefits of our revenue-enhancing capital investments are beginning to take shape, and we feel there is further room to grow in our markets. Our portfolio is positioned in markets with high senior population growth and has shown resilience to the threats of new supply.
Fewer than 15% of our communities have been impacted by recent openings since the start of 2015. Occupancy in our top 5 markets improved 100 basis points in the second quarter from prior year to 91% while growth for the remaining portfolio was even stronger. Our diverse portfolio by geography and care mix allows us to mitigate the concentration risk of new supply and labor challenges.
Although our communities located in our top markets enjoyed NOI growth comparable to our peers, our communities located outside the primary markets enjoyed same-store NOI growth of 13% over the prior year. We firmly believe that quality returns are determined by local market fundamentals and the execution of the operations.
As Mike mentioned, we value our Brookdale relationship. We are diversified within Brookdale across independent living, assisted living, memory care and continuing care retirement communities in a variety of structures, including triple-net leases and RIDEA joint ventures, and we are encouraged by the direction of the company.
However, we are mindful of the Brookdale concentration post spin and remain focused on the performance management of their communities through the team's efforts. We are focused with Brookdale in finding mutually beneficial ways to address our concentration and improve the overall quality of the portfolio.
On the MOB front, 82% of our properties are located on campus, with 95% affiliated with over 200 health systems. One of the hallmark characteristics of our MOB platform is its consistent and predictable performance, evidenced by having 75% tenant retention rate year-to-date and 2.7% same-store growth outlook for the year at the midpoint. We are the largest owner and developer of life science real estate on the West Coast, concentrated in 2 of the top 3 markets in the country where fundamentals continue to be very favorable.
We reported another all-time high occupancy and strong same-store outlook for the year at a midpoint of 7.4%. The Cove development in South San Francisco continues to progress well. The Phase I buildings are substantially complete and steel is up on the second phase buildings. We are excited to welcome our first tenant, Denali Therapeutics, moving in this week and are -- we are on schedule for CytomX Therapeutics to take occupancy in early October. Demand continues to be strong, and we look forward to providing further updates in the near future.
Now, I'll cover the HCR ManorCare performance update. For the second quarter of 2016, HCR ManorCare reported normalized EBITDAR of $132 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $263 million. HCR ManorCare's normalized fixed charge coverage ratio for the trailing 12 months was 1.03x, down 3 basis points from Q1, driven by continued industry headwinds, a weaker flu season and a 3% rent increase effective in April. Note that fixed charge coverage was also burdened by $9 million of EBITDAR losses from the 33 nonstrategic assets that have sold to date.
Upon excluding these EBITDAR losses and the rent associated with the assets, the trailing 12-month normalized fixed charge coverage would have been 1.07x. As a reminder, there are 17 additional assets that are planned to be sold by early 2017. HCR ManorCare ended the quarter with $174 million of cash and cash equivalents.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

277966,372625672,1032060,"HCP, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. As Mike mentioned, we are progressing in every area necessary to launch the spin of our new company, Quality Care Properties or QCP. We have a highly experienced management team, with Greg Neeb as our President and Chief Investment Office",543,"Thank you, Mike. As Mike mentioned, we are progressing in every area necessary to launch the spin of our new company, Quality Care Properties or QCP. We have a highly experienced management team, with Greg Neeb as our President and Chief Investment Officer and Marc Richards as our Chief Financial Officer.
I worked closely with Greg and Mark for the past decade at several companies, most applicably, the turnaround of Sunrise Senior Living where we both owned and operated skilled nursing facilities and a major assisted living and memory care platform. We have a demonstrated track record of actively managing real estate and healthcare operations with a proven ability to work through challenging situations to reach an optimal outcome for our shareholders. We look forward to leading QCP.
We have also made good progress on forming our Board of Directors. We will soon be announcing a highly-qualified board of 6 independent directors joining me, with experience across the health care, real estate, investing, finance and legal sectors.
As Mike mentioned, we are moving along toward arranging our debt financing, which will be in place for the spin, and we will then be able to speak specifically to the debt cost and structure. QCP will emerge with an appropriate capital structure to support our business strategy. We will be a major player in a vital, irreplaceable and growing sector within health care.
As inception, QCP will own a portfolio of 338 properties diversified across 30 states, primarily consisting of post-acute/skilled nursing and private pay senior housing facilities operated by HCR ManorCare. QCP's in-place rental income will be approximately $485 million, and we estimate our annual G&A run rate to be just over $20 million. Our near-term goal will be to manage actively our portfolio and relationship with HCR ManorCare in order to develop a comprehensive solution that will unlock the real estate value in the portfolio. We have a wide variety of alternatives that we can pursue, and we will work with HCR ManorCare's management team to improve the portfolio's operating performance and lease coverage.
The QCP dividend, of course, will be set by our independent board. I believe that given our high tenant concentration in one operator with lease coverage that has declined in recent periods, it'll be most important for QCP to build up near-term liquidity. Therefore, it's my expectation that we will most likely begin with a low to modest dividend. We will seek to maximize value for investors through total shareholder return. Of course, we'll have the option to grow into a higher dividend level over time as lease coverage stabilizes.
I'll conclude by saying that I'm very pleased by the excellent collaboration among my team and the HCP board, management team and advisers to launch a first-class company, which will unlock value for HCP and future QCP shareholders. In my role as adviser to HCP, I've been able to see firsthand the company's careful determination to build its next chapter. Our time together has been a pleasure, and we all look forward to the launch of QCP and to rolling up our sleeves to seek a comprehensive solution with HCR ManorCare.
We look forward to meeting with our investors and potential investors in the coming weeks and months. Mike?"

As Mike mentioned in his prepared remarks, that it will be a focus for us. We think that ongoing discussions with Brookdale to call the portfolio can help the concentration and ultimately help the credit quality of the lease moving forward.

So what we're looking at, as Justin indicated, regardless of how we finance it, we still have our same share in the real estate in that joint venture and it's at a 6.5% trailing cap rate. And again -- so that part doesn't change. What has changed is how we're financing the entity. So we have this partnership, along with another one, where we have partners that would like to receive some proceeds. And we don't prefer to receive proceeds at the HCP level because we're more geared toward wanting to bring our leverage down more rapidly and improve our net debt to EBITDA. So the way to accomplish that is to put in place a third-party debt for the partner's share of that financing. And then we provide debt at the same rate for our share, which gets eliminated in consolidation as if that debt doesn't even exist from our perspective. So our financial position remains unchanged. So we did -- we're doing that with a couple of our partnerships. We also have a GBP revolver outstanding for $450 million. We intend to prepay that because there's no prepayment penalties on that, and we can reduce our leverage fairly substantially. That's where we come up with those leverage numbers that I spoke to in the script of coming somewhere in the vicinity of 45.5% to 46% leverage post spin, bringing it down to 43.5%, and from 6.6x net debt-to-EBITDA down to 6.25x net debt to EBITDA. It is that series of moves. One other thing I'd add is in prepayment of that GBP debt, of course, we have to pay attention to the hedging that we have on our GBP investments. So we'd enter into a simple cross-currency swap against one of our unsecured notes so that we stay hedged. So that's how we're thinking about the revised financing plan."

If you take out the impact that was picked up from the asset sales or the drag from the asset sales, you're about at 1.04. Another way to look at it though is that we have more asset sales to go. There's about $65 million more in sales coming. $10 million are under contract; total proceeds, we estimate to be around $54 million; and then we have another $7 million now to pick up the remaining amount. And we expect the $10 million to close by year-end and then the remaining amounts to close in the first quarter. But the timing of that sale can help us to get to that 1.1 cover."

But you'll see that normalize over time, as Justin mentioned, the occupancy getting to that pretty high levels."

It usually requires a fairly high cash on cash return in the front-end, probably has an average life somewhere in the vicinity of 12 years, we're going to fine-tune this through our discussions. We're obviously going to want to underwrite to an IRR a certain number of basis points above our WAC to make sure that there's honesty in the projects that we approve, that there is a positive return to our investors and then have a view on the impact on the same-store portfolio growth, so that again, we've got a feel for what it does to the numbers.

We really start out more in the mid-3s as far as net debt to EBITDA based on current rents. And that 5.0x that you're referencing would be somebody in the Street looking at it and modifying or underwriting a rent at a 1.3x on the skilled and 1.1x on the assisted. That is not where we're at right now. So I would just start by saying it's more in that mid to upper 3s as to where we'd stand on day 1 and -- but yet to be determined. As far as the different types of financing that could occur, we had looked at 3. I mean, we could enter into term loans, A and B notes, for instance, CMBS which really doesn't work that well in skilled space and of course -- and there's corporate bonds. We have explored all 3 with our bankers. I think the CMBS probably is not the route to go. It could very well be a combination of term loans and corporate bonds. And we actually do have a path that we're looking at right now, but it would be premature for me to provide you our thoughts on because I'd like to see where it plays out over the next couple of weeks. As far as the rate of repayment of the debt, the 6.3% rate is what I said in my script. So is that accretive or dilutive? Well, let's put it this way. It comes at a -- what I would think a fairly modest prepayment penalty to clear out all of our debt or the vast majority of it for 2016, '17 and '18 at the HCP level. It's pretty high-level rate debt. And then we have to see what that debt cost is at the QCP level to look at what it looks like across the combined enterprises, not that they won't totally trade separately, but when you're just looking at the 2 together at period 0. So we'll see where that plays out. The other thing that I would mention is you're probably wondering how do the high-yield markets look right now. The fact is they look favorable. So I'll remind you, when you're comparing to other executions that are out there, that QCP is going to be a REIT, and it's backed by a full portfolio of real estate assets. There's been excellent activity over the last couple of weeks and before that. And that financing has been around LBOs, acquisitions, opportunistic refinancings, et cetera, so the transactions -- these transactions have been met with very, very strong demand because investors are putting a lot of dollars to work. If you go back to the beginning of the year and you look at the single B index, and I'm not saying that's where we're at specifically, but we'll be below investment grade at QCP, it's at 6 point -- I think the number I got yesterday was about 6.7% versus 8.6% at the beginning of the year. So the markets have been quite favorable, and the indications that we get in all preliminary discussions are quite favorable as well."

We've had pretty good results where we face new supply to date. Occupancy typically comes under pressure. We've had an exception to that where we had an independent living portfolio that was concentrated in Houston, for instance, that performs quite well. What tends to happen is you'll have occupancy be impacted in the market and therefore, in your community within that market, but rate tends to hold. So we're still seeing EBITDAR growth or NOI growth in communities that are impacted by new supply to date. However, as we look forward and trying to predict performance, we're going to be conservative and anticipate some impact. On the wage front, we find it really interesting that our communities that are located in the top 31 MSAs are actually more impacted by wage increases than our secondary markets. In fact, they're substantially more impacted, so there's pressure there as well."

And that's actually similar in the range of where we're building the cobuy [ph] depending on the TI package you're looking at."

Joining me today is Justin Hutchens, our Chief Investment Officer; and John Lu, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Finance. And I'm pleased to welcome back Tom Herzog on his first earnings call since returning as our Chief Financial Officer.
We look forward to sharing with you our quarterly results and updates on several significant initiatives. But before diving into the details, I want to step back for several minutes and give you some additional color on the rationale behind some major changes at the company. They have a purpose.
I will start by saying this is an exciting time at HCP. It's a renaissance of sorts. I've been referring recently to the stage we are entering into as HCP 3.0. I've been fortunate to be a witness to and a participant in each of the generational periods of HCP since its formation in 1985.
The first generation was represented by our friend and founding CEO, Ken Roath. Well known to many of you, Ken established our company as one of the first healthcare REITs and grew it significantly with a solid foundation and a stellar reputation.
Jay Flaherty is identified with our second generation. Over his decade of leadership, he repositioned the company to a significant extent by moving away from properties reliant on government reimbursement and into larger transactions that provided scale as privatization and consolidation swept through the industry.
Lessons learned, one large transaction that we all take responsibility for was our purchase of HCR ManorCare in 2011. At the time of the purchase, this leading skilled nursing post-acute company was widely acclaimed as best in class, but it was also heavily reliant on government reimbursement. All of you know that over the last 5 years, the skilled nursing post-acute space has been rocked by numerous sequential challenges. The cumulative impact has been strongly felt across the sector.
When these issues came more into focus, we asked Lauralee Martin to take the helm and bridge us to the next generation. We knew we were giving her a tough hand to play, but none of us were able to predict how difficult the last few years would be as this space continued to be jolted by one decision or another imposed on it primarily by the payer shift toward Medicare Advantage and the net effect of sequestration cuts.
In the last few months, the board and I evaluated where we were and what the future could look like. In addition to the spin and the other initiatives in play, we determined that the best course was to move HCP 3.0 forward by starting to put the face on the team that would take the company forward into the next generation of evolution and growth.
With the initiatives we have announced and some we will announce shortly, all of us are confident and excited about our prospects for near- and longer-term performance and growth. I want to express my heartfelt appreciation for the effort and contribution that Lauralee gave us, getting us to the point that we can now launch this next stage.
Let me also report that the team that will take us forward is coming together very well. There is some blending of new folks in encore appearance and those that have been around for many years. They are working marvelously together, and I am confident that you will see tangible positive results soon from the groundwork that is underway.
In assembling this team, there is a method to our madness. It's been noted by many of you that we've added some key executives like Justin Hutchens and Kai Hsiao with strong reputations as leaders and operators of large healthcare companies. And we've added other new team members, who aren't as publicly visible with similar backgrounds.
Our long-tenured executives, Tom Klaritch and John Bergschneider, who run our medical office and life science platforms, are as well regarded as anyone in their respective roles. And with Tom Herzog returning to our team, we have someone widely regarded for his conservative yet progressive thinking around balance sheet, cost of capital management and strategic capital allocation. We'll stack this talented team up against any in the industry.
Now, looking ahead, one of the biggest questions we face like many REITs is how do you plan to grow going forward. Well, our assessment is that there is plenty of room to grow, but it will be a different strategic path than in recent -- in the recent past. Much of the growth in the future will come through affiliations with provider networks and picking experienced operators and partnering with them for growth.
The good news is that the healthcare real estate market remains large and in many areas, highly fragmented. HCP is being shaped to be the capital partner of choice because we understand the needs of the operator and we know how operations either succeed or fail. We believe that our ability to attract and underwrite potential investments will benefit from the internal resources assembled, and we believe we will quickly become a trusted partner to selected new operators and emerging provider networks because we talk their language and have an appreciation of their needs.
We understand business needs because we have run businesses and we have walked in our tenants' shoes. So when we talk about a new generation, HCP 3.0, we are talking not just about change but strategic change to meet the market where it is and where it's going.
With that said, there are some key overhangs that we are aggressively addressing to position us for growth. First, we are obviously addressing the issues related to HCR ManorCare with the spin transaction. Second, although we have a high degree of confidence in Brookdale Senior Living, we recognize reducing our portfolio concentration in Brookdale is a high priority.
Third, we have somewhat elevated leverage as compared to our peers and historical averages. We are prepared to improve our balance sheet metrics progressively over the next 2 to 3 years. Fourth, as you continue to get to know our next generation of leaders, we believe that you will quickly gain confidence in our ability to execute and to grow prudently. And finally, as part of sustained credibility, we will be a leader in transparency, predictability and clarity to the fullest extent possible.
Let me acknowledge upfront that this earnings call has some inherent limitations because some of what we are doing is still in progress, and detailed information in some areas is restricted by the fact that we are in registration with the SEC for our spin transaction and we are not yet effective. We will do the best we can to be responsive to your questions, but we really look forward to getting through the next several months when all of the things we are doing will become much clearer when the comprehensive plan we are implementing can be shared with you fully.
Today, we will cover details of our second quarter results and portfolio performance, and we'll give you an update on our spinoff of HCR ManorCare, which is well underway and expected to be completed early in the fourth quarter.
I'm happy to report that we now have a name for the new spin company. We call it Quality Care Properties or QCP. I'm also happy to report that the remaining 75% of our portfolio, which is predominantly private pay, is performing at or above plan and will anchor HCP's organic growth following the spin.
Let me now turn things over to Tom Herzog, who will focus on our quarterly results and financial performance."
277966,372625672,1033044,"HCP, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Today, I will cover several topics: first, our second quarter results; second, an update on our dispositions and RIDEA 2 transaction; third, our balance sheet and financing plan; and finally, our updated 2016 guidance.I'll start with ou",1084,"Thank you, Mike. Today, I will cover several topics: first, our second quarter results; second, an update on our dispositions and RIDEA 2 transaction; third, our balance sheet and financing plan; and finally, our updated 2016 guidance.
I'll start with our results. During the second quarter, we reported NAREIT FFO of $0.71 per share, which included a negative $0.03 per share of transaction-related costs, substantially all of which were spin related. Excluding these costs, we recorded FFO as adjusted of $0.74 per share and FAD of $0.72 per share.
Also impacting the quarter were gains of $0.03 per share that resulted from monetizing our share in the appreciation of 2 participating development loans in our senior housing segment. Note that there was a similar gain of $0.02 per share in the prior year period.
Both NAREIT FFO and FFO as adjusted for the quarter reflect an $0.08 per share year-over-year reduction from placing the HCR ManorCare lease on cash basis beginning on January 1 of this year, as discussed on our February earnings call.
Looking at same property performance, our overall year-over-year same-store cash NOI grew at 4% in the second quarter. Excluding HCR ManorCare and the other 28 assets included in the spin to QCP, HCP RemainCo generated solid year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth of 4.4% for the quarter, led by strong leasing momentum in life science, which grew at 8.6%, driven by the burn-off of rent abatements, contractual rent steps and lease-up activities, bringing occupancy to a new all-time high of 98.7%, and strong RIDEA growth of 5.6% in the quarter, which Justin will cover momentarily.
Moving on to dispositions and RIDEA 2 transaction. We are on track to complete $1.25 billion of dispositions in 2016, inclusive of the previously announced RIDEA 2 transaction, of which $350 million has closed and the remaining $900 million is committed and expected to close by year-end. As will be further discussed in a moment, proceeds will be used primarily to reduce leverage and recycle into other investments.
Significant transactions include: $130 million from the sale of a portfolio of 5 skilled nursing and 2 assisted living facilities operated by Trilogy, which closed in June; $50 million from the monetization of 2 senior housing development loans during the quarter; $470 million of total proceeds to HCP from the pending RIDEA 2 joint venture transaction announced last quarter from selling a 40% stake in the venture for $110 million and raising $360 million of new third-party debt.
Note that this has been revised from a previously disclosed estimate of $740 million due to our decision to reduce the size of the new third-party mortgage debt, allowing us to reduce leverage more quickly compared to our previous plan. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter. The majority of the remaining $600 million of dispositions represents previously announced transactions, including Phase 1 of the Genentech purchase option expected to close November and the sales of a life science facility, a medical office building and nonstrategic HCR ManorCare assets.
Next, our balance sheet and financing plan. During the quarter, we prepaid $200 million of mortgage debt at 6.6%. Our financial leverage improved by 90 basis points from the prior quarter to 44.6% at the end of second quarter. And we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of immediate liquidity from our revolver plus unrestricted cash.
Now, I'll provide an update on our overall financing plan for HCP and QCP. Our current financing plan anticipates raising up to $3.8 billion of proceeds in aggregate from a combination of: first, $0.9 billion from dispositions and the RIDEA 2 transaction during the second half of the year as reflected in our guidance, which I just discussed; and second, $2.9 billion not included in our guidance from QCP financing to be distributed to HCP and additional asset sales.
The $3.8 billion of proceeds will be used as follows: first, the repayment of $3.3 billion of debt consisting of $2.4 billion of bonds and secured debt maturities at a 6.3% blended rate, representing substantially all scheduled debt maturities through the end of 2018, plus $0.9 billion currently outstanding under our revolver; and the remaining proceeds of $0.5 billion will be used to finance pending acquisitions during the second half of 2016 totaling $0.2 billion, with the remainder used for spin transaction costs, debt prepayment costs and committed development fundings.
Our updated financing plan improves HCP RemainCo's balance sheet relative to our targets communicated last quarter. Our target net debt to EBITDA is expected to improve from 6.6x to 6.25x, and our target financial leverage to improve from 45.5% to 43.5%.
Finally, our 2016 guidance. Full year 2016 guidance updated today represents our performance expectations for the entire HCP portfolio and does not reflect the spin transaction. It does reflect the impact of the $1.25 billion of dispositions inclusive of RIDEA 2 that I just discussed, our announced investment activities and contractual rent from HCR ManorCare, inclusive of the 3% rent escalator that took effect on April 1.
With that said, HCP's portfolio continues to perform well, and we expect our full year 2016 NAREIT FFO to range from $2.72 to $2.78 per share, reflecting $0.08 per share of transaction costs, primarily for spin-related professional fees realized before completion, which are expensed as incurred, and $0.03 per share of previously announced severance-related charges in the third quarter.
Excluding the transaction costs and the severance-related charges, we are raising FFO as adjusted to $2.83 to $2.89 per share from the previous range of $2.77 to $2.83 per share, inclusive of the $0.03 per share gain I described earlier.
We're also raising our FAD guidance to $2.68 to $2.74 per share from the previous range of $2.65 to $2.71 per share. We are reaffirming our overall same-store cash NOI year-over-year growth forecast of 1.5% to 2.5% and are projecting same-store growth for HCP RemainCo's portfolio, which primarily consists of private pay senior housing, life science and medical office assets, to increase between 2.3% and 3.3% when excluding the assets being spun off to QCP.
While not reflected in our 2016 guidance, the incremental impact from the spin transaction will include transferring approximately $485 million of annual in-place rental income to QCP and prepaying HCP debt using cash proceeds raised by QCP and additional asset sales. Additional future spin transaction-related costs, including the impact in EPS and NAREIT FFO, will be provided upon completion of the transaction.
Now let me turn the call over to Justin."

In senior housing, as Tom mentioned, we had another quarter of strong growth in our 70-community same-store RIDEA portfolio of 5.6%, bringing our year-to-date growth to 7.5%, driven by occupancy improvement of 150 basis points in the quarter, which was 170 basis points above the overall industry.
We were also able to achieve strong rate growth of 3.5%, again ahead of the industry average. The benefits of our revenue-enhancing capital investments are beginning to take shape, and we feel there is further room to grow in our markets. Our portfolio is positioned in markets with high senior population growth and has shown resilience to the threats of new supply.
Fewer than 15% of our communities have been impacted by recent openings since the start of 2015. Occupancy in our top 5 markets improved 100 basis points in the second quarter from prior year to 91% while growth for the remaining portfolio was even stronger. Our diverse portfolio by geography and care mix allows us to mitigate the concentration risk of new supply and labor challenges.
Although our communities located in our top markets enjoyed NOI growth comparable to our peers, our communities located outside the primary markets enjoyed same-store NOI growth of 13% over the prior year. We firmly believe that quality returns are determined by local market fundamentals and the execution of the operations.
As Mike mentioned, we value our Brookdale relationship. We are diversified within Brookdale across independent living, assisted living, memory care and continuing care retirement communities in a variety of structures, including triple-net leases and RIDEA joint ventures, and we are encouraged by the direction of the company.
However, we are mindful of the Brookdale concentration post spin and remain focused on the performance management of their communities through the team's efforts. We are focused with Brookdale in finding mutually beneficial ways to address our concentration and improve the overall quality of the portfolio.
On the MOB front, 82% of our properties are located on campus, with 95% affiliated with over 200 health systems. One of the hallmark characteristics of our MOB platform is its consistent and predictable performance, evidenced by having 75% tenant retention rate year-to-date and 2.7% same-store growth outlook for the year at the midpoint. We are the largest owner and developer of life science real estate on the West Coast, concentrated in 2 of the top 3 markets in the country where fundamentals continue to be very favorable.
We reported another all-time high occupancy and strong same-store outlook for the year at a midpoint of 7.4%. The Cove development in South San Francisco continues to progress well. The Phase 1 buildings are substantially complete and steel is up on the second phase buildings. We are excited to welcome our first tenant, Denali Therapeutics, moving in this week and are -- we are on schedule for CytomX Therapeutics to take occupancy in early October. Demand continues to be strong, and we look forward to providing further updates in the near future.
Now, I'll cover the HCR ManorCare performance update. For the second quarter of 2016, HCR ManorCare reported normalized EBITDAR of $132 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $263 million. HCR ManorCare's normalized fixed charge coverage ratio for the trailing 12 months was 1.03x, down 3 basis points from Q1, driven by continued industry headwinds, a weaker flu season and a 3% rent increase effective in April. Note that fixed charge coverage was also burdened by $9 million of EBITDAR losses from the 33 nonstrategic assets that have sold to date.
Upon excluding these EBITDAR losses and the rent associated with the assets, the trailing 12-month normalized fixed charge coverage would have been 1.07x. As a reminder, there are 17 additional assets that are planned to be sold by early 2017. HCR ManorCare ended the quarter with $174 million of cash and cash equivalents.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

277966,372625672,1033044,"HCP, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. As Mike mentioned, we are progressing in every area necessary to launch the spin of our new company, Quality Care Properties or QCP. We have a highly experienced management team, with Greg Neeb as our President and Chief Investment Office",543,"Thank you, Mike. As Mike mentioned, we are progressing in every area necessary to launch the spin of our new company, Quality Care Properties or QCP. We have a highly experienced management team, with Greg Neeb as our President and Chief Investment Officer and Marc Richards as our Chief Financial Officer.
I worked closely with Greg and Mark for the past decade at several companies, most applicably, the turnaround of Sunrise Senior Living where we both owned and operated skilled nursing facilities and a major assisted living and memory care platform. We have a demonstrated track record of actively managing real estate and healthcare operations with a proven ability to work through challenging situations to reach an optimal outcome for our shareholders. We look forward to leading QCP.
We have also made good progress on forming our Board of Directors. We will soon be announcing a highly-qualified board of 6 independent directors joining me, with experience across the health care, real estate, investing, finance and legal sectors.
As Mike mentioned, we are moving along toward arranging our debt financing, which will be in place for the spin, and we will then be able to speak specifically to the debt cost and structure. QCP will emerge with an appropriate capital structure to support our business strategy. We will be a major player in a vital, irreplaceable and growing sector within health care.
As inception, QCP will own a portfolio of 338 properties diversified across 30 states, primarily consisting of post-acute/skilled nursing and private pay senior housing facilities operated by HCR ManorCare. QCP's in-place rental income will be approximately $485 million, and we estimate our annual G&A run rate to be just over $20 million. Our near-term goal will be to manage actively our portfolio and relationship with HCR ManorCare in order to develop a comprehensive solution that will unlock the real estate value in the portfolio. We have a wide variety of alternatives that we can pursue, and we will work with HCR ManorCare's management team to improve the portfolio's operating performance and lease coverage.
The QCP dividend, of course, will be set by our independent board. I believe that given our high tenant concentration in one operator with lease coverage that has declined in recent periods, it'll be most important for QCP to build up near-term liquidity. Therefore, it's my expectation that we will most likely begin with a low to modest dividend. We will seek to maximize value for investors through total shareholder return. Of course, we'll have the option to grow into a higher dividend level over time as lease coverage stabilizes.
I'll conclude by saying that I'm very pleased by the excellent collaboration among my team and the HCP board, management team and advisers to launch a first-class company, which will unlock value for HCP and future QCP shareholders. In my role as adviser to HCP, I've been able to see firsthand the company's careful determination to build its next chapter. Our time together has been a pleasure, and we all look forward to the launch of QCP and to rolling up our sleeves to seek a comprehensive solution with HCR ManorCare.
We look forward to meeting with our investors and potential investors in the coming weeks and months. Mike?"

So we're encouraged by the overall performance of the company. Meanwhile, we're mindful of the concentration that HCP will have -- on pre-spin, we're around 25% concentrated; post spin, we go to around 34%. As Mike mentioned in his prepared remarks, that it will be a focus for us. We think that ongoing discussions with Brookdale to call the portfolio can help the concentration and ultimately help the credit quality of the lease moving forward. And then, of course, over time, by growing in other asset classes and what other operators, we'll be able to address the concentration as well."

So what we're looking at, as Justin indicated, regardless of how we finance it, we still have our same share in the real estate in that joint venture and it's at a 6.5% trailing cap rate. And again -- so that part doesn't change. What has changed is how we're financing the entity. So we have this partnership, along with another one, where we have partners that would like to receive some proceeds. And we don't prefer to receive proceeds at the HCP level because we're more geared toward wanting to bring our leverage down more rapidly and improve our net debt to EBITDA. So the way to accomplish that is to put in place a third-party debt for the partner's share of that financing. And then we provide debt at the same rate for our share, which gets eliminated in consolidation as if that debt doesn't even exist from our perspective. So our financial position remains unchanged. So we did -- we're doing that with a couple of our partnerships. We also have a GBP revolver outstanding for $450 million. We intend to prepay that because there's no prepayment penalties on that, and we can reduce our leverage fairly substantially. That's where we come up with those leverage numbers that I spoke to in the script of coming somewhere in the vicinity of 45.5% to 46% leverage post spin, bringing it down to 43.5%, and from 6.6x net debt-to-EBITDA down to 6.25x net debt to EBITDA. It is that series of moves. One other thing I'd add is in prepayment of that GBP debt, of course, we have to pay attention to the hedging that we have on our GBP investments. So we'd enter into a simple cross-currency swap against one of our unsecured notes so that we stay hedged. So that's how we're thinking about the revised financing plan."

Seasonally, Q4 is generally strong, although that's not always the case. So as we look at that and incorporated feedback from the company, we point to the lower end of that range at this point in time and a corresponding fixed charge cover, be it 1.07 and 1.10. If you take out the impact that was picked up from the asset sales or the drag from the asset sales, you're about at 1.04. Another way to look at it though is that we have more asset sales to go. There's about $65 million more in sales coming. $10 million are under contract; total proceeds, we estimate to be around $54 million; and then we have another $7 million now to pick up the remaining amount. And we expect the $10 million to close by year-end and then the remaining amounts to close in the first quarter. But the timing of that sale can help us to get to that 1.1 cover."

We track the cash flow performance and occupancy of those assets relative to market and we're finding that we're outperforming. So there's definitely a net benefit in the early going from these capital expenditures. However, as we've looked at this and with Tom on board now, we're going to make this a priority topic.

But to put more rigor around it, we think about the type of spend that it is, that's exterior common areas, it's kitchen, bath, FF&E, et cetera. A lot of the stuff might have a 12-year life. It usually requires a fairly high cash on cash return in the front-end, probably has an average life somewhere in the vicinity of 12 years, we're going to fine-tune this through our discussions. We're obviously going to want to underwrite to an IRR a certain number of basis points above our WAC to make sure that there's honesty in the projects that we approve, that there is a positive return to our investors and then have a view on the impact on the same-store portfolio growth, so that again, we've got a feel for what it does to the numbers.

We really start out more in the mid-3s as far as net debt to EBITDA based on current rents. And that 5.0x that you're referencing would be somebody in the Street looking at it and modifying or underwriting a rent at a 1.3x on the skilled and 1.1x on the assisted. That is not where we're at right now. So I would just start by saying it's more in that mid to upper 3s as to where we'd stand on day 1 and -- but yet to be determined. As far as the different types of financing that could occur, we had looked at 3. I mean, we could enter into term loans, A and B notes, for instance, CMBS which really doesn't work that well in skilled space and of course -- and there's corporate bonds. We have explored all 3 with our bankers. I think the CMBS probably is not the route to go. It could very well be a combination of term loans and corporate bonds. And we actually do have a path that we're looking at right now, but it would be premature for me to provide you our thoughts on because I'd like to see where it plays out over the next couple of weeks. As far as the rate of repayment of the debt, the 6.3% rate is what I said in my script. So is that accretive or dilutive? Well, let's put it this way. It comes at a -- what I would think a fairly modest prepayment penalty to clear out all of our debt or the vast majority of it for 2016, '17 and '18 at the HCP level. It's pretty high-level rate debt. And then we have to see what that debt cost is at the QCP level to look at what it looks like across the combined enterprises, not that they won't totally trade separately, but when you're just looking at the 2 together at period 0. So we'll see where that plays out. The other thing that I would mention is you're probably wondering how do the high-yield markets look right now. The fact is they look favorable. So I'll remind you, when you're comparing to other executions that are out there, that QCP is going to be a REIT, and it's backed by a full portfolio of real estate assets. There's been excellent activity over the last couple of weeks and before that. And that financing has been around LBOs, acquisitions, opportunistic refinancings, et cetera, so the transactions -- these transactions have been met with very, very strong demand because investors are putting a lot of dollars to work. If you go back to the beginning of the year and you look at the single B index, and I'm not saying that's where we're at specifically, but we'll be below investment grade at QCP, it's at 6 point -- I think the number I got yesterday was about 6.7% versus 8.6% at the beginning of the year. So the markets have been quite favorable, and the indications that we get in all preliminary discussions are quite favorable as well."

We've had pretty good results where we face new supply to date. Occupancy typically comes under pressure. We've had an exception to that where we had an independent living portfolio that was concentrated in Houston, for instance, that performs quite well. What tends to happen is you'll have occupancy be impacted in the market and therefore, in your community within that market, but rate tends to hold. So we're still seeing EBITDAR growth or NOI growth in communities that are impacted by new supply to date. However, as we look forward and trying to predict performance, we're going to be conservative and anticipate some impact. On the wage front, we find it really interesting that our communities that are located in the top 31 MSAs are actually more impacted by wage increases than our secondary markets. In fact, they're substantially more impacted, so there's pressure there as well."

Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On our last earnings call, I gave you 5 goals that we were focused on: to execute the spinoff of HCR ManorCare's portfolio; to reduce and improve our Brookdale concentration; to improve our balance sheet metrics; to become a leader in transparency and clarity; and to establish the next generation of leadership for HCP 3.0. As you know, we are very pleased to have completed the Spin transaction yesterday, creating a new publicly listed company called Quality Care Properties or QCP.
QCP's primary holdings are the real estate facilities operated by HCR ManorCare. QCP's principal objective at the outset will be to take the necessary steps over time to realize the embedded value in these assets, value that we believe has not been recognized in recent months and years in the stock valuation of HCP. We wish Mark Ordan, QCP's CEO, and his team the very best as he launches this new company.
We're also delighted that QCP has a world-class Board of Directors to oversee its business strategy and governance. Joining Mark on the board will be Don Wood, CEO of Federal Realty; Glenn Cohen, CFO of Kimco Realty; Paul Klaassen, co-Founder and former Chairman of Sunrise Senior Living; Kathy Smalley, a partner at the law firm of Locke Lord and the former General Counsel of Trammell Crow, and Catellus; Bill Schimmel [ph], recently retired from KPMG, having served as lead audit partner for such clients as Apple, General Dynamics, and Tenet Healthcare; and Jerry Doctrow, well known to many of you from his days as a leading health care analyst at Stifel, and Legg Mason. QCP will be in excellent hands. 
Yesterday, we repatriated from QCP to HCP the net proceeds from the $1.75 billion financing we recently raised. We also have announced that we are under contract to sell 64 Brookdale properties to a venture formed by Blackstone and Columbia Pacific for $1.125 billion. We are also well on our way to completing the previously announced RIDEA 2 transaction with Columbia Pacific and the sale or transfer of 25 other Brookdale triple-net properties.
In the aggregate, we have taken a major step in reducing our Brookdale concentration from 35% immediately post spin to 27%, and of note, the 10% concentration for the triple-net assets. I'm also pleased to report that when these transactions close, the aggregate lease coverage of the remaining Brookdale triple-net assets held by HCP significantly improves to 1.21x on a pro forma trailing basis.
Our current objective is to further reduce our Brookdale concentration to between 20% and 25% over a reasonable period of time. The combined proceeds from QCP financing and Brookdale transactions will be used by HCP to pay off our line of credit and substantially all other debt maturities through the end of 2018. Once completed, this will result in a much improved balance sheet profile. As we will explain in greater detail, these actions have stabilized our balance sheet, with metrics solidly in the BBB territory and provide a clear path ahead to return to BBB+.
And as to our fourth goal around transparency and clarity, you see today a revamped and enhanced supplemental report for the third quarter 2016 and moving forward. This is one tangible expression of our commitment around providing improved transparency. 
As to our fifth goal, establishing the next generation of leadership for HCP 3.0, I will be prepared to be very specific about our plans in the coming weeks and certainly before year-end.
It has been a complex and multifaceted journey since we announced a general direction along these lines last May. With the completed spin, the successful spin financing, the announced asset sales and the team that is being assembled, we have reset the company with a stable foundation and an ability going forward to grow prudently and in an accretive manner. 
HCP moving forward is in the strongest position it has been in for years. 94% private pay, a vastly improved balance sheet with plans in place for further improvement, crown jewels in our life science and medical properties portfolios and an improving and more diversified senior housing platform.
It is no surprise that all of these achievements have come with a cost. To position HCP for the future and create QCP to realize value over time, we have incurred costs, fees, prepayment charges, dilutive dispositions of noncore assets and the like. We have incurred these costs in order to achieve this onetime reset and to come out of this process with the strongest HCP possible, HCP 3.0.
So today, we will be giving a preliminary outlook for 2017. We will provide details on how we have reset our dividend and metrics as the foundation for moving forward. We will do our best to provide as clear a picture of how all of the actions we have taken come together in a complete picture. So let me turn the call over now to Tom Herzog to begin that discussion."

For the third quarter, our portfolio performed in line with our expectations, reported FFO as adjusted of $0.72 per share and NAREIT FFO of $0.65 per share. These results included a $0.01 gain in the quarter for monetizing a participating development loan in our senior housing segment. 
NAREIT FFO is impacted by $0.04 per share of spin transaction-related costs and $0.03 per share of previously announced severance-related charges. Note that we're no longer reporting or providing guidance for FAD on a per share basis in light of the SEC's recent focus on FAD per share as a liquidity measure. Although we are no longer reporting FAD per share, we will continue to provide total FAD and its related components.
For same-store performance beginning this quarter, we're now including the pro rata contribution from unconsolidated joint ventures in our same-store reporting convention to provide increased transparency in our portfolio performance. For the quarter, HCP generated solid year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth of 3.1%, excluding the QCP assets.
Now turning to our full year 2016 guidance. We are updating our guidance to reflect the spin transaction closed yesterday. Accordingly, it represents 10 months of HoldCo and 2 months of RemainCo post-spin. The net impact of the spin for the 2-month period equates to approximately $0.15 per share and is reflected in our updated guidance. 
We continue to have strong performance from all our core segments and expect our full year FFO as adjusted per share to range from $2.69 to $2.75, inclusive of the $0.04 of year-to-date gains from monetizing 3 senior housing development loans. We expect full year 2016 FFO -- NAREIT FFO to range from $2.35 to $2.41 per share, impacted by $0.34 of onetime costs, of which $0.18 relates to spin transaction costs, $0.10 of debt prepayment costs resulting from the spin, $0.03 of other transaction costs and $0.03 of previously announced severance-related charges.
Also, excluding QCP, we are projecting full year 2016 same-store cash NOI to range from 2.75% to 3.75%. Finally, our upcoming dividend. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per share to be paid on November 25, 2016. The new dividend reflects our outlook, which I will discuss in a few minutes.

I'll start with a few more details on our strategic Brookdale transactions, then I'll review our recent investments and third quarter performance. And lastly, I'll provide a preliminary outlook for our 2017 same-property performance for each of our sectors.
Starting with the Brookdale transactions. This morning, we announced that we entered into definitive agreements to sell 64 communities that are leased to Brookdale for $1.125 billion to Blackstone and Columbia Pacific Advisors, representing a trailing 12-month lease yield of 8%, and we expect it to close in the first quarter of 2017. The portfolio had an occupancy of 85.2% for the third quarter and lease coverage of 0.81x for the trailing 12 months through September. 
In addition, we will sell or transition 25 triple-net assets that are nonstrategic to both HCP and Brookdale within the next 12 months. These assets had an occupancy of 79.9% for the third quarter and lease coverage of 0.52x for the trailing 12 months through September. 
Also in Q4, we expect to transfer 8 expiring Brookdale leases to RIDEA structures, 4 with Brookdale and 4 with a new operator. We are pleased to announce the asset sales and lease restructure as key components of our transition to HCP 3.0. These combined initiatives were mutually beneficial while enabling HCP to address several important strategic priorities, including reducing our Brookdale concentration, improving the lease coverage of our triple-net senior housing portfolio and diversifying our operator relationships. Additionally, we were able to achieve market pricing on the 64 assets validated through a competitive bidding process. The transaction significantly improves the overall quality of our retained portfolio.
Specifically, we are reducing a major tenant concentration from 35% immediately post-spin to 27% once these transactions are complete. I'll also note that our triple-net exposure to Brookdale reduces from 16% of our total portfolio concentration to 10%.
The lease coverage for our Brookdale triple-net portfolio will improve by 19 basis points on a pro forma basis to 1.21x on a trailing 12-month basis. And the quality of our Brookdale triple-net portfolio will improve significantly, with occupancy increasing by 260 basis points to 89.1%. Furthermore, the retained Brookdale portfolio is located in stronger markets represented by a better overall demographics profile as shown on Slide 4 in our presentation deck. 
We value our relationship with Brookdale and look forward to our continued work together, positioning our portfolio for success. Additionally, we will diversify relationships by adding 2 to 3 new operators in conjunction with transitioning communities from Brookdale.
Moving on to our investments. In September, we completed the previously announced acquisition of 7 private pay senior housing communities for $186 million, welcoming a new operator partner to our SHOP platform, Senior Lifestyle Corporation. This marks the sixth new relationship that we've added to our senior housing portfolio this year. 
Now let me highlight a few things on our third quarter performance. We continue to see growth in our SHOP platform, which delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 3.3% for 120 communities, bringing our year-to-date growth to 6.4%. This was driven by an 80 basis point increase in occupancy versus prior year and 2.9% growth in rates. 
We also experienced a 40 basis point increase in sequential occupancy while the industry remained flat. Our overall triple-net portfolio coverage will improve to 1.34x on an EBITDAR basis and 1.13x on an EBITDAR basis with the sale and transition of Brookdale communities mentioned previously. 
The overall senior housing industry continues to be impacted by new supply in many markets, and in the case of Brookdale, there's the added complexity of their scale and still finding CLECs [ph] 1 year post integration and 2 years post merger while navigating oversupply. Based on a new inventory peak in 2016 and declining construction starts, 2017 should bear the brunt of the supply pressure. 
It's important to note that with the planned asset sales and Brookdale lease restructure mentioned earlier, we have significant cushion to absorb any impact to the lease coverage. Also, the Brookdale triple-net portfolio that we retain following the asset sales will have far less exposure to new supply. Although 60% of our SHOP portfolio is represented by independent living and CCRC communities, which are far less impacted by new supply. In summary, HCP is very well positioned relative to the new supply issue.
As Mike mentioned, we have enhanced our supplemental with additional disclosures across each of our segments. For senior housing, we have included a new supply schedule related to our triple-net portfolio, similar to the SHOP schedule. And we are now disclosing new supply for independent living and CCRCs separate from assisted living for both SHOP and triple-net. We have also added an affordability metric and a qualified caregiver percentage by market, both of which we view as key demand drivers.
Turning to life science. Our same-store portfolio is 97% leased, and we are proud to announce another strong quarter of same-store cash NOI growth of 8.8%. Yesterday, we made an exciting announcement regarding the Cove development, which is located at the epicenter of South San Francisco's life science cluster. Phase 1 is now 73% leased, and we have pre-leased half of Phase 2 to AstraZeneca, who will join the campus in the fourth quarter of 2017. They are leasing 116,000 square feet, allowing the company to consolidate operations and research throughout the Bay Area. 
In response to our leasing success for Phases 1 and 2 and continued strong demand from life science users in South San Francisco, we are commencing the development of Phase 3, which adds 2 Class A buildings, totaling up to 336,000 square feet. Construction will commence next year with planned deliveries throughout the second half of 2018. The total cost of the project is estimated at $211 million. Upon completion, the Cove will be a 1 million-square-foot pre-certified LEED Silver, fully integrated waterfront life science campus with 7 buildings.
Our medical office portfolio maintains strong occupancy of 92% with cash NOI same-store growth this quarter of 3.1%. 95% of our portfolio is affiliated with over 200 hospitals and health systems and 83% is located on campus. As a result, tenant retention remains high at nearly 78%. We currently have 4 on-campus ground-up MOB development projects underway, which are 63% pre-leased.
Now let me give you a preliminary 2017 outlook for cash SPP for each of our reported segments, which have been redefined. We expect overall same-store cash NOI growth to range from 2.5% to 3.5%; for senior housing triple-net, 3.25% to 4.25%, driven by contractual rent escalators and rent on capital expenditures; for SHOP, 4% to 5%, driven by rate increases and growth from capital investments; for life science, 1.7% to 2.7%, which is primarily driven by contractual rent escalators, partially offset by projected rent abatements and downtime on expiring leases. 
For medical office, we expect steady performance in the 2% to 3% range. And lastly, our other segment, which now includes hospitals, our U.K. real estate and all of our debt investments. For cash SPP, which would only include hospitals and U.K. real estate, we are expecting 0.75% to 1.75% growth, reflecting a contractual rent reduction for one of our acute-care hospitals. Overall, we have a healthy performance outlook for the near term across our segments.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Tom to walk you through our preliminary 2017 outlook for the overall company."

Please reference the presentation we posted on our website. Starting on Slide 1. As Mike mentioned earlier, we have made substantial progress towards accomplishing all of our near-term strategic priorities.
Turning to Slide 2. Post the spin, HCP is a $20-plus billion enterprise, generating $1.3 billion of income from our diversified portfolio with 4 core segments: senior housing triple-net, SHOP, medical office, and life science. We believe our upgraded portfolio mix, which is 94% private pay concentrated in top 50 MSAs, supported by above-average population growth, is one of the best in the sector.
Onto the next slide, Slide 3. We have highlighted our key relationships and the portfolio strength of each of our core segments.
Slide 4 outlines how we're improving our Brookdale triple-net portfolio with higher coverage and improved portfolio quality, as Justin just took you through.
Turning to Slides 5 and 6. Earlier, I talked about our 2016 guidance, which includes 10 months of HoldCo and 2 months post spin, which is summarized in the first column on Slide 5. In the second column, we have provided the 2016 pro forma FFO as adjusted run rate of $1.92 per share. As you can see from the bridge on Slide 6, it is computed from our 2016 guidance adjusted for the following items as if they occurred on January 1, 2016: the QCP spin, the sale of the 64 Brookdale triple-net assets and the RIDEA 2 transaction, offset in part by the use of proceeds principally to pay down debt. 
The 2016 run rate of $1.92 per share represents a good jumping off point to compare to our 2017 outlook and represents an earnings reset in exchange for: a vastly upgraded portfolio, reinforcing stability and organic growth with 94% private pay revenue sources; reduced Brookdale concentration with strong coverage levels and more diversified relationships; and an improving investment grade balance sheet with ample liquidity and no significant debt maturities through the end of 2018. 
Back to Slide 5. In the far right column, we have provided our 2017 preliminary outlook for FFO as adjusted of $1.92 per share at the midpoint, which is flat to our 2016 run rate.
Please now turn to Slide 7. This slide provides a summarized roll forward of our FFO as adjusted from our 2016 run rate to our 2017 outlook. You'll note the roll forward includes: SPP NOI growth of $0.05 per share, combined with $0.02 per share of development earn-in from existing committed projects results in projected organic growth and development earn-in of $0.07 per share. This growth is offset by various items, including incremental drag from commencing the Cove Phase 3 and other plant redevelopments, the exercise of purchase options by Genentech and Tenet and several other small items. I'll note the outlook is preliminary as we are currently going through the process of developing our detailed budget for 2017, and we'll provide our finalized guidance on our next earnings call in February.
And our preliminary 2017 outlook assumes a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, consistent with our fourth quarter 2016 dividend announced this morning.
Turning to Slide 8. This slide summarizes the anticipated use of gross proceeds from the 3 transactions that will generate approximately $3.35 billion: first, $1.75 billion of financing proceeds associated with the spin; second, $470 million of proceeds from the RIDEA 2 transaction, which is on track to close this quarter; and third, $1.125 billion of Brookdale asset sales that are exported to be completed during the first quarter of 2017. With these proceeds, we plan to pay down $3.15 billion of bonds, mortgage debt and revolver balances with a blended rate of 5.2%. The remaining proceeds will be used to cover the spin transaction and debt prepayment costs totaling $200 million.
Turning to Slide 9. Upon completing all these transactions, HCP will have a much stronger balance sheet, with minimal debt maturities through the end of 2018. 
As highlighted on Slide 10, we are on track to outperform our financing plans set forth upon announcing the spin in May and are now targeting better credit metrics than initially anticipated. By the end of 2017, we anticipate a target net debt to EBITDA in the low to mid-6x range and a target financial leverage in the 43% to 44% range. 
In October, S&P reaffirmed our BBB ratings and Fitch also reaffirmed our BBB rating while improving our outlook to stable. We have the goal of reducing leverage further and regaining Baa1, BBB+ ratings over time.
And finally, Slide 11 provides our key takeaways on what differentiates HCP 3.0. We have a higher quality of private pay portfolio, strong coverage levels on our triple-net portfolio and improved tenant concentration. We have an investment-grade balance sheet backed by an upgraded portfolio of ample liquidity and no significant near-term debt maturities. And our improved senior housing portfolio, premier life science and on-campus medical office platforms will continue to generate strong and steady returns. 
So in summary, we have made enormous progress on multiple fronts and are truly excited about our future prospects. I will now turn the call back to our operator for the Q&A session. Kerry?"

If you want to look at what's remaining in the portfolio, you'll note on Slide 4 some highlights of the performance of the assets that we kept, the type of markets they're in. There's an upgrade, we think, in terms of just performance in regards to what we're keeping. I'll even share some market commentary with you if you want to look at a recent market comp would be the transaction we just closed with Mid-Atlantic. That was a purchased that at a T12 [ph] basis at a 5.8% [ph] cap. We're expecting about a 6.6% [ph] in year 1. Year 3 could be an 8% cap based on our projections. Class A senior housing is mid- to high 5s. And B+ is around low 6s. So if you consider all of that feedback and take a hard look at what we've kept versus what we sold, I think that helps you to rationalize the pricing."

We may add 1 to 2, maybe 3 operators from this portfolio and from the portfolio of 8 assets that we mentioned as well. So it was a win-win, we think. It cleared off some assets that were not performing as well for Brookdale. We retained some rent. We'll sell the assets, we're estimating, could be $160 million, $170 million in total value, and that's how we get to our low 6% cap rate range on those assets.

Yes, we would intend to delever carefully over time primarily through over-equitizing acquisitions that we would make. So as we think about dispositions, there's some of that, that there will be obviously some recycling that occurs every year. But as far as future growth, it's going to be based on us looking at our cost of capital, making sure that we have identified asset acquisitions or portfolio acquisitions that fit squarely into our strategy. And then we have the proper funding to get that done on an accretive basis, and it will be our intent to over-equitize those purchases, which would then bring our credit metrics back toward BBB+ over time. And we'll do it patiently. And we're thinking that could be a 2-, 3-year period but it could be longer or shorter, we'll see, but that's how we intend to go at it."

We've spent an enormous amount of time in the last few months or more getting to today. This is an important day. It's a chance now to pivot to investments, growth and so forth.

We hope and expect to earn the market's trust to reflect the multiple in our stock price that turns the [indiscernible] now to growth. We certainly have some relationships embedded in our portfolios, whether they're large networks or other providers in the spaces that we're highlighting that we're anxious to start to renew our cultivation. We have the relationships but they know that we've had to be very cautious. So I think the emphasis that you're going to start hearing from us is more about pipeline, more about investment thesis, strategic direction. We won't be talking about HCR Manorcare and some of the things that we've had to deal with in the past. But I think that's probably more suited for a few more weeks from now while we kind of get stabilized here and then can give you something that's pretty tangible.

I think we noted earlier a strong priority, as we manage our capital raises, our balance sheet and our investments, is to migrate as quickly as possible back to BBB+ and we've got a clear path to do that. So one thing in picking those numbers wasn't to set that as hard and fast, but it was an objective to kind of line up the various guidelines that we need to talk with the rating agencies about. So I don't want to put too hard and fast a point on that range. Having said that, as of -- as we consummate the deals that we are now under contract with and moving forward, the quality of what we've got here is pretty good. And senior housing is a space that all of the health care REITs are going to be invested in. And senior housing, as you know, has a number of different segments to it. So we're very focused. One of the things that we've emphasized in the past is, as we've had Justin join our team, Kai Hsiao and others that are deep and wide in this space, we've got to be very wise about what parts of the senior housing space we invest in and what we hold in our portfolio. But right now, we feel good about where we are. We can still work around the margins. We're much more influenced now by RIDEA than triple-net, and that gives us a seat at the table in terms of CapEx and operations and the like that triple-net doesn't. And so some of that management talent that we've invested can kind of go to work under that umbrella. So again, more than almost anybody in the world, we're going to be monitoring and working closely with Brookdale for obvious reasons. But we feel pretty good where we sit today."

We're more interested in the ancillary part and the private pay part of the business. In terms of international, we're just being cautious at this point. The couple of relationships we have over there are strong. Brexit and the sterling and so forth are certainly things to watch, labor costs and even the nursing shortages. It's pretty well documented that there are challenges over there. But on the other hand, the demographics are even better than in the U.S., and that the health care system in the U.K. is not as segmented or stratified as it is here. So if you're not in the hospital and you're not home, there's not a lot of intermediate opportunities. So we think that there's a lot of activity going on over there. It's going to sort out over time, but it is an early-stage market when it comes to some of the kind of things that we invest in.

Generally, the market over there is a 6% to 7% cap rate market for the kind of care homes that we're in. I think you have to look at the market kind of again in its different segments. There's the super prime luxury. That is not a segment that's performing well. I think some people overbuilt and overshot in terms of what their strategic focus was. And then some of the smaller mom-and-pops are not doing well, and it is a market where there is a significant number of smaller players. And the reason that they're not doing as well -- but the middle segment where Maria Mallaband and HC-One are in is what we call the prime market. So that's a nice solid good product to an upper middle class type of constituency. And not only is the private pay market able to do well in that segment, also the local authorities who supplement some of the costs have targeted the prime market, that upper middle type of market. It's not a value market, it's a prime market but it's not super prime. But the reason that the local authorities think of counties and states here but are willing to support it is because they think they get good value and get good return for supporting it. And they think that some of the smaller players aren't as efficient and don't give them the best value for their regulated dollar. So our focus has been in that prime market. We still think that it's the place to be. So like any segment in any country or region, you kind of got to go down a little bit to put a value on it. And I think the short answer to your question, Rich, is it's a 6% to 7% cap rate market, but we would say some segments are certainly doing better than others. And some of the segments, especially the prime, are able to absorb the labor costs and some of the issues because they're getting good support not only from a fairly affluent country with not a lot of options in the continuum of care and they're getting good government support. So that's our view."

The third quarter occupancy was at 89.8% [ph] so the 3-year average but within that, independent living was at a 7-year high. Construction starts were slowing in the second half of the year. Rent growth is the highest it's been since 2007, and there's been a little less transaction volume overall, as you know. So if you think about that and look at the backdrop, you would expect in the sector that there would be, in '17, some absorption occurring within assisted living. It seems like that '17 could carry the brunt of the new supply issue as it pertains to assisted living, as it pertains to markets actually have a new supply impact. When we stepped back and looked at our portfolio, one thing, just by simply reducing the size of our triple-net, we've reduced exposure within our triple-net portfolio of new supply. Our triple-net portfolio is 70% assisted living. The remainder is independent living and CCRC, so that there's less impact in those asset classes. I mentioned the SHOP exposure we have. And so there's -- we feel that we'll be less impacted than the general industry because of the segments that we're in, independent living CCRC and then some impact in assisted living but it's all been factored into our outlook."

There could be some other subordinated debt used as well. But it's not going to be a primary focus. It will be substantially less than it was in the past. And the goal and intent moving forward is to be an owner of high-quality real estate. In regards to the -- there was -- with regards to the hospital rent cut, there was a contractual rent cut that had been in place for a number of years. Our team was able to renegotiate that and spread it over a 3-year period so as to lessen the impact.

This is the first day in almost 6 years that I haven't been a fiduciary of a company heavily invested in HCR ManorCare. It's kind of a different experience. I think in a general sense, what Mark has said is that he will and his board will be talking about their dividend right away and be announcing where they want to come out. I think he signaled that you should look at it as a modest dividend in the early quarters because they think it's prudent to take some of the rent that they collect and create some cash reserves and balance just to be in a strong a position as they can be. But he totally recognizes he is a REIT and dividends are important. But it will be, I think, a process that occurs not right out of the gate but it will build up as they work through. And I think he's also signaled that he expects to have a pretty active dialogue and possibly negotiation with HCR ManorCare in the early days of his company. So all of that will play in. It will be a time where, I'm sure as he's already said in his road show, that he can't be pretty definitive at this point. It would be like going to the Super Bowl and giving your opponent your defensive and offensive game plan before you play the game. And so I think you're going to have to be a little patient with some of that. His board that I mentioned in my earlier remarks is a very seasoned board. They'll look out for the shareholders very well, a good bit of REIT experience on that board and people that I think you know and can trust will be doing the right thing. But we don't know the answer to that. It's up now to their board so we'll kind of have to leave it at that and wish them well."

Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On our last earnings call, I gave you 5 goals that we were focused on: to execute the spinoff of HCR ManorCare's portfolio; to reduce and improve our Brookdale concentration; to improve our balance sheet metrics; to become a leader in transparency and clarity; and to establish the next generation of leadership for HCP 3.0. As you know, we are very pleased to have completed the spin transaction yesterday, creating a new publicly listed company called Quality Care Properties or QCP.
QCP's primary holdings are the real estate facilities operated by HCR ManorCare. QCP's principal objective at the outset will be to take the necessary steps over time to realize the embedded value in these assets, value that we believe has not been recognized in recent months and years in the stock valuation of HCP. We wish Mark Ordan, QCP's CEO, and his team the very best as he launches this new company.
We're also delighted that QCP has a world-class Board of Directors to oversee its business strategy and governance. Joining Mark on the board will be Don Wood, CEO of Federal Realty; Glenn Cohen, CFO of Kimco Realty; Paul Klaassen, co-Founder and former Chairman of Sunrise Senior Living; Kathy Smalley, a partner at the law firm of Locke Lord and the former General Counsel of Trammell Crow, and Catellus; Bill Schimmel [ph], recently retired from KPMG, having served as lead audit partner for such clients as Apple, General Dynamics, and Tenet Healthcare; and Jerry Doctrow, well known to many of you from his days as a leading health care analyst at Stifel, and Legg Mason. QCP will be in excellent hands. 
Yesterday, we repatriated from QCP to HCP the net proceeds from the $1.75 billion financing we recently raised. We also have announced that we are under contract to sell 64 Brookdale properties to a venture formed by Blackstone and Columbia Pacific for $1.125 billion. We are also well on our way to completing the previously announced RIDEA 2 transaction with Columbia Pacific and the sale or transfer of 25 other Brookdale triple-net properties.
In the aggregate, we have taken a major step in reducing our Brookdale concentration from 35% immediately post spin to 27%, and of note, the 10% concentration for the triple-net assets. I'm also pleased to report that when these transactions close, the aggregate lease coverage of the remaining Brookdale triple-net assets held by HCP significantly improves to 1.21x on a pro forma trailing basis.
Our current objective is to further reduce our Brookdale concentration to between 20% and 25% over a reasonable period of time. The combined proceeds from QCP financing and Brookdale transactions will be used by HCP to pay off our line of credit and substantially all other debt maturities through the end of 2018. Once completed, this will result in a much improved balance sheet profile. As we will explain in greater detail, these actions have stabilized our balance sheet, with metrics solidly in the BBB territory and provide a clear path ahead to return to BBB+.
And as to our fourth goal around transparency and clarity, you see today a revamped and enhanced supplemental report for the third quarter 2016 and moving forward. This is one tangible expression of our commitment around providing improved transparency. 
As to our fifth goal, establishing the next generation of leadership for HCP 3.0, I will be prepared to be very specific about our plans in the coming weeks and certainly before year-end.
It has been a complex and multifaceted journey since we announced a general direction along these lines last May. With the completed spin, the successful spin financing, the announced asset sales and the team that is being assembled, we have reset the company with a stable foundation and an ability going forward to grow prudently and in an accretive manner. 
HCP moving forward is in the strongest position it has been in for years. 94% private pay, a vastly improved balance sheet with plans in place for further improvement, crown jewels in our life science and medical properties portfolios and an improving and more diversified senior housing platform.
It is no surprise that all of these achievements have come with a cost. To position HCP for the future and create QCP to realize value over time, we have incurred costs, fees, prepayment charges, dilutive dispositions of noncore assets and the like. We have incurred these costs in order to achieve this onetime reset and to come out of this process with the strongest HCP possible, HCP 3.0.
So today, we will be giving a preliminary outlook for 2017. We will provide details on how we have reset our dividend and metrics as the foundation for moving forward.

For the third quarter, our portfolio performed in line with our expectations, reported FFO as adjusted of $0.72 per share and NAREIT FFO of $0.65 per share. These results included a $0.01 gain in the quarter for monetizing a participating development loan in our senior housing segment. 
NAREIT FFO is impacted by $0.04 per share of spin transaction-related costs and $0.03 per share of previously announced severance-related charges. Note that we're no longer reporting or providing guidance for FAD on a per share basis in light of the SEC's recent focus on FAD per share as a liquidity measure. Although we are no longer reporting FAD per share, we will continue to provide total FAD and its related components.
For same-store performance beginning this quarter, we're now including the pro rata contribution from unconsolidated joint ventures in our same-store reporting convention to provide increased transparency in our portfolio performance. For the quarter, HCP generated solid year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth of 3.1%, excluding the QCP assets.
Now turning to our full year 2016 guidance. We are updating our guidance to reflect the spin transaction closed yesterday. Accordingly, it represents 10 months of HoldCo and 2 months of RemainCo post-spin. The net impact of the spin for the 2-month period equates to approximately $0.15 per share and is reflected in our updated guidance. 
We continue to have strong performance from all our core segments and expect our full year FFO as adjusted per share to range from $2.69 to $2.75, inclusive of the $0.04 of year-to-date gains from monetizing 3 senior housing development loans. We expect full year 2016 FFO -- NAREIT FFO to range from $2.35 to $2.41 per share, impacted by $0.34 of onetime costs, of which $0.18 relates to spin transaction costs, $0.10 of debt prepayment costs resulting from the spin, $0.03 of other transaction costs and $0.03 of previously announced severance-related charges.
Also, excluding QCP, we are projecting full year 2016 same-store cash NOI to range from 2.75% to 3.75%. Finally, our upcoming dividend. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per share to be paid on November 25, 2016. The new dividend reflects our outlook, which I will discuss in a few minutes.
Now I will turn the call over to Justin to take you through our Brookdale transactions and operating highlights."

I'll start with a few more details on our strategic Brookdale transactions, then I'll review our recent investments and third quarter performance. And lastly, I'll provide a preliminary outlook for our 2017 same-property performance for each of our sectors.
Starting with the Brookdale transactions. This morning, we announced that we entered into definitive agreements to sell 64 communities that are leased to Brookdale for $1.125 billion to Blackstone and Columbia Pacific Advisors, representing a trailing 12-month lease yield of 8%, and we expect it to close in the first quarter of 2017. The portfolio had an occupancy of 85.2% for the third quarter and lease coverage of 0.81x for the trailing 12 months through September. 
In addition, we will sell or transition 25 triple-net assets that are nonstrategic to both HCP and Brookdale within the next 12 months. These assets had an occupancy of 79.9% for the third quarter and lease coverage of 0.52x for the trailing 12 months through September. 
Also in Q4, we expect to transfer 8 expiring Brookdale leases to RIDEA structures, 4 with Brookdale and 4 with a new operator. We are pleased to announce the asset sales and lease restructure as key components of our transition to HCP 3.0. These combined initiatives were mutually beneficial while enabling HCP to address several important strategic priorities, including reducing our Brookdale concentration, improving the lease coverage of our triple-net senior housing portfolio and diversifying our operator relationships. Additionally, we were able to achieve market pricing on the 64 assets validated through a competitive bidding process. The transaction significantly improves the overall quality of our retained portfolio.
Specifically, we are reducing a major tenant concentration from 35% immediately post-spin to 27% once these transactions are complete. I'll also note that our triple-net exposure to Brookdale reduces from 16% of our total portfolio concentration to 10%.
The lease coverage for our Brookdale triple-net portfolio will improve by 19 basis points on a pro forma basis to 1.21x on a trailing 12-month basis. And the quality of our Brookdale triple-net portfolio will improve significantly, with occupancy increasing by 260 basis points to 89.1%. Furthermore, the retained Brookdale portfolio is located in stronger markets represented by a better overall demographics profile as shown on Slide 4 in our presentation deck. 
We value our relationship with Brookdale and look forward to our continued work together, positioning our portfolio for success. Additionally, we will diversify relationships by adding 2 to 3 new operators in conjunction with transitioning communities from Brookdale.
Moving on to our investments. In September, we completed the previously announced acquisition of 7 private pay senior housing communities for $186 million, welcoming a new operator partner to our SHOP platform, Senior Lifestyle Corporation. This marks the sixth new relationship that we've added to our senior housing portfolio this year. 
Now let me highlight a few things on our third quarter performance. We continue to see growth in our SHOP platform, which delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 3.3% for 120 communities, bringing our year-to-date growth to 6.4%. This was driven by an 80 basis point increase in occupancy versus prior year and 2.9% growth in rates. 
We also experienced a 40 basis point increase in sequential occupancy while the industry remained flat. Our overall triple-net portfolio coverage will improve to 1.34x on an EBITDAR basis and 1.13x on an EBITDAR basis with the sale and transition of Brookdale communities mentioned previously. 
The overall senior housing industry continues to be impacted by new supply in many markets, and in the case of Brookdale, there's the added complexity of their scale and still finding CLECs [ph] 1 year post integration and 2 years post merger while navigating oversupply. Based on a new inventory peak in 2016 and declining construction starts, 2017 should bear the brunt of the supply pressure. 
It's important to note that with the planned asset sales and Brookdale lease restructure mentioned earlier, we have significant cushion to absorb any impact to the lease coverage. Also, the Brookdale triple-net portfolio that we retain following the asset sales will have far less exposure to new supply. Although 60% of our SHOP portfolio is represented by independent living and CCRC communities, which are far less impacted by new supply. In summary, HCP is very well positioned relative to the new supply issue.
As Mike mentioned, we have enhanced our supplemental with additional disclosures across each of our segments. For senior housing, we have included a new supply schedule related to our triple-net portfolio, similar to the SHOP schedule. And we are now disclosing new supply for independent living and CCRCs separate from assisted living for both SHOP and triple-net. We have also added an affordability metric and a qualified caregiver percentage by market, both of which we view as key demand drivers.
Turning to life science. Our same-store portfolio is 97% leased, and we are proud to announce another strong quarter of same-store cash NOI growth of 8.8%. Yesterday, we made an exciting announcement regarding the Cove development, which is located at the epicenter of South San Francisco's life science cluster. Phase 1 is now 73% leased, and we have pre-leased half of Phase 2 to AstraZeneca, who will join the campus in the fourth quarter of 2017. They are leasing 116,000 square feet, allowing the company to consolidate operations and research throughout the Bay Area. 
In response to our leasing success for Phases 1 and 2 and continued strong demand from life science users in South San Francisco, we are commencing the development of Phase 3, which adds 2 Class A buildings, totaling up to 336,000 square feet. Construction will commence next year with planned deliveries throughout the second half of 2018. The total cost of the project is estimated at $211 million. Upon completion, the Cove will be a 1 million-square-foot pre-certified LEED Silver, fully integrated waterfront life science campus with 7 buildings.
Our medical office portfolio maintains strong occupancy of 92% with cash NOI same-store growth this quarter of 3.1%. 95% of our portfolio is affiliated with over 200 hospitals and health systems and 83% is located on campus. As a result, tenant retention remains high at nearly 78%. We currently have 4 on-campus ground-up MOB development projects underway, which are 63% pre-leased.
Now let me give you a preliminary 2017 outlook for cash SPP for each of our reported segments, which have been redefined. We expect overall same-store cash NOI growth to range from 2.5% to 3.5%; for senior housing triple-net, 3.25% to 4.25%, driven by contractual rent escalators and rent on capital expenditures; for SHOP, 4% to 5%, driven by rate increases and growth from capital investments; for life science, 1.7% to 2.7%, which is primarily driven by contractual rent escalators, partially offset by projected rent abatements and downtime on expiring leases. 
For medical office, we expect steady performance in the 2% to 3% range. And lastly, our other segment, which now includes hospitals, our U.K. real estate and all of our debt investments. For cash SPP, which would only include hospitals and U.K. real estate, we are expecting 0.75% to 1.75% growth, reflecting a contractual rent reduction for one of our acute-care hospitals. Overall, we have a healthy performance outlook for the near term across our segments.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Tom to walk you through our preliminary 2017 outlook for the overall company."

Please reference the presentation we posted on our website. Starting on Slide 1. As Mike mentioned earlier, we have made substantial progress towards accomplishing all of our near-term strategic priorities.
Turning to Slide 2. Post the spin, HCP is a $20-plus billion enterprise, generating $1.3 billion of income from our diversified portfolio with 4 core segments: senior housing triple-net, SHOP, medical office, and life science. We believe our upgraded portfolio mix, which is 94% private pay concentrated in top 50 MSAs, supported by above-average population growth, is one of the best in the sector.
Onto the next slide, Slide 3. We have highlighted our key relationships and the portfolio strength of each of our core segments.
Slide 4 outlines how we're improving our Brookdale triple-net portfolio with higher coverage and improved portfolio quality, as Justin just took you through.
Turning to Slides 5 and 6. Earlier, I talked about our 2016 guidance, which includes 10 months of HoldCo and 2 months post spin, which is summarized in the first column on Slide 5. In the second column, we have provided the 2016 pro forma FFO as adjusted run rate of $1.92 per share. As you can see from the bridge on Slide 6, it is computed from our 2016 guidance adjusted for the following items as if they occurred on January 1, 2016: the QCP spin, the sale of the 64 Brookdale triple-net assets and the RIDEA 2 transaction, offset in part by the use of proceeds principally to pay down debt. 
The 2016 run rate of $1.92 per share represents a good jumping off point to compare to our 2017 outlook and represents an earnings reset in exchange for: a vastly upgraded portfolio, reinforcing stability and organic growth with 94% private pay revenue sources; reduced Brookdale concentration with strong coverage levels and more diversified relationships; and an improving investment grade balance sheet with ample liquidity and no significant debt maturities through the end of 2018. 
Back to Slide 5. In the far right column, we have provided our 2017 preliminary outlook for FFO as adjusted of $1.92 per share at the midpoint, which is flat to our 2016 run rate.
Please now turn to Slide 7. This slide provides a summarized roll forward of our FFO as adjusted from our 2016 run rate to our 2017 outlook. You'll note the roll forward includes: SPP NOI growth of $0.05 per share, combined with $0.02 per share of development earn-in from existing committed projects results in projected organic growth and development earn-in of $0.07 per share. This growth is offset by various items, including incremental drag from commencing the Cove Phase 3 and other plant redevelopments, the exercise of purchase options by Genentech and Tenet and several other small items. I'll note the outlook is preliminary as we are currently going through the process of developing our detailed budget for 2017, and we'll provide our finalized guidance on our next earnings call in February.
And our preliminary 2017 outlook assumes a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, consistent with our fourth quarter 2016 dividend announced this morning.
Turning to Slide 8. This slide summarizes the anticipated use of gross proceeds from the 3 transactions that will generate approximately $3.35 billion: first, $1.75 billion of financing proceeds associated with the spin; second, $470 million of proceeds from the RIDEA 2 transaction, which is on track to close this quarter; and third, $1.125 billion of Brookdale asset sales that are exported to be completed during the first quarter of 2017. With these proceeds, we plan to pay down $3.15 billion of bonds, mortgage debt and revolver balances with a blended rate of 5.2%. The remaining proceeds will be used to cover the spin transaction and debt prepayment costs totaling $200 million.
Turning to Slide 9. Upon completing all these transactions, HCP will have a much stronger balance sheet, with minimal debt maturities through the end of 2018. 
As highlighted on Slide 10, we are on track to outperform our financing plans set forth upon announcing the spin in May and are now targeting better credit metrics than initially anticipated. By the end of 2017, we anticipate a target net debt to EBITDA in the low to mid-6x range and a target financial leverage in the 43% to 44% range. 
In October, S&P reaffirmed our BBB ratings and Fitch also reaffirmed our BBB rating while improving our outlook to stable. We have the goal of reducing leverage further and regaining Baa1, BBB+ ratings over time.
And finally, Slide 11 provides our key takeaways on what differentiates HCP 3.0. We have a higher quality of private pay portfolio, strong coverage levels on our triple-net portfolio and improved tenant concentration. We have an investment-grade balance sheet backed by an upgraded portfolio of ample liquidity and no significant near-term debt maturities. And our improved senior housing portfolio, premier life science and on-campus medical office platforms will continue to generate strong and steady returns. 
So in summary, we have made enormous progress on multiple fronts and are truly excited about our future prospects. I will now turn the call back to our operator for the Q&A session. Kerry?"

There's an upgrade, we think, in terms of just performance in regards to what we're keeping. I'll even share some market commentary with you if you want to look at a recent market comp would be the transaction we just closed with Mid-Atlantic. That was purchased at a T12 [ph] basis at a 5.8% cap. We're expecting about a 6.6% in year 1. Year 3 could be an 8% cap based on our projections. Class A senior housing is mid- to high 5s. And B+ is around low 6s. So if you consider all of that feedback and take a hard look at what we've kept versus what we sold, I think that helps you to rationalize the pricing."

It cleared off some assets that were not performing as well for Brookdale. We retained some rent. We'll sell the assets, we're estimating, could be $160 million, $170 million in total value, and that's how we get to our low 6% cap rate range on those assets. So we're -- there's some flexibility in terms of what we do moving forward but I think I've stated our general intentions."

I would also point to -- there's about 190 units that were out of commission in '16. They were being repurposed. They were -- they will open in '17 and they'll be repurposed, in some cases, to independent living, memory care, assisted living, even a little bit of subacute.

We certainly have some relationships embedded in our portfolios, whether they're large networks or other providers in the spaces that we're highlighting that we're anxious to start to renew our cultivation.

I think we noted earlier a strong priority, as we manage our capital raises, our balance sheet and our investments, is to migrate as quickly as possible back to BBB+ and we've got a clear path to do that. So one thing in picking those numbers wasn't to set that as hard and fast, but it was an objective to kind of line up the various guidelines that we need to talk with the rating agencies about. So I don't want to put too hard and fast a point on that range. Having said that, as of -- as we consummate the deals that we are now under contract with and moving forward, the quality of what we've got here is pretty good. And senior housing is a space that all of the health care REITs are going to be invested in. And senior housing, as you know, has a number of different segments to it. So we're very focused. One of the things that we've emphasized in the past is, as we've had Justin join our team, Kai Hsiao and others that are deep and wide in this space, we've got to be very wise about what parts of the senior housing space we invest in and what we hold in our portfolio. But right now, we feel good about where we are. We can still work around the margins. We're much more influenced now by RIDEA than triple-net, and that gives us a seat at the table in terms of CapEx and operations and the like that triple-net doesn't. And so some of that management talent that we've invested in can kind of go to work under that umbrella. So again, more than almost anybody in the world, we're going to be monitoring and working closely with Brookdale for obvious reasons. But we feel pretty good where we sit today."

We're more interested in the ancillary part and the private pay part of the business. In terms of international, we're just being cautious at this point. The couple of relationships we have over there are strong. Brexit and the sterling and so forth are certainly things to watch, labor costs and even the nursing shortages. It's pretty well documented that there are challenges over there. But on the other hand, the demographics are even better than in the U.S., and the health care system in the U.K. is not as segmented or stratified as it is here. So if you're not in the hospital and you're not home, there's not a lot of intermediate opportunities. So we think that there's a lot of activity going on over there. It's going to sort out over time, but it is an early-stage market when it comes to some of the kind of things that we invest in.

Generally, the market over there is a 6% to 7% cap rate market for the kind of care homes that we're in. I think you have to look at the market kind of -- again in its different segments. There's the super prime luxury. That is not a segment that's performing well. I think some people overbuilt and overshot in terms of what their strategic focus was. And then some of the smaller mom-and-pops are not doing well, and it is a market where there is a significant number of smaller players. And the reason that they're not doing as well -- but the middle segment where Maria Mallaband and HC-One are in is what we call the prime market. So that's a nice solid good product to an upper middle class type of constituency. And not only is the private pay market able to do well in that segment, also the local authorities who supplement some of the costs have targeted the prime market, that upper middle type of market. It's not a value market, it's a prime market but it's not super prime. But the reason that the local authorities think of counties and states here but are willing to support it is because they think they get good value and get good return for supporting it. And they think that some of the smaller players aren't as efficient and don't give them the best value for their regulated dollar. So our focus has been in that prime market. We still think that it's the place to be. So like any segment in any country or region, you kind of got to go down a little bit to put a value on it. And I think the short answer to your question, Rich, is it's a 6% to 7% cap rate market, but we would say some segments are certainly doing better than others. And some of the segments, especially the prime, are able to absorb the labor costs and some of the issues because they're getting good support not only from a fairly affluent country with not a lot of options in the continuum of care and they're getting good government support. So that's our view."

The third quarter occupancy was at 89.8% so the 3-year average but within that, independent living was at a 7-year high. Construction starts were slowing in the second half of the year. Rent growth is the highest it's been since 2007, and there's been a little less transaction volume overall, as you know. So if you think about that and look at the backdrop, you would expect in the sector that there would be, in '17, some absorption occurring within assisted living. It seems like that '17 could carry the brunt of the new supply issue as it pertains to assisted living, as it pertains to markets actually have a new supply impact. When we stepped back and looked at our portfolio, one thing, just by simply reducing the size of our triple-net, we've reduced exposure within our triple-net portfolio of new supply. Our triple-net portfolio is 70% assisted living. The remainder is independent living and CCRC, so that there's less impact in those asset classes. I mentioned the SHOP exposure we have. And so there's -- we feel that we'll be less impacted than the general industry because of the segments that we're in, independent living, CCRC, and then some impact in assisted living but it's all been factored into our outlook."

And the goal and intent moving forward is to be an owner of high-quality real estate. In regards to the -- there was -- with regards to the hospital rent cut, there was a contractual rent cut that had been in place for a number of years.

But as Justin said several times, this -- we're pretty active in our asset management, we'll continue to be, and we're glad that we've got a good working relationship with Brookdale, which even gives us further insight than just being a landlord or, in some cases, a partner in the RIDEA."

This is the first day in almost 6 years that I haven't been a fiduciary of a company heavily invested in HCR ManorCare. It's kind of a different experience. I think in a general sense, what Mark has said is that he will and his board will be talking about their dividend right away and be announcing where they want to come out. I think he signaled that you should look at it as a modest dividend in the early quarters because they think it's prudent to take some of the rent that they collect and create some cash reserves and balance just to be in a strong a position as they can be. But he totally recognizes he is a REIT and dividends are important. But it will be, I think, a process that occurs not right out of the gate but it will build up as they work through. And I think he's also signaled that he expects to have a pretty active dialogue and possibly negotiation with HCR ManorCare in the early days of his company. So all of that will play in. It will be a time where, I'm sure, as he's already said in his road show, that he can't be pretty definitive at this point. It would be like going into the Super Bowl and giving your opponent your defensive and offensive game plan before you play the game. And so I think you're going to have to be a little patient with some of that. His board, that I mentioned in my earlier remarks, is a very seasoned board. They'll look out for their shareholders very well, a good bit of REIT experience on that board and people that, I think you know and can trust, will be doing the right thing. But we don't know the answer to that. It's up now to their board so we'll kind of have to leave it at that and wish them well."

Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On our last earnings call, I gave you 5 goals that we were focused on: to execute the spinoff of HCR ManorCare's portfolio; to reduce and improve our Brookdale concentration; to improve our balance sheet metrics; to become a leader in transparency and clarity; and to establish the next generation of leadership for HCP 3.0. As you know, we are very pleased to have completed the spin transaction yesterday, creating a new publicly listed company called Quality Care Properties or QCP.
QCP's primary holdings are the real estate facilities operated by HCR ManorCare. QCP's principal objective at the outset will be to take the necessary steps over time to realize the embedded value in these assets, value that we believe has not been recognized in recent months and years in the stock valuation of HCP. We wish Mark Ordan, QCP's CEO, and his team the very best as he launches this new company.
We're also delighted that QCP has a world-class Board of Directors to oversee its business strategy and governance. Joining Mark on the board will be Don Wood, CEO of Federal Realty; Glenn Cohen, CFO of Kimco Realty; Paul Klaassen, co-Founder and former Chairman of Sunrise Senior Living; Kathy Smalley, a partner at the law firm of Locke Lord and the former General Counsel of Trammell Crow, and Catellus; Bill Schimmel [ph], recently retired from KPMG, having served as lead audit partner for such clients as Apple, General Dynamics, and Tenet Healthcare; and Jerry Doctrow, well known to many of you from his days as a leading health care analyst at Stifel, and Legg Mason. QCP will be in excellent hands. 
Yesterday, we repatriated from QCP to HCP the net proceeds from the $1.75 billion financing we recently raised. We also have announced that we are under contract to sell 64 Brookdale properties to a venture formed by Blackstone and Columbia Pacific for $1.125 billion. We are also well on our way to completing the previously announced RIDEA 2 transaction with Columbia Pacific and the sale or transfer of 25 other Brookdale triple-net properties.
In the aggregate, we have taken a major step in reducing our Brookdale concentration from 35% immediately post spin to 27%, and of note, the 10% concentration for the triple-net assets. I'm also pleased to report that when these transactions close, the aggregate lease coverage of the remaining Brookdale triple-net assets held by HCP significantly improves to 1.21x on a pro forma trailing basis.
Our current objective is to further reduce our Brookdale concentration to between 20% and 25% over a reasonable period of time. The combined proceeds from QCP financing and Brookdale transactions will be used by HCP to pay off our line of credit and substantially all other debt maturities through the end of 2018. Once completed, this will result in a much improved balance sheet profile. As we will explain in greater detail, these actions have stabilized our balance sheet, with metrics solidly in the BBB territory and provide a clear path ahead to return to BBB+.
And as to our fourth goal around transparency and clarity, you see today a revamped and enhanced supplemental report for the third quarter 2016 and moving forward. This is one tangible expression of our commitment around providing improved transparency. 
As to our fifth goal, establishing the next generation of leadership for HCP 3.0, I will be prepared to be very specific about our plans in the coming weeks and certainly before year-end.
It has been a complex and multifaceted journey since we announced a general direction along these lines last May. With the completed spin, the successful spin financing, the announced asset sales and the team that is being assembled, we have reset the company with a stable foundation and an ability going forward to grow prudently and in an accretive manner. 
HCP moving forward is in the strongest position it has been in for years. 94% private pay, a vastly improved balance sheet with plans in place for further improvement, crown jewels in our life science and medical properties portfolios and an improving and more diversified senior housing platform.
It is no surprise that all of these achievements have come with a cost. To position HCP for the future and create QCP to realize value over time, we have incurred costs, fees, prepayment charges, dilutive dispositions of noncore assets and the like. We have incurred these costs in order to achieve this onetime reset and to come out of this process with the strongest HCP possible, HCP 3.0.
So today, we will be giving a preliminary outlook for 2017. We will provide details on how we have reset our dividend and metrics as the foundation for moving forward. We will do our best to provide as clear a picture of how all of the actions we have taken come together in a complete picture. So let me turn the call over now to Tom Herzog to begin that discussion."

For the third quarter, our portfolio performed in line with our expectations, reported FFO as adjusted of $0.72 per share and NAREIT FFO of $0.65 per share. These results included a $0.01 gain in the quarter for monetizing a participating development loan in our senior housing segment. 
NAREIT FFO is impacted by $0.04 per share of spin transaction-related costs and $0.03 per share of previously announced severance-related charges. Note that we're no longer reporting or providing guidance for FAD on a per share basis in light of the SEC's recent focus on FAD per share as a liquidity measure. Although we are no longer reporting FAD per share, we will continue to provide total FAD and its related components.
For same-store performance beginning this quarter, we're now including the pro rata contribution from unconsolidated joint ventures in our same-store reporting convention to provide increased transparency in our portfolio performance. For the quarter, HCP generated solid year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth of 3.1%, excluding the QCP assets.
Now turning to our full year 2016 guidance. We are updating our guidance to reflect the spin transaction closed yesterday. Accordingly, it represents 10 months of HoldCo and 2 months of RemainCo post-spin. The net impact of the spin for the 2-month period equates to approximately $0.15 per share and is reflected in our updated guidance. 
We continue to have strong performance from all our core segments and expect our full year FFO as adjusted per share to range from $2.69 to $2.75, inclusive of the $0.04 of year-to-date gains from monetizing 3 senior housing development loans. We expect full year 2016 FFO -- NAREIT FFO to range from $2.35 to $2.41 per share, impacted by $0.34 of onetime costs, of which $0.18 relates to spin transaction costs, $0.10 of debt prepayment costs resulting from the spin, $0.03 of other transaction costs and $0.03 of previously announced severance-related charges.
Also, excluding QCP, we are projecting full year 2016 same-store cash NOI to range from 2.75% to 3.75%. Finally, our upcoming dividend. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per share to be paid on November 25, 2016. The new dividend reflects our outlook, which I will discuss in a few minutes.
Now I will turn the call over to Justin to take you through our Brookdale transactions and operating highlights."

I'll start with a few more details on our strategic Brookdale transactions, then I'll review our recent investments and third quarter performance. And lastly, I'll provide a preliminary outlook for our 2017 same-property performance for each of our sectors.
Starting with the Brookdale transactions. This morning, we announced that we entered into definitive agreements to sell 64 communities that are leased to Brookdale for $1.125 billion to Blackstone and Columbia Pacific Advisors, representing a trailing 12-month lease yield of 8%, and we expect it to close in the first quarter of 2017. The portfolio had an occupancy of 85.2% for the third quarter and lease coverage of 0.81x for the trailing 12 months through September. 
In addition, we will sell or transition 25 triple-net assets that are nonstrategic to both HCP and Brookdale within the next 12 months. These assets had an occupancy of 79.9% for the third quarter and lease coverage of 0.52x for the trailing 12 months through September. 
Also in Q4, we expect to transfer 8 expiring Brookdale leases to RIDEA structures, 4 with Brookdale and 4 with a new operator. We are pleased to announce the asset sales and lease restructure as key components of our transition to HCP 3.0. These combined initiatives were mutually beneficial while enabling HCP to address several important strategic priorities, including reducing our Brookdale concentration, improving the lease coverage of our triple-net senior housing portfolio and diversifying our operator relationships. Additionally, we were able to achieve market pricing on the 64 assets validated through a competitive bidding process. The transaction significantly improves the overall quality of our retained portfolio.
Specifically, we are reducing a major tenant concentration from 35% immediately post-spin to 27% once these transactions are complete. I'll also note that our triple-net exposure to Brookdale reduces from 16% of our total portfolio concentration to 10%.
The lease coverage for our Brookdale triple-net portfolio will improve by 19 basis points on a pro forma basis to 1.21x on a trailing 12-month basis. And the quality of our Brookdale triple-net portfolio will improve significantly, with occupancy increasing by 260 basis points to 89.1%. Furthermore, the retained Brookdale portfolio is located in stronger markets represented by a better overall demographics profile as shown on Slide 4 in our presentation deck. 
We value our relationship with Brookdale and look forward to our continued work together, positioning our portfolio for success. Additionally, we will diversify our relationships by adding 2 to 3 new operators in conjunction with transitioning communities from Brookdale.
Moving on to our investments. In September, we completed the previously announced acquisition of 7 private pay senior housing communities for $186 million, welcoming a new operator partner to our SHOP platform, Senior Lifestyle Corporation. This marks the sixth new relationship that we've added to our senior housing portfolio this year. 
Now let me highlight a few things on our third quarter performance. We continue to see growth in our SHOP platform, which delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 3.3% for 120 communities, bringing our year-to-date growth to 6.4%. This was driven by an 80 basis point increase in occupancy versus prior year and 2.9% growth in rates. 
We also experienced a 40 basis point increase in sequential occupancy while the industry remained flat. Our overall triple-net portfolio coverage will improve to 1.34x on an EBITDAR basis and 1.13x on an EBITDAR basis with the sale and transition of Brookdale communities mentioned previously. 
The overall senior housing industry continues to be impacted by new supply in many markets, and in the case of Brookdale, there's the added complexity of their scale and still finding sea legs 1 year post integration and 2 years post merger while navigating oversupply. Based on a new inventory peak in 2016 and declining construction starts, 2017 should bear the brunt of the supply pressure. 
It's important to note that with the planned asset sales and Brookdale lease restructure mentioned earlier, we have significant cushion to absorb any impact to the lease coverage. Also, the Brookdale triple-net portfolio that we retain following the asset sales will have far less exposure to new supply. Although 60% of our SHOP portfolio is represented by independent living and CCRC communities, which are far less impacted by new supply. In summary, HCP is very well positioned relative to the new supply issue.
As Mike mentioned, we have enhanced our supplemental with additional disclosures across each of our segments. For senior housing, we have included a new supply schedule related to our triple-net portfolio, similar to the SHOP schedule. And we are now disclosing new supply for independent living and CCRCs separate from assisted living for both SHOP and triple-net. We have also added an affordability metric and a qualified caregiver percentage by market, both of which we view as key demand drivers.
Turning to life science. Our same-store portfolio is 97% leased, and we are proud to announce another strong quarter of same-store cash NOI growth of 8.8%. Yesterday, we made an exciting announcement regarding the Cove development, which is located at the epicenter of South San Francisco's life science cluster. Phase 1 is now 73% leased, and we have pre-leased half of Phase 2 to AstraZeneca, who will join the campus in the fourth quarter of 2017. They are leasing 116,000 square feet, allowing the company to consolidate operations and research throughout the Bay Area. 
In response to our leasing success for Phases 1 and 2 and continued strong demand from life science users in South San Francisco, we are commencing the development of Phase 3, which adds 2 Class A buildings, totaling up to 336,000 square feet. Construction will commence next year with planned deliveries throughout the second half of 2018. The total cost of the project is estimated at $211 million. Upon completion, the Cove will be a 1 million-square-foot pre-certified LEED Silver, fully integrated waterfront life science campus with 7 buildings.
Our medical office portfolio maintains strong occupancy of 92% with cash NOI same-store growth this quarter of 3.1%. 95% of our portfolio is affiliated with over 200 hospitals and health systems and 83% is located on campus. As a result, tenant retention remains high at nearly 78%. We currently have 4 on-campus ground-up MOB development projects underway, which are 63% pre-leased.
Now let me give you a preliminary 2017 outlook for cash SPP for each of our reported segments, which have been redefined. We expect overall same-store cash NOI growth to range from 2.5% to 3.5%; for senior housing triple-net, 3.25% to 4.25%, driven by contractual rent escalators and rent on capital expenditures; for SHOP, 4% to 5%, driven by rate increases and growth from capital investments; for life science, 1.7% to 2.7%, which is primarily driven by contractual rent escalators, partially offset by projected rent abatements and downtime on expiring leases. 
For medical office, we expect steady performance in the 2% to 3% range. And lastly, our other segment, which now includes hospitals, our U.K. real estate and all of our debt investments. For cash SPP, which would only include hospitals and U.K. real estate, we are expecting 0.75% to 1.75% growth, reflecting a contractual rent reduction for one of our acute-care hospitals. Overall, we have a healthy performance outlook for the near term across our segments.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Tom to walk you through our preliminary 2017 outlook for the overall company."
277966,406873417,1069251,"HCP, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Justin.

Please reference the presentation we posted on our website. Starting on Slide 1. As Mike mentioned earlier, we have made substantial progress towards accomplishing all of our near-term strategic priorities.
Turning to Slide 2. Post the spin, HCP is a $20-plus billion enterprise, generating $1.3 billion of income from our diversified portfolio with 4 core segments: senior housing triple-net, SHOP, medical office, and life science. We believe our upgraded portfolio mix, which is 94% private pay concentrated in top 50 MSAs, supported by above-average population growth, is one of the best in the sector.
Onto the next slide, Slide 3. We have highlighted our key relationships and the portfolio strength of each of our core segments.
Slide 4 outlines how we're improving our Brookdale triple-net portfolio of higher coverage and improved portfolio quality, as Justin just took you through.
Turning to Slides 5 and 6. Earlier, I talked about our 2016 guidance, which includes 10 months of HoldCo and 2 months post spin, which is summarized in the first column on Slide 5. In the second column, we have provided the 2016 pro forma FFO's adjusted run rate of $1.92 per share. As you can see from the bridge on Slide 6, it is computed from our 2016 guidance adjusted for the following items as if they occurred on January 1, 2016: the QCP spin, the sale of the 64 Brookdale triple-net assets and the RIDEA 2 transaction, offset in part by the use of proceeds principally to pay down debt. 
The 2016 run rate of $1.92 per share represents a good jumping off point to compare to our 2017 outlook and represents an earnings reset in exchange for: a vastly upgraded portfolio, reinforcing stability and organic growth with 94% private pay revenue sources; reduced Brookdale concentration with strong coverage levels and more diversified relationships; and an improving investment grade balance sheet with ample liquidity and no significant debt maturities through the end of 2018. 
Back to Slide 5. In the far right column, we have provided our 2017 preliminary outlook for FFO as adjusted of $1.92 per share at the midpoint, which is flat to our 2016 run rate.
Please now turn to Slide 7. This slide provides a summarized roll forward of our FFO as adjusted from our 2016 run rate to our 2017 outlook. You'll note the roll forward includes: SPP NOI growth of $0.05 per share, combined with $0.02 per share of development earn-in from existing committed projects results in projected organic growth and development earn-in of $0.07 per share. This growth is offset by various items, including incremental drag from commencing the Cove Phase 3 and other plant redevelopments, the exercise of purchase options by Genentech and Tenet and several other small items. I'll note the outlook is preliminary as we are currently going through the process of developing our detailed budget for 2017, and we'll provide our finalized guidance on our next earnings call in February.
And our preliminary 2017 outlook assumes a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, consistent with our fourth quarter 2016 dividend announced this morning.
Turning to Slide 8. This slide summarizes the anticipated use of gross proceeds from the 3 transactions that will generate approximately $3.35 billion: first, $1.75 billion of financing proceeds associated with the spin; second, $470 million of proceeds from the RIDEA 2 transaction, which is on track to close this quarter; and third, $1.125 billion of Brookdale asset sales that are exported to be completed during the first quarter of 2017. With these proceeds, we plan to pay down $3.15 billion of bonds, mortgage debt and revolver balances with a blended rate of 5.2%. The remaining proceeds will be used to cover the spin transaction and debt prepayment costs totaling $200 million.
Turning to Slide 9. Upon completing all these transactions, HCP will have a much stronger balance sheet, with minimal debt maturities through the end of 2018. 
As highlighted on Slide 10, we are on track to outperform our financing plans set forth upon announcing the spin in May and are now targeting better credit metrics than initially anticipated. By the end of 2017, we anticipate a target net debt to EBITDA in the low to mid-6x range and a target financial leverage in the 43% to 44% range. 
In October, S&P reaffirmed our BBB ratings and Fitch also reaffirmed our BBB rating while improving our outlook to stable. We have the goal of reducing leverage further and regaining Baa1, BBB+ ratings over time.
And finally, Slide 11 provides our key takeaways on what differentiates HCP 3.0. We have a higher quality of private pay portfolio, strong coverage levels on our triple-net portfolio and improved tenant concentration. We have an investment-grade balance sheet backed by an upgraded portfolio of ample liquidity and no significant near-term debt maturities. And our improved senior housing portfolio, premier life science and on-campus medical office platforms will continue to generate strong and steady returns. 
So in summary, we have made enormous progress on multiple fronts and are truly excited about our future prospects. I will now turn the call back to our operator for the Q&A session. Kerry?"

There's an upgrade, we think, in terms of just performance in regards to what we're keeping. I'll even share some market commentary with you if you want to look at a recent market comp would be the transaction we just closed with Mid-Atlantic. That was purchased at a T12 [ph] basis at a 5.8% cap. We're expecting about a 6.6% in year 1. Year 3 could be an 8% cap based on our projections. Class A senior housing is mid- to high 5s. And B+ is around low 6s. So if you consider all of that feedback and take a hard look at what we've kept versus what we sold, I think that helps you to rationalize the pricing."

We may add 1 to 2, maybe 3 operators from this portfolio and from the portfolio of 8 assets that we mentioned as well. So it was a win-win, we think. It cleared off some assets that were not performing as well for Brookdale. We retained some rent. We'll sell the assets, we're estimating, could be $160 million, $170 million in total value, and that's how we get to our low 6% cap rate range on those assets.

We certainly have some relationships embedded in our portfolios, whether they're large networks or other providers in the spaces that we're highlighting that we're anxious to start to renew our cultivation.

So one thing in picking those numbers wasn't to set that as hard and fast, but it was an objective to kind of line up the various guidelines that we need to talk with the rating agencies about. So I don't want to put too hard and fast a point on that range. Having said that, as of -- as we consummate the deals that we are now under contract with and moving forward, the quality of what we've got here is pretty good. And senior housing is a space that all of the health care REITs are going to be invested in. And senior housing, as you know, has a number of different segments to it. So we're very focused. One of the things that we've emphasized in the past is, as we've had Justin join our team, Kai Hsiao and others that are deep and wide in this space, we've got to be very wise about what parts of the senior housing space we invest in and what we hold in our portfolio. But right now, we feel good about where we are. We can still work around the margins. We're much more influenced now by RIDEA than triple-net, and that gives us a seat at the table in terms of CapEx and operations and the like that triple-net doesn't. And so some of that management talent that we've invested in can kind of go to work under that umbrella. So again, more than almost anybody in the world, we're going to be monitoring and working closely with Brookdale for obvious reasons. But we feel pretty good where we sit today."

So the same execution we had on RIDEA 2, and it's really only the 2 JVs at this point that we were planning to do that with, but this was step 2 in the process that we had spoken to last quarter."

We're -- I'm not saying we're done with hospitals, but it would take a pretty good profile or underwriting to go there. We're more interested in the ancillary part and the private pay part of the business. In terms of international, we're just being cautious at this point. The couple of relationships we have over there are strong. Brexit and the sterling and so forth are certainly things to watch, labor costs and even the nursing shortages. It's pretty well documented that there are challenges over there. But on the other hand, the demographics are even better than in the U.S., and the health care system in the U.K. is not as segmented or stratified as it is here. So if you're not in the hospital and you're not home, there's not a lot of intermediate opportunities. So we think that there's a lot of activity going on over there. It's going to sort out over time, but it is an early-stage market when it comes to some of the kind of things that we invest in. So we really have it on a watch, if you will, and we thought we should isolate it in other just as we were, for that reason.

Generally, the market over there is a 6% to 7% cap rate market for the kind of care homes that we're in. I think you have to look at the market kind of -- again in its different segments. There's the super prime luxury. That is not a segment that's performing well. I think some people overbuilt and overshot in terms of what their strategic focus was. And then some of the smaller mom-and-pops are not doing well, and it is a market where there is a significant number of smaller players. And the reason that they're not doing as well -- but the middle segment where Maria Mallaband and HC-One are in is what we call the prime market. So that's a nice solid good product to an upper middle class type of constituency. And not only is the private pay market able to do well in that segment, also the local authorities who supplement some of the costs have targeted the prime market, that upper middle type of market. It's not a value market, it's a prime market but it's not super prime. But the reason that the local authorities think of counties and states here but are willing to support it is because they think they get good value and get good return for supporting it. And they think that some of the smaller players aren't as efficient and don't give them the best value for their regulated dollar. So our focus has been in that prime market. We still think that it's the place to be. So like any segment in any country or region, you kind of got to go down a little bit to put a value on it. And I think the short answer to your question, Rich, is it's a 6% to 7% cap rate market, but we would say some segments are certainly doing better than others. And some of the segments, especially the prime, are able to absorb the labor costs and some of the issues because they're getting good support not only from a fairly affluent country with not a lot of options in the continuum of care and they're getting good government support. So that's our view."

The third quarter occupancy was at 89.8%, so the 3-year average, but within that, independent living was at a 7-year high. Construction starts were slowing in the second half of the year. Rent growth is the highest it's been since 2007, and there's been a little less transaction volume overall, as you know. So if you think about that and look at the backdrop, you would expect in the sector that there would be, in '17, some absorption occurring within assisted living. It seems like that '17 could carry the brunt of the new supply issue as it pertains to assisted living, as it pertains to markets actually have a new supply impact. When we stepped back and looked at our portfolio, one thing, just by simply reducing the size of our triple-net, we've reduced exposure within our triple-net portfolio of new supply. Our triple-net portfolio is 70% assisted living. The remainder is independent living and CCRC, so that there's less impact in those asset classes. I mentioned the SHOP exposure we have. And so there's -- we feel that we'll be less impacted than the general industry because of the segments that we're in, independent living, CCRC, and then some impact in assisted living but it's all been factored into our outlook."

We've -- HCP has used them in the past, there's been some high-yield loan investments. There's been investments made with the intent on pursuing real estate ownership. Moving forward, we'll be more geared towards, in the event we use debt, to gear towards owned real estate, it could be development loans, we have a participating development loan or we can own the real estate. There could be some other subordinated debt used as well. But it's not going to be a primary focus. It will be substantially less than it was in the past. And the goal and intent moving forward is to be an owner of high-quality real estate. In regards to the -- there was -- with regards to the hospital rent cut, there was a contractual rent cut that had been in place for a number of years. Our team was able to renegotiate that and spread it over a 3-year period so it lessened the impact. They did a good job and they also were able to pursue a little bit of development with that hospital as well. So I'd say it was something we saw coming for a long time and we planned appropriately for it. Our medical office team did a great job planning for the impact of it."

I think in a general sense, what Mark has said is that he will and his board will be talking about their dividend right away and be announcing where they want to come out. I think he signaled that you should look at it as a modest dividend in the early quarters because they think it's prudent to take some of the rent that they collect and create some cash reserves and balance just to be in a strong a position as they can be. But he totally recognizes he is a REIT and dividends are important. But it will be, I think, a process that occurs not right out of the gate but it will build up as they work through. And I think he's also signaled that he expects to have a pretty active dialogue and possibly negotiation with HCR ManorCare in the early days of his company. So all of that will play in. It will be a time where, I'm sure, as he's already said in his road show, that he can't be pretty definitive at this point. It would be like going into the Super Bowl and giving your opponent your defensive and offensive game plan before you play the game. And so I think you're going to have to be a little patient with some of that. His board, that I mentioned in my earlier remarks, is a very seasoned board.

The first-gen revenue-enhancing type CapEx, you're going to see decline, from memory, it might have been from about $150 million to probably $80 million because a lot of the Brookdale CapEx expenditures and MOB expenditures that we had planned for 2016 are primarily completed but we still do intend to spend money on some high IRR type expenditures, and we've promised you more analysis around that in the future. And as to development, you'll see that bump up a little bit with The Cove, and we have some additional redevelopment on what we believe to be some quite lucrative redev projects on campus MOB properties that probably are about 30-plus years since they've had redevelopment completed. I have been out, looked at those properties and see some real upside. So when you get into the different buckets, that's what's you're going to see. And I'm just giving it conversationally instead of with details because I couldn't get to my schedule quick enough. But that's what makes up those numbers."

Probably is opportunity over time and with a little more focus. But I don't relate those assets to the assets that we've kept. There's a difference in terms of the performance.

So I think that's going to be very stable, and it's going to be -- we're setting some almost kind of really nice precedent with this Cove development that we've got going. I think that you're going to see maybe that as an innovation that we'll want to duplicate, and probably others as well, where you see more of the life science and research properties more on campuses than spread out, where they can get a lot of amenities and synergies. So we feel like we're in a pretty good place here. And I think the simple answer to your question is real estate is always a cyclical business. We can't help that, but that's better than having fundamental problems with an asset class."

Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On our last earnings call, I gave you 5 goals that we were focused on: to execute the spinoff of HCR ManorCare's portfolio; to reduce and improve our Brookdale concentration; to improve our balance sheet metrics; to become a leader in transparency and clarity; and to establish the next generation of leadership for HCP 3.0. As you know, we are very pleased to have completed the spin transaction yesterday, creating a new publicly listed company called Quality Care Properties or QCP.
QCP's primary holdings are the real estate facilities operated by HCR ManorCare. QCP's principal objective at the outset will be to take the necessary steps over time to realize the embedded value in these assets, value that we believe has not been recognized in recent months and years in the stock valuation of HCP. We wish Mark Ordan, QCP's CEO, and his team the very best as he launches this new company.
We're also delighted that QCP has a world-class Board of Directors to oversee its business strategy and governance. Joining Mark on the board will be Don Wood, CEO of Federal Realty; Glenn Cohen, CFO of Kimco Realty; Paul Klaassen, co-Founder and former Chairman of Sunrise Senior Living; Kathy Smalley, a partner at the law firm of Locke Lord and the former General Counsel of Trammell Crow, and Catellus; Bill Schimmel [ph], recently retired from KPMG, having served as lead audit partner for such clients as Apple, General Dynamics, and Tenet Healthcare; and Jerry Doctrow, well known to many of you from his days as a leading health care analyst at Stifel, and Legg Mason. QCP will be in excellent hands. 
Yesterday, we repatriated from QCP to HCP the net proceeds from the $1.75 billion financing we recently raised. We also have announced that we are under contract to sell 64 Brookdale properties to a venture formed by Blackstone and Columbia Pacific for $1.125 billion. We are also well on our way to completing the previously announced RIDEA 2 transaction with Columbia Pacific and the sale or transfer of 25 other Brookdale triple-net properties.
In the aggregate, we have taken a major step in reducing our Brookdale concentration from 35% immediately post spin to 27%, and of note, the 10% concentration for the triple-net assets. I'm also pleased to report that when these transactions close, the aggregate lease coverage of the remaining Brookdale triple-net assets held by HCP significantly improves to 1.21x on a pro forma trailing basis.
Our current objective is to further reduce our Brookdale concentration to between 20% and 25% over a reasonable period of time. The combined proceeds from QCP financing and Brookdale transactions will be used by HCP to pay off our line of credit and substantially all other debt maturities through the end of 2018. Once completed, this will result in a much improved balance sheet profile. As we will explain in greater detail, these actions have stabilized our balance sheet, with metrics solidly in the BBB territory and provide a clear path ahead to return to BBB+.
And as to our fourth goal around transparency and clarity, you see today a revamped and enhanced supplemental report for the third quarter 2016 and moving forward. This is one tangible expression of our commitment around providing improved transparency. 
As to our fifth goal, establishing the next generation of leadership for HCP 3.0, I will be prepared to be very specific about our plans in the coming weeks and certainly before year-end.
It has been a complex and multifaceted journey since we announced a general direction along these lines last May. With the completed spin, the successful spin financing, the announced asset sales and the team that is being assembled, we have reset the company with a stable foundation and an ability going forward to grow prudently and in an accretive manner. 
HCP moving forward is in the strongest position it has been in for years. 94% private pay, a vastly improved balance sheet with plans in place for further improvement, crown jewels in our life science and medical properties portfolios and an improving and more diversified senior housing platform.
It is no surprise that all of these achievements have come with a cost. To position HCP for the future and create QCP to realize value over time, we have incurred costs, fees, prepayment charges, dilutive dispositions of noncore assets and the like. We have incurred these costs in order to achieve this onetime reset and to come out of this process with the strongest HCP possible, HCP 3.0.
So today, we will be giving a preliminary outlook for 2017. We will provide details on how we have reset our dividend and metrics as the foundation for moving forward. We will do our best to provide as clear a picture of how all of the actions we have taken come together in a complete picture. So let me turn the call over now to Tom Herzog to begin that discussion."

For the third quarter, our portfolio performed in line with our expectations, reported FFO as adjusted of $0.72 per share and NAREIT FFO of $0.65 per share. These results included a $0.01 gain in the quarter for monetizing a participating development loan in our senior housing segment. 
NAREIT FFO is impacted by $0.04 per share of spin transaction-related costs and $0.03 per share of previously announced severance-related charges. Note that we're no longer reporting or providing guidance for FAD on a per share basis in light of the SEC's recent focus on FAD per share as a liquidity measure. Although we are no longer reporting FAD per share, we will continue to provide total FAD and its related components.
For same-store performance beginning this quarter, we're now including the pro rata contribution from unconsolidated joint ventures in our same-store reporting convention to provide increased transparency in our portfolio performance. For the quarter, HCP generated solid year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth of 3.1%, excluding the QCP assets.
Now turning to our full year 2016 guidance. We are updating our guidance to reflect the spin transaction closed yesterday. Accordingly, it represents 10 months of HoldCo and 2 months of RemainCo post-spin. The net impact of the spin for the 2-month period equates to approximately $0.15 per share and is reflected in our updated guidance. 
We continue to have strong performance from all our core segments and expect our full year FFO as adjusted per share to range from $2.69 to $2.75, inclusive of the $0.04 of year-to-date gains from monetizing 3 senior housing development loans. We expect full year 2016 FFO -- NAREIT FFO to range from $2.35 to $2.41 per share, impacted by $0.34 of onetime costs, of which $0.18 relates to spin transaction costs, $0.10 of debt prepayment costs resulting from the spin, $0.03 of other transaction costs and $0.03 of previously announced severance-related charges.
Also, excluding QCP, we are projecting full year 2016 same-store cash NOI to range from 2.75% to 3.75%. Finally, our upcoming dividend. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per share to be paid on November 25, 2016. The new dividend reflects our outlook, which I will discuss in a few minutes.

I'll start with a few more details on our strategic Brookdale transactions, then I'll review our recent investments and third quarter performance. And lastly, I'll provide a preliminary outlook for our 2017 same-property performance for each of our sectors.
Starting with the Brookdale transactions. This morning, we announced that we entered into definitive agreements to sell 64 communities that are leased to Brookdale for $1.125 billion to Blackstone and Columbia Pacific Advisors, representing a trailing 12-month lease yield of 8%, and we expect it to close in the first quarter of 2017. The portfolio had an occupancy of 85.2% for the third quarter and lease coverage of 0.81x for the trailing 12 months through September. 
In addition, we will sell or transition 25 triple-net assets that are nonstrategic to both HCP and Brookdale within the next 12 months. These assets had an occupancy of 79.9% for the third quarter and lease coverage of 0.52x for the trailing 12 months through September. 
Also in Q4, we expect to transfer 8 expiring Brookdale leases to RIDEA structures, 4 with Brookdale and 4 with a new operator. We are pleased to announce the asset sales and lease restructure as key components of our transition to HCP 3.0. These combined initiatives were mutually beneficial while enabling HCP to address several important strategic priorities, including reducing our Brookdale concentration, improving the lease coverage of our triple-net senior housing portfolio and diversifying our operator relationships. Additionally, we were able to achieve market pricing on the 64 assets validated through a competitive bidding process. The transaction significantly improves the overall quality of our retained portfolio.
Specifically, we are reducing a major tenant concentration from 35% immediately post-spin to 27% once these transactions are complete. I'll also note that our triple-net exposure to Brookdale reduces from 16% of our total portfolio concentration to 10%.
The lease coverage for our Brookdale triple-net portfolio will improve by 19 basis points on a pro forma basis to 1.21x on a trailing 12-month basis. And the quality of our Brookdale triple-net portfolio will improve significantly, with occupancy increasing by 260 basis points to 89.1%. Furthermore, the retained Brookdale portfolio is located in stronger markets represented by a better overall demographics profile as shown on Slide 4 in our presentation deck. 
We value our relationship with Brookdale and look forward to our continued work together, positioning our portfolio for success. Additionally, we will diversify our relationships by adding 2 to 3 new operators in conjunction with transitioning communities from Brookdale.
Moving on to our investments. In September, we completed the previously announced acquisition of 7 private pay senior housing communities for $186 million, welcoming a new operator partner to our SHOP platform, Senior Lifestyle Corporation. This marks the sixth new relationship that we've added to our senior housing portfolio this year. 
Now let me highlight a few things on our third quarter performance. We continue to see growth in our SHOP platform, which delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 3.3% for 120 communities, bringing our year-to-date growth to 6.4%. This was driven by an 80 basis point increase in occupancy versus prior year and 2.9% growth in rates. 
We also experienced a 40 basis point increase in sequential occupancy while the industry remained flat. Our overall triple-net portfolio coverage will improve to 1.34x on an EBITDAR basis and 1.13x on an EBITDAR basis with the sale and transition of Brookdale communities mentioned previously. 
The overall senior housing industry continues to be impacted by new supply in many markets, and in the case of Brookdale, there's the added complexity of their scale and still finding sea legs 1 year post integration and 2 years post merger while navigating oversupply. Based on a new inventory peak in 2016 and declining construction starts, 2017 should bear the brunt of the supply pressure. 
It's important to note that with the planned asset sales and Brookdale lease restructure mentioned earlier, we have significant cushion to absorb any impact to the lease coverage. Also, the Brookdale triple-net portfolio that we retain following the asset sales will have far less exposure to new supply. Although 60% of our SHOP portfolio is represented by independent living and CCRC communities, which are far less impacted by new supply. In summary, HCP is very well positioned relative to the new supply issue.
As Mike mentioned, we have enhanced our supplemental with additional disclosures across each of our segments. For senior housing, we have included a new supply schedule related to our triple-net portfolio, similar to the SHOP schedule. And we are now disclosing new supply for independent living and CCRCs separate from assisted living for both SHOP and triple-net. We have also added an affordability metric and a qualified caregiver percentage by market, both of which we view as key demand drivers.
Turning to life science. Our same-store portfolio is 97% leased, and we are proud to announce another strong quarter of same-store cash NOI growth of 8.8%. Yesterday, we made an exciting announcement regarding the Cove development, which is located at the epicenter of South San Francisco's life science cluster. Phase 1 is now 73% leased, and we have pre-leased half of Phase 2 to AstraZeneca, who will join the campus in the fourth quarter of 2017. They are leasing 116,000 square feet, allowing the company to consolidate operations and research throughout the Bay Area. 
In response to our leasing success for Phases 1 and 2 and continued strong demand from life science users in South San Francisco, we are commencing the development of Phase 3, which adds 2 Class A buildings, totaling up to 336,000 square feet. Construction will commence next year with planned deliveries throughout the second half of 2018. The total cost of the project is estimated at $211 million. Upon completion, the Cove will be a 1 million-square-foot pre-certified LEED Silver, fully integrated waterfront life science campus with 7 buildings.
Our medical office portfolio maintains strong occupancy of 92% with cash NOI same-store growth this quarter of 3.1%. 95% of our portfolio is affiliated with over 200 hospitals and health systems and 83% is located on campus. As a result, tenant retention remains high at nearly 78%. We currently have 4 on-campus ground-up MOB development projects underway, which are 63% pre-leased.
Now let me give you a preliminary 2017 outlook for cash SPP for each of our reported segments, which have been redefined. We expect overall same-store cash NOI growth to range from 2.5% to 3.5%; for senior housing triple-net, 3.25% to 4.25%, driven by contractual rent escalators and rent on capital expenditures; for SHOP, 4% to 5%, driven by rate increases and growth from capital investments; for life science, 1.7% to 2.7%, which is primarily driven by contractual rent escalators, partially offset by projected rent abatements and downtime on expiring leases. 
For medical office, we expect steady performance in the 2% to 3% range. And lastly, our other segment, which now includes hospitals, our U.K. real estate and all of our debt investments. For cash SPP, which would only include hospitals and U.K. real estate, we are expecting 0.75% to 1.75% growth, reflecting a contractual rent reduction for one of our acute-care hospitals. Overall, we have a healthy performance outlook for the near term across our segments.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Tom to walk you through our preliminary 2017 outlook for the overall company."

Please reference the presentation we posted on our website. Starting on Slide 1. As Mike mentioned earlier, we have made substantial progress towards accomplishing all of our near-term strategic priorities.
Turning to Slide 2. Post the spin, HCP is a $20-plus billion enterprise, generating $1.3 billion of income from our diversified portfolio with 4 core segments: senior housing triple-net, SHOP, medical office, and life science. We believe our upgraded portfolio mix, which is 94% private pay concentrated in top 50 MSAs, supported by above-average population growth, is one of the best in the sector.
Onto the next slide, Slide 3. We have highlighted our key relationships and the portfolio strength of each of our core segments.
Slide 4 outlines how we're improving our Brookdale triple-net portfolio of higher coverage and improved portfolio quality, as Justin just took you through.
Turning to Slides 5 and 6. Earlier, I talked about our 2016 guidance, which includes 10 months of HoldCo and 2 months post spin, which is summarized in the first column on Slide 5. In the second column, we have provided the 2016 pro forma FFO's adjusted run rate of $1.92 per share. As you can see from the bridge on Slide 6, it is computed from our 2016 guidance adjusted for the following items as if they occurred on January 1, 2016: the QCP spin, the sale of the 64 Brookdale triple-net assets and the RIDEA 2 transaction, offset in part by the use of proceeds principally to pay down debt. 
The 2016 run rate of $1.92 per share represents a good jumping off point to compare to our 2017 outlook and represents an earnings reset in exchange for: a vastly upgraded portfolio, reinforcing stability and organic growth with 94% private pay revenue sources; reduced Brookdale concentration with strong coverage levels and more diversified relationships; and an improving investment grade balance sheet with ample liquidity and no significant debt maturities through the end of 2018. 
Back to Slide 5. In the far right column, we have provided our 2017 preliminary outlook for FFO as adjusted of $1.92 per share at the midpoint, which is flat to our 2016 run rate.
Please now turn to Slide 7. This slide provides a summarized roll forward of our FFO as adjusted from our 2016 run rate to our 2017 outlook. You'll note the roll forward includes: SPP NOI growth of $0.05 per share, combined with $0.02 per share of development earn-in from existing committed projects results in projected organic growth and development earn-in of $0.07 per share. This growth is offset by various items, including incremental drag from commencing the Cove Phase 3 and other plant redevelopments, the exercise of purchase options by Genentech and Tenet and several other small items. I'll note the outlook is preliminary as we are currently going through the process of developing our detailed budget for 2017, and we'll provide our finalized guidance on our next earnings call in February.
And our preliminary 2017 outlook assumes a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, consistent with our fourth quarter 2016 dividend announced this morning.
Turning to Slide 8. This slide summarizes the anticipated use of gross proceeds from the 3 transactions that will generate approximately $3.35 billion: first, $1.75 billion of financing proceeds associated with the spin; second, $470 million of proceeds from the RIDEA 2 transaction, which is on track to close this quarter; and third, $1.125 billion of Brookdale asset sales that are exported to be completed during the first quarter of 2017. With these proceeds, we plan to pay down $3.15 billion of bonds, mortgage debt and revolver balances with a blended rate of 5.2%. The remaining proceeds will be used to cover the spin transaction and debt prepayment costs totaling $200 million.
Turning to Slide 9. Upon completing all these transactions, HCP will have a much stronger balance sheet, with minimal debt maturities through the end of 2018. 
As highlighted on Slide 10, we are on track to outperform our financing plans set forth upon announcing the spin in May and are now targeting better credit metrics than initially anticipated. By the end of 2017, we anticipate a target net debt to EBITDA in the low to mid-6x range and a target financial leverage in the 43% to 44% range. 
In October, S&P reaffirmed our BBB ratings and Fitch also reaffirmed our BBB rating while improving our outlook to stable. We have the goal of reducing leverage further and regaining Baa1, BBB+ ratings over time.
And finally, Slide 11 provides our key takeaways on what differentiates HCP 3.0. We have a higher quality of private pay portfolio, strong coverage levels on our triple-net portfolio and improved tenant concentration. We have an investment-grade balance sheet backed by an upgraded portfolio of ample liquidity and no significant near-term debt maturities. And our improved senior housing portfolio, premier life science and on-campus medical office platforms will continue to generate strong and steady returns. 
So in summary, we have made enormous progress on multiple fronts and are truly excited about our future prospects. I will now turn the call back to our operator for the Q&A session. Kerry?"

If you want to look at what's remaining in the portfolio, you'll note on Slide 4 some highlights of the performance of the assets that we kept, the type of markets they're in. There's an upgrade, we think, in terms of just performance in regards to what we're keeping. I'll even share some market commentary with you if you want to look at a recent market comp would be the transaction we just closed with Mid-Atlantic. That was purchased at a T12 [ph] basis at a 5.8% cap. We're expecting about a 6.6% in year 1. Year 3 could be an 8% cap based on our projections. Class A senior housing is mid- to high 5s. And B+ is around low 6s. So if you consider all of that feedback and take a hard look at what we've kept versus what we sold, I think that helps you to rationalize the pricing."

We may add 1 to 2, maybe 3 operators from this portfolio and from the portfolio of 8 assets that we mentioned as well. So it was a win-win, we think. It cleared off some assets that were not performing as well for Brookdale. We retained some rent. We'll sell the assets, we're estimating, could be $160 million, $170 million in total value, and that's how we get to our low 6% cap rate range on those assets.

We won't be talking about HCR ManorCare and some of the things that we've had to deal with in the past. But I think that's probably more suited for a few more weeks from now while we kind of get stabilized here and then can give you something that's pretty tangible. I think the overall feeling is quite positive in-house because of the conversations that have been ongoing, but they have been conversations that have had to wait until we accomplished some of the things that we've announced today."

I think we noted earlier a strong priority, as we manage our capital raises, our balance sheet and our investments, is to migrate as quickly as possible back to BBB+ and we've got a clear path to do that. So one thing in picking those numbers wasn't to set that as hard and fast, but it was an objective to kind of line up the various guidelines that we need to talk with the rating agencies about. So I don't want to put too hard and fast a point on that range. Having said that, as of -- as we consummate the deals that we are now under contract with and moving forward, the quality of what we've got here is pretty good. And senior housing is a space that all of the health care REITs are going to be invested in. And senior housing, as you know, has a number of different segments to it. So we're very focused. One of the things that we've emphasized in the past is, as we've had Justin join our team, Kai Hsiao and others that are deep and wide in this space, we've got to be very wise about what parts of the senior housing space we invest in and what we hold in our portfolio. But right now, we feel good about where we are. We can still work around the margins. We're much more influenced now by RIDEA than triple-net, and that gives us a seat at the table in terms of CapEx and operations and the like that triple-net doesn't. And so some of that management talent that we've invested in can kind of go to work under that umbrella. So again, more than almost anybody in the world, we're going to be monitoring and working closely with Brookdale for obvious reasons. But we feel pretty good where we sit today."

We're more interested in the ancillary part and the private pay part of the business. In terms of international, we're just being cautious at this point. The couple of relationships we have over there are strong. Brexit and the sterling and so forth are certainly things to watch, labor costs and even the nursing shortages. It's pretty well documented that there are challenges over there. But on the other hand, the demographics are even better than in the U.S., and the health care system in the U.K. is not as segmented or stratified as it is here. So if you're not in the hospital and you're not home, there's not a lot of intermediate opportunities. So we think that there's a lot of activity going on over there. It's going to sort out over time, but it is an early-stage market when it comes to some of the kind of things that we invest in.

Generally, the market over there is a 6% to 7% cap rate market for the kind of care homes that we're in. I think you have to look at the market kind of -- again in its different segments. There's the super prime luxury. That is not a segment that's performing well. I think some people overbuilt and overshot in terms of what their strategic focus was. And then some of the smaller mom-and-pops are not doing well, and it is a market where there is a significant number of smaller players. And the reason that they're not doing as well -- but the middle segment where Maria Mallaband and HC-One are in is what we call the prime market. So that's a nice solid good product to an upper middle class type of constituency. And not only is the private pay market able to do well in that segment, also the local authorities who supplement some of the costs have targeted the prime market, that upper middle type of market. It's not a value market, it's a prime market but it's not super prime. But the reason that the local authorities think of counties and states here but are willing to support it is because they think they get good value and get good return for supporting it. And they think that some of the smaller players aren't as efficient and don't give them the best value for their regulated dollar. So our focus has been in that prime market. We still think that it's the place to be. So like any segment in any country or region, you kind of got to go down a little bit to put a value on it. And I think the short answer to your question, Rich, is it's a 6% to 7% cap rate market, but we would say some segments are certainly doing better than others. And some of the segments, especially the prime, are able to absorb the labor costs and some of the issues because they're getting good support not only from a fairly affluent country with not a lot of options in the continuum of care and they're getting good government support. So that's our view."

They've shown that they share our priority of being in the right assets and in the right markets, and so we've found them to be great to work with in that regard. So we'll certainly stay focused on that. I'd also just point out this as well that of the Brookdale concentration, that 27%, 10% of that is triple-net, so it's a well covered triple-net, 17% is SHOP. Within that SHOP, 58% of that is independent living and CCRC, so you have hardly any impact from new supply expected. So if you combine all those attributes, we're not going to sit still.

I'm going to give you a few highlights that Nick has pointed to, actually, and then I'll relate that to our view in our portfolio. The third quarter occupancy was at 89.8%, so the 3-year average, but within that, independent living was at a 7-year high. Construction starts were slowing in the second half of the year. Rent growth is the highest it's been since 2007, and there's been a little less transaction volume overall, as you know. So if you think about that and look at the backdrop, you would expect in the sector that there would be, in '17, some absorption occurring within assisted living. It seems like that '17 could carry the brunt of the new supply issue as it pertains to assisted living, as it pertains to markets actually have a new supply impact. When we stepped back and looked at our portfolio, one thing, just by simply reducing the size of our triple-net, we've reduced exposure within our triple-net portfolio of new supply. Our triple-net portfolio is 70% assisted living. The remainder is independent living and CCRC, so that there's less impact in those asset classes. I mentioned the SHOP exposure we have. And so there's -- we feel that we'll be less impacted than the general industry because of the segments that we're in, independent living, CCRC, and then some impact in assisted living but it's all been factored into our outlook."

Moving forward, we'll be more geared towards, in the event we use debt, to gear towards owned real estate, it could be development loans, we have a participating development loan or we can own the real estate. There could be some other subordinated debt used as well. But it's not going to be a primary focus. It will be substantially less than it was in the past. And the goal and intent moving forward is to be an owner of high-quality real estate. In regards to the -- there was -- with regards to the hospital rent cut, there was a contractual rent cut that had been in place for a number of years. Our team was able to renegotiate that and spread it over a 3-year period so it lessened the impact. They did a good job and they also were able to pursue a little bit of development with that hospital as well. So I'd say it was something we saw coming for a long time and we planned appropriately for it. Our medical office team did a great job planning for the impact of it."

This is the first day in almost 6 years that I haven't been a fiduciary of a company heavily invested in HCR ManorCare. It's kind of a different experience. I think in a general sense, what Mark has said is that he will and his board will be talking about their dividend right away and be announcing where they want to come out. I think he signaled that you should look at it as a modest dividend in the early quarters because they think it's prudent to take some of the rent that they collect and create some cash reserves and balance just to be in a strong a position as they can be. But he totally recognizes he is a REIT and dividends are important. But it will be, I think, a process that occurs not right out of the gate but it will build up as they work through. And I think he's also signaled that he expects to have a pretty active dialogue and possibly negotiation with HCR ManorCare in the early days of his company. So all of that will play in. It will be a time where, I'm sure, as he's already said in his road show, that he can't be pretty definitive at this point. It would be like going into the Super Bowl and giving your opponent your defensive and offensive game plan before you play the game. And so I think you're going to have to be a little patient with some of that. His board, that I mentioned in my earlier remarks, is a very seasoned board. They'll look out for their shareholders very well, a good bit of REIT experience on that board and people that, I think you know and can trust, will be doing the right thing. But we don't know the answer to that. It's up now to their board so we'll kind of have to leave it at that and wish them well."

You'll probably see just a little bump in that because we've got some lease-up. The first-gen revenue-enhancing type CapEx, you're going to see decline, from memory, it might have been from about $150 million to probably $80 million because a lot of the Brookdale CapEx expenditures and MOB expenditures that we had planned for 2016 are primarily completed but we still do intend to spend money on some high IRR type expenditures, and we've promised you more analysis around that in the future. And as to development, you'll see that bump up a little bit with The Cove, and we have some additional redevelopment on what we believe to be some quite lucrative redev projects on campus MOB properties that probably are about 30-plus years since they've had redevelopment completed. I have been out, looked at those properties and see some real upside. So when you get into the different buckets, that's what's you're going to see.

Probably is opportunity over time and with a little more focus. But I don't relate those assets to the assets that we've kept. There's a difference in terms of the performance.

I think that the primary risk is the one that senior housing is going through now, which is more of a cyclical risk of normal real estate fundamentals of supply and demand. And we're at a pretty high point in terms of life science, but we're very concentrated in the very best markets with the very best properties. So I think that's going to be very stable, and it's going to be -- we're setting some almost kind of really nice precedent with this Cove development that we've got going. I think that you're going to see maybe that as an innovation that we'll want to duplicate, and probably others as well, where you see more of the life science and research properties more on campuses than spread out, where they can get a lot of amenities and synergies. So we feel like we're in a pretty good place here. And I think the simple answer to your question is real estate is always a cyclical business. We can't help that, but that's better than having fundamental problems with an asset class."
