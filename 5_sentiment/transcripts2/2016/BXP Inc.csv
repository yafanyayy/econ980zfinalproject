Our focus today, in addition to the quarter and market conditions will be a review of 2015 and our outlook for 2016. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share $0.01 above consen",1572,"Thank you, Arista, and good morning, everyone. Our focus today, in addition to the quarter and market conditions will be a review of 2015 and our outlook for 2016. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share $0.01 above consensus and $0.01 above our guidance after adjusting for The Seasons transaction. Based on recent leasing accomplishments, as well as a significant lease termination we just completed for $45 million, we have also increased the midpoint of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.26. We leased 1.4 million square feet in the fourth quarter and 5.2 million square feet for all of 2015 and our portfolio occupancy is now 91.4%. 
So moving to the operating environment. The U.S. economy continues to grow albeit at modest level with full year 2016 GDP growth expected to be 2% to 2.5%. There was a modest slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2015 as GDP rose only 0.7%. The jobs picture remains healthy with 292,000 jobs created in December, 2.7 million jobs created in all of 2015, 2.5% wage growth for last year and 5% unemployment, albeit with lower workforce participation rates. Economic growth continues to be uneven with energy-related industrial sectors in recessions. Our markets that are driven by technology and life sciences are continuing to exhibit tightening leasing conditions. Office markets nationally are also firming. The data indicates that absorption was 17 million square feet for the fourth quarter and 46 million square feet for all of 2015. Vacancy ended the year at 13.8%, down 20 basis points for the fourth quarter and 50 basis points for the year and asking rent rose 4.7% with Boston and San Francisco experiencing the highest increases. Construction levels actually dropped in the fourth quarter to 2% of existing stock but are up 9% from a year ago. Financial markets have become very volatile in 2016 driven largely by concerns that weaker economic growth outside the U.S. and falling oil prices will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy. Most economic data indicates a continued slowdown in the Chinese economy, the domestic equity market in China is down over 20% year-to-date and fears of additional currency devaluation are pervasive. China has funded an estimated $600 billion of currency reserves over the last 6 months, supporting the remedy to its current trading level. Local regulators appeared to be taking additional steps to stem capital flows out of China. Oil prices have also dropped nearly 50% from highest last year to approximately $33 a barrel. This has caused disruption in the industrial component of the U.S. economy and widening credit spreads for high-yield particularly related to the energy sector. We are also monitoring with interest investment activity from oil based fund as several Middle Eastern funds have reportedly been redeeming more liquid offshore investment than 2015. And lastly, despite the Federal Reserve raising short-term rates 25 basis points in December, the 10 year U.S. Treasury has dropped below 1.9%, given all the global economic uncertainty mentioned. 
So what is all of these mean for real estate, investment activity and valuation? Our instincts that are investment activity from some of oil base sovereign wealth fund should slow due to decreasing inflows and capital needs at home and that flows from China will recede due to increasing capital control. However, there continue to be numerous large-scale office deals completed in gateway markets at attractive pricing. Recent examples included selling 787 7th Avenue to CalPERS and 1285 6th Avenue to RXR and Blackstone selling 4 assets in Westwood to Douglas Summit as well as 500 Street and 222 Berkeley in Boston to Oxford and JPMorgan. All these deals were large and completed with North American led investors at cap rates in the mid-4% range or lower. Our REIT is capital values for high-quality assets are holding up, notwithstanding in some cases, fewer bidders and a somewhat geographic rotation of investor appetite. Further as a tailwind, long-term interest rates are low and dropping while cap rates spreads to treasuries are above long-term average have been rising. Investment yields and cash flow stability from high-quality real estate assets will continue to be an attractive investment alternative to fixed income. Our capital strategy remains largely unchanged in that we are investing more in new developments versus acquisitions which will be funded partially by additional dispositions. On acquisitions, we continue to actively review new investments but do not anticipate significant investments and stabilize buildings given continued robust pricing. We are however, seeing a pick up in value add and development opportunities in our core markets. 
Moving to disposition. In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of Innovation Place in San Jose for $207 million, including a gain of $79 million and a land parcel sale in Maryland for $13 million. Our total dispositions for 2015 were $584 million on an hour share basis which led to a special dividend of $1.25 per share, which brings our total special dividend paid since 2005 to over $21 per share. For 2016, we expect to continue to sell non-core assets and assets where we are able to achieve extraordinary pricing, but likely at levels below 2015. Our balance sheet is strong. We have already raised the cash to fund our significant capital need and we see upside in many of our core assets through roll ups and redevelopment. We recently sold 7 Kendall Center to MIT for $105 million based on a pre-agreed option associated with MIT's tenancy in the building. We also placed under contract for sale our Reston Eastgate site to a corporate user who will retain us to build a corporate facility for their use, further enhancing the Reston area. Though difficult to estimate precisely at this time, we would expect to $200 million to $250 million of total assets sales in 2016. 
Moving to development. Our activities remain robust. In the fourth quarter, we placed in service from our development pipeline, 535 Mission Street and 690 Folsom Street in San Francisco, the Point in the Waltham and Annapolis Junction in Annapolis, Maryland. In the aggregate, these projects cost $254 million and with the exception of Annapolis Junction, which is currently not lease, we're delivered 98% occupied and an unleverage cash yield of 7.8% which is above our target. Also in the fourth quarter, we added to our active development pipeline, the Hub on Causeway at North Station, which is the podium phase of our North Station development in Boston, where we have signed anchor deals for 60% of the 200,000 square-foot retail component and are negotiating 85,000 square feet of additional retail and office leases. North Station is a very significant mixed use development being built adjacent to 1 of Boston's busiest transit stations and the TD Garden. This project is a 50% partnership with Delaware North and will provide us with significant long-term profit opportunity. At year-end, our development pipeline consisted of 11 projects representing 4.6 million square feet and $2.6 billion in project costs. Our budgeted NOI yield for these projects is in excess of 7%. The commercial component of the pipeline is 58% pre-leased. We have all the cash, $1.5 billion, required to complete the development of the portfolio, which should add materially to our company's growth over the next 4 years. 
Looking ahead into 2016 on development. We have numerous entitled projects and new starts will be highly dependent on pre-leasing activity. More specifically, we secured 940,000 square feet in additional entitlements from the city of Cambridge for Kendall Center and are in discussion with several tenants for pre-leasing a 360,000 square-foot office building. For Springfield Metro Center in Northern Virginia, we are pursuing a 600,000 square-foot requirement from the TSA. Again, predicated on substantial pre-leasing, other potential projects for this year are 20 City Point in Walton, Mass. and Blockside office in Reston. All of these projects aggregate 1.5 million square feet. 
Lastly, we continue to devote time and resources to refurbishing our existing high-quality asset base. As Citibank vacates 399 Park Avenue in late 2017, we'll be completing upgrades to the facade entrance, roof decks and outdoor spaces. A redevelopment of the office and retail space in the low rise 601 Lexington Avenue was also planned. We are also updating lobbies and common space at 1330 Connecticut Avenue and Metropolitan Square in Washington, D.C. to accommodate existing tenant renewals and attract new tenants. 
So in summary, we are very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. We have a very clear plan to improve and lease our existing assets as well as add new buildings through development to our portfolio. All of which we expect to result in attractive FFO growth over the coming years. We have selected non-core assets for sale to ensure continued portfolio refreshment. We have significant entitled and unentitled land holdings that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt-to-EBITDA below 6x and with much of our upcoming debt maturities having now been either refinanced or hedged. This strong capital position will also allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that may present themselves in the coming quarter due to increasingly turbulent financial market conditions. Now, over to Doug for a further review of our markets."

So it seems like everyday we seem to jump on this roller coaster of global volatility in the financial markets. But I do want to step back and just sort of take a little bit of a prospective here. So about 8 months a",2891,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So it seems like everyday we seem to jump on this roller coaster of global volatility in the financial markets. But I do want to step back and just sort of take a little bit of a prospective here. So about 8 months ago when we were in the conference, I think almost every meeting we had was dominated by questions focused on signs of weakness in the tech markets, the lack of public IPOs, questionable valuations of unicorns, whether there was a looming shadow vacancy in our tech -- biotech markets due to potential slowing from venture capital sources and that all of this was sort of going to be precipitating the market correction. I think honestly that these are the same questions that we were asked in November and they're the same questions that are on everyone's mind today. They continue to be top of mind. So just take that perspective as I give my comments. You're going to recall that the way we've been characterizing the Bay Area real estate market is really 1 of, as I would refer to, healthy where the activity is really pretty similar to what it was in 2013, which was a really good year, but clearly off the spike that we saw in 2014. And I think the pace of activity that we're getting today is pretty similar to the same activity that we've been seeing in the back half of 2015 and it's pretty constant. And I just sort of want to supply some facts to back that up. So in the Northern Peninsula in the Valley, in the last quarter or so, Apple has expanded by another 1 million square feet. Google has leased over 500,000 square feet and they've entered into additional building purchase agreements. Palo Alto Networks has expanded by 300,000 square feet. Facebook has taken on 200,000 Square feet. As Owen said, we were the beneficiary of Broadcom's desire to expand and they purchased our 574,000 square feet at Innovation Center and have filed permit for the next phase of development, which is up to 537,000 square feet. And then, on top of all that, there've been another 12 fields in the Valley for over 1.3 million square feet with block of space over 50,000 square feet. And we, in January, signed 88,000 square feet of renewals and expansions in our single-story Mountainview asset that's R&D property over $48 triple net rent. If you go to the city. Leasing activity in the city finished off 2015, clearly off of the 2014 level high when Salesforce and Twitter and Dropbox all combined for over 1.4 million square feet, just those 3 tenants. But again, it was the exact same level we were in 2013. Tech demand continues to average around 50% of the volume in the city and there has been a pretty consistent volume of deals. Now recently, there's been continued attention to sublet space. Well, the Dropbox sublet, which was planned at China basin, it was all absorbed by Stripe and Lift. There was some Twitter availability that was described in the mid-market area and it's all under lease negotiation. In fact, there's over 850,000 square feet of tech leasing that's expected to get done in the first quarter and it's almost entirely expansion led by Air B&B, which has taken an additional 150,000 square feet from the former Dolby building. The largest block of sublet space that was in our portfolio was a 5-4 block in EC3 coming back from the Morgan Lewis mortgage that occurred a few years ago. We leased 4 of those 5 floors. Now there is some speculative construction in the city, 181 Fremont and 350 Bush and The Exchange are all under construction and they're adding about 1.4 million square feet of space. In Park Tower, at Trend Bay is supposedly going to be -- sorry, another 750,000 square feet. But again, the overall vacancy rate in the city of San Francisco is under 6% and people continue to talk about the prop issues there but the point is that after the FAR deposit in October, the bank was at about 1.75 million square feet but the first admission project, if 598 Brand Street get approved, the bank will be empty. No additional supply availability. At Embarcadero Center, we completed another 220,000 square feet of office leasing during a quarter. 4 floors totaled 162,000 square feet and new tenants moving into Embarcadero made up 145,000 square feet of that. During the third quarter, you may recall and I'm going to refer to this a few times, we described our ""revenue bridge"" to get into the end of 2017 and I think one of the sell side analyst on our last call sort of asked, well, so how much of that's in the bag back? Well in Embarcadero Center, the larger deals that we completed last quarter, about 95,000 square feet, are going to add about 2.4 million square feet to that 2017 revenue versus '15. The new floor deals that we did this quarter, 145,000 square feet are going to add 4.4 million square feet. We have another 4 more floors close to being completed, another 89,000 square feet. Those floors a going to add 5.1 million square feet for a total of 12 million square feet of fundamental growth from Embarcadero Center. So $12 million of incremental growth from Embarcadero Center. The mark-to-market on these transactions is between 40% and 70% on a gross basis. And none of those transactions are in our same-store statistics for the quarter. In fact, there's only about 28,000 square feet of CBD deals in the San Francisco region in that same store data in our supplemental. Traditional fiery of demand continues to be very strong at Embarcadero Center and across the city. At 535 Mission, we're at 99% leased. So this is the last time you're going to be hearing about that project for quite some time. We've completed 51,000 square feet of leases. Average growth gross rent of about $80 a square foot. The building should be fully contributing by the third quarter of '16, cash returned 7.8%, 150 basis points greater than our pro forma. I have hope to announce that we had signed leases for additional 5 floors at Salesforce Tower, 108,000 square feet, bringing that to 821,000 square feet of leasing of that 1.4 million square foot building or 59%. While, 2 of the leases are back or 2 of those floors but the remainder is yet to come in and we expect to see it hopefully by this Friday. So we're going to have 108,000 square feet of leasing done. We're adding venture capital and management consulting clients as industries are being represented in the building. We still have active single and multi floor discussions going on with asset managers and hedge funds and more VCs, law firms, consulting firms, real estate brokerage firms and other non-tech service firms that encompass another 300,000 plus square foot of space. Activity continues to be really strong at Salesforce Tower. And most of these requirements are lease expiration driven occupancy. Tenants are recognizing the value and excitement about the Salesforce Tower and wanting to be there. So again, in summary, activity across the California portfolio, our Bay Area portfolio continues to be very strong. 
Let's jump over to Manhattan Midtown. Again, not much has changed on our activity and expectations for the Midtown market. Our tone has been pretty consistent for the last 24 months, somewhat subdued. When we made the strategic decision to get in front of our many pending lease expirations due to the large block future availability to supply in the market. And our view that providing early release in the form of taking back some space in small increments will be the best interest of both us and our customers. Well, during this quarter, we completed another 11 deals, 120,000 square feet. 8 of them had starting rents above $90,000 a square foot and 6 were above $100,000 a square foot. Compared to the last quarter, where we did 12 deals, 90,000 were over, square feet -- in 10 deals over $90 a square foot and 7 deals over $100 a Square Foot. Now, it's clear that during periods of high stock and credit market volatility, many things due in fact distract the high end users. And while some of the active tenants are probably elongating their decision-making process, they continue to look for space and sublet space in Midtown is at an 8 year low. In 2014, there were 570,000 square feet of leases done with starting rents between $90 and $99 a square foot. In 2015, there was more than 1.2 million. For deals over $100 a square foot, there was over 1 million square feet in 2015. The reason I talked about this is because the bulk of our availability and rollover in our portfolio in the next few years occurred in spaces with that command rents in excess of $90 or $100 a square foot. Now transaction size continues to be small, with the preponderance of the activity under 20,000 square feet for nonrenewal, which is the reason we have, again strategically, decide to cut off the remaining floors that we have at 250 West 55th Street and we have leases out for all of our remaining prebuilt suites and we have signed half of our deals on the 2 of the 3 available floors that we have. We have signed leases now for 242,000 square feet with incremental gross revenues of $18 million that will be exhibiting in 2017, another component of our bridge. We signed a termination agreement last night with a tenant that leaves 85,000 square feet in a combination of 1 high-rise floor, the second floor and a portion of the ground-level space at 250 West 55th Street. While working with the tenant on the transaction that will allow them to minimize their future obligations while recognizing both the cost and the time associated with finding a replacement tenant, the parties agree to a onetime payment and a transfer of the responsibility of retenanting the building to Boston Properties. That space was never built out and we never provided TI. 
Switching over to 399. As Owen said, we've unveiled our plan for the upgrade, including the addition of outdoor terraces in our ""Oasis in the Sky"", as we position the building to relapse 640,000 Square feet of 2017 explorations. Those are late '17 explanations. We are in lease negotiations now on 200,000 square feet of that space and we completed our first full floor deal in the mid-rise where we have pricing the space with starting rent around $115 a square foot. There are a number of medium-sized financial institutions with 2018 and '19 explorations that really value to be more affordable, low-rise large block space, we have those 165,000 --  100,000 floors and 55,000 square foot floors but with connectivity to our slightly more expensive space in the mid-rise. 
Going down to Washington, D.C. 2/3 of our activity this quarter in the Washington area was in Northern Virginia where we completed 128,000 square feet of leases with the GSA, renewal at our VA95 project and also some GA -- GSA contract dependent expansions that are Kingstowne projects. Then we also did 10 small transactions in Reston Town Center. In January, we completed a 60,000 square-foot renewal at the Town Center with starting rents of over $54 a square foot. And again, if you compare that to the total, were rents are on average of $33 to $35 a square foot, a premium from Reston continues to show. Reston is 97% leased. Our signature residential project is under construction and we are in lease negotiations for 80% of the 25,000 square feet of retail that's associated with that project. And for our leasing team followed its typical pattern given the lack of blocks of space and the continued demand in Reston, we should have a lead tenant for the 275,000 square foot signature office development sometime in 2016. In the CBD of D.C., we completed our second office lease at 601 Ave. and we have pretty good activity o the remaining 47,000 Square feet. Our largest availability is going to be at Metropolitan Square where we have 120,000 square foot tenant expiring at the end of first quarter. We are in active discussions on more than 110,000 square feet of that upcoming availability. Our view is that the overall market conditions in D.C. really haven't changed much. On the margin, it's probably a little bit more GSA related leasing that's anticipated for 2016, but it's probably going to have some economic limits that will push it a little bit further out of the CBD in the East end. The district continues to be very competitive. 
The majority of our Boston activity during the quarter was in suburban Waltham, Lexington. The Waltham Metro West Market, a ""suburban market"" continues to get stronger driven by organic expansion. This quarter, we did 16 leases in our suburban portfolio for 413,000 square feet and we have another 200,000 under active negotiation. Rents have increased 25% over the last 18 months. Delivery of the Waltham development is on target, August for 10 City Point  October for 1265 Main. Both projects come into service 100% leased. In January, the city of Boston learned that General Electric had chosen to move its corporate headquarters to the city. It's expected to bring about 800 jobs, but that's really not what the issue is. What it really speaks to is the overall economic ecosystem of the area. This region continues to be a magnet for both the life science industry, established technology companies, as well as start app tech and maker organizations. This has led to continual improvement in business growth in the greater Boston area. The East Cambridge office and land market is probably the largest beneficiary of growth and if that has the best economic of any market that we're in. With 6.5 million square feet of office space and just under 8 million of lab, base, direct vacancy is under 4%. Office rents continue to achieve new peaks with the most recent transaction to being completed on the office space of over $65 triple net with annual increases. Head improvement allowances have been reduced and are not below $60 per square foot. As Owen mentioned, we finished out the year with an up-zoning of our Kendall Square development that's going to allow for the eventual development of 540,000 square feet of commercial office and 400,000 square feet of residential, including 80,000 up for sale. We're having substantive conversations right now with a number of existing tenants that are searching for growth and looking for that office space. The other news for our Cambridge portfolio is the recent decision of Microsoft to relocate a group that it has at 255 Main Street to the suburbs over the next 24 months. This is likely going to mean that we will have an opportunity to leased 125,000 square feet of space that will not going to be expiring until 2021. With the site, RFP expected to be issued in May and the zoning applications still in process, we would expect more Cambridge tenants with near-term space need to be likely exploring suburban Waltham in Lexington and the Boston CBD because there's simply no place to go in the city of Cambridge right now. The Boston CBD continues to be a good market as supply has been absorbed over the last 2 years, though there is some speculative development the seaport of a modest size building. Again, GE has not landed on where its new home is going to be and it could take existing inventory or go to a new development. At 120 St. James, where we have 170,000 square feet of availability, there are now a number of tenants reviewing our options at the building and they range from 32,000 square feet of single floor up to the entire 170,000 square-foot block. 
At 200 Clarendon, we're in lease negotiations with tenants that will fill 100 floors in the high rise, and leave us with 90,000 square feet on floors 45, 46 and 47. High end demand in Boston is typically been for users under 30,000 square feet and we expect to lease the spaces in smaller increments. We have completed our multi-tenant transaction at 100 Federal Street were Putnam has signed a leased for 250,000 square feet, Wellington has executed a long-term renewal and relocation on 156,000 square feet its current using and BofA has been able to realize some space and rent savings by reducing its footprint by 137,000 square feet. All of the available space at 107 Federal Street has now been spoken for. Again, as you think about our bridge to 2017, these transactions at 100 Federal Street contribute approximately $6 million of incremental revenue. So last fall, we outlined $80 million of incremental revenue from our existing portfolio that we hope to have in place by the end of '17. Given all the transactions I've described, we now have commitments for approximately $36 million of that $80 million. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

As you know, we deceased our $640 million mortgage loan on 200 Clarendon Street in December. That resulted in a $0.13 per share charge for our fourth quarter earnings. To replenish our cash, we closed on $1 billion 10 year bond deal at an all in yield of 3.77%. The excess funds will be used to repay our $211 million mortgage on Fountain Square, that is open for prepayment at par in April, as well as fund our future development costs. We've reduced the cash interest rate by 200 basis points with this bond deal versus the expiring loan and the annual cash interest savings will be $11.5 million, even though we borrowed an additional $150 million of proceeds. On a GAAP basis, the interest rate reduction is 75 basis points as both of the refinance loans were above market at acquisition, so they have a noncash fair value interest component that is amortized into and reduced its GAAP interest expense. Clearly, the market volatility that Owen described is having an impact on the credit market. It's driving credit spreads wider  particularly as you move out the risk spectrum. The bond market continue to operate efficiently though at high-quality issuers like ourselves have access on spreads that are 20 to 30 basis points wider than 155 basis point spread that we issued in early January. Though there are frequently days when the global volatility does necessitate patience. With the rally and the tenure of below 2%, all in borrowing costs really haven't moved much for us. The mortgage markets have been a more fickle with CMBS spreads widening, more significantly, especially in the conduit world and for single asset deals that are in secondary markets are not fully stabilized. For high-quality stabilized properties in strong locations, the markets remained active with both life companies and CMBS issuers actively putting out mortgage money with 50% to 60% leverage loans pricing at a 4% area for 10 years. The banks are also increasingly active in financing 5 to 7 year term loans on a floating rate basis at competitive spreads. So although we see some volatility, good quality assets like ours continue to be able to secure attractively priced long-term financing. With the most active buyers for our asset class looking to employ lower leverage, the financing markets remain favorable. 
I also want to note that over the past 3 years, our asset sales strategy and the delivery of development properties at superior yields has translated into a reduction in our leverage position. As our new deliveries stabilize, we expect these ratios will continue to improve and create additional investment capacity on our balance sheet. I just want to quickly touch on our earnings for the quarter. We reported funds from operation of $1.28 per share after adjusting for this season's charge, we came in at $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range, which was related the better performance in the portfolio. Operating expenses came in better than budgeted while our revenues are pretty tightly aligned with our expectations. For 2016, we are increasing our NOI projections from are in service portfolio. As Doug detailed, we continue to see good leasing activity, particularly in San Francisco and in Boston. In Boston, we closed the Putnam lease and although will not impact earnings until 2017, the transaction included a relocation and the long terms extension with Wellington with future that will be straight line in 2016. We're also seeing increased activity on our vacancy, both in the high rise space at 200 Clarendon Street and at the Prudential Tower where we could see additional income from it later this year. At Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, we continue to be successful in completing a number of these renewables with significant rental rate increases and have activity on our availability. If these renewals are signed, our GAAP income reflects the straight-line impact of the rental rate increases, though the cash impact will not occur until the future renewal date, which is in most cases, later in 2016 or in 2017. As Doug mentioned, we terminated an 85,000 square-foot lease at 250 West 55th Street and receive a significant termination payment of $45 million. Also at 601 Lexington Avenue, we are finalizing a termination with its tenant in the high-rise, which will enable Citibank to relocate out of the low-rise office building, so it can be vacated for repositioning. Overall, we expect our 2016 termination income to be approximately $47.5 million higher than our guidance last quarter. These lease terminations will result in lower future rental income until such time as we find replacement tenants. The lost income is projected to be approximately $11 million in 2016. Given it's lumpy nature, our practice is to exclude termination income from our same property NOI guidance but it does have an impact. The leasing success that we are executing exceeded our expectations and would have improved our GAAP same-store NOI growth projection by about 50 basis points. However, the loss rental income related to our decision to enter into lease termination has more than offset this growth. The net impact on our GAAP same-store property NOI projection is a decrease of approximately 25 basis points from our guidance last quarter. The loss termination -- income from termination also impacts our cash same property NOI though we still project growth of 1% to 3% over 2015. As a reminder, our same-store property growth is weighed down by rollover at 767 5th Avenue and at 601 Lexington Avenue. Both of these are consolidated joint venture properties. The growth in our share of same property NOI is approximately 100 basis points higher for both GAAP and cash. We project our noncash straight-line rental income to be $35 million to $50 million in 2016 which is higher than our projection last quarter. The completion of our bond deal takes care of the $1 billion of our near-term debt maturities. We now have $2.9 billion of consolidated debt expiring over the next 2 years, of which $2.3 billion represents our share. These loans carry a cash interest rate of 5.9% and a GAAP interest rate of 4.4%. We have hedged the 10 year swap rate on $1 billion of the expected refinancing. The only material financing activity in our 2016 projections is the refinancing of our $350 million mortgage loan on Embarcadero Center 4 in the fourth quarter. This loan has a cash interest rate of 6.1% and a GAAP interest rate of 7%. So our interest expense run rate should be lower at the end of the year. Overall, we project our 2016 full-year interest expense to be $400 million to $450 million, which is net of capitalized interest of $40 million to $50 million. The impact of these changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operations from operations to $5.78 to $5.93 per share. This is an increase of $0.26 per share at the midpoint which consists of $0.21 per share from the net impact of tenant termination and $0.05 per share from better projected performance at our same property portfolio. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, if you could turn the call over to questions, that would be great. Thank you."

But on the New York side, we don't see any change over the last few months in the leasing. I would say the only change that's really noteworthy and Doug has mentioned the supply for a number of times is the deal with the news that didn't get done at 2. So that's 2.8 million square-foot building that's not getting built downtown. So on the supply side, we understand that, that's the way out but we do look way out, let's say over the next 3 or 4 years. So certainly on the supply side, we don't need another 2 million square foot building on Sixth Avenue to come to the market in terms of the supply. So we're just moving along in New York.

I think that in the last 4 or 5 years, the city of San Francisco has reshaped itself so dramatically in terms of the tenant demand that the diversity of companies and the strength of those companies is so different that I think that it will be much more difficult to sort of look at any 1 particular industry or any 1 particular company and say, okay, things have really changed. I mean, clearly, a overall GDP reduction and a series of layoffs from major technology companies would be the thing that I think would make it a clear cut type of a demarcation but again, we just don't see that. I mean, we see these large tech companies that have got pretty strong balance sheets and pretty global reaches now being able to weather the storm in a pretty significant manner and with business strategies that have a very long term focus associated with them. So there is no question that there is going to be failures in certain tech industries. All of the mobile payment companies are not going to survive. I mean  there are, in all likelihood, a couple of unicorns that are not going to make just because from an valuation -- from a capital spec the my perspective. But we spent a tremendous amount of time looking at the demand from the sort of startup community versus the ""traditional now"" and more fundamentally sound technology company and on a relative basis, the city of San Francisco is in a really good place.

First of all, I can't comment on the specifics of the tenant coming or the purchaser coming to Reston. And there is a little bit movement towards owning the space. As you know the accounting change taking place in '18 will have an impact on many corporations on how they booked their occupancy costs. But I still think that the defense contractors want to have, given the uncertainty of the long-term government contracts, they still want to stay relatively short in the lease terms, so they're not held out with either a long-term lease obligations or the lack of liquidity by owning real estate. So I think the isolated examples, John, but I don't see a general trend. Relative to the market for cyber command, obviously, we're optimistic that Fort Meade will continue to pump out both contracts and result in jobs. The Dallas corridor still is very strong with the presence of major Intel activities out there, NRO and CIA. So we like our positions on both of those markets. I will say that corridor is relatively soft and I think that's more about the fact that now Tyson's with the silver line has opened up another market that those defense contractors can go to with better access and lower occupancy cost. So that still faces challenges but we're putting our money in the Dallas corridor score door and the Fort Meade market."

That's different than the amortization of the transaction cost into that building and I guess, I would argue that in many cases, the expectation proceeded with what these buildings will do in the future is an important component to how they're being valued and so while on a short-term basis, it may be true that in a particular building where our lease rolling at a ""flat mark-to-market "" and you're transaction costs on a net effective basis is slightly dilutive, if there's a perception and in many of those markets, there's a perception which is based upon reality that rental rates will grow over time, there is significant value that's likely embedded in that cash flow from that particular lease on a forward basis. So that's how you have to think about it. Now there are in fact cases where we don't have a view that there is going to be rental rate growth of any significance and as Owen suggested, those are buildings were we are sort of saying, ""You know, leasing things up and selling these buildings might be the best course of valor here."" And so we have done a number of those sort of modest pruning over the couple of years were in fact never agreed with you that there isn't really a lot of value to be attributed to doing additional leasing in this area."

Obviously, in prior years, we have sold a tremendous amount of assets and we have delivered, I think it's $8 a share in special dividends in the last few years. And so we've lost income from those assets that we sold. We replaced it with development and we've elected to keep our dividend -- our regular dividend in line because we've been able to based on our taxable income.

We're actively looking at new investment opportunities in all of our markets. We have on balance sheet today actually, a very significant pipeline of both entitled and unentitled land that we're going to continue to push through the entitlement and permitting process. New projects at this stage, it depends. It could be for a future cycle. I suppose it's for prospects exist for this cycle probably less likely. I just want to add a couple of things to that last question. So we have interestingly, a shadow, shadow pipeline that we talked about before. So as an example, in Reston, Virginia, when light rail comes, we are going to get an up-zoning in density and Peter, you can describe what we're going to be getting there on the land that we own in our existing footprint. In Boston, we are in the midst of beginning our Back Bay train station up zoning entitlements for up to 1.75 million square feet of space. So there are projects like that that are more long-range than our 2017 starts and probably 2018 or '19 or '20 starts that are physically in the company's balance sheet right now and we just need to perfect them. And then we have buildings like Fort of Harrison where again we're in the permitting process for up to 900,000 square feet and likely probably be a little less than that but when Central eventually gets permitted and we're in a position to start rebuilding, it's a market where we're looking for things. We talked about Dock72 where we're hopefully will be under construction of the next few weeks were in the first building, we have a potential to do another 1 million square feet. So again  there's a really good embedded inventory of places in the company that we can add inventory over time. 
So I think that completes all the questions. Hopefully  we've been able to demonstrate to you the whole progress we've made on our plans. Thank you very much for your attention this morning."

Our focus today, in addition to the quarter and market conditions, will be a review of 2015 and our outlook for 2016. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share $0.01 above consensus and $0.01 above our guidance after adjusting for the defeasance transaction. Based on recent leasing accomplishments as well as a significant lease termination we just completed for $45 million, we have also increased the midpoint of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.26. We leased 1.4 million square feet in the fourth quarter and 5.2 million square feet for all of 2015 and our portfolio occupancy is now 91.4%. 
So moving to the operating environment. The U.S. economy continues to grow albeit at modest levels with full year 2016 GDP growth expected to be 2% to 2.5%. There was a modest slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2015 as GDP rose only 0.7%. The jobs picture remains healthy with 292,000 jobs created in December, 2.7 million jobs created in all of 2015, 2.5% wage growth for last year and 5% unemployment, albeit with lower workforce participation rates. Economic growth continues to be uneven with energy-related industrial sectors in recessions. Our markets that are driven by technology and life sciences are continuing to exhibit tightening leasing conditions. Office markets nationally are also firming. The data indicates that absorption was 17 million square feet for the fourth quarter and 46 million square feet for all of 2015. Vacancy ended the year at 13.8%, down 20 basis points for the fourth quarter and 50 basis points for the year and asking rents rose 4.7% with Boston and San Francisco experiencing the highest increases. Construction levels actually dropped in the fourth quarter to 2% of existing stock but are up 9% from a year ago. Financial markets have become very volatile in 2016 driven largely by concerns that weaker economic growth outside the U.S. and falling oil prices will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy. Most economic data indicates a continued slowdown in the Chinese economy. The domestic equity market in China is down over 20% year-to-date and fears of additional currency devaluation are pervasive. China has funded an estimated $600 billion of currency reserves over the last 6 months, supporting the remedy to its current trading level. Local regulators appear to be taking additional steps to stem capital flows out of China. Oil prices have also dropped nearly 50% from highs last year to approximately $33 a barrel. This has caused disruption in the industrial component of the U.S. economy and widening credit spreads for high-yield names particularly related to the energy sector. We are also monitoring with interest investment activity from oil based sovereign well funds as several Middle Eastern funds have reportedly been redeeming more liquid offshore investments in 2015. And lastly, despite the Federal Reserve raising short-term rates 25 basis points in December, the 10-year U.S. Treasury has dropped below 1.9% given all the global economic uncertainty mentioned. 
So what does all this mean for real estate, investment activity and valuation? Our instincts are that investment activity from some of oil based sovereign wealth funds should slow due to the decreasing inflows and capital needs at home and that flows from China will recede due to increasing capital control. However, there continue to be numerous large-scale office deals completed in gateway markets at attractive pricing. Recent examples included AXA; selling 787 Seventh Avenue to CalPERS and 1285 Sixth Avenue to RXR and Blackstone selling 4 assets in Westwood to Douglas Emmett as well as 500 Boylston St. and 222 Berkeley in Boston to Oxford and JPMorgan. All these deals were large and completed with North American led investors at cap rates in the mid-4% range or lower. Our REIT is capital values for high-quality assets are holding up, notwithstanding in some cases, fewer bidders and a somewhat geographic rotation of investor appetite. Further as a tailwind, long-term interest rates are low and dropping, while cap rates spreads to treasuries are above long-term averages and rising. Investment yields and cash flow stability from high-quality real estate assets will continue to be an attractive investment alternative to fixed income. Our capital strategy remains largely unchanged in that we are investing more in new developments versus acquisitions which will be funded partially by additional dispositions. On acquisitions, we continue to actively review new investments but do not anticipate significant investments in stabilized buildings given continued robust pricing. We are, however, seeing a pick up in value add and development opportunities in our core market. 
Moving to disposition. In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of Innovation Place in San Jose for $207 million, including a gain of $79 million and a land parcel sale in Maryland for $13 million. Our total dispositions for 2015 were $584 million on an hour share basis which led to a special dividend of $1.25 per share, which brings our total special dividend paid since 2005 to over $21 per share. For 2016, we expect to continue to sell noncore assets and assets where we are able to achieve extraordinary pricing likely at levels below 2015. Our balance sheet is strong. We have already raised the cash to fund our significant capital needs and we see upside in many of our core assets through roll ups and redevelopment. We recently sold 7 Kendall Center to MIT for $105 million based on a pre-agreed option associated with MIT's tenancy in the building. We also placed under contract for sale our Reston Eastgate site to a corporate user who will retain us to build a corporate facility for their use, further enhancing the Reston area. Though difficult to estimate precisely at this time, we would expect $200 million to $250 million of total assets sales in 2016. 
Moving to development. Our activities remain robust. In the fourth quarter, we placed in service from our development pipeline, 535 Mission Street and 690 Folsom Street in San Francisco, the Point in the Waltham and Annapolis Junction in Annapolis, Maryland. In the aggregate, these projects cost $254 million and with the exception of Annapolis Junction, which is currently not leased, we delivered 98% occupied and an unleverage cash yield of 7.8% which is above our target. Also, in the fourth quarter, we added to our active development pipeline, The Hub on Causeway at North Station, which is the podium phase of our North Station development in Boston, where we have signed anchor deals for 60% of the 200,000 square-foot retail component and are negotiating 85,000 square feet of additional retail and office leases. North Station is a very significant mixed use development being built adjacent to one of Boston's busiest transit stations and the TD Garden. This project is a 50% partnership with Delaware North and will provide us with significant long-term profit opportunity. At year end, our development pipeline consisted of 11 projects representing 4.6 million square feet and $2.6 billion in project costs. Our budgeted NOI yield for these projects is in excess of 7%. The commercial component of the pipeline is 58% pre-leased. We have all the cash, $1.5 billion, required to complete the development of the portfolio, which should add materially to our company's growth over the next 4 years. 
Looking ahead into 2016 on development. We have numerous entitled projects and new starts will be highly dependent on pre-leasing activity. More specifically, we secured 940,000 square feet in additional entitlement from the city of Cambridge for Kendall Center and are in discussions with several tenants for pre-leasing a 360,000 square-foot office building. For Springfield Metro Center in Northern Virginia, we are pursuing a 600,000 square-foot requirement from the TSA. Again, predicated on substantial pre-leasing, other potential projects for this year are 20 CityPoint in Waltham, Mass. and Block 5 office in Reston. All these projects aggregate 1.5 million square feet. 
Lastly, we continue to devote time and resources to refurbishing our existing high-quality asset base. As Citibank vacates 399 Park Avenue in late 2017, we'll be completing upgrades to the facade entrance, roof decks and outdoor spaces. A redevelopment of the office and retail space in the low rise at 601 Lexington Avenue was also planned. We are also updating lobbies and common space at 1330 Connecticut Avenue and Metropolitan Square in Washington, D.C. to accommodate existing tenant renewals and attract new tenants. 
So in summary, we are very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. We have a very clear plan to improve and lease our existing assets as well as add new buildings through development to our portfolio. All of which we expect to result in attractive FFO growth over the coming years. We have selected noncore assets for sale to ensure continued portfolio refreshment. We have significant entitled and unentitled land holdings that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt-to-EBITDA below 6x and with much of our upcoming debt maturities having now been either refinanced or hedged. This strong capital position will also allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that may present themselves in the coming quarter due to increasingly turbulent financial market conditions. Now over to Doug for a further review of our markets."

So it seems like everyday we seem to jump on this roller coaster of global volatility in the financial markets. But I do want to step back and just sort of take a little bit of a perspective here. So about 8 months a",2899,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So it seems like everyday we seem to jump on this roller coaster of global volatility in the financial markets. But I do want to step back and just sort of take a little bit of a perspective here. So about 8 months ago, when we were in the NAREIT conference, I think almost every meeting we had was dominated by questions focused on signs of weakness in the tech markets, the lack of public IPOs, questionable valuations of unicorns, whether there was a looming shadow vacancy in our tech -- in our biotech markets due to potential slowing from venture capital sources and that all of this was sort of going to be precipitating a market correction. I think honestly that these are the same questions that we were asked in November and they're the same questions that are on everyone's mind today. They continue to be top of mind. So just take that perspective as I give my comments. You're going to recall that the way we've been characterizing the Bay Area real estate market is really one of, as I would refer to, healthy where the activity is really pretty similar to what it was in 2013, which was a really good year, but clearly off the spike that we saw in 2014. And I think the pace of activity that we're getting today is pretty similar to the same activity that we've been seeing in the back half of 2015 and it's pretty constant. And I just sort of want to supply some facts to back that up. So in the Northern Peninsula and the Valley, in the last quarter or so, Apple has expanded by another million square feet. Google has leased over 500,000 square feet and they've entered into additional building purchase agreements. Palo Alto Networks has expanded by 300,000 square feet. Facebook has taken on 200,000 square feet. As Owen said, we were the beneficiary of Broadcom's desire to expand and they purchased our 574,000 square feet at Innovation Center and have filed permits for the next phase of development, which is up to 537,000 square feet. And then on top of all that, there have been another 12 deals in the Valley for over 1.3 million square feet with blocks of space over 50,000 square feet. And we, in January, signed 88,000 square feet of renewals and expansions in our single-story Mountain View assets that's R&D property over $48 triple net rent. If you go to the city. Leasing activity in the city finished off 2015, clearly off of the 2014 level of high when Salesforce and Twitter and Dropbox all combined for over 1.4 million square feet, just those 3 tenants. But again, it was at the exact same level as we were in 2013. Tech demand continues to average around 50% of the volume in the city and there has been a pretty consistent volume of deals. Now recently, there's been continued attention to sublet space. Well, the Dropbox sublet, which was planned at China basin, it was all absorbed by Stripe and Lyft. There is some Twitter availability that was described in the mid-market area and it's all under lease negotiation. In fact, there's over 850,000 square feet of tech leasing that's expected to get done in the first quarter and it's almost entirely expansion led by Airbnb, which has taken an additional 150,000 square feet from the former Dolby building. The largest block of sublet space that was in our portfolio was a 5-floor block in EC3 coming back from the Morgan Lewis-Bingham merger that occurred a few years ago. We leased 4 of those 5 floors. Now there is some speculative construction in the city, 181 Fremont and 350 Bush and The Exchange are all under construction and they're adding about 1.4 million square feet of space. And Park Tower at Transbay is supposedly going to be -- sorry, it was another 750,000 square feet. But again, the overall vacancy rate in the city of San Francisco is under 6% and people continue to talk about the Prop M and issues there but the point is that after the FAR deposit in October, the bank was at about 1.75 million square feet. But if the First and Mission project, and 590 Brannan St. get approved, the bank will be empty. No additional supply availability. At Embarcadero Center, we completed another 220,000 square feet of office leasing during the quarter. Full floors totaled 162,000 square feet and new tenants moving into Embarcadero made up 145,000 square feet of that. During the third quarter, you may recall, and I'm going to refer to this a few times, we described our ""revenue bridge"" to get to the end of 2017 and I think one of the sell side analyst on our last call sort of asked, well, so how much of that's in the bag? Well, in Embarcadero Center, the larger deals that we completed last quarter, about 95,000 square feet, are going to add about 2.4 million square feet to that 2017 revenue versus '15. The new floor deals that we did this quarter, 145,000 square feet are going to add 4.4 million square feet. We have another 4 more floors close to being completed, another 89,000 square feet. Those floors a going to add 5.1 million square feet for a total of 12 million square feet of incremental growth from the Embarcadero Center. So -- $12 million of incremental growth from Embarcadero Center. The mark-to-market on these transactions is between 40% and 70% on a gross basis. And none of those transactions are in our same-store statistics for the quarter. In fact, there's only about 28,000 square feet of CBD deals in the San Francisco region in that same store data in our supplemental. Traditional FIRE [ph] demand continues to be very strong at Embarcadero Center and across the city. At 535 Mission, we're now 99% leased. So this is the last time you're going to be hearing about that project for quite some time. We've completed 51,000 square feet of leases. Average gross rent of about $80 a square foot. The building should be fully contributing by the third quarter of '16, cash return 7.8%, 150 basis points greater than our pro forma. I had hoped to announce that we had signed leases for additional 5 floors at Salesforce Tower, 108,000 square feet, bringing us to 821,000 square feet of leasing of that 1.4 million square-foot building or 59%. While 2 of the leases are back for 2 of those floors but the remainder is yet to come in and we expect to see it hopefully by this Friday. So we're going to have 108,000 square feet of leasing done. We're adding venture capital and management consulting clients as industries being represented in the building. We still have active single and multi floor discussions going on with asset managers and hedge funds and more VCs, law firms, consulting firms, real estate brokerage firms and other nontech service firms that encompass another 300,000-plus square feet of space. Activity continues to be really strong at Salesforce Tower. And most of these requirements are lease expiration driven occupancy -- tenants that are recognizing the value and excitement about the Salesforce Tower and wanting to be there. So again, in summary, activity across the California portfolio, our Bay Area portfolio continues to be very strong. 
Let's jump over to Manhattan Midtown. Again, not much has changed on our activity and expectations for the Midtown market. Our tone has been pretty consistent for the last 24 months, somewhat subdued. When we made the strategic decision to get in front of our many pending lease expirations due to the large block future availability, the supply in the market. And our view that providing early release in the form of taking back some space in small increments will be the best interest of both us and our customers. Well, during this quarter, we completed another 11 deals, 120,000 square feet. 8 of them had starting rents above $90 a square foot and 6 were above $100 a square foot. Compared to the last quarter, where we did 12 deals, 90,000 were over -- square feet -- in 10 deals over $90 a square foot and 7 deals over $100 a square foot. Now it's clear that during periods of high stock and credit market volatility, many things do, in fact, distract the high end users. And while some of the active tenants are probably elongating their decision-making process, they continue to look for space and sublet space in Midtown is at an 8 year low. In 2014, there were 570,000 square feet of leases done with starting rents between $90 and $99 a square foot. In 2015, there was more than 1.2 million. For deals over $100 a square foot, there was over 1 million square feet in 2015. The reason I talk about this is because the bulk of our availability and rollover in our portfolio in the next few years occurred in spaces with -- that command rents in excess of $90 or $100 a square foot. Now transaction size continues to be small, with the preponderance of the activity under 20,000 square feet for nonrenewal, which is the reason we have, again strategically, decided to cut up the remaining floors that we have at 250 West 55th Street and we have leases out for all of our remaining prebuilt suites and we have signed half of our deals on the 2 of the 3 available floors that we have. We have signed leases now for 242,000 square feet with incremental gross revenues of $18 million that will be contributing in 2017, another component of our bridge. We signed a termination agreement last night with a tenant that leased 85,000 square feet in a combination of 1 high-rise floor, the second floor and a portion of the ground level space at 250 West 55th Street. While working with the tenant on a transaction that would allow them to minimize their future obligations while recognizing both the cost and the time associated with finding a replacement tenant, the parties agreed to a onetime payment and a transfer of the responsibility of retenanting the building to Boston Properties. That space was never built out and we never provided TI. 
Switching over to 399. As Owen said, we've unveiled our plan for the upgrade, including the addition of outdoor terraces in our ""Oasis in the Sky"", as we position the building to relet 640,000 square feet of 2017 expirations. Those are late '17 expirations. We are in lease negotiations now on 200,000 square feet of that space and we completed our first full floor deal in the mid-rise where we are pricing the space with starting rents around $115 a square foot. There are a number of medium-sized financial institutions with 2018 and '19 expirations that really value to be more affordable, low-rise large block space, we have those 165,000 -- 100,000 square-foot floors and 55,000 square-foot floors but with connectivity to our slightly more expensive space in the mid-rise. 
Going down to Washington, D.C. 2/3 of our activity this quarter in the Washington area was in Northern Virginia where we completed 128,000 square feet of leases with a GSA, renewal at our VA95 project and also some GA -- GSA contract dependent-expansions that are Kingstowne projects. Then we also did 10 small transactions in Reston Town Center. In January, we completed a 60,000 square-foot renewal at the Town Center with starting rents of over $54 a square foot. And again, if you compare that to the Toll Road, where rents are on average $33 to $35 a square foot, the premium from Reston continues to show. Reston is 97% leased. Our signature residential project is under construction and we are in lease negotiations for 80% of the 25,000 square feet of retail that's associated with that project. And if our leasing team follows its typical pattern given the lack of blocks of space and the continued demand in Reston, we should have a lead tenant for the 275,000 square foot signature office development sometime in 2016. In CBD of D.C., we completed our second office lease at 601 Mass Ave. and we have pretty good activity on the remaining 47,000 square feet. Our largest availability is going to be at Metropolitan Square where we have 120,000 square-foot tenant expiring at the end of first quarter. We are in active discussions on more than 110,000 square feet of that upcoming availability. Our view is that the overall market conditions in D.C. really haven't changed much. On the margin, there's probably a little bit more GSA related leasing that's anticipated for 2016, but it's probably going to have some economic limits that will push it a little bit further out of the CBD in the east end. The district continues to be very competitive. 
The majority of our Boston activity during the quarter was in suburban Waltham and Lexington. The Waltham Metro West Market, a ""suburban market"" continues to get stronger driven by organic expansion. This quarter, we did 16 leases in our suburban portfolio for 413,000 square feet and we have another 200,000 under active negotiation. Rents have increased 25% over the last 18 months. Delivery of the Waltham development is on target, August for 10 CityPoint, October for 1265 Main. Both projects come into service 100% leased. In January, the city of Boston learned that General Electric had chosen to move its corporate headquarters to the city. It's expected to bring about 800 jobs, but that's really not what the issue is. What it really speaks to is the overall economic ecosystem of the area. This region continues to be a magnet for both the life science industry, established technology companies as well as startup tech and maker organizations. This has led to continual improvement in business growth in the greater Boston area. The East Cambridge office and lab market is probably the largest beneficiary of growth and that has the best economic of any market that we're in. With 6.5 million square feet of office space and just under 8 million of lab space, direct vacancy is under 4%. Office rents continue to achieve new peaks with the most recent transactions being completed on the office space at over $65 triple net with annual increases. Tenant improvement allowances have been reduced and are not below $60 a square foot. As Owen mentioned, we finished out the year with an up-zoning of our Kendall Square development that's going to allow for the eventual development of 540,000 square feet of commercial office and 400,000 square feet of residential, including 80,000 up for sale. We're having substantive conversations right now with a number of existing tenants that are searching for growth and looking for that office space. The other news for our Cambridge portfolio is the recent decision of Microsoft to relocate a group that it has at 255 Main Street to the suburbs over the next 24 months. This is likely going to mean that we will have an opportunity to lease 125,000 square feet of space that is not going to be expiring until 2021. With the Volpe site RFP expected to be issued in May and the zoning application still in process, we would expect more Cambridge tenants with near-term space needs to be likely exploring suburban Waltham and Lexington and the Boston CBD because there's simply no place to go in the city of Cambridge right now. The Boston CBD continues to be a good market as supply has been absorbed over the last few years, though there is some speculative development the seaport of some modest-sized building. Again, GE has not landed on where its new home is going to be and it could take existing inventory or go to a new development. At 120 St. James, where we have 170,000 square feet of availability, there are now a number of tenants reviewing our options at the building and they range from 32,000 square feet of single floor up to the entire 170,000 square-foot block. 
At 200 Clarendon, we're in lease negotiations with tenants that would fill another floor in the high rise, and leave us with 90,000 square feet on floors 45, 46 and 47. High end demand in Boston has typically been for users under 30,000 square feet and we expect to lease the space in smaller increments. We have completed our multi-tenant transaction at 100 Federal Street where Putnam has signed a lease for 250,000 square feet, Wellington has executed a long-term renewal and relocation on 156,000 square feet its current using and BofA has been able to realize some space and rent savings by reducing its footprint by 137,000 square feet. All of the available space at 100 Federal Street has now been spoken for. Again, as you think about our bridge to 2017, these transactions at 100 Federal Street contribute approximately $6 million of incremental revenue. So last fall, we outlined $80 million of incremental revenue from our existing portfolio that we hope to have in place by the end of '17. Given all the transactions I've described, we now have commitments for approximately $36 million of that $80 million. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

I'm going to start out with a few comments on what we're seeing on the debt markets. As you know, we've defeased our $640 million mortgage loan on 200 Clarendon Street in December. That resulted in a $0.13 per share char",1219,"Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I'm going to start out with a few comments on what we're seeing on the debt markets. As you know, we've defeased our $640 million mortgage loan on 200 Clarendon Street in December. That resulted in a $0.13 per share charge for our fourth quarter earnings. To replenish our cash, we closed on $1 billion 10-year bond deal at an all in-yield of 3.77%. The excess funds will be used to repay our $211 million mortgage on Fountain Square, that is open for prepayment at par in April as well as fund our future development costs. We've reduced the cash interest rate by 200 basis points with this bond deal versus the expiring loan and the annual cash interest savings will be $11.5 million even though we borrowed an additional $150 million of proceeds. On a GAAP basis, the interest rate reduction is 75 basis points as both of the refinance loans were above market at acquisition, so they have a noncash fair value interest component that is amortized into and reduces GAAP interest expense. Clearly, the market volatility that Owen described is having an impact on the credit market. It's driving credit spreads wider particularly as you move out the risk spectrum. The bond market continue to operate efficiently though, and high-quality issuers like ourselves have access, albeit, at spreads that are 20 to 30 basis points wider than the 155 basis point spread that we issued in early January. Though there are frequently days when the global volatility does necessitate patience. With the rally and the tenure below 2%, all-in borrowing costs really haven't moved much for us. The mortgage markets have been a little more fickle with CMBS spreads widening more significantly, especially in the conduit world and for single asset deals that are in secondary markets are not fully stabilized. For high-quality stabilized properties in strong locations, the markets remain active with both life companies and CMBS issuers actively putting out mortgage money with 50% to 60% leverage loans pricing in the 4% area for 10 years. The banks are also increasingly active in financing 5 to 7 year term loans on a floating rate basis at competitive spreads. So although we see some volatility, good quality assets like ours continue to be able to secure attractively priced long-term financing. With the most active buyers for our asset class looking to employ lower leverage, the financing markets remain favorable. 
I also want to note that over the past 3 years, our asset sales strategy and the delivery of development properties at superior yields has translated into a reduction in our leverage position. As our new deliveries stabilize, we expect these ratios will continue to improve and create additional investment capacity on our balance sheet. I just want to quickly touch on our earnings for the quarter. We reported funds from operation of $1.28 per share. After adjusting for the defeasance charge, we came in at $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range, which was related to better performance in the portfolio. 
Operating expenses came in better than budgeted, while our revenues are pretty tightly aligned with our expectations. For 2016, we are increasing our NOI projections from our in-service portfolio. As Doug detailed, we continue to see good leasing activity, particularly in San Francisco and in Boston. 
In Boston, we closed the Putnam lease. And although it will not impact earnings until 2017, the transaction included a relocation and long-term extension with Wellington with future rent bumps that will be straight-lined into 2016. We're also seeing increased activity on our vacancy, both in the high-rise space at 200 Clarendon Street and at the Prudential Tower where we could see additional income from it later this year. 
At Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, we continue to be successful in completing a number of lease renewals with significant rental rate increases and have activity on our availability. If these renewals are signed, our GAAP income reflects the straight-line impact of the rental rate increases, though the cash impact will not occur until the future renewal date, which is, in most cases, later in 2016 or in 2017. 
As Doug mentioned, we terminated an 85,000-square-foot lease at 250 West 55th Street and received a significant termination payment of $45 million. Also at 601 Lexington Avenue, we are finalizing a termination with a tenant in the high-rise, which will enable Citibank to relocate out of the low-rise office building, so it can be vacated for repositioning. 
Overall, we expect our 2016 termination income to be approximately $47.5 million higher than our guidance last quarter. These lease terminations will result in lower future rental income until such time as we find replacement tenants. The lost income is projected to be approximately $11 million in 2016. Given it's lumpy nature, our practice is to exclude termination income from our same-property NOI guidance, but it does have an impact. The leasing success that we are executing exceeded our expectations and would have improved our GAAP same-store NOI growth projection by about 50 basis points. However, the loss rental income related to our decision to enter into lease termination has more than offset this growth. The net impact on our GAAP same-store property NOI projection is a decrease of approximately 25 basis points from our guidance last quarter. The loss termination -- income from termination also impacts our cash same-property NOI, though we still project growth of 1% to 3% over 2015. As a reminder, our same-property growth is weighed down by rollover at 767 Fifth Avenue and at 601 Lexington Avenue. Both of these are consolidated joint venture properties. The growth in our share of same-property NOI is approximately 100 basis points higher for both GAAP and cash. 
We project our noncash straight-line rental income to be $35 million to $50 million in 2016, which is higher than our projection last quarter. The completion of our bond deal takes care of a $1 billion of our near-term debt maturities. We now have $2.9 billion of consolidated debt expiring over the next 2 years, of which $2.3 billion represents our share. These loans carry a cash interest rate of 5.9% and a GAAP interest rate of 4.4%. We have hedged the 10-year swap rate on a $1 billion of the expected refinancing. The only material financing activity in our 2016 projections is the refinancing of our $350 million mortgage loan on Embarcadero Center 4 in the fourth quarter. This loan has a cash interest rate of 6.1% and a GAAP interest rate of 7%. So our interest expense run rate should be lower at the end of the year. 
Overall, we project our 2016 full year interest expense to be $400 million to $450 million, which is net of capitalized interest of $40 million to $50 million. The impact of these changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operation to $5.78 to $5.93 per share. This is an increase of $0.26 per share at the midpoint, which consists of $0.21 per share from the net impact of tenant termination and $0.05 per share from better projected performance in our same-property portfolio. 
That completes our formal remarks. Operator, if you could turn the call over to questions, that would be great. Thanks."

So even if we add a few projects this year, it's likely our development pipeline may actually go down during the year. So, yes, we're paying attention.

There's also an article that Northrop Grumman is spending $300 million to buy versus lease space in the Baltimore Washington area. Do you have any sense as -- with the defense contractors out there, whether there is a tendency to lease versus own and control their own space?

First of all, I can't comment on the specifics of the tenant coming or the purchaser coming to Reston. And there is a little bit of movement towards owning the space. As you know the accounting change taking place in '18 will have an impact on many corporations of how they booked their occupancy costs. But I still think that the defense contractors want to have -- given the uncertainty of the long-term government contracts, they still want to stay relatively short in the lease terms, so they're not held out with either long-term lease obligations or the lack of liquidity by owning real estate. So I think those are isolated examples, John, but I don't see a general trend. Relative to the market for cyber command, obviously, we're optimistic that Fort Meade will continue to pump out both contracts and then resulting jobs. The Dallas corridor still is very strong, with the presence of major intel activities out there, NRO and CIA. So we like our positions in both those markets. I will say that the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor is relatively soft. And I think that's more about the fact that now Tysons, with the silver line, has opened up another market that those defense contractors can go to with better access and lower occupancy cost. So that still faces challenges but we're putting our money in the Dulles corridor and the Fort Meade market."

That's different than the amortization of the transaction cost into that building and I guess, I would argue that, in many cases, the expectations associated with what these buildings will do in the future is an important component to how they're being valued, and so while on a short-term basis, it may be true that in a particular building where a lease is rolling at a ""flat mark-to-market "" and you're putting transaction costs in on a net-effective basis is obviously slightly dilutive, if there's a perception, and in many of these markets, there's a perception which is based upon reality that rental rates will grow over time that there is significant value that's likely embedded in that cash flow from that particular lease on a forward basis. So that's how you have to think about it. Now there are in fact cases where we don't have a view that, that -- there is going to be rental rate growth of any significance. And as Owen suggested, those are buildings were we are sort of saying, ""You know, leasing these things up and selling these buildings might be the best course of valor here."" And so we have done a number of those sort of modest prunings over the couple of years, where in fact, we have agreed with you that there really isn't a lot of value to be attributed to doing additional leasing in these assets."

Obviously, in prior years, we have sold a tremendous amount of assets and we have delivered, I think it's $8 a share in special dividends in the last few years. And so we've lost income from those assets that we've sold. We've replaced it with development and we've elected to keep our dividend, our regular dividend, in line because we've been able to base it upon our taxable income.

So our decision to redo Weil Gotshal, Kirkland & Ellis, Reed Smith, Kirkpatrick and Lockhart was a decision where we said, ""Okay, there are a number of new buildings that are being built across the city, and there are a number of buildings that are going to be vacated across the city when the tenants that are in them are moving to buildings that are currently vacated."" And our tenants are a likely candidate for all of those future availabilities and we think we have the ability to help them get into more efficient space, take some space back in calendar year 2015 or 2016 or 2017 in a very modest way that can be both accretive to them in terms of being able to reduce their footprint prior to their expiration in 2019 or 2020 and give us an opportunity to lease space at rents that are better than what those current tenants are paying. And so it was the recognition that there were a number of competitive availabilities that our tenants were going to be looking at over the next few years and taking advantage of our attributes in terms of timing and ability to do things with them earlier that led us to go into those directions. And that space is available today, and so we feel really good about all of those decisions."

One of the things we look at is not only the new construction that is -- new development taking place. What we're seeing in D.C. is a repositioning of older assets, moving them from B- to A-, and that level of supply is probably at an all-time high. That's why we're so aggressive and now talking to our tenants. We just renewed Steptoe with '17 expiration. We're talking to Aiken with a 2020 exploration. We're trying to get our larger existing tenants locked up because they are the targets of those new buildings coming online. And unlike the other 3 markets that we're in, D.C. is very much a lease expiration-driven market. We don't have Salesforce coming in, taking 700,000 square feet as Bob enjoys in San Francisco. So our strategy is to get out with our existing tenants, lock them up and then aggressively go after other people's tenants to backfill our new developments. So I think to summarize this, it's much more about the increasing supply moderating any future growth in demand."

So the mathematics associated with what the value is -- are really difficult to sort of describe with a number. I will tell you that we believe that we will be able to achieve rents in excess of that mid- to high 60s on a triple-net basis in current market conditions, and over time, we think those rents are going to go up because there's such a lack of supply in that area.

We're actively looking at new investment opportunities in all of our markets. We have on balance sheet today, actually, a very significant pipeline of both entitled and unentitled land that we're going to continue to push through the entitlement and permitting process. New projects at this stage, it depends. I mean, it's -- they could be for a future cycle. I suppose it's -- prospects exist for this cycle although probably less likely. I just want to add a couple of things to that last question. So we have, interestingly, a shadow, shadow pipeline that we've talked about before. So as an example, in Reston, Virginia, we -- when light rail comes, we are going to get an up-zoning in density. And I will -- Peter, you can describe what -- how much of that we're going to be getting there on the land that we own in, in our existing footprint. In Boston, we are in the midst of beginning our Back Bay train station upzoning entitlements for up to 1.75 million square feet of space. So there are projects like that, that are more long-range . They are not 2017 starts, they're probably 2018 or '19 or '20 starts that are physically in the company's balance sheet right now and we just need to protect them. And then we have buildings like 4th and Harrison, where again, we're in the permitting process for up to 900,000 square feet and likely to probably be a little bit less than that, but when central SOMA eventually gets permitted and we're in a position to start a building, it's another market where we're looking for things. We've talked about block -- excuse me, Dock72 where we're -- we'll hopefully be under construction in the next few weeks with the first building where we have the potential to do another 1 million square feet. So again there's a really good embedded inventory of places in the company that we can add inventory over time. 
So I think that completes all the questions. Hopefully we've been able to demonstrate to you all the progress we've made on our plans. Thank you very much for your attention this morning."

Our focus today, in addition to the quarter and market conditions, will be a review of 2015 and our outlook for 2016. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share $0.01 above consensus and $0.01 above our guidance after adjusting for the defeasance transaction. Based on recent leasing accomplishments as well as a significant lease termination we just completed for $45 million, we have also increased the midpoint of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.26. We leased 1.4 million square feet in the fourth quarter and 5.2 million square feet for all of 2015 and our portfolio occupancy is now 91.4%. 
So moving to the operating environment. The U.S. economy continues to grow albeit at modest levels with full year 2016 GDP growth expected to be 2% to 2.5%. There was a modest slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2015 as GDP rose only 0.7%. The jobs picture remains healthy with 292,000 jobs created in December, 2.7 million jobs created in all of 2015, 2.5% wage growth for last year and 5% unemployment, albeit with lower workforce participation rates. Economic growth continues to be uneven with energy-related industrial sectors in recessions. Our markets that are driven by technology and life sciences are continuing to exhibit tightening leasing conditions. Office markets nationally are also firming. The data indicates that absorption was 17 million square feet for the fourth quarter and 46 million square feet for all of 2015. Vacancy ended the year at 13.8%, down 20 basis points for the fourth quarter and 50 basis points for the year and asking rents rose 4.7% with Boston and San Francisco experiencing the highest increases. Construction levels actually dropped in the fourth quarter to 2% of existing stock but are up 9% from a year ago. Financial markets have become very volatile in 2016 driven largely by concerns that weaker economic growth outside the U.S. and falling oil prices will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy. Most economic data indicates a continued slowdown in the Chinese economy. The domestic equity market in China is down over 20% year-to-date and fears of additional currency devaluation are pervasive. China has funded an estimated $600 billion of currency reserves over the last 6 months, supporting the remedy [ph] to its current trading level. Local regulators appear to be taking additional steps to stem capital flows out of China. Oil prices have also dropped nearly 50% from highs last year to approximately $33 a barrel. This has caused disruption in the industrial component of the U.S. economy and widening credit spreads for high-yield names particularly related to the energy sector. We are also monitoring with interest investment activity from oil based sovereign well funds as several Middle Eastern funds have reportedly been redeeming more liquid offshore investments in 2015. And lastly, despite the Federal Reserve raising short-term rates 25 basis points in December, the 10-year U.S. Treasury has dropped below 1.9% given all the global economic uncertainty mentioned. 
So what does all this mean for real estate, investment activity and valuation? Our instincts are that investment activity from some oil based sovereign wealth funds should slow due to the decreasing inflows and capital needs at home and that flows from China will recede due to increasing capital control. However, there continue to be numerous large-scale office deals completed in gateway markets at attractive pricing. Recent examples included AXA, selling 787 Seventh Avenue to CalPERS and 1285 Sixth Avenue to RXR; and Blackstone, selling 4 assets in Westwood to Douglas Emmett as well as 500 Boylston St. and 222 Berkeley in Boston to Oxford and JPMorgan. All these deals were large and completed with North American led investors at cap rates in the mid-4% range or lower. Our REITs' capital values for high-quality assets are holding up, notwithstanding in some cases, fewer bidders and a somewhat geographic rotation of investor appetite. Further as a tailwind, long-term interest rates are low and dropping, while cap rates spreads to treasuries are above long-term averages and rising. Investment yields and cash flow stability from high-quality real estate assets will continue to be an attractive investment alternative to fixed income. Our capital strategy remains largely unchanged in that we are investing more in new developments versus acquisitions which will be funded partially by additional dispositions. On acquisitions, we continue to actively review new investments but do not anticipate significant investments in stabilized buildings given continued robust pricing. We are, however, seeing a pick-up in value add and development opportunities in our core market. 
Moving to disposition. In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of Innovation Place in San Jose for $207 million, including a gain of $79 million, and a land parcel sale in Maryland for $13 million. Our total dispositions for 2015 were $584 million on an hour share basis which led to a special dividend of $1.25 per share, which brings our total special dividends paid since 2005 to over $21 per share. For 2016, we expect to continue to sell noncore assets and assets where we are able to achieve extraordinary pricing, though likely at levels below 2015. Our balance sheet is strong. We have already raised the cash to fund our significant capital needs and we see upside in many of our core assets through roll ups and redevelopment. We recently sold 7 Kendall Center to MIT for $105 million based on a pre-agreed option associated with MIT's tenancy in the building. We also placed under contract for sale our Reston Eastgate site to a corporate user who will retain us to build a corporate facility for their use, further enhancing the Reston area. Though difficult to estimate precisely at this time, we would expect $200 million to $250 million of total assets sales in 2016. 
Moving to development. Our activities remain robust. In the fourth quarter, we placed in service from our development pipeline, 535 Mission Street and 690 Folsom Street in San Francisco, the Point in Waltham and Annapolis Junction Eight in Annapolis, Maryland. In the aggregate, these projects cost $254 million and with the exception of Annapolis Junction, which is currently not leased, were delivered 98% occupied at an unleveraged cash yield of 7.8% which is above our target. Also, in the fourth quarter, we added to our active development pipeline, The Hub on Causeway at North Station, which is the podium phase of our North Station development in Boston, where we have signed anchor deals for 60% of the 200,000 square-foot retail component and are negotiating 85,000 square feet of additional retail and office leases. North Station is a very significant mixed use development being built adjacent to one of Boston's busiest transit stations and the TD Garden. This project is a 50% partnership with Delaware North and will provide us with significant long-term profit opportunity. At year end, our development pipeline consisted of 11 projects representing 4.6 million square feet and $2.6 billion in project costs. Our budgeted NOI yield for these projects is in excess of 7%. The commercial component of the pipeline is 58% pre-leased. We have all the cash, $1.5 billion, required to complete the development of the portfolio, which should add materially to our company's growth over the next 4 years. 
Looking ahead into 2016 on development. We have numerous entitled projects and new starts will be highly dependent on pre-leasing activity. More specifically, we secured 940,000 square feet in additional entitlements from the city of Cambridge for Kendall Center and are in discussions with several tenants for pre-leasing a 360,000 square-foot office building. For Springfield Metro Center in Northern Virginia, we are pursuing a 600,000 square-foot requirement from the TSA. Again, predicated on substantial pre-leasing, other potential projects for this year are 20 CityPoint in Waltham, Mass. and Block 5 office in Reston. All these projects aggregate 1.5 million square feet. 
Lastly, we continue to devote time and resources to refurbishing our existing high-quality asset base. As Citibank vacates 399 Park Avenue in late 2017, we'll be completing upgrades to the facade entrance, roof decks and outdoor spaces. A redevelopment of the office and retail space in the low rise at 601 Lexington Avenue was also planned. We are also updating lobbies and common space at 1330 Connecticut Avenue and Metropolitan Square in Washington, D.C. to accommodate existing tenant renewals and attract new tenants. 
So in summary, we are very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. We have a very clear plan to improve and lease our existing assets as well as add new buildings through development to our portfolio. All of which we expect to result in attractive FFO growth over the coming years. We have selected noncore assets for sale to ensure continued portfolio refreshment. We have significant entitled and unentitled land holdings that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt-to-EBITDA below 6x and with much of our upcoming debt maturities having now been either refinanced or hedged. This strong capital position will also allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that may present themselves in the coming quarter due to increasingly turbulent financial market conditions. Now over to Doug for a further review of our markets."
368278,312959112,927395,"Boston Properties Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So it seems like every day we seem to jump on this roller coaster of global volatility in the financial markets. But I do want to step back and just sort of take a little bit of a perspective here. So about 8 months",2904,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So it seems like every day we seem to jump on this roller coaster of global volatility in the financial markets. But I do want to step back and just sort of take a little bit of a perspective here. So about 8 months ago, when we were in the NAREIT conference, I think almost every meeting we had was dominated by questions focused on signs of weakness in the tech markets, the lack of public IPOs, questionable valuations of unicorns, whether there was a looming shadow vacancy in our tech -- in our biotech markets due to potential slowing from venture capital sources and that all of this was sort of going to be precipitating a market correction. I think honestly that these are the same questions that we were asked in November at NAREIT and they're the same questions that are on everyone's mind today. They continue to be top of mind. So just take that perspective as I give my comments. You're going to recall that the way we've been characterizing the Bay Area real estate market is really one of, as I would refer to, healthy where the activity is really pretty similar to what it was in 2013, which was a really good year, but clearly off the spike that we saw in 2014. And I think the pace of activity that we're getting today is pretty similar to the same activity that we've been seeing in the back half of 2015 and it's pretty constant. And I just sort of want to supply some facts to back that up. So in the Northern Peninsula and the Valley, in the last quarter or so, Apple has expanded by another million square feet. Google has leased over 500,000 square feet and they've entered into additional building purchase agreements. Palo Alto Networks has expanded by 300,000 square feet. Facebook has taken on 200,000 square feet. As Owen said, we were the beneficiary of Broadcom's desire to expand and they purchased our 574,000 square feet at Innovation Center and have filed permits for the next phase of development, which is up to 537,000 square feet. And then on top of all that, there have been another 12 deals in the Valley for over 1.3 million square feet with blocks of space over 50,000 square feet. And we, in January, signed 88,000 square feet of renewals and expansions in our single-story Mountain View assets that's R&D property over $48 triple net rent. If you go to the city. Leasing activity in the city finished off 2015, clearly off of the 2014 level of high when Salesforce and Twitter and Dropbox all combined for over 1.4 million square feet, just those 3 tenants. But again, it was at the exact same level as we were in 2013. Tech demand continues to average around 50% of the volume in the city and there has been a pretty consistent volume of deals. Now recently, there's been continued attention to sublet space. Well, the Dropbox sublet, which was planned at China basin, it was all absorbed by Stripe and Lyft. There is some Twitter availability that was described in the mid-market area and it's all under lease negotiation. In fact, there's over 850,000 square feet of tech leasing that's expected to get done in the first quarter and it's almost entirely expansion led by Airbnb, which has taken an additional 150,000 square feet from the former Dolby building. The largest block of sublet space that was in our portfolio was a 5-floor block in EC3 coming back from the Morgan Lewis-Bingham merger that occurred a few years ago. We leased 4 of those 5 floors. Now there is some speculative construction in the city, 181 Fremont and 350 Bush and The Exchange are all under construction and they're adding about 1.4 million square feet of space. And Park Tower at Transbay is supposedly going to be -- sorry, it was another 750,000 square feet. But again, the overall vacancy rate in the city of San Francisco is under 6% and people continue to talk about the Prop M and issues there but the point is that after the FAR deposit in October, the bank was at about 1.75 million square feet. But if the First and Mission project and 590 Brannan St. get approved, the bank will be empty. No additional supply availability. At Embarcadero Center, we completed another 220,000 square feet of office leasing during the quarter. Full floors totaled 162,000 square feet and new tenants moving into Embarcadero made up 145,000 square feet of that. During the third quarter, you may recall, and I'm going to refer to this a few times, we described our ""revenue bridge"" to get to the end of 2017 and I think one of the sell side analysts on our last call sort of asked, well, so how much of that's in the bag? Well, in Embarcadero Center, the larger deals that we completed last quarter, about 95,000 square feet, are going to add about 2.4 million square feet to that 2017 revenue versus '15. The new floor deals that we did this quarter, 145,000 square feet are going to add 4.4 million square feet. We have another 4 more floors close to being completed, another 89,000 square feet. Those floors are going to add 5.1 million square feet for a total of 12 million square feet of incremental growth from the Embarcadero Center. So -- $12 million of incremental growth from Embarcadero Center. The mark-to-market on these transactions is between 40% and 70% on a gross basis. And none of those transactions are in our same-store statistics for the quarter. In fact, there's only about 28,000 square feet of CBD deals in the San Francisco region in that same store data in our supplemental. Traditional Firea [ph] demand continues to be very strong at Embarcadero Center and across the city. At 535 Mission, we're now 99% leased. So this is the last time you're going to be hearing about that project for quite some time. We've completed 51,000 square feet of leases. Average gross rents of about $80 a square foot. The building should be fully contributing by the third quarter of '16, cash return 7.8%, 150 basis points greater than our pro forma. I had hoped to announce that we had signed leases for an additional 5 floors at Salesforce Tower, 108,000 square feet, bringing us to 821,000 square feet of leasing of that 1.4 million square-foot building or 59%. Well, 2 of the leases are back for 2 of those floors but the remainder is yet to come in and we expect to see it hopefully by this Friday. So we're going to have 108,000 square feet of leasing done. We're adding venture capital and management consulting clients as industries being represented in the building. We still have active single and multi-floor discussions going on with asset managers and hedge funds and more VCs, law firms, consulting firms, real estate brokerage firms and other nontech service firms that encompass another 300,000-plus square feet of space. Activity continues to be really strong at Salesforce Tower. And most of these requirements are lease expiration driven occupancy -- tenants that are recognizing the value and excitement about the Salesforce Tower and wanting to be there. So again, in summary, activity across the California portfolio, our Bay Area portfolio continues to be very strong. 
Let's jump over to Manhattan Midtown. Again, not much has changed on our activity and expectations for the Midtown market. Our tone has been pretty consistent for the last 24 months, somewhat subdued. When we made the strategic decision to get in front of our many pending lease expirations due to the large block of future availability, the supply in the market. And our view that providing early release in the form of taking back some space in small increments would be the best interest of both us and our customers. Well, during this quarter, we completed another 11 deals, 120,000 square feet. 8 of them had starting rents above $90 a square foot and 6 were above $100 a square foot. Comparable to last quarter, where we did 12 deals, 90,000 were over -- square feet -- in 10 deals over $90 a square foot and 7 deals over $100 a square foot. Now it's clear that during periods of high stock and credit market volatility, many things do, in fact, distract the high end users. And while some of the active tenants are probably elongating their decision-making process, they continue to look for space and sublet space in Midtown is at an 8-year low. In 2014, there were 570,000 square feet of leases done with starting rents between $90 and $99 a square foot. In 2015, there was more than 1.2 million. For deals over $100 a square foot, there was over 1 million square feet in 2015. The reason I talk about this is because the bulk of our availability and rollover in our portfolio in the next few years occurred in spaces with -- that command rents in excess of $90 or $100 a square foot. Now transaction size continues to be small, with the preponderance of the activity under 20,000 square feet for nonrenewal, which is the reason we have, again strategically, decided to cut up the remaining floors that we have at 250 West 55th Street and we have leases out for all of our remaining prebuilt suites and we have signed half of our deals on the 2 of the 3 available floors that we have. We have signed leases now for 242,000 square feet with incremental gross revenues of $18 million that will be contributing in 2017, another component of our bridge. We signed a termination agreement last night with a tenant that leased 85,000 square feet in a combination of 1 high-rise floor, the second floor and a portion of the ground level space at 250 West 55th Street. While working with the tenant on a transaction that would allow them to minimize their future obligations while recognizing both the cost and the time associated with finding replacement tenants, the parties agreed to a onetime payment and a transfer of the responsibility of retenanting the building to Boston Properties. That space was never built out and we never provided TI. 
Switching over to 399. As Owen said, we've unveiled our plan for the upgrade, including the addition of outdoor terraces in our ""Oasis in the Sky,"" as we position the building to relet 640,000 square feet of 2017 expirations. Those are late '17 expirations. We are in lease negotiations now on 200,000 square feet of that space and we completed our first full floor deal in the mid-rise where we are pricing the space with starting rents around $115 a square foot. There are a number of medium-sized financial institutions with 2018 and '19 expirations that really value the more affordable, low-rise large block space, we have those 165,000 -- 100,000 square-foot floors and 55,000 square-foot floors but with connectivity to our slightly more expensive space in the mid-rise. 
Going down to Washington, D.C. 2/3 of our activity this quarter in the Washington area was in Northern Virginia where we completed 128,000 square feet of leases with a GSA, renewals at our VA95 project and also some GA -- GSA contract dependent-expansions that are Kingstowne projects. Then we also did 10 small transactions in Reston Town Center. In January, we completed a 60,000 square-foot renewal at the Town Center with starting rents of over $54 a square foot. And again, if you compare that to the Toll Road, where rents are on average $33 to $35 a square foot, the premium from Reston continues to show. Reston is 97% leased. Our signature residential project is under construction and we are in lease negotiations for 80% of the 25,000 square feet of retail that's associated with that project. And if our leasing team follows its typical pattern given the lack of blocks of space and the continued demand in Reston, we should have a lead tenant for the 275,000 square foot signature office development sometime in 2016. In the CBD of D.C., we completed our second office lease at 601 Mass Ave. and we have pretty good activity on the remaining 47,000 square feet. Our largest availability is going to be at Metropolitan Square where we have 120,000 square-foot tenant expiring at the end of the first quarter. We are in active discussions on more than 110,000 square feet of that upcoming availability. Our view is that the overall market conditions in D.C. really haven't changed much. On the margin, there's probably a little bit more GSA related leasing that's anticipated for 2016, but it's probably going to have some economic limits that will push it a little bit further out of the CBD in the east end. The district continues to be very competitive. 
The majority of our Boston activity during the quarter was in suburban Waltham and Lexington. The Waltham Metro West Market, a ""suburban market,"" continues to get stronger driven by organic expansion. This quarter, we did 16 leases in our suburban portfolio for 413,000 square feet and we have another 200,000 under active negotiation. Rents have increased 25% over the last 18 months. Delivery of the Waltham development is on target, August for 10 CityPoint, October for 1265 Main. Both projects come into service 100% leased. In January, the city of Boston learned that General Electric had chosen to move its corporate headquarters to the city. It's expected to bring about 800 jobs, but that's really not what the issue is. What it really speaks to is the overall economic ecosystem of the area. This region continues to be a magnet for both the life science industry, established technology companies as well as startup tech and maker organizations. This has led to continual improvement in business growth in the greater Boston area. The East Cambridge office and lab market is probably the largest beneficiary of growth and that has the best economics of any market that we're in. With 6.5 million square feet of office space and just under 8 million square feet of lab space, direct vacancy is under 4%. Office rents continue to achieve new peaks with the most recent transactions being completed on the office space at over $65 triple net with annual increases. Tenant improvement allowances have been reduced and are now below $60 a square foot. As Owen mentioned, we finished out the year with an up-zoning of our Kendall Square development that's going to allow for the eventual development of 540,000 square feet of commercial office and 400,000 square feet of residential, including 80,000 up for sale. We're having substantive conversations right now with a number of existing tenants that are searching for growth and looking for that office space. The other news for our Cambridge portfolio is the recent decision of Microsoft to relocate a group that it has at 255 Main Street to the suburbs over the next 24 months. This is likely going to mean that we will have an opportunity to lease 125,000 square feet of space that was not going to be expiring until 2021. With the Volpe site RFP expected to be issued in May and the zoning application still in process, we would expect more Cambridge tenants with near-term space needs to be likely exploring suburban Waltham and Lexington and the Boston CBD because there's simply no place to go in the city of Cambridge right now. The Boston CBD continues to be a good market as supply has been absorbed over the last few years, though there is some speculative development in the seaport of some modest-sized building. Again, GE has not landed on where its new home is going to be and it could take existing inventory or go to a new development. At 120 St. James, where we have 170,000 square feet of availability, there are now a number of tenants reviewing their options at the building and they range from 32,000 square feet of single floor up to the entire 170,000 square-foot block. 
At 200 Clarendon, we're in lease negotiations with tenants that would fill another floor in the high rise, and leave us with 90,000 square feet on floors 45, 46 and 47. High end demand in Boston has typically been for users under 30,000 square feet and we expect to lease the space in smaller increments. We have completed our multi-tenant transaction at 100 Federal Street where Putnam has signed a lease for 250,000 square feet, Wellington has executed a long-term renewal and relocation on 156,000 square feet it's current using and BofA has been able to realize some space and rent savings by reducing its footprint by 137,000 square feet. All of the available space at 100 Federal Street has now been spoken for. Again, as you think about our bridge to 2017, these transactions at 100 Federal Street contribute approximately $6 million of incremental revenue. So last fall, we outlined $80 million of incremental revenue from our existing portfolio that we hope to have in place by the end of '17. Given all the transactions I've described, we now have commitments for approximately $36 million of that $80 million. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

I'm going to start out with a few comments on what we're seeing in the debt markets. As you know, we've defeased our $640 million mortgage loan on 200 Clarendon Street in December. That resulted in a $0.13 per share char",1217,"Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I'm going to start out with a few comments on what we're seeing in the debt markets. As you know, we've defeased our $640 million mortgage loan on 200 Clarendon Street in December. That resulted in a $0.13 per share charge for our fourth quarter earnings. To replenish our cash, we closed on $1 billion 10-year bond deal at an all in-yield of 3.77%. The excess funds will be used to repay our $211 million mortgage on Fountain Square, that is open for prepayment at par in April as well as fund our future development costs. We've reduced the cash interest rate by 200 basis points with this bond deal versus the expiring loans and the annual cash interest savings will be $11.5 million even though we borrowed an additional $150 million of proceeds. On a GAAP basis, the interest rate reduction is 75 basis points as both of the refinance loans were above market at acquisition, so they have a noncash fair value interest component that is amortized into and reduces GAAP interest expense. Clearly, the market volatility that Owen described is having an impact on the credit market. It's driving credit spreads wider, particularly as you move out the risk spectrum. The bond market continue to operate efficiently though, and high-quality issuers like ourselves have access, albeit at spreads that are 20 to 30 basis points wider than the 155 basis point spread that we issued in early January. Though there are frequently days when the global volatility does necessitate patience. With the rally [ph] and the 10-years at below 2%, all-in borrowing costs really haven't moved much for us. The mortgage markets have been a little more fickle with CMBS spreads widening more significantly, especially in the conduit world and for single asset deals that are in secondary markets are not fully stabilized. For high-quality stabilized properties in strong locations, the markets remain active with both life companies and CMBS issuers actively putting out mortgage money with 50% to 60% leverage loans pricing in the 4% area for 10 years. The banks are also increasingly active in financing 5- to 7-year term loans on a floating rate basis at competitive spreads. So although we see some volatility, good quality assets like ours continue to be able to secure attractively priced long-term financing. With the most active buyers for our asset class looking to employ lower leverage, the financing markets remain favorable. 
I also want to note that over the past 3 years, our asset sales strategy and the delivery of development properties at superior yields has translated into a reduction in our leverage position. As our new deliveries stabilize, we expect these ratios will continue to improve and create additional investment capacity on our balance sheet. I just want to quickly touch on our earnings for the quarter. We reported funds from operation of $1.28 per share. After adjusting for the defeasance charge, we came in at $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range, which was related to better performance in the portfolio. 
Operating expenses came in better than budgeted, while our revenues were pretty tightly aligned with our expectations. For 2016, we are increasing our NOI projections from our in-service portfolio. As Doug detailed, we continue to see good leasing activity, particularly in San Francisco and in Boston. 
In Boston, we closed the Putnam lease. And although it will not impact earnings until 2017, the transaction included a relocation and long-term extension with Wellington with future rent bumps that will be straight-lined into 2016. We're also seeing increased activity on our vacancy, both in the high-rise space at 200 Clarendon Street and at the Prudential Tower where we could see additional income permits later this year. 
At Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, we continue to be successful in completing a number of lease renewals with significant rental rate increases and have activity on our availability. As these renewals are signed, our GAAP income reflects the straight-line impact of the rental rate increases, though the cash impact will not occur until the future renewal date, which is, in most cases, later in 2016 or in 2017. 
As Doug mentioned, we terminated an 85,000-square-foot lease at 250 West 55th Street and received a significant termination payment of $45 million. Also at 601 Lexington Avenue, we are finalizing a termination with a tenant in the high-rise, which will enable Citibank to relocate out of the low-rise office building, so it can be vacated for repositioning. 
Overall, we expect our 2016 termination income to be approximately $47.5 million higher than our guidance last quarter. These lease terminations will result in lower future rental income until such time as we find replacement tenants. The lost income is projected to be approximately $11 million in 2016. Given its lumpy nature, our practice is to exclude termination income from our same-property NOI guidance, but it does have an impact. The leasing success that we are executing exceeded our expectations and would have improved our GAAP same-store NOI growth projection by about 50 basis points. However, the loss rental income related to our decision to enter into lease termination has more than offset this growth. The net impact on our GAAP same-store property NOI projection is a decrease of approximately 25 basis points from our guidance last quarter. The loss termination -- income from terminations also impacts our cash same-property NOI, though we still project growth of 1% to 3% over 2015. As a reminder, our same-property growth is weighed down by rollover at 767 Fifth Avenue and at 601 Lexington Avenue. Both of these are consolidated joint venture properties. The growth in our share of same-property NOI is approximately 100 basis points higher for both GAAP and cash. 
We project our noncash straight-line rental income to be $35 million to $50 million in 2016, which is higher than our projection last quarter. The completion of our bond deal takes care of $1 billion of our near-term debt maturities. We now have $2.9 billion of consolidated debt expiring over the next 2 years, of which $2.3 billion represents our share. These loans carry a cash interest rate of 5.9% and a GAAP interest rate of 4.4%. We have hedged the 10-year swap rate on $1 billion of the expected refinancing. The only material financing activity in our 2016 projections is the refinancing of our $350 million mortgage loan on Embarcadero Center 4 in the fourth quarter. This loan has a cash interest rate of 6.1% and a GAAP interest rate of 7%. So our interest expense run rate should be lower at the end of the year. 
Overall, we project our 2016 full year interest expense to be $400 million to $450 million, which is net of capitalized interest of $40 million to $50 million. The impact of these changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operation to $5.78 to $5.93 per share. This is an increase of $0.26 per share at the midpoint, which consists of $0.21 per share from the net impact of tenant terminations and $0.05 per share from better projected performance in our same-property portfolio. 
That completes our formal remarks. Operator, if you could turn the call over to questions, that would be great. Thanks."

And so our -- I think our perspective has been very constant over the last 3 or 4 of these calls about the issues associated with the growth of rental rate and economics in the city is largely due to the amount of supply that is in the market from either relocations to the new building on the far-west side or downtown and the retrenchment that occurred in 2013 and '14, those deals actually starting to get completed. So as an example, Time-Life moved finally down to the World Financial Center. And their building on 6th Avenue is now vacant and available to lease, and they're doing a repositioning on it. Everyone knew that the building was going to be there but it's now in the market. So there are a number of those types of macro supply issues that we've been watching and following and, again, why we made our decisions and have tempered our views on what would be going on in Manhattan in calendar year 2016 and '17.

I would say the only change that's really noteworthy, and Doug has mentioned the supply for a number of times, is the deal with the news didn't get done at 2. So that's a 2.8 million-square-foot building that's not getting built downtown. So on the supply side, we understand that, that's way out but we do look way out, let's say, over the next 3 or 4 years. So certainly, that's -- on the supply side, we don't need another 2 million-square-foot building on Sixth Avenue to come in the market in terms of the supply. So we're just moving along in New York.

First of all, I can't comment on the specifics of the tenant coming or the purchaser coming to Reston. And there is a little bit of movement towards owning the space. As you know, the accounting change taking place in '18 will have an impact on many corporations on how they booked their occupancy costs. But I still think that the defense contractors want to have -- given the uncertainty of the long-term government contracts, they still want to stay relatively short in the lease terms, so they're not held out with either long-term lease obligations or the lack of liquidity by owning real estate. So I think those are isolated examples, John, but I don't see a general trend. Relative to the market for cyber command, obviously, we're optimistic that Fort Meade will continue to pump out both contracts and then resulting jobs. The Dulles Corridor still is very strong, with the presence of major intel activities out there, NRO and CIA. So we like our positions in both those markets. I will say that the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor is relatively soft. And I think that's more about the fact that now Tysons, with the Silver Line, has opened up another market that those defense contractors can go to with better access and lower occupancy cost. So that still faces challenges but we're putting our money in the Dulles Corridor and the Fort Meade market."

So that's how you have to think about it. Now there are in fact cases where we don't have a view that, that -- there is going to be rental rate growth of any significance. And as Owen suggested, those are buildings were we are sort of saying, ""You know, leasing these things up and selling these buildings might be the best course of valor here.""

Obviously, in prior years, we have sold a tremendous amount of assets and we have delivered, I think it's $8 a share in special dividends in the last few years. And so we've lost income from those assets that we've sold. We've replaced it with development and we've elected to keep our dividend, our regular dividend, in line because we've been able to base it upon our taxable income.

By the way, the $70 a square foot is probably getting them 60% of the way to what their costs are and it might have been getting them [indiscernible] 5 years ago because just the cost of construction as well changes to the energy codes and other codes that are requiring them to do things that they would not have had to do, which is just simply increase the overall cost of occupancy.

And our tenants are a likely candidate for all of those future availabilities and we think we have the ability to help them get into more efficient space, take some space back in calendar year 2015 or 2016 or 2017 in a very modest way that can be both accretive to them in terms of being able to reduce their footprint prior to their expiration in 2019 or 2020 and give us an opportunity to lease space at rents that are better than what those current tenants are paying. And so it was the recognition that there were a number of competitive availabilities that our tenants were going to be looking at over the next few years and taking advantage of our attributes in terms of timing and ability to do things with them earlier that led us to go into those directions.

One of the things we look at is not only the new construction that is -- new development taking place. What we're seeing in D.C. is a repositioning of older assets, moving them from B- to A-, and that level of supply is probably at an all-time high. That's why we're so aggressive and out talking to our tenants. We just renewed Steptoe with '17 expiration. We're talking to Aiken with a 2020 expiration. We're trying to get our larger existing tenants locked up because they are the targets of those new buildings coming online. And unlike the other 3 markets that we're in, D.C. is very much a lease expiration-driven market. We don't have Salesforce coming in, taking 700,000 square feet as Bob enjoys in San Francisco. So our strategy is to get out with our existing tenants, lock them up and then aggressively go after other people's tenants to backfill our new developments. So I'd say to summarize this, it's much more about the increasing supply moderating any future growth in demand."

We're actively looking at new investment opportunities in all of our markets. We have on balance sheet today, actually, a very significant pipeline of both entitled and unentitled land that we're going to continue to push through the entitlement and permitting process. New projects at this stage, it depends. I mean, it's -- they could be for a future cycle. I suppose it's -- prospects exist for this cycle although probably less likely. I just want to add a couple of things to that last question. So we have, interestingly, a shadow, shadow pipeline that we've talked about before. So as an example, in Reston, Virginia, we -- when light rail comes, we are going to get an up-zoning in density. And I will -- Peter, you can describe what -- how much of that we're going to be getting there on land that we own in, in our existing footprint. In Boston, we are in the midst of beginning our Back Bay train station upzoning entitlements for up to 1.75 million square feet of space. So there are projects like that, that are more long-range. They are not 2017 starts, they're probably 2018 or '19 or '20 starts that are physically in the company's balance sheet right now and we just need to perfect them. And then we have buildings like 4th and Harrison, where again, we're in the permitting process for up to 900,000 square feet and likely to probably be a little bit less than that, but when central SOMA eventually gets permitted and we're in a position to start a building, it's another market where we're looking for things. We've talked about block -- excuse me, Dock72 where we're -- we'll hopefully be under construction in the next few weeks with the first building where we have the potential to do another 1 million square feet. So again there's a really good embedded inventory of places in the company that we can add inventory over time. 
So I think that completes all the questions. Hopefully we've been able to demonstrate to you all the progress we've made on our plans. Thank you very much for your attention this morning."

This morning, I'll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions that we see as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity.Our current results, we produced another strong quarter wi",1763,"Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions that we see as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity.
Our current results, we produced another strong quarter with FFO per share of $0.05 above consensus, primarily due to improved operating performance. We've also increased the midpoint of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.05. Released 1.5 million square feet in the first quarter, above historical averages, and our portfolio occupancies is now 91%, down 40 basis points from year end, due primarily to the Genentech vacancy of 186,000 square feet at 611 Gateway South San Francisco. We had solid rent roll up in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the first quarter, up to 16% on a gross basis and 26% on a net basis compared to the prior weeks. The leasing results in San Francisco, New York and Boston all exhibited strong growth over the quarter.
Now moving to market conditions. U.S. economic growth continues to be positive, though we certainly see a hint of slow down. Fourth quarter GDP growth is now reported at 1.5%, which is down 2% from the third quarter last year. And estimates for this quarter are below 1%. However, most forecasters for this year are still predicting growth in excess of 2.5% albeit after downward revision.
The job picture remains fairly healthy with 215,000 jobs created in March and the unemployment rate is steady at 5%. Labor participation statistics are unchanged. We also see office markets nationally continuing to improve. Net absorption was 5.9 million square feet in the first quarter. Vacancy rate remains essentially unchanged at 13.9%, asking rents rose 4.7% over the last year, construction levels also rose 6% over the last year but remained at 2% of total stocks, slightly above long-term averages for the U.S. office market. We continue to see the strongest-based demand in locations driven by technology, life sciences and other innovative industries notwithstanding all the financial disruptions for the last 9 months.
Moving to financial markets. They've improved materially from their low to mid-February. S&P 500 is up over 14%, credit spreads have narrowed, oil prices are up over 50%. Near-term interest rate increase is also look less likely with U.S. Federal Reserve, highlighting concerns about the sluggish growth and other central banks around the world, most recently the European Central Bank, signaling an accommodated posture. 10-year U.S. Treasury is hovering around 1.9%. It's traded below 2% since January. Credit spreads has narrowed less though for riskier credits.
Now moving to real estate. On private real estate, private market real estate valuation, prices remain strong for prime assets in gateway market. And we've seen plenty of evidence of this over the first quarters. I've seen a number of transactions in our core market that were offered and priced in 2016. Examples of these include: In Boston, 101 Seaport, that's a new 440,000 square-foot office building located in the Seaport District, 100% leased to PwC on a long-term basis, sold for $1,029 of square-foot and a 4% initial cap rate to a German fund.
In Washington, D.C, 733 10th Street, fully leased 270 square-foot office building sold for about a 4.7% initial cap rate, 1,065 square-foot, I believe, only the third building to trade above $1,000 per square-foot in the district. The buyer was a Middle Eastern Fund Manager.
In New York, there are 2 significant sales reported to be pending to non-U.S. investors. A significant partial interest in 10 Hudson Yard, a new 1.8 million-square-foot office tower selling for a low 4s, initial cap rate and nearly 1,200 of square-foot; and 550 Madison Avenue, a 850,000 square-foot office building that was being vacated for residential conversion that's trading for approximately $1,800 a square-foot.
And lastly, in San Francisco, 140 New Montgomery, a 300,000 square-foot older but fully renovated Class A office building in the Soma district, leased at current market rents, sold to a U.S. investor for approximately a 4 8 cap rate and over $960 a foot, a record price per square foot in San Francisco.
As with the fixed income market, our perception is pricing for riskier assets whether a non-core location and/or requiring lease up or renovation has softened to a degree in 2016. Long-term interest rates are low and cap rate spreads and treasuries are above long-term averages, both of which provide strong support to real estate valuation. As I've mentioned before, the relatively high investment yields and cash flow stability provided by high quality real estate assets will continue to be an attractive investment alternative to fixed income. 
Now moving to our capital strategy. It remains unchanged in that we're investing more in new developments and redevelopments that a stabilized acquisition, and these investments will be funded partially by select asset dispositions in the balance with debt financing.
On acquisitions, we continue to actively review and are seeing an increase for the reasons I mentioned earlier in value-add and development opportunities in our core markets. This past quarter, we purchased a 218,000 square-foot office building on Peterson Way in Santa Clara, California for $78 million. The asset is in an infill location with increasing density at 100% leased to a single tenant through 2021. During the remaining lease term, we plan to entitle the property for approximately a 630,000 square-foot office campus. So the way to think about pricing is we're paying $123 a square-foot for an untitled land while receiving a 4.6% cash yield as we entitle and pre-lease a new upsized office complex. We're also working on several additional acquisitions of size and value-add office buildings.
On dispositions. In the first quarter, as previously discussed, we completed the sale of 7 Kendall Center to MIT for $105 million. We continue to pursue select sales of non-core assets and maintain our estimate of 2016 asset sales of $200 million to $250 million.
Moving to development. We remain very active primarily in the execution of our predevelopment pipeline. In terms of forecasting potential start for the balance of 2016, we'll remain highly dependent on securing preleasing for entitled sites with potential starts for 2016 includes Springfield Metro Center, where we're pursuing a requirement with the TSA; Reston Block 5, located in the Reston Town Center; and 20 CityPoint, the Mirror building to 10 CityPoint being developed in Waltham. These 3 projects aggregate 1.1 million square feet.
We've been very active this past quarter advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start beyond 2016. Several important updates are as follows: as mentioned last quarter, in Cambridge at year end 2015, 940,000 square feet of additional entitlement were made available for our Kendall Center development. We're -- we are in advanced discussion with multiple office users to fully pre-lease the 540,000 square-foot office component of the entitlement. The balance of the project will be high-rise residential. The project is complex involving replacing 2 smaller existing buildings on the site and will likely commence in 2017. Given we are not acquiring additional land, this project is another great example of the embedded development value in many of our existing assets.
You probably read about our initial submission to the city of Boston for the development of additional site at the Back Bay Station. We are already managing the concourse level of the Back Bay Station as part of our agreement with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. The project is in an early stage and could ultimately represent 1.3 million square feet of office retail and residential space located adjacent to a major Boston transit hub. The project is obviously subject to local approvals and public review and would not commence prior to late 2017.
You have also probably read that we have been designated by the MTA as developer for their site located at 343 Madison Avenue between 44th and 45th Street in New York. The site is the western half of the full city block between Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues and offers direct access to Grand Central Station and the new Long Island railroad station at Grand Central terminal. We will acquire a 99-year ground lease and build up to a 900,000 square-foot office tower, subject to a number of local approvals and the new work. The development at this property is likely several years out but we've commenced our predevelopment work.
As discussed, we're also conducting a significant upgrade of portions of our portfolio. This redevelopment projects that we're executing includes 399 Park, a low-rise building at 601 Lex in New York; 1330 Connecticut Avenue; Metropolitan Square and the Prudential Center retail.
At the end of the first quarter, our development pipeline consisted of 11 new projects and 1 redevelopment, representing 4.6 million square feet and $2.6 billion in projected costs. Our budgeted NOI for these projects remains an excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 61% pre-lease. We have all the cash, $1.4 billion, required to complete the development of the portfolio, which should add materially to our company's growth over the next 4 years.
Moving for a moment to a comment on governance. We recently announced in our proxy that Morts Zuckerman will retire as Chairman of the Board and becomes Chairman of Emeritus of Boston Properties. Ivan Seidenberg will also retire from our board and Joel Klein will become our Lead Independent Director. We are also very pleased to be able to recruit Sharon Deistre and Bruce Duncan as independent directors of our board.
So in conclusion, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value for the balance of 2016 and in future years. We have a very clear plan to improve and lease our existing assets as well as add new buildings through development to our portfolio. All of which, we expect to result in attractive FFO growth over these coming years. We have selected non-core assets for sale to ensure continued portfolio refreshments. We have significant entitled and unentitled landholding that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years.
Our balance sheet is strong, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 6x and with the substantial portion of our upcoming debt maturities having now been either refinanced or hedged. This strong capital position will also allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that may present themselves in the coming quarter.
Now let me turn it over to Doug for a further review of our markets."
368278,331205601,964238,"Boston Properties Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. The tone of the market color that I'm going to use this morning is pretty consistent with our last few calls. We have a few subtle changes but I wanted to sort of level set as to what I've said previously, and I'll d",2624,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. The tone of the market color that I'm going to use this morning is pretty consistent with our last few calls. We have a few subtle changes but I wanted to sort of level set as to what I've said previously, and I'll do that real quickly.
So what we've said before is that San Francisco has slowed from the phase it was going at in 2014 and 2015 and the Silicon Valley can be very active and actually has been expanding. New York is a good market but it's been impacted by growing supply and there's been some impact of the financial service market volatility on small tenant demand. So Washington D.C. is a challenged market and there's not much evidence of improvement. So the Reston area can be pretty active and there's little bit of growth there. And Boston suburban and Cambridge are seeing increasing demand while the CBD is a healthy market but it's really more driven by lease expirations and intermittent technology migration. So that sort of levels that what I'd said previously.
Let me start now with the Silicon Valley and given that Tucson way, which is parts of give you some sense of the thesis around on this site and our views of the Valley. So having sold individual place last quarter, our portfolio is unfortunately, it's pretty small down there. It's really comprised of 570,000 square feet of mountain view, single-story product where we actually completed another 89,000 square feet of leases this quarter with average starting rents of $50 triple net, which is more than double the expiring rents on that space. Then we have our standalone office building down in Mountain View, which is only 141,000 square feet. And we have our land redevelopment parcel on North First in San Jose. That's the totality of our portfolio down there.
The difficulty we've been having over the last 4, 5 years is finding high-quality buildings or sites within acceptable basis/return ratio. And the Peterson Way site offers an opportunity for us to deliver products in 2023 at a cost basis of under $700 a square-foot, and that assumes cost escalation on the cost side of the equation in terms of our building materials, labor, et cetera, and an initial return in excess of 7% at rents that are less than 10% above market rents today.
So we have a market whether it's 29 million square feet of gross leasing and user activity in 2015 and market size of about 240 million square feet. So it's a market we definitely want to be a part of and there was 11 million square feet of endorsement 2015. In the first quarter, there were another 8 leases over a 100,000 square feet each, including 275,000 square feet from Google, and another 200,000 square feet for Apple and those are clearly the 2 dominant users of space and it has its dramatic influence on the market but there are lots of other companies down there like Facebook and NVIDIA, and Broadcom, and VMware and Palo Alto Networks that are really leaders in their perspective fields and they are -- these are growing companies and what they're looking for is new, modern, efficient products to house their growth. So this is what we're going to hopefully build and this is the demand that we're going to satisfy.
Jumping over to the city. As we discussed in our call in January, we've seen velocity in the San Francisco CBD has moderated from the levels we saw in '14 and early '15. Actually, that's been a continuation into the beginning of 2016. I think the big difference between the market then, i.e., in '14 and '15, and today is really the lack of large growth requirements and by that, I mean, big tenants over 300,000 square feet. So at the moment, there's no 300,000 square feet or greater requirement that we are backing in the market. In '13, '14 and '15, you had unprecedented large growth from Google, in Dropbox, in Salesforce.com and Uber and Stride and flag and LinkedIn and they're just not there today. However, there continues to be lots of active tech demand and in the first quarter, AirBnB and Twilo and Comcast and Stripes all took down blocks over 100,000 square feet and just in April, Lift and FitFit and Uber have combined lease over 500,000 square feet and much of that actually is from the sublease market. So technology is still a vibrant part of the market. It's still expanding. It's just not quite in the same area than it was in '14 and '15. And interestingly, technology users now make up 31% of all of the space leased in the city of San Francisco.
The second change in the CBD market in San Francisco has been the velocity from start ups. If you look at debenture investing statistics, the seed in early stage investing is down by 22% quarter-to-quarter from prior year. And first time that it's actually down 31% and if you look at the cities sublist statistics, the overall level is very low at about the 1.4 million square feet but there are significant amounts of full floor availability between 12,000 and 15,000 square feet across the South financial in the Soma areas. This is the product that's most attractive to the startup community. Keep in mind that most sublet space has limited term so it's not competing with the lease expiration requirements from traditional tenants, which is where we are working at Embarcadero Center. So as you see, we completed another 128,000 square feet of leasing during the quarter, full floor tenants totaled 90,000 square feet at 128 and new tenants coming into Embarcadero Center totaled 85,000 square feet of that 128. The mark-to-market on these larger transactions is between about 40% and 70% on a gross basis, very consistent with what we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters and it's obviously a dramatic markup in our same-store statistics this quarter. The pipeline of leases that we have going in negotiation today at D.C. continues to be robust, 150,000 square feet of additional leases in negotiation, 66,000 square feet of that is either new tenant or extension. We also have active discussions with new tenant for additional 4 vacant floors totaling 100,000 square feet. So it's very, very busy at Embarcadero Center. I would say, however, that relative to end of 2015, what was actively described as strong as it has ever been in the history of our ownership, the pace of new tours has moderated a little bit.
We've signed additional leases for floors at Salesforce Tower, 108,000 square feet, which is in our system today. So occupancy is 59% and the next wave of these proposals are progressing and includes some single floor users as well as large tenants of between 2 and 4 floors. All of this discussion involved pending lease 2017 and '18 lease expirations. The steel on the core arising into the San Francisco skyline, and we hope to have our first tenant in occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018.
Now based on conversations we've had with shareholders and analysts recently, I think it's fair to say that there's been a prevalent concern about the next market I'm going to talk about, which is Midtown Manhattan. And our perspective has been pretty consistent since 2014 when we recognize there is going to be a supply issue from both new construction and the impending relocations that would impact lease economics. There continues to be good, not great leasing activity across the city and there are still tenant expansions across diversed industry groups, including examples of financial services companies within our portfolio there is today. Some of them were recent transactions in the marketplace from an extension perspective that included Facebook and CBS Broadcasting, Fox Media, Google, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Schroeders and Shout.
In January, we talked about the fact that the public capital market volatility was impacting the decision-making from small financial firms. In the first quarter, we're certainly a roller coaster for the debt and the equity markets. These conditions impact velocity at the high-end, which is predominantly a small financial services for demand pool. Across the market in the third quarter, there were 5 relocation transactions written at starting rents over $100 a square foot and that includes lease export 25 Park. So if you move -- remove the transaction, the average lease was 10,000 square feet. So 4 lease, 10,000 square feet on average. There was clearly a change in the market in the first quarter.
During the quarter, we completed 14 deals for about 173,000 square feet. Over 100,000 square feet of our demand at starting rents over $100 a square feet. They were all renewals and explore expansion. While we continue to see a constant and steady volume of leasing at between $80 and $120 per square feet, the velocity above $125 a square foot has slowed. These to this will leasing smaller units across the portfolio for a number of years, and we're going to take a very similar approach to the 2 General Motors floors we get back on July 1st. Subdividing them for smaller customers as required.
Our discussions regarding the entire FAO block continues to be very, very active. Given the magnitude of the commitment by the respective tenants, this will take some time, but we hope to have a firm signed lease later this year.
Last quarter, we announced our lease termination transaction at 250 West 55th Street. While we have not signed a lease on any of that space in the last 90 days, we have significant conversations underway for the entire second floor and a number of good operators have presented approvals for the ground floor space. So the activity on that exact is stronger than we anticipated.
At 399 Park, we're in lease negotiations with 2 existing tenants that would expand and permit to about 175,000 square feet of the city space rolling over in '17, 125,000 square feet of that demand represents expansions by these tenants. Now we've had some questions about the roll up and rolldown of the office space, the city is going to be living in '17 and our expectation is that it's going to be pretty moderate with a very slight roll up. So as an example, we completed the full floor extension on 1 of the floors that been in question and the roll up was about 3.75% on a gross basis, i.e., pretty flat. This quarter, our New York City portfolio, CBD portfolio had a roll up of over 35% on a gross basis. So clearly, 399 is one of the more moderate pieces of that. Now Mike needs some significant enhancements to our supplemental package this quarter and he is going to discuss those but the one I want to point out is that the delineation of our share of the portfolio NOI by market. In the case of our Washington, D.C. region, it illustrates what we've been saying for some time, which is that our Washington, D.C. CBD portfolio is 9.5% of the company's NOI. We've seen a number of comments suggesting that the D.C. office market has turned the corner. Our view is that there has been no remarkable change in the leasing environment. Most of the D.C. law firm have completed their new installations. Between '16 and 2019, we're tracking only 1 law firm expiration of over 100,000 square feet. The good news is that there's likelihood of little impact on any downsizing on the market. The bad news is that there's activity being generated from this sector. The GSA continues to be very -- take a very measured approach to their renewals and is now hunkering into what we refer to as election inertia, which contributes to pushing out decisions. In spite of the challenging environment, we did complete 117,000 square foot of lease that we worked at net square this quarter as well as get another 17,000 square feet of uncommitted space at 601 Matt Avenue lease.
This quarter, we also completed a 60,000 square feet renewal in Reston Town Center starting rents in the mid-50s and 5 smaller transactions totaling 17,000 square feet. Reston continues to be 97% leased. One green shoot in the Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia market place comes from a group of midsized technology tenants that have slowed this demanding. We have a few of these tenants in our Reston portfolio, some direct and actually some subtenants, and they are prime candidates for that next building in Town Center that I will mention.
The Boston region continues to be a magnet for life science industry and established tech companies as well as for startup technology and maker organizations. This has led to a continual improvement in leasing momentum in the greater Boston market this year. Leasing velocity in the Waltham Lexinton submarket in particular has accelerated during the last few months as a result of the type of demand and much of it is organic expansion. When we purchased a colony in 2011, there was about 50,000 square feet of technology tenants and no life science companies in the park. Today, we have over 500,000 square feet of these users and almost everyone of them is in an extension mode. This quarter, we completed another 179,000 square feet of our suburban portfolio and we have responded for more than 500,000 square feet of additional portfolio over the last month. Virtually every pharma company has put down a base in the Cambridge market and coupled with the growth of the biotech industry and the tech segments that are there, we have a market where the availability rate is under 5%. We are in active discussions, as Owen described, on a 100% of our recently permitted commercial density, which will likely involve terminating some leases and potentially taking down some existing buildings in order to accommodate the new growth. We expect to make our site specific applications this year with a potential construction commencement in early 2017. And again, as Owen said, it's part of this new development, we will also build additional residential high-rise product.
The Boston CBD continues to be a very steady market as supply have seen growth over the last two years so there isn't speculative development going on in Seaport area. While we do have a few technology tenants extending into the overall market, much of the demand is still lease expiration-driven. General Electric is going to be moving to accommodate the new construction, and rehab building currently owned by CNG and not utilizing existing inventory. This quarter, we completed over 525 -- 20,000 square feet of leasing and that includes the work that we did at 100, which is about 400,000 square feet of that. We also did 28,000 square feet at the top of 200 Clarendon, and a 50,000 square feet at Prudential Center.
Activity at 120 St. James, where we have 170,000 square feet of development has picked up dramatically and although we haven't signed any leases, we have a number of tenants reviewing their office at the building and they range from between 32,000 square feet, which should be partial floor to the entire 170,000 square foot block. All of those tenants would have occupancy in late '17 or early '18.
Last quarter, we provided a score card for our revenue bridge. We continue to make progress and with additional transactions this quarter, leasing at Embarcadero Center, the Prudential Tower, 200 Clarendon and 250 West 55th Street, we've accomplished about $48 million of that $80 million bridge.
And with that, I'll turn the floor over to Mike."
368278,331205601,964238,"Boston Properties Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Doug mentioned, we made some changes to our supplemental financial report this quarter that I'd like to go over. The purpose was really to more clearly reflect the characteristics and performance of our share of t",1022,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Doug mentioned, we made some changes to our supplemental financial report this quarter that I'd like to go over. The purpose was really to more clearly reflect the characteristics and performance of our share of the portfolio, given the sizable impacts of the consolidated joint ventures that we have put in place in the last couple of years.
In addition to delineating the geographic and tenant diversification in this manner, we've included supplemental information in our same property and in our light performance stages to include both the consolidated portfolio performance that we have historically provided as well as the performance of our share portfolio. You will also note that we folded our R&D segment into our office segment this quarter to the immaterial size of the R&D portfolio, especially after the sale of 415 Main Street in Cambridge during the first quarter.
Lastly, as Owen mentioned, we're embarking on several significant repositioning projects within the portfolio, which we consider nonrecurring in nature. In our capital expenditure disclosure in the supplemental, we're now segregating the capital spend for these projects, which our total budget approximately $155 million to be spent over the next few years.
Now turning to our results for the quarter. As you can see from our press release, we reported first quarter funds from operations of $1.63 per share, which is $0.03 per share or about $5 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The performance of our portfolio has grown approximately $4 million of this out performance, with about half of it coming from faster than projected leasing activity. We continue to successfully execute early renewals at Embarcadero Center and in our Mountain View properties at a significant rent roll up that are straight lined into our revenues upon lease signing.
We also incurred earlier than projected occupancy from new leasing in smaller pieces across the portfolio. Approximately $2 million of the improvement resulted from lower than projected operating expenses that stems from warmer than normal weather conditions in the Northeast, which reduced our utilities expense a little bit as well as the deferral of repair and maintenance expenses that we project to be incurred later this year.
On development and management services fee income, we're approximately $1 million ahead of our projected -- projection. The majority relates to higher than anticipated service income generated in the portfolio. We also signed an agreement to act as development manager for the tenant that acquired our former Innovation Place project in North San Jose, and we will earn a multi-year development fee for once they commence this quarter.
Our first quarter same property performance was solid, with a combined portfolio of cash NOI up 5.6% and GAAP NOI of 1.5% from the first quarter last year. As I mentioned, the company share of NOI growth differs from the combined results and if you pull out the noncontrolling interest share, our share of the portfolio performance is even better. This quarter, our share of cash NOI growth was 7% and GAAP NOI growth was 2.8% from 2015, which is the new level of detail we provided on Page 41 of the supplemental under the heading Adjusted Combined.
As we look out to the remainder of 2016, we project our same property growth to moderate through the year. Our same property cash NOI growth will be impacted by free rent that was in place in the first quarter of 2015 but burned up during the year. And both GAAP and cash NOI would be negatively impacted by the pending vacancy of 70,000 square feet in the mid-rise at 767 Fifth Avenue and 150,000 square feet at 601 Lexington Avenue where we completed a series of lease terminations and relocations that will allow us to redevelop the low-rise buildings starting later this year. We expect this portion of building to be out of service for about 2 years. The redevelopment will result in a longer period of downtime but in late 2018, when we've reintroduced the new retail and low rise building to the market, we expect it will enhance the long-term value and future cash flow from the building.
Our leasing activity in the portfolio is steady and generally in line with our prior projections. Overall, we modestly increased our combined same-property NOI growth projections for GAAP NOI, and we still project roughly breakeven growth in 2015, and we continue to expect our combined same property cash NOI growth to be 1% to 3% from 2015. Again, when you remove the noncontrolling interest share from the consolidated portfolio, our share of growth for both GAAP and cash is projected to be 100 basis points higher. The increase in our NOI projection is reflected in our guidance for noncash straight line rents, which is now $40 million to $55 million for the full year.
We acquired Peterson Way this quarter with a plan to complete entitlement and develop the site in the future. In the meantime, the building is 100% leased for the next 5 years and it's projected to generate approximately a 4.6% cash return and a 5.8% GAAP return. As a result, we've increased our 2016 guidance for the incremental NOI contribution from our non-same property portfolio. That includes our new development and our acquisitions to $38 million to $44 million. The projected 2016 incremental contribution from this development and acquisitions for 2015 represents 3% year-over-year growth on our share of the total portfolio NOI.
We also increased our guidance for development and management services income by $2 million at the midpoint and now project services income of $22 million to $26 million for the year. The impact of these changes result in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operations to $5.85 to $5.95 per share. This is an increase of $0.05 per share at the midpoint, consisting of $0.02 per share from better projected portfolio performance, $0.02 from acquisitions and $0.01 from higher projected development and management services income.
That concludes our formal remarks, and I'll appreciate it if the operator would open up the line for any question."

I think that the challenge with New York City and I'll let John Powers comment on this, is that while there are plenty of tenants who are paying about $100 a square foot, there are not a lot of big tenants that would be anchor tenants that would be paid over $100 a square feet in size. And so I think the market has to be naturally positioned to accommodate the demand that is there as opposed to hope that simply rising rents will be achieved by the traditional large scaled tenant demand that the city currently sees.

  Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions that we see as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity.
On current results, we produced another strong quarter with FFO per share $0.05 above consensus, primarily due to improved operating performance. We've also increased the midpoint of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.05. We leased the 1.5 million square feet in the first quarter, above historical averages, and our portfolio occupancy is now 91%, down 40 basis points from year-end, due primarily to the Genentech vacancy of 186,000 square feet at 611 Gateway South San Francisco. We had solid rent roll ups in our leasing activity, with rental rates on leases that commenced in the first quarter, up to 16% on a gross basis and 26% on a net basis compared to the prior lease. The leasing results in San Francisco, New York and Boston, all exhibited strong growth over the quarter.
Now moving to market conditions. U.S. economic growth continues to be positive, though we certainly see a hint of slowdown. Fourth quarter GDP growth is now reported at 1.5%, which is down 2% from the third quarter last year, and estimates for this quarter are below 1%. However, most forecasters for this year are still predicting growth in excess of 2.5% albeit after downward revisions.
The jobs picture remains fairly healthy with 215,000 jobs created in March and the unemployment rate is steady at 5%. Labor participation statistics are unchanged. We also see office markets nationally continuing to improve. Net absorption was 5.9 million square feet in the first quarter. Vacancy rate remains essentially unchanged at 13.9%, asking rents rose 4.7% over the last year, construction levels also rose 6% over the last year but remained at 2% of total stocks, slightly above long-term averages for the U.S. office market. We continue to see the strongest-based demand in locations driven by technology, life sciences and other innovative industries notwithstanding all the financial disruption for the last 9 months.
Moving to financial markets. They've improved materially from their lows in mid-February. S&P 500 is up over 14%, credit spreads have narrowed, oil prices are up over 50%. Near-term interest rate increases also look less likely with the U.S. Federal Reserve, highlighting concerns about the sluggish growth and other central banks around the world, most recently the European Central Bank, signaling an accommodated posture. 10-year U.S. Treasury is hovering around 1.9%, has traded below 2% since January. Credit spreads narrowed less though for riskier credits.
Now moving to real estate. On private real estate, private market's real estate valuation, prices remain strong for prime assets in gateway market. And we've seen plenty of evidence of this over the first quarter. And seen a number of transactions in our core market that were offered and priced in 2016. Examples of this include: In Boston, 101 Seaport, that's a new 440,000 square foot office building located in the Seaport District, 100% leased to PwC on a long-term basis, sold for $1,029 of square foot and a 4% initial cap rate to a German fund.
In Washington, D.C., 733 10th Street, fully leased 170,000 square foot office building sold for about a 4.7% initial cap rate, $1,065 square foot, I believe, only the third building to trade above $1,000 per square foot in the district. The buyer was a Middle Eastern Fund Manager.
In New York, there are 2 significant sales reported to be pending to non-U.S. investors. A significant partial interest in 10 Hudson Yards, a new 1.8 million square foot office tower, selling for a low 4s, initial cap rate and nearly $1,200 a square foot; and 550 Madison Avenue, an 850,000 square foot office building that was being vacated for residential conversion is trading for approximately $1,800 a square foot.
And lastly, in San Francisco, 140 New Montgomery, a 300,000 square foot older but fully renovated Class A office building in the SoMa district, leased at current market rents, sold to a U.S. investor for approximately a 48 cap rate and over $960 a foot, a record price per square foot in San Francisco.
As with the fixed income market, our perception is pricing for riskier assets whether a non-core location and/or requiring lease up or renovation has softened to a degree in 2016. Long-term interest rates are low and cap rate spreads of the treasuries are above long-term averages, both of which provide strong support to real estate valuations. As I've mentioned before, the relatively high investment yields and cash flow stability provided by high quality real estate assets will continue to be an attractive investment alternative to fixed income. 
Now moving to our capital strategy. It remains unchanged and that we're investing more in new developments and redevelopments than in stabilized acquisition, and these investments will be funded partially by select asset dispositions in the balance with debt financing.
On acquisitions, we continue to actively review and are seeing an increase for the reasons I mentioned earlier in value-add and development opportunities in our core markets. This past quarter, we purchased a 218,000 square foot office building on Peterson Way in Santa Clara, California for $78 million. The asset is in an infill location, with increasing density and 100% leased to a single tenant through 2021. During the remaining lease term, we plan to entitle the property for approximately a 630,000 square foot office campus. So the way to think about pricing is we're paying $123 a square foot for unentitled land, while receiving a 4.6% cash yield as we entitle and pre-lease a new upsize office complex. We're also working on several additional acquisitions of size and value-add office buildings.
On dispositions. In the first quarter, as previously discussed, we completed the sale of 7 Kendall Center to MIT for $105 million. We continue to pursue select sales of noncore assets and maintain our estimate of 2016 asset sales of $200 million to $250 million.
Moving to development. We remain very active, primarily in the execution of our predevelopment pipeline. In terms of forecasting potential starts for the balance of 2016, it will remain highly dependent on securing pre-leasing for entitled sites. The potential starts for 2016 include: Springfield Metro Center, where we're pursuing a requirement with the TSA; Reston Block 5, located in the Reston Town Center; and 20 CityPoint, the Mirror building to 10 CityPoint being developed in Waltham. These 3 projects aggregate 1.1 million square feet.
We've been very active this past quarter, advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start beyond 2016. Several important updates are as follows: As mentioned last quarter, in Cambridge at year-end 2015, 940,000 square feet of additional entitlements were made available for our Kendall Center development. We're -- we are in advanced discussion with multiple office users to fully pre-lease the 540,000 square foot office component of the entitlement. The balance of the project will be high-rise residential. The project is complex, involving replacing 2 smaller existing buildings on the site and will likely commence in 2017. Given we are not acquiring additional land, this project is another great example of the embedded development value in many of our existing assets.
You've probably read about our initial submission to the city of Boston for the development of additional site at the Back Bay Station. We are already managing the concourse level of the Back Bay Station as part of our agreement with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. The project is in an early phase and could ultimately represent 1.3 million square feet of office retail and residential space located adjacent to a major Boston transit hub. The project is obviously subject to local approvals and public review and would not commence prior to late 2017.
You have also probably, read that we've been designated by the MTA as developer for their site located at 343 Madison Avenue between 44th and 45th Street in New York. The site is the western half of a full city block between Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues and offers direct access to Grand Central Station and the new Long Island railroad station at Grand Central terminal. We will acquire a 99-year ground lease and build up to a 900,000 square foot office tower, subject to a number of local approvals and ULURP. The development at this property is likely several years out, but we've commenced our predevelopment work.
As discussed, we're also conducting a significant upgrade of portions of our portfolio. These redevelopment projects that we're executing include: 399 Park, the low-rise building of 601 Lex in New York; 1330 Connecticut Avenue; Metropolitan Square; and the Prudential Center retail.
At the end of the first quarter, our development pipeline consisted of 11 new projects and 1 redevelopment, representing 4.6 million square feet and $2.6 billion in projected costs. Our budgeted NOI for these projects remains an excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 61% pre-lease. We have all the cash, $1.4 billion, required to complete the development of the portfolio, which should add materially to our company's growth over the next 4 years.
Moving for a moment to a comment on governance. We recently announced in our proxy that Mort Zuckerman will retire as Chairman of the Board and become Chairman emeritus of Boston Properties. Ivan Seidenberg will also retire from our board and Joel Klein will become our Lead Independent Director. We were also very pleased to be able to recruit Karen Dykstra and Bruce Duncan as independent directors of our board.
So in conclusion, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value for the balance of 2016 and in future years. We have a very clear plan to improve and lease our existing assets as well as add new buildings through development to our portfolio. All of which, we expect to result in attractive FFO growth over the coming years. We have selected noncore assets for sale to ensure continued portfolio refreshments. We have significant entitled and unentitled landholdings that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years.
Our balance sheet is strong, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 6x and with a substantial portion of our upcoming debt maturities having now been either refinanced or hedged. This strong capital position will also allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that may present themselves in the coming quarters.
Now let me turn it over to Doug for a further review of our markets."

  Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. The tone of the market color that I'm going to give this morning is pretty consistent with our last few calls, albeit there a few subtle changes. But I wanted to sort of level that as to what I've said previously, and I'll do that real quickly.
So what we've said before is that San Francisco has slowed from the pace it was going at in 2014 and 2015 and the Silicon Valley continues to be very active and is actually, has been expanding. New York is a good market, but it's been impacted by growing supply and there's been some impact of the financial service market volatility on small tenant demand. The Washington D.C. is a challenged market and there's not much evidence of improvement. So the Reston area continues to be pretty active and there's little bit of growth there. And Boston suburban and Cambridge are seeing increasing demand, while the CBD is a healthy market but it's really been more driven by lease expirations and intermittent technology migration. So that's sort of levels that what I'd said previously.
Let me start now with the Silicon Valley and given that Peterson Way was just part I'll give you some sense of the thesis around on this site and our views of the Valley. So having sold innovation place last quarter, our portfolio is unfortunately, it's pretty small down there. It's really comprised of 570,000 square feet of Mountain View, single-story product, where we actually completed another 89,000 square feet of leases this quarter, with average starting rents of $50 triple net, which is more than double the expiring rents on that space. And then we have our stand-alone office building down in Mountain View, which is only 141,000 square feet. And we have our land redevelopment parcel on North First in San Jose. That's the totality of our portfolio down there.
The difficulty we've been having over the last 4, 5 years is finding high-quality buildings or sites within acceptable basis/return ratio. And the Peterson Way site offers an opportunity for us to deliver products in 2023 at a cost basis of under $700 a square foot, and that assumes cost escalation on the cost side of the equation in terms of our building materials, labor, et cetera, and an initial return in excess of 7% at rents that are less than 10% above market rents today.
So we have a market where there is 29 million square feet of gross leasing and user activity in 2015. The market size of about 240 million square feet. So it's a market we definitely want to be a part of, and there was 11 million square feet of absorption in 2015. In the first quarter, there were another 8 leases over a 100,000 square feet each, including 275,000 square feet from Google, and another 200,000 square feet from Apple and those are clearly the 2 dominant users of space and they've had a dramatic influence on the market. But there are lots of other companies down there like Facebook, NVIDIA, and Broadcom, and VMware and Palo Alto Networks that are really leaders in their perspective fields and they are -- these are growing companies and what they're looking for is new, modern, efficient products to house their growth. So this is what we're going to hopefully build, and this is the demand that we're going to satisfy.
Jumping over to the city. As we discussed in our call, in January, we see velocity in the San Francisco CBD has moderated from the levels we saw in '14 and early '15. Actually, that's been a continuation into the beginning of 2016. I think the big difference between the market then, i.e., in '14 and '15, and today is really the lack of large growth requirements and by that, I mean, big tenants over 300,000 square feet. So at the moment, there's no 300,000 square foot or greater requirement that we are tracking in the market. In '13, '14 and '15, you had unprecedented large growth from Google, in Dropbox, in Salesforce.com and Uber, and Stripe and Slack and LinkedIn and they're just not there today. However, there continues to be lots of active tech demand and in the first quarter, AirBnB and Twilio and Comcast and Stripe all took down blocks over 100,000 square feet each, and just in April, Lyft and Fitbit and Uber combined leased over 500,000 square feet and much of that actually was from the sublet market. So technology is still a vibrant part of the market. It's still expanding. It's just not quite in the same area that it was in '14 and '15. And interestingly, technology users now make up 31% of all of the space leased in the City of San Francisco.
The second change in the CBD market, in San Francisco has been the velocity from startups. If you look at the venture investing statistics, the seed in early-stage investing is down about 22% quarter-to-quarter from prior year. And first time that investing is down 31% and if you look at the cities sublet statistics, the overall level is very low at about 1.4 million square feet but there are significant amounts of full floor availability between 12,000 and 15,000 square feet across the south financial and the SoMa areas. This is the product that's most attractive to the startup community. Keep in mind that most sublet space has limited term, so it's not competing with the lease expiration-driven requirements from traditional tenants, which is where we are working at Embarcadero Center. So as you see, we completed another 128,000 square feet of leasing during the quarter, full floor tenants totaled 90,000 square feet of that 128,000 and new tenants coming into Embarcadero Center totaled 85,000 square feet of that 128,000. The mark-to-market on these larger transactions is between 40% and 70% on a gross basis, very consistent with what we've been seeing for the last couple of quarters and is obviously a dramatic markup in our same-store statistics this quarter. The pipeline of leases that we have going in negotiation today, at EC continues to be robust, 150,000 square feet of additional leases in negotiation, 66,000 square feet of that is either new tenants or expansions. We also have active discussions with new tenant for an additional 4 vacant floors, totaling 100,000 square feet. So it's very, very busy at Embarcadero Center. I would say, however, that relative to the end of 2015, when activity was described as strong as it has ever been in the history of our ownership, the pace of new tours has moderated a little bit.
We've signed additional leases for floors at Salesforce Tower, 108,000 square feet, which is in our statistics today. So occupancy is 59% and the next wave of these proposals are progressing and include some single floor users as well as large tenants of between 2 and 4 floors. All of the discussions involve pending lease 2017 and '18 lease expirations. The steel on the core arising into the San Francisco skyline, and we hope to have our first tenant in occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018.
Now based on conversations we've had with shareholders and analysts recently, I think it's fair to say that there's been a prevalent of concern about the next market I'm going to talk about, which is Midtown Manhattan. Our perspective has been pretty consistent since 2014 when we recognized there was going to be a supply issue from both new construction and the impending relocations that would impact lease economics. There continues to be good, not great leasing activity across the city and there are still tenant expansions across diverse industry groups, including examples of financial services companies within our portfolio that are expanding today. Some of them were recent transactions in the marketplace from an expansion perspective have included Facebook and CBS Broadcasting, Vox Media, Google, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Schroders and Chubb.
In January, we talked about the fact that the public capital market volatility was impacting the decision-making from small financial firms. And the first quarter was certainly a roller coaster for the debt and the equity markets. These conditions impact velocity at the high end, which is predominantly a small financial services for our demand pool. Across the market in the first quarter, there were 5 relocation transactions written at starting rents over $100 a square foot and that includes the Citadel lease at 425 Park. So if you move -- remove the Citadel transaction, the average lease was 10,000 square feet. So 4 leases, 10,000 square feet on average. There was clearly a change in the market in the first quarter.
During the quarter, we completed 14 deals for about 173,000 square feet. Over 100,000 square feet of our demand at starting rents over $100 a square foot. They were all renewals and explorer expansions. While we continue to see a constant and steady volume of leasing at between $80 and $120 per square foot, the velocity above $125 a square foot has slowed. We have been successful leasing smaller units across the portfolio for a number of years, and we're going to take a very similar approach to the 2 General Motors floors, we get back on July 1st. Subdividing them for smaller customers as required.
Our discussions regarding the entire FAO block continues to be very, very active. Given the magnitude of the commitment by the respective tenants, this will take some time, but we hope to have a firm signed lease later this year.
Last quarter, we announced our lease termination transaction at 250 West 55th Street, and while we have not signed a lease on any of that space in the last 90 days, we have significant conversations underway for the entire second floor and a number of food operators have presented proposals for the ground floor space. So the activity on that take back is stronger than we anticipated.
At 399 Park, we're in lease negotiations with 2 existing tenants that would expand and commit to about 175,000 square feet of the city space rolling over in '17, 125,000 square feet of that demand represents expansions by these tenants. Now we've had some questions about the roll up and roll down of the office space that Citi is going to be leaving in '17 and our expectation is that it's going to be pretty moderate with a very slight roll up. So as an example, we completed a full floor extension on one of the floors that's in question and the roll up was about 3.75% on a gross basis, i.e., pretty flat. This quarter, our New York City portfolio, CBD portfolio had a roll up of over 35% on a gross basis. So clearly, 399 is one of the more moderate pieces of that. Now Mike needs some significant enhancements to our supplemental package this quarter and he's going to discuss those. But the one I want to point out is the delineation of our share of the portfolio NOI by market. In the case of our Washington, D.C. region, it illustrates what we've been saying for some time, which is that our Washington, D.C. CBD portfolio is 9.5% of the company's NOI. We've seen a number of comments suggesting that the D.C. office market has turned the corner. Our view is that there has been no remarkable change in the leasing environment. Most of the D.C. law firms have completed their new installations. Between '16 and 2019, we're tracking only one law firm expiration over 100,000 square feet. The good news is that there's likelihood of little impact on any downsizing on the market. The bad news is that there's still activity being generated from this sector. The GSA continues to be very -- take a very measured approach to their renewals and is now hunkering into what we refer to as election inertia, which contributes to pushing out decisions. In spite of the challenging environment, we did complete 117,000 square foot lease at WeWork at Met Square this quarter as well as get another 17,000 square feet of the uncommitted space at 601 Mass Avenue lease.
This quarter, we also completed a 60,000 square foot renewal in Reston Town Center, starting rents in the mid-50s and 5 smaller transactions totaling 17,000 square feet. Reston continues to be 97% leased. One green shoot in the Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia marketplace comes from a group of midsized technology tenants that have slowly expanding. We have a few of these tenants in our Reston portfolio, some direct and actually some subtenants, and they are prime candidates for that next building in Town Center that Owen mentioned.
The Boston region continues to be a magnet for life science industry and established tech companies as well as for startup technology and maker organizations. This has led to a continual improvement in leasing momentum in the greater Boston market this quarter. Leasing velocity in the Waltham Lexinton submarket in particular has accelerated during the last few months as a result of the type of demand and much of it is organic expansion. When we purchased a colony in 2011, there was about 50,000 square feet of technology tenants and no life science companies in the park. Today, we have over 500,000 square feet of these users and almost every one of them is in an expansion mode. This quarter, we completed another 179,000 square feet in our suburban portfolio, and we have responded to more than 500,000 square feet of additional portfolio over the last month. Virtually every pharma company has put down a base in the Cambridge market and coupled with the growth of the biotech industry and the tech titans that are there. We have a market where the availability rate is under 5%. We are in active lease discussions, as Owen described, on a 100% of our recently permitted commercial density, which will likely involve terminating some leases and potentially taking down some existing buildings in order to accommodate the new growth. We expect to make our site-specific applications this year, with a potential construction commencement in early 2017. And again, as Owen said, as part of this new development, we will also build additional residential high-rise product.
The Boston CBD continues to be a very steady market as supply has been absorbed over the last 2 years, so there isn't speculative development going on in the Seaport area. While we do have a few technology tenants expanding into the overall market, much of the demand is still lease expiration-driven. General Electric is going to be moving to accommodation of new construction, in the rehab building, currently owned by P&G and not utilizing existing inventory. This quarter, we completed over 520,000 square feet of leasing and that includes the work we did at 100 Federal Street, which is about 400,000 square feet of that. We also did 28,000 square feet at the top of 200 Clarendon, a 50,000 square feet at Prudential Center.
Activity at 120 St. James, where we have 170,000 square feet of the availability has picked up dramatically and although we haven't signed any leases, we have a number of tenants reviewing their options at the building and they range from between 32,000 square feet, which will be partial floor to the entire 170,000 square foot block. All of those tenants will have occupancy in late '17 or early '18.
Last quarter, we provided a score card for our revenue bridge. We continue to make progress and with additional transactions this quarter, leasing at Embarcadero Center, the Prudential Tower, 200 Clarendon and 250 West 55th Street, we've accomplished about $48 million of that $80 million bridge.
And with that, I'll turn the floor over to Mike."

  Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Doug mentioned, we made some changes to our supplemental financial report this quarter that I'd like to go over. The purpose was really to more clearly reflect the characteristics and performance of our share of the portfolio, given the sizable impacts of the consolidated joint ventures that we have put in place in the last couple of years.
In addition to delineating the geographic and tenant diversification in this manner, we've included supplemental information in our same-property NOI performance stages to include both the consolidated portfolio performance that we historically provided as well as the performance of our share portfolio. You will also note that we folded our R&D segment into our office segment this quarter to the immaterial size of the R&D portfolio, especially after the sale of 415 Main Street in Cambridge during the first quarter.
Lastly, as Owen mentioned, we're embarking on several significant repositioning projects within the portfolio, which we consider nonrecurring in nature. In our capital expenditure disclosure, in the supplemental, we're now segregating the capital spend for these projects, which have a total budget of approximately $165 million to be spent over the next few years.
Now turning to our results for the quarter. As you can see from our press release, we reported first quarter funds from operations of $1.63 per share, which is $0.03 per share, or about $5 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The performance of our portfolio drove approximately $4 million of this outperformance, with about half of it coming from faster-than-projected leasing activity. We continue to successfully execute early renewals at Embarcadero Center and in our Mountain View properties at a significant rent roll up that are straight-lined into our revenues upon lease signing.
We also incurred earlier-than-projected occupancy from new leasing in smaller pieces across the portfolio. Approximately $2 million of the improvement resulted from lower-than-projected operating expenses that stemmed from warmer-than-normal weather conditions in the Northeast, which reduced our utilities expense a little bit as well as the deferral of repair and maintenance expenses that we project will be incurred later this year.
On development and management services fee income, we're approximately $1 million ahead of our projected -- projection. The majority relates to higher-than-anticipated service income generated in the portfolio. We also signed an agreement to act as development manager for the tenant that acquired our former Innovation Place project in North San Jose, and we will earn a multi-year development fee for work that commenced this quarter.
Our first quarter same-property performance was solid, with the combined portfolio cash NOI, up 5.6% and GAAP NOI, up 1.5% from the first quarter last year. As I mentioned, the company share of NOI growth differs from the combined results, and if you pull out the noncontrolling interest share, our share of the portfolio performance is even better. This quarter, our share of cash NOI growth was 7% and GAAP NOI growth was 2.8% from 2015, which is the new level of detail we provided on Page 41 of the supplemental under the heading Adjusted Combined.
As we look out to the remainder of 2016, we project our same-property growth to moderate through the year. Our same-property cash NOI growth will be impacted by free rent that was in place in the first quarter of 2015 but burned off during the year. And both GAAP and cash NOI will be negatively impacted by the pending vacancy of 70,000 square feet in the mid-rise at 767 Fifth Avenue and 150,000 square feet at 601 Lexington Avenue, where we've completed a series of lease terminations and relocations that will allow us to redevelop the low rise buildings starting later this year. We expect this portion of the building to be out of service for about 2 years. The redevelopment will result in a longer period of downtime but in late 2018, when we've reintroduced the new retail and low-rise building to the market, we expect it will enhance the long-term value and future cash flow from the building.
Our leasing activity in the portfolio is steady and generally, in line with our prior projections. Overall, we modestly increased our combined same-property NOI growth projections for GAAP NOI, and we still project roughly breakeven growth in 2015, and we continue to expect our combined same-property cash NOI growth to be 1% to 3% from 2015. Again, when you remove the noncontrolling interest share from the consolidated portfolio, our share of growth for both GAAP and cash is projected to be 100 basis points higher. The increase in our GAAP NOI projection is reflected in our guidance for noncash straight-line rents, which is now $40 million to $55 million for the full year.
We acquired Peterson Way this quarter, with a plan to complete entitlement and develop the site in the future. In the meantime, the building is 100% leased for the next 5 years, and it's projected to generate approximately a 4.6% cash return and a 5.8% GAAP return. As a result, we've increased our 2016 guidance for the incremental NOI contribution from our nonsame-property portfolio. That includes our new developments and our acquisitions to $38 million to $44 million. The projected 2016 incremental contribution from these developments and acquisitions for 2015 represents 3% year-over-year growth on our share of the total portfolio NOI.
We also increased our guidance for development and management services income by $2 million at the midpoint and now project services income of $22 million to $26 million for the year. The impact of these changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operations to $5.85 to $5.95 per share. This is an increase of $0.05 per share at the midpoint, consisting of $0.02 per share from better projected portfolio performance, $0.02 from acquisitions and $0.01 from higher projected development and management services income.
That completes our formal remarks. I'd appreciate it if the operator would open up the line for any questions."

  So you just mentioned 3 projects. One of them is an existing building. The other 2 are new developments. I can't comment on the timing of the 1 Vanderbilts, but I think that the MTA site is a site that will take some time to go through entitlement. And hopefully, over time, that the City of New York will have a demand generator that allows us to start that building with a significant pre-leasing commitment associated with it. I think that the challenge with New York City and I'll let John Powers comment on this, is that while there are plenty of tenants who are paying above $100 a square foot, there are not a lot of big tenants that would be anchor tenants that would be paying over a $100 of square foot in size. And so I think the market has to be naturally positioned to accommodate the demand that is there as opposed to a hope that simply, rising rents will be achieved by the traditional large-scale tenant demand that the city currently sees. John, you want to comment anymore?"

And so we may have a quarter, where we have more -- much more significant growth, and then we may have a quarter where we have a much more muted perspective because of the specifics associated with again, the granularity of that. In general, the more dominant quarter is relative to its San Francisco roll over, the higher the numbers will be because on average, there is -- there's probably somewhere around a 50% or 55% mark-to-market on virtually everything that we are doing in Embarcadero Center. So as that gets a larger portion of each particular quarter, that's what's driving it. And then I think the second area would be our New York portfolio at the General Motors Building, where we have significant embedded upside. So when those things rollover into the market, you're going to see a much higher number and then our Cambridge portfolio, where there's a significant embedded upside. Those are the sort of 3 portions of the market, where when they hit the statistics in any one quarter, they will push it in the right direction."

  I mean, I think that the amount of debt we will be able to get will be at least equal to what is there, and it'll all be senior. We won't need to use mezzanine debt to get to that level. The cash flow of that property has grown pretty dramatically over the last 10 years that we've owned it, as we've rolled up rents pretty constantly over that time frame. And there's still -- it's still under-rented from a lease rate perspective. So from a debt underwriting perspective, lenders will be comfortable with the cash flow characteristics and the future cash flow characteristics. It's obviously a large loan. So that's the biggest challenge with it, is that the current financing is $1.6 billion. It's naturally going to be good for the CMBS market. The CMBS market can easily handle a loan of that size typically. But that market has been a little bit more volatile over the last 6 to 9 months, although I would say that most of the volatility is when you start to get into the higher leverage points. So when you're talking about a loan that is 40% to 50% leveraged, that market is more -- is a better place to be today than if you're talking about a loan that is 60% to 65% leveraged. So we could finance this loan today in the CMBS market based upon the leverage points that we have. The existing loan is a syndicate of a bunch of banks and insurance companies. So it's also possible to execute in that type of environment, where you would have somebody help you put together a large syndicate. So I think there's a couple of different ways for us to tackle this. It doesn't expire until the end of '17. So obviously, there's time, but we're -- we've put in some hedges for about 1/3 of the exposure at this point. So that's kind of where I see that standing."

  Yes. In San Francisco, I mean, right now, in addition to Salesforce Tower, there's the 181 Fremont project in Block 5, which is under construction. I don't see anything else coming out of the ground that's entitled in the Central SoMa district or the SoMa district or the downtown anytime soon. So that's the main competition that we have. Mission Bay does have the Kilroy project that's under construction, that we really don't think that anyone that's going to be looking at that project is going to be looking at our project at Salesforce Tower. And then down in the Valley, there's numerous projects that are under construction and planned several million square feet, and we think that will offer opportunities for tenants to expand in and temper the vacancy rates somewhat from a standpoint of possibly increasing. But in San Francisco, overall, there's very little competition that's going to come into play in Prop M, obviously is going to have impact on future development because there is nothing that's been resolved on Prop M one way or another. And I don't see anything getting resolved on it in the near future."

  I don't think its quote changed, but I do think it is shifting gradually. In terms of your question about the cycle, obviously, it's difficult for us to predict exactly when the cycle will end and when we'll have the next recession. There are a number of people predicting it in the nearer term. I don't think we're quite as concerned about a near-term recession. But as I mentioned in my remarks, growth is clearly slow, and I think we anticipate that continuing here for some period of time. But we're not blind to the prospects of a recession in the -- certainly in the medium term. And then what I mean by saying a shift, I do think our thinking about launching new developments is shifting. I think our pre-let requirement is higher. It's difficult for us to say precisely that we need x percent of a building pre-let to launch it because it depends a lot on other factors, like where is the tenant coming from? What's the size of the building? What's the nature of the market at the time? So we don't set those kinds of fixed hurdles. But I do think as we look at our portfolio and we look at projects that we want to launch, a pre-let requirement is clearly required. And I mentioned in my remarks, 3 projects that we're looking at now for 2016. And we're not going to launch any of them without some kind of significant pre-letting."

  Sure. Let me take a quick stab at that, Steve, because it's a fair question. So the good news is that the occupancy number that you were describing and the contribution from the properties that are in that occupancy number is significantly under-weighted. In other words, if it were leased, the relative rent that it would achieve is de minimis relative to the rents that we're achieving in our CBD properties. So as an example, the Washington, D.C. vacancy is in our VA 95 product. And it's interesting. It's actually the first time in the 20-some-odd years that we've had significant availability in that particular part. But the net rents -- or the net rents that we're achieving are $13 a square foot. The big pieces of availability in our portfolio are at Tower Center in New Brunswick, which is in excess of 300,000 square feet of that availability, and then the property in South San Francisco at Gateway. So if you pull those 3 out, the VA 95 couple, the Gateway and the Tower Center, you have a very different picture. But it is true that the majority of our challenged space is in the suburban marketplace."

  So Steve, it's a great point. It's a debate we constantly have as a management team. So I described a lot of investor enthusiasm for real estate, but it's primarily for leased buildings in our core markets. And there's less investor enthusiasm for unleased buildings in suburban markets. So our trade-off is we don't want to sell assets just to sell them at deeply discounted prices. We want to perform the real estate skill, lease the buildings and get a proper price for them. But -- and I would say, if you go back and look at the asset sales that we've done, clearly, we've done some of the large joint ventures on the urban assets. But mixed in with that, if you go back over the last couple of years, we have sold non-core assets in some of our suburban locations in Boston and in Washington, D.C. And also, as Doug said, one other thing I just want to clarify, when you talked about the Princeton vacancy, the Carnegie vacancy is -- the currency occupancy is 86%, all resident in Tower Center, as Doug described."

And for better or worse, the nature of that park, those 1-year leases are just the way they get allocated funding. So what they do is basically give you a 1-year deal and then 9 1-year extensions. So we have every expectation that they're going to stay in that space."

  Actually, we put the bulk of that investment in. And as Ray described it, it really was a plug-and-play skiff with raised flooring, all the way down to the desktop computers and a 24-hour operating entity in there, which was first SAIC and is now Leidos, one of their successor entities, with a staffed help desk 24/7. And as Ray indicated, what happened, having met with the director of logistics and facilities early in this part of the year -- earlier this year rather, they've had a couple of security issues up there. There was a facility outside the base. There was obviously the Edward Snowden incident. And it has, I think, scared them into moving certain requirements on base when they've been able to do that. We're in the process now with Leidos of throttling back based on our conversations with the logistics folks from NSA, the level of services that we've been providing to a number that we can adjust the rent downward and take that part out of the operating expense, if you will. So where we've been leasing space there in the $120 to $130 range. We just did a deal at $95, which quite frankly, if we can continue to do deals at that rate, I think we can put the building back on a pretty sound footing."

  So the -- we've talked about this in the past. And it hasn't changed, but I want to just reiterate that. So all of the demand that we are seeing at Salesforce Tower is really lease expiration-driven demand. I mean, there may be a couple of tenants that aren't in the market or a floor that have asked for a presentation, but it is a truly representative FIRREA-oriented group of tenants that are looking for high-quality, brand-new, visible, state-of-the-art office space. So it's brokerage firms, consulting firms, accounting firms, lawyers, investment professionals, asset managers, venture capitalists. That's sort of the laundry list of the types of users, who are the most likely tenants to be in that building that, remember, the first available floor is now 32. And so you're in the high rise of a high-rise office building in the pinnacle location in San Francisco."

But looking at your portfolio mix, New York is still a pretty big component of BXP relative to the West Coast. And if we look at where a lot of the economic growth is, there seems to be a lot more coming out of the Bay Area versus New York. So should we expect more and more of the investment to be out West? Or should we expect it to be, as it's been right now, where, yes, there's a West Coast investment announcement and, at the same time, you have sort of a New York investment announcement as well?"

  So Alex, the -- we certainly think about our portfolio mix and our balance across the various regions as we think about making new investments in buildings or in developments. And for that reason, if you pro forma what we're going to look like over the next few years, the San Francisco component of our overall results is going to grow materially, primarily driven by the sales of the delivery of the Salesforce Tower, but also by some of the other projects that we delivered last year, like 680, 690, 535 Mission and so forth. So it has been a conscious effort. And I think it's going to continue to be a conscious effort that we're going to grow our company in areas where there's the greatest tenant demand, which today is technology and life sciences. So the answer to your question is yes, but I would also say that the investments that we make are also opportunity-driven. So our teams in each of the regions worked feverishly on identifying new investment, on pushing our development pipeline forward. And so that the -- that we think about it top-down. The actual allocations are also driven by where the opportunities present themselves."

  I mean, Alex, just if you take Salesforce Tower, right, it's 1.4 million square feet. And if the average gross rent in there is in the mid-80s, you're talking about $115 million, $120 million of additional revenue, which is a significant jump in the overall percentage that San Francisco will have when the building is fully in-service in 2018 or early 2019. I also think that, and I think we've been pretty consistent in our description of this, which is we're a demand-oriented company. We're looking to serve those users, who are growing, and where the demand is being generated. And to the extent that there is more demand and users that are sort of technology-oriented, and they happen to be in the West Coast, we're going to do everything we can to service those companies. On the other hand, New York City and the Boston and the Cambridge marketplaces and, to some degree, Northern Virginia also have a pretty interesting future demand pool that we are going to try and serve as best we can as well. And so I think that we are going to be aggressive about making investments in all of those places, where we think there's an opportunity to find tenants, who are growing, and who are looking for a high-quality office space."

I also think that the number of people, who are living in the city of San Francisco, and that our using commuter-oriented transit, mostly in the form of private buses to get to those campuses down in the Silicon Valley, is very, very significant. And so I think that the ""value of the affordable housing"" is less critical to the growth of the Silicon Valley than the natural establishment of those campuses and those businesses in terms of historically where they've been and their ability to still be able to attract labor from the urban market if they're looking for younger, more transit-oriented types of opportunities.

This morning, I'll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions that we see as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity.On current results, we produced another strong quarter wit",1772,"Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions that we see as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity.
On current results, we produced another strong quarter with FFO per share $0.05 above consensus, primarily due to improved operating performance. We've also increased the midpoint of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.05. We leased the 1.5 million square feet in the first quarter, above historical averages, and our portfolio occupancy is now 91%, down 40 basis points from year-end, due primarily to the Genentech vacancy of 186,000 square feet at 611 Gateway South San Francisco. We had solid rent roll ups in our leasing activity, with rental rates on leases that commenced in the first quarter, up to 16% on a gross basis and 26% on a net basis compared to the prior lease. The leasing results in San Francisco, New York and Boston, all exhibited strong growth over the quarter.
Now moving to market conditions. U.S. economic growth continues to be positive, though we certainly see a hint of slowdown. Fourth quarter GDP growth is now reported at 1.5%, which is down 2% from the third quarter last year, and estimates for this quarter are below 1%. However, most forecasters for this year are still predicting growth in excess of 2.5% albeit after downward revisions.
The jobs picture remains fairly healthy with 215,000 jobs created in March and the unemployment rate is steady at 5%. Labor participation statistics are unchanged. We also see office markets nationally continuing to improve. Net absorption was 5.9 million square feet in the first quarter. Vacancy rate remains essentially unchanged at 13.9%, asking rents rose 4.7% over the last year, construction levels also rose 6% over the last year but remained at 2% of total stocks, slightly above long-term averages for the U.S. office market. We continue to see the strongest-based demand in locations driven by technology, life sciences and other innovative industries notwithstanding all the financial disruption for the last 9 months.
Moving to financial markets. They've improved materially from their lows in mid-February. S&P 500 is up over 14%, credit spreads have narrowed, oil prices are up over 50%. Near-term interest rate increases also look less likely with the U.S. Federal Reserve, highlighting concerns about the sluggish growth and other central banks around the world, most recently the European Central Bank, signaling an accommodated posture. 10-year U.S. Treasury is hovering around 1.9%, has traded below 2% since January. Credit spreads narrowed less though for riskier credits.
Now moving to real estate. On private real estate, private market's real estate valuation, prices remain strong for prime assets in gateway market. And we've seen plenty of evidence of this over the first quarter. And seen a number of transactions in our core market that were offered and priced in 2016. Examples of this include: In Boston, 101 Seaport, that's a new 440,000 square foot office building located in the Seaport District, 100% leased to PwC on a long-term basis, sold for $1,029 of square foot and a 4% initial cap rate to a German fund.
In Washington, D.C., 733 10th Street, fully leased 170,000 square foot office building sold for about a 4.7% initial cap rate, $1,065 square foot, I believe, only the third building to trade above $1,000 per square foot in the district. The buyer was a Middle Eastern Fund Manager.
In New York, there are 2 significant sales reported to be pending to non-U.S. investors. A significant partial interest in 10 Hudson Yards, a new 1.8 million square foot office tower, selling for a low 4s, initial cap rate and nearly $1,200 a square foot; and 550 Madison Avenue, an 850,000 square foot office building that was being vacated for residential conversion is trading for approximately $1,800 a square foot.
And lastly, in San Francisco, 140 New Montgomery, a 300,000 square foot older but fully renovated Class A office building in the SoMa district, leased at current market rents, sold to a U.S. investor for approximately a 48 cap rate and over $960 a foot, a record price per square foot in San Francisco.
As with the fixed income market, our perception is pricing for riskier assets whether a non-core location and/or requiring lease up or renovation has softened to a degree in 2016. Long-term interest rates are low and cap rate spreads of the treasuries are above long-term averages, both of which provide strong support to real estate valuations. As I've mentioned before, the relatively high investment yields and cash flow stability provided by high quality real estate assets will continue to be an attractive investment alternative to fixed income. 
Now moving to our capital strategy. It remains unchanged and that we're investing more in new developments and redevelopments than in stabilized acquisition, and these investments will be funded partially by select asset dispositions in the balance with debt financing.
On acquisitions, we continue to actively review and are seeing an increase for the reasons I mentioned earlier in value-add and development opportunities in our core markets. This past quarter, we purchased a 218,000 square foot office building on Peterson Way in Santa Clara, California for $78 million. The asset is in an infill location, with increasing density and 100% leased to a single tenant through 2021. During the remaining lease term, we plan to entitle the property for approximately a 630,000 square foot office campus. So the way to think about pricing is we're paying $123 a square foot for unentitled land, while receiving a 4.6% cash yield as we entitle and pre-lease a new upsize office complex. We're also working on several additional acquisitions of size and value-add office buildings.
On dispositions. In the first quarter, as previously discussed, we completed the sale of 7 Kendall Center to MIT for $105 million. We continue to pursue select sales of non-core assets and maintain our estimate of 2016 asset sales of $200 million to $250 million.
Moving to development. We remain very active, primarily in the execution of our predevelopment pipeline. In terms of forecasting potential starts for the balance of 2016, it will remain highly dependent on securing pre-leasing for entitled sites. The potential starts for 2016 include: Springfield Metro Center, where we're pursuing a requirement with the TSA; Reston Block 5, located in the Reston Town Center; and 20 CityPoint, the Mirror building to 10 CityPoint being developed in Waltham. These 3 projects aggregate 1.1 million square feet.
We've been very active this past quarter, advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start beyond 2016. Several important updates are as follows: As mentioned last quarter, in Cambridge at year-end 2015, 940,000 square feet of additional entitlements were made available for our Kendall Center development. We're -- we are in advanced discussion with multiple office users to fully pre-lease the 540,000 square foot office component of the entitlement. The balance of the project will be high-rise residential. The project is complex, involving replacing 2 smaller existing buildings on the site and will likely commence in 2017. Given we are not acquiring additional land, this project is another great example of the embedded development value in many of our existing assets.
You've probably read about our initial submission to the city of Boston for the development of additional site at the Back Bay Station. We are already managing the concourse level of the Back Bay Station as part of our agreement with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. The project is in an early phase and could ultimately represent 1.3 million square feet of office retail and residential space located adjacent to a major Boston transit hub. The project is obviously subject to local approvals and public review and would not commence prior to late 2017.
You have also probably, read that we've been designated by the MTA as developer for their site located at 343 Madison Avenue between 44th and 45th Street in New York. The site is the western half of a full city block between Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues and offers direct access to Grand Central Station and the new Long Island railroad station at Grand Central terminal. We will acquire a 99-year ground lease and build up to a 900,000 square foot office tower, subject to a number of local approvals and ULURP. The development at this property is likely several years out, but we've commenced our predevelopment work.
As discussed, we're also conducting a significant upgrade of portions of our portfolio. These redevelopment projects that we're executing include: 399 Park, the low-rise building of 601 Lex in New York; 1330 Connecticut Avenue; Metropolitan Square; and the Prudential Center retail.
At the end of the first quarter, our development pipeline consisted of 11 new projects and 1 redevelopment, representing 4.6 million square feet and $2.6 billion in projected costs. Our budgeted NOI for these projects remains an excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 61% pre-lease. We have all the cash, $1.4 billion, required to complete the development of the portfolio, which should add materially to our company's growth over the next 4 years.
Moving for a moment to a comment on governance. We recently announced in our proxy that Mort Zuckerman will retire as Chairman of the Board and become Chairman emeritus of Boston Properties. Ivan Seidenberg will also retire from our board and Joel Klein will become our Lead Independent Director. We were also very pleased to be able to recruit Karen Dykstra and Bruce Duncan as independent directors of our board.
So in conclusion, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value for the balance of 2016 and in future years. We have a very clear plan to improve and lease our existing assets as well as add new buildings through development to our portfolio. All of which, we expect to result in attractive FFO growth over the coming years. We have selected non-core assets for sale to ensure continued portfolio refreshments. We have significant entitled and unentitled landholdings that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years.
Our balance sheet is strong, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 6x and with a substantial portion of our upcoming debt maturities having now been either refinanced or hedged. This strong capital position will also allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that may present themselves in the coming quarters.
Now let me turn it over to Doug for a further review of our markets."
368278,331205601,964975,"Boston Properties Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. The tone of the market color that I'm going to give this morning is pretty consistent with our last few calls, albeit there a few subtle changes.

The tone of the market color that I'm going to give this morning is pretty consistent with our last few calls, albeit there a few subtle changes. But I wanted to sort of level that as to what I've said previously, and I'll do that real quickly.
So what we've said before is that San Francisco has slowed from the pace it was going at in 2014 and 2015 and the Silicon Valley continues to be very active and is actually -- has been expanding. New York is a good market, but it's been impacted by growing supply and there's been some impact of the financial service market volatility on small tenant demand. The Washington D.C. is a challenged market and there's not much evidence of improvement. So the Reston area continues to be pretty active and there's little bit of growth there. And Boston suburban and Cambridge are seeing increasing demand, while the CBD is a healthy market but it's really been more driven by lease expirations and intermittent technology migration. So that's sort of levels that what I'd said previously.
Let me start now with the Silicon Valley and given that Peterson Way was just part I'll give you some sense of the thesis around on this site and our views of the Valley. So having sold innovation place last quarter, our portfolio is unfortunately, it's pretty small down there. It's really comprised of 570,000 square feet of Mountain View, single-story product, where we actually completed another 89,000 square feet of leases this quarter, with average starting rents of $50 triple net, which is more than double the expiring rents on that space. And then we have our stand-alone office building down in Mountain View, which is only 141,000 square feet. And we have our land redevelopment parcel on North First in San Jose. That's the totality of our portfolio down there.
The difficulty we've been having over the last 4, 5 years is finding high-quality buildings or sites within acceptable basis/return ratio. And the Peterson Way site offers an opportunity for us to deliver products in 2023 at a cost basis of under $700 a square foot, and that assumes cost escalation on the cost side of the equation in terms of our building materials, labor, et cetera, and an initial return in excess of 7% at rents that are less than 10% above market rents today.
So we have a market where there is 29 million square feet of gross leasing and user activity in 2015. The market size of about 240 million square feet. So it's a market we definitely want to be a part of, and there was 11 million square feet of absorption in 2015. In the first quarter, there were another 8 leases over a 100,000 square feet each, including 275,000 square feet from Google, and another 200,000 square feet from Apple and those are clearly the 2 dominant users of space and they've had a dramatic influence on the market. But there are lots of other companies down there like Facebook, NVIDIA, and Broadcom, and VMware and Palo Alto Networks that are really leaders in their perspective fields and they are -- these are growing companies and what they're looking for is new, modern, efficient products to house their growth. So this is what we're going to hopefully build, and this is the demand that we're going to satisfy.
Jumping over to the city. As we discussed in our call, in January, we see velocity in the San Francisco CBD has moderated from the levels we saw in '14 and early '15. Actually, that's been a continuation into the beginning of 2016. I think the big difference between the market then, i.e., in '14 and '15, and today is really the lack of large growth requirements and by that, I mean, big tenants over 300,000 square feet. So at the moment, there's no 300,000 square foot or greater requirement that we are tracking in the market. In '13, '14 and '15, you had unprecedented large growth from Google, in Dropbox, in Salesforce.com and Uber, and Stripe and Slack and LinkedIn and they're just not there today. However, there continues to be lots of active tech demand and in the first quarter, AirBnB and Twilio and Comcast and Stripe all took down blocks over 100,000 square feet each, and just in April, Lyft and Fitbit and Uber combined leased over 500,000 square feet and much of that actually was from the sublet market. So technology is still a vibrant part of the market. It's still expanding. It's just not quite in the same area that it was in '14 and '15. And interestingly, technology users now make up 31% of all of the space leased in the City of San Francisco.
The second change in the CBD market, in San Francisco has been the velocity from startups. If you look at the venture investing statistics, the seed in early-stage investing is down about 22% quarter-to-quarter from prior year. And first time that investing is down 31% and if you look at the cities sublet statistics, the overall level is very low at about 1.4 million square feet but there are significant amounts of full floor availability between 12,000 and 15,000 square feet across the south financial and the SoMa areas. This is the product that's most attractive to the startup community. Keep in mind that most sublet space has limited term, so it's not competing with the lease expiration-driven requirements from traditional tenants, which is where we are working at Embarcadero Center. So as you see, we completed another 128,000 square feet of leasing during the quarter, full floor tenants totaled 90,000 square feet of that 128,000 and new tenants coming into Embarcadero Center totaled 85,000 square feet of that 128,000. The mark-to-market on these larger transactions is between 40% and 70% on a gross basis, very consistent with what we've been seeing for the last couple of quarters and is obviously a dramatic markup in our same-store statistics this quarter. The pipeline of leases that we have going in negotiation today, at EC continues to be robust, 150,000 square feet of additional leases in negotiation, 66,000 square feet of that is either new tenants or expansions. We also have active discussions with new tenant for an additional 4 vacant floors, totaling 100,000 square feet. So it's very, very busy at Embarcadero Center. I would say, however, that relative to the end of 2015, when activity was described as strong as it has ever been in the history of our ownership, the pace of new tours has moderated a little bit.
We've signed additional leases for floors at Salesforce Tower, 108,000 square feet, which is in our statistics today. So occupancy is 59% and the next wave of these proposals are progressing and include some single floor users as well as large tenants of between 2 and 4 floors. All of the discussions involve pending lease 2017 and '18 lease expirations. The steel on the core arising into the San Francisco skyline, and we hope to have our first tenant in occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018.
Now based on conversations we've had with shareholders and analysts recently, I think it's fair to say that there's been a prevalent of concern about the next market I'm going to talk about, which is Midtown Manhattan. Our perspective has been pretty consistent since 2014 when we recognized there was going to be a supply issue from both new construction and the impending relocations that would impact lease economics. There continues to be good, not great leasing activity across the city and there are still tenant expansions across diverse industry groups, including examples of financial services companies within our portfolio that are expanding today. Some of them were recent transactions in the marketplace from an expansion perspective have included Facebook and CBS Broadcasting, Vox Media, Google, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Schroders and Chubb.
In January, we talked about the fact that the public capital market volatility was impacting the decision-making from small financial firms. And the first quarter was certainly a roller coaster for the debt and the equity markets. These conditions impact velocity at the high end, which is predominantly a small financial services for our demand pool. Across the market in the first quarter, there were 5 relocation transactions written at starting rents over $100 a square foot and that includes the Citadel lease at 425 Park. So if you move -- remove the Citadel transaction, the average lease was 10,000 square feet. So 4 leases, 10,000 square feet on average. There was clearly a change in the market in the first quarter.
During the quarter, we completed 14 deals for about 173,000 square feet. Over 100,000 square feet of our demand at starting rents over $100 a square foot. They were all renewals and explorer expansions. While we continue to see a constant and steady volume of leasing at between $80 and $120 per square foot, the velocity above $125 a square foot has slowed. We have been successful leasing smaller units across the portfolio for a number of years, and we're going to take a very similar approach to the 2 General Motors floors, we get back on July 1st. Subdividing them for smaller customers as required.
Our discussions regarding the entire FAO block continues to be very, very active. Given the magnitude of the commitment by the respective tenants, this will take some time, but we hope to have a firm signed lease later this year.
Last quarter, we announced our lease termination transaction at 250 West 55th Street, and while we have not signed a lease on any of that space in the last 90 days, we have significant conversations underway for the entire second floor and a number of food operators have presented proposals for the ground floor space. So the activity on that take back is stronger than we anticipated.
At 399 Park, we're in lease negotiations with 2 existing tenants that would expand and commit to about 175,000 square feet of the city space rolling over in '17, 125,000 square feet of that demand represents expansions by these tenants. Now we've had some questions about the roll up and roll down of the office space that Citi is going to be leaving in '17 and our expectation is that it's going to be pretty moderate with a very slight roll up. So as an example, we completed a full floor extension on one of the floors that's in question and the roll up was about 3.75% on a gross basis, i.e., pretty flat. This quarter, our New York City portfolio, CBD portfolio had a roll up of over 35% on a gross basis. So clearly, 399 Park is one of the more moderate pieces of that. Now Mike needs some significant enhancements to our supplemental package this quarter and he's going to discuss those. But the one I want to point out is the delineation of our share of the portfolio NOI by market. In the case of our Washington, D.C. region, it illustrates what we've been saying for some time, which is that our Washington, D.C. CBD portfolio is 9.5% of the company's NOI. We've seen a number of comments suggesting that the D.C. office market has turned the corner. Our view is that there has been no remarkable change in the leasing environment. Most of the D.C. law firms have completed their new installations. Between '16 and 2019, we're tracking only one law firm expiration over 100,000 square feet. The good news is that there's likelihood of little impact on any downsizing on the market. The bad news is that there's still activity being generated from this sector. The GSA continues to be very -- take a very measured approach to their renewals and is now hunkering into what we refer to as election inertia, which contributes to pushing out decisions. In spite of the challenging environment, we did complete 117,000 square foot lease at WeWork at Met Square this quarter as well as get another 17,000 square feet of the uncommitted space at 601 Mass Avenue lease.
This quarter, we also completed a 60,000 square foot renewal in Reston Town Center, starting rents in the mid-50s and 5 smaller transactions totaling 17,000 square feet. Reston continues to be 97% leased. One green shoot in the Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia marketplace comes from a group of midsized technology tenants that have slowly expanding. We have a few of these tenants in our Reston portfolio, some direct and actually some subtenants, and they are prime candidates for that next building in Town Center that Owen mentioned.
The Boston region continues to be a magnet for life science industry and established tech companies as well as for startup technology and maker organizations. This has led to a continual improvement in leasing momentum in the greater Boston market this quarter. Leasing velocity in the Waltham Lexington submarket in particular has accelerated during the last few months as a result of the type of demand and much of it is organic expansion. When we purchased a colony in 2011, there was about 50,000 square feet of technology tenants and no life science companies in the park. Today, we have over 500,000 square feet of these users and almost every one of them is in an expansion mode. This quarter, we completed another 179,000 square feet in our suburban portfolio, and we have responded to more than 500,000 square feet of additional portfolio over the last month. Virtually every pharma company has put down a base in the Cambridge market and coupled with the growth of the biotech industry and the tech titans that are there. We have a market where the availability rate is under 5%. We are in active lease discussions, as Owen described, on a 100% of our recently permitted commercial density, which will likely involve terminating some leases and potentially taking down some existing buildings in order to accommodate the new growth. We expect to make our site-specific applications this year, with a potential construction commencement in early 2017. And again, as Owen said, as part of this new development, we will also build additional residential high-rise product.
The Boston CBD continues to be a very steady market as supply has been absorbed over the last 2 years, so there isn't speculative development going on in the Seaport area. While we do have a few technology tenants expanding into the overall market, much of the demand is still lease expiration-driven. General Electric is going to be moving to accommodation of new construction, in the rehab building, currently owned by P&G and not utilizing existing inventory. This quarter, we completed over 520,000 square feet of leasing and that includes the work we did at 100 Federal Street, which is about 400,000 square feet of that. We also did 28,000 square feet at the top of 200 Clarendon, a 50,000 square feet at Prudential Center.
Activity at 120 St. James, where we have 170,000 square feet of the availability has picked up dramatically and although we haven't signed any leases, we have a number of tenants reviewing their options at the building and they range from between 32,000 square feet, which will be partial floor to the entire 170,000 square foot block. All of those tenants will have occupancy in late '17 or early '18.
Last quarter, we provided a score card for our revenue bridge. We continue to make progress and with additional transactions this quarter, leasing at Embarcadero Center, the Prudential Tower, 200 Clarendon and 250 West 55th Street, we've accomplished about $48 million of that $80 million bridge.
And with that, I'll turn the floor over to Mike."
368278,331205601,964975,"Boston Properties Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Doug mentioned, we made some changes to our supplemental financial report this quarter that I'd like to go over. The purpose was really to more clearly reflect the characteristics and performance of our share of t",1001,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Doug mentioned, we made some changes to our supplemental financial report this quarter that I'd like to go over. The purpose was really to more clearly reflect the characteristics and performance of our share of the portfolio, given the sizable impacts of the consolidated joint ventures that we have put in place in the last couple of years.
In addition to delineating the geographic and tenant diversification in this manner, we've included supplemental information in our same-property NOI performance stages to include both the consolidated portfolio performance that we historically provided as well as the performance of our share portfolio. You will also note that we folded our R&D segment into our office segment this quarter to the immaterial size of the R&D portfolio, especially after the sale of 415 Main Street in Cambridge during the first quarter.
Lastly, as Owen mentioned, we're embarking on several significant repositioning projects within the portfolio, which we consider nonrecurring in nature. In our capital expenditure disclosure, in the supplemental, we're now segregating the capital spend for these projects, which have a total budget of approximately $165 million to be spent over the next few years.
Now turning to our results for the quarter. As you can see from our press release, we reported first quarter funds from operations of $1.63 per share, which is $0.03 per share, or about $5 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The performance of our portfolio drove approximately $4 million of this out-performance, with about half of it coming from faster-than-projected leasing activity. We continue to successfully execute early renewals at Embarcadero Center and in our Mountain View properties at a significant rent roll up that are straight-lined into our revenues upon lease signing.
We also incurred earlier-than-projected occupancy from new leasing in smaller pieces across the portfolio. Approximately $2 million of the improvement resulted from lower-than-projected operating expenses that stemmed from warmer-than-normal weather conditions in the Northeast, which reduced our utilities expense a little bit as well as the deferral of repair and maintenance expenses that we project will be incurred later this year.
On development and management services fee income, we're approximately $1 million ahead of our projected -- projection. The majority relates to higher-than-anticipated service income generated in the portfolio. We also signed an agreement to act as development manager for the tenant that acquired our former Innovation Place project in North San Jose, and we will earn a multi-year development fee for work that commenced this quarter.
Our first quarter same-property performance was solid, with the combined portfolio cash NOI, up 5.6% and GAAP NOI, up 1.5% from the first quarter last year. As I mentioned, the company share of NOI growth differs from the combined results, and if you pull out the noncontrolling interest share, our share of the portfolio performance is even better. This quarter, our share of cash NOI growth was 7% and GAAP NOI growth was 2.8% from 2015, which is the new level of detail we provided on Page 41 of the supplemental under the heading Adjusted Combined.
As we look out to the remainder of 2016, we project our same-property growth to moderate through the year. Our same-property cash NOI growth will be impacted by free rent that was in place in the first quarter of 2015 but burned off during the year. And both GAAP and cash NOI will be negatively impacted by the pending vacancy of 70,000 square feet in the mid-rise at 767 Fifth Avenue and 150,000 square feet at 601 Lexington Avenue, where we've completed a series of lease terminations and relocations that will allow us to redevelop the low rise buildings starting later this year. We expect this portion of the building to be out of service for about 2 years. The redevelopment will result in a longer period of downtime but in late 2018, when we've reintroduced the new retail and low-rise building to the market, we expect it will enhance the long-term value and future cash flow from the building.
Our leasing activity in the portfolio is steady and generally, in line with our prior projections. Overall, we modestly increased our combined same-property NOI growth projections for GAAP NOI, and we still project roughly breakeven growth in 2015, and we continue to expect our combined same-property cash NOI growth to be 1% to 3% from 2015. Again, when you remove the noncontrolling interest share from the consolidated portfolio, our share of growth for both GAAP and cash is projected to be 100 basis points higher. The increase in our GAAP NOI projection is reflected in our guidance for noncash straight-line rents, which is now $40 million to $55 million for the full year.
We acquired Peterson Way this quarter, with a plan to complete entitlement and develop the site in the future. In the meantime, the building is 100% leased for the next 5 years, and it's projected to generate approximately a 4.6% cash return and a 5.8% GAAP return. As a result, we've increased our 2016 guidance for the incremental NOI contribution from our non-same property portfolio. That includes our new developments and our acquisitions to $38 million to $44 million. The projected 2016 incremental contribution from these developments and acquisitions for 2015 represents 3% year-over-year growth on our share of the total portfolio NOI.
We also increased our guidance for development and management services income by $2 million at the midpoint and now project services income of $22 million to $26 million for the year. The impact of these changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operations to $5.85 to $5.95 per share. This is an increase of $0.05 per share at the midpoint, consisting of $0.02 per share from better projected portfolio performance, $0.02 from acquisitions and $0.01 from higher projected development and management services income.
That completes our formal remarks. I'd appreciate it if the operator would open up the line for any questions."

And hopefully, over time, that the City of New York will have a demand generator that allows us to start that building with a significant pre-leasing commitment associated with it. I think that the challenge with New York City and I'll let John Powers comment on this, is that while there are plenty of tenants who are paying above $100 a square foot, there are not a lot of big tenants that would be anchor tenants that would be paying over a $100 of square foot in size. And so I think the market has to be naturally positioned to accommodate the demand that is there as opposed to a hope that simply, rising rents will be achieved by the traditional large-scale tenant demand that the city currently sees. John, you want to comment anymore?"

In general, the more dominant quarter is relative to its San Francisco roll over, the higher the numbers will be because on average, there is -- there's probably somewhere around a 50% or 55% mark-to-market on virtually everything that we are doing in Embarcadero Center. So as that gets a larger portion of each particular quarter, that's what's driving it. And then I think the second area would be our New York portfolio at the General Motors Building, where we have significant embedded upside. So when those things rollover into the market, you're going to see a much higher number and then our Cambridge portfolio, where there's a significant embedded upside.

We won't need to use mezzanine debt to get to that level. The cash flow of that property has grown pretty dramatically over the last 10 years that we've owned it, as we've rolled up rents pretty constantly over that time frame. And there's still -- it's still under-rented from a lease rate perspective. So from a debt underwriting perspective, lenders will be comfortable with the cash flow characteristics and the future cash flow characteristics. It's obviously a large loan. So that's the biggest challenge with it, is that the current financing is $1.6 billion. It's naturally going to be good for the CMBS market. The CMBS market can easily handle a loan of that size typically. But that market has been a little bit more volatile over the last 6 to 9 months, although I would say that most of the volatility is when you start to get into the higher leverage points. So when you're talking about a loan that is 40% to 50% leveraged, that market is more -- is a better place to be today than if you're talking about a loan that is 60% to 65% leveraged. So we could finance this loan today in the CMBS market based upon the leverage points that we have. The existing loan is a syndicate of a bunch of banks and insurance companies. So it's also possible to execute in that type of environment, where you would have somebody help you put together a large syndicate. So I think there's a couple of different ways for us to tackle this. It doesn't expire until the end of '17. So obviously, there's time, but we're -- we've put in some hedges for about 1/3 of the exposure at this point. So that's kind of where I see that standing."

And then what I mean by saying a shift, I do think our thinking about launching new developments is shifting. I think our pre-let requirement is higher. It's difficult for us to say precisely that we need x percent of a building pre-let to launch it because it depends a lot on other factors, like where is the tenant coming from? What's the size of the building? What's the nature of the market at the time? So we don't set those kinds of fixed hurdles.

Let me take a quick stab at that, Steve, because it's a fair question. So the good news is that the occupancy number that you were describing and the contribution from the properties that are in that occupancy number is significantly under-weighted. In other words, if it were leased, the relative rent that it would achieve is de minimis relative to the rents that we're achieving in our CBD properties. So as an example, the Washington, D.C. vacancy is in our VA 95 product. And it's interesting. It's actually the first time in the 20-some-odd years that we've had significant availability in that particular part. But the net rents -- or the net rents that we're achieving are $13 a square foot. The big pieces of availability in our portfolio are at Tower Center in New Brunswick, which is in excess of 300,000 square feet of that availability, and then the property in South San Francisco at Gateway. So if you pull those 3 out, the VA 95 couple, the Gateway and the Tower Center, you have a very different picture.

We want to perform the real estate skill, lease the buildings and get a proper price for them. But -- and I would say, if you go back and look at the asset sales that we've done, clearly, we've done some of the large joint ventures on the urban assets.

The actual allocations are also driven by where the opportunities present themselves."

I also think that -- and I think we've been pretty consistent in our description of this, which is: We're a demand-oriented company. We're looking to serve those users, who are growing, and where the demand is being generated. And to the extent that there is more demand and users that are sort of technology-oriented, and they happen to be in the West Coast, we're going to do everything we can to service those companies. On the other hand, New York City and the Boston and the Cambridge marketplaces and, to some degree, Northern Virginia also have a pretty interesting future demand pool that we are going to try and serve as best we can as well. And so I think that we are going to be aggressive about making investments in all of those places, where we think there's an opportunity to find tenants, who are growing, and who are looking for a high-quality office space."

This morning, I'll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions that we see as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity.On current results, we produced another strong quarter wit",1772,"Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions that we see as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity.
On current results, we produced another strong quarter with FFO per share $0.05 above consensus, primarily due to improved operating performance. We've also increased the midpoint of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.05. We leased the 1.5 million square feet in the first quarter, above historical averages, and our portfolio occupancy is now 91%, down 40 basis points from year-end, due primarily to the Genentech vacancy of 186,000 square feet at 611 Gateway South San Francisco. We had solid rent roll ups in our leasing activity, with rental rates on leases that commenced in the first quarter, up to 16% on a gross basis and 26% on a net basis compared to the prior lease. The leasing results in San Francisco, New York and Boston, all exhibited strong growth over the quarter.
Now moving to market conditions. U.S. economic growth continues to be positive, though we certainly see a hint of slowdown. Fourth quarter GDP growth is now reported at 1.5%, which is down 2% from the third quarter last year, and estimates for this quarter are below 1%. However, most forecasters for this year are still predicting growth in excess of 2.5% albeit after downward revisions.
The jobs picture remains fairly healthy with 215,000 jobs created in March and the unemployment rate is steady at 5%. Labor participation statistics are unchanged. We also see office markets nationally continuing to improve. Net absorption was 5.9 million square feet in the first quarter. Vacancy rate remains essentially unchanged at 13.9%, asking rents rose 4.7% over the last year, construction levels also rose 6% over the last year but remained at 2% of total stocks, slightly above long-term averages for the U.S. office market. We continue to see the strongest-based demand in locations driven by technology, life sciences and other innovative industries notwithstanding all the financial disruption for the last 9 months.
Moving to financial markets. They've improved materially from their lows in mid-February. S&P 500 is up over 14%, credit spreads have narrowed, oil prices are up over 50%. Near-term interest rate increases also look less likely with the U.S. Federal Reserve, highlighting concerns about the sluggish growth and other central banks around the world, most recently the European Central Bank, signaling an accommodated posture. 10-year U.S. Treasury is hovering around 1.9%, has traded below 2% since January. Credit spreads narrowed less though for riskier credits.
Now moving to real estate. On private real estate, private market's real estate valuation, prices remain strong for prime assets in gateway market. And we've seen plenty of evidence of this over the first quarter. And seen a number of transactions in our core market that were offered and priced in 2016. Examples of this include: In Boston, 101 Seaport, that's a new 440,000 square foot office building located in the Seaport District, 100% leased to PwC on a long-term basis, sold for $1,029 of square foot and a 4% initial cap rate to a German fund.
In Washington, D.C., 733 10th Street, fully leased 170,000 square foot office building sold for about a 4.7% initial cap rate, $1,065 square foot, I believe, only the third building to trade above $1,000 per square foot in the district. The buyer was a Middle Eastern Fund Manager.
In New York, there are 2 significant sales reported to be pending to non-U.S. investors. A significant partial interest in 10 Hudson Yards, a new 1.8 million square foot office tower, selling for a low 4s, initial cap rate and nearly $1,200 a square foot; and 550 Madison Avenue, an 850,000 square foot office building that was being vacated for residential conversion is trading for approximately $1,800 a square foot.
And lastly, in San Francisco, 140 New Montgomery, a 300,000 square foot older but fully renovated Class A office building in the SoMa district, leased at current market rents, sold to a U.S. investor for approximately a 48 cap rate and over $960 a foot, a record price per square foot in San Francisco.
As with the fixed income market, our perception is pricing for riskier assets whether a noncore location and/or requiring lease up or renovation has softened to a degree in 2016. Long-term interest rates are low and cap rate spreads of the treasuries are above long-term averages, both of which provide strong support to real estate valuations. As I've mentioned before, the relatively high investment yields and cash flow stability provided by high quality real estate assets will continue to be an attractive investment alternative to fixed income. 
Now moving to our capital strategy. It remains unchanged and that we're investing more in new developments and redevelopments than in stabilized acquisition, and these investments will be funded partially by select asset dispositions in the balance with debt financing.
On acquisitions, we continue to actively review and are seeing an increase for the reasons I mentioned earlier in value-add and development opportunities in our core markets. This past quarter, we purchased a 218,000 square foot office building on Peterson Way in Santa Clara, California for $78 million. The asset is in an infill location, with increasing density and 100% leased to a single tenant through 2021. During the remaining lease term, we plan to entitle the property for approximately a 630,000 square foot office campus. So the way to think about pricing is we're paying $123 a square foot for unentitled land, while receiving a 4.6% cash yield as we entitle and pre-lease a new upsize office complex. We're also working on several additional acquisitions of size and value-add office buildings.
On dispositions. In the first quarter, as previously discussed, we completed the sale of 7 Kendall Center to MIT for $105 million. We continue to pursue select sales of noncore assets and maintain our estimate of 2016 asset sales of $200 million to $250 million.
Moving to development. We remain very active, primarily in the execution of our predevelopment pipeline. In terms of forecasting potential starts for the balance of 2016, it will remain highly dependent on securing pre-leasing for entitled sites. The potential starts for 2016 include: Springfield Metro Center, where we're pursuing a requirement with the TSA; Reston Block 5, located in the Reston Town Center; and 20 CityPoint, the Mirror building to 10 CityPoint being developed in Waltham. These 3 projects aggregate 1.1 million square feet.
We've been very active this past quarter, advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start beyond 2016. Several important updates are as follows: As mentioned last quarter, in Cambridge at year-end 2015, 940,000 square feet of additional entitlements were made available for our Kendall Center development. We're -- we are in advanced discussion with multiple office users to fully pre-lease the 540,000 square foot office component of the entitlement. The balance of the project will be high-rise residential. The project is complex, involving replacing 2 smaller existing buildings on the site and will likely commence in 2017. Given we are not acquiring additional land, this project is another great example of the embedded development value in many of our existing assets.
You've probably read about our initial submission to the city of Boston for the development of additional site at the Back Bay Station. We are already managing the concourse level of the Back Bay Station as part of our agreement with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. The project is in an early phase and could ultimately represent 1.3 million square feet of office retail and residential space located adjacent to a major Boston transit hub. The project is obviously subject to local approvals and public review and would not commence prior to late 2017.
You have also probably, read that we've been designated by the MTA as developer for their site located at 343 Madison Avenue between 44th and 45th Street in New York. The site is the western half of a full city block between Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues and offers direct access to Grand Central Station and the new Long Island railroad station at Grand Central terminal. We will acquire a 99-year ground lease and build up to a 900,000 square foot office tower, subject to a number of local approvals and ULURP. The development at this property is likely several years out, but we've commenced our predevelopment work.
As discussed, we're also conducting a significant upgrade of portions of our portfolio. These redevelopment projects that we're executing include: 399 Park, the low-rise building of 601 Lex in New York; 1330 Connecticut Avenue; Metropolitan Square; and the Prudential Center retail.
At the end of the first quarter, our development pipeline consisted of 11 new projects and 1 redevelopment, representing 4.6 million square feet and $2.6 billion in projected costs. Our budgeted NOI for these projects remains an excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 61% pre-lease. We have all the cash, $1.4 billion, required to complete the development of the portfolio, which should add materially to our company's growth over the next 4 years.
Moving for a moment to a comment on governance. We recently announced in our proxy that Mort Zuckerman will retire as Chairman of the Board and become Chairman emeritus of Boston Properties. Ivan Seidenberg will also retire from our board and Joel Klein will become our Lead Independent Director. We were also very pleased to be able to recruit Karen Dykstra and Bruce Duncan as independent directors of our board.
So in conclusion, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value for the balance of 2016 and in future years. We have a very clear plan to improve and lease our existing assets as well as add new buildings through development to our portfolio. All of which, we expect to result in attractive FFO growth over the coming years. We have selected noncore assets for sale to ensure continued portfolio refreshments. We have significant entitled and unentitled landholdings that we will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years.
Our balance sheet is strong, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 6x and with a substantial portion of our upcoming debt maturities having now been either refinanced or hedged. This strong capital position will also allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that may present themselves in the coming quarters.
Now let me turn it over to Doug for a further review of our markets."

So what we've said before is that San Francisco has slowed from the pace it was going at in 2014 and 2015 and the Silicon Valley continues to be very active and is actually -- has been expanding. New York is a good market, but it's been impacted by growing supply and there's been some impact of the financial service market volatility on small tenant demand. The Washington D.C. is a challenged market and there's not much evidence of improvement. So the Reston area continues to be pretty active and there's little bit of growth there. And Boston suburban and Cambridge are seeing increasing demand, while the CBD is a healthy market but it's really been more driven by lease expirations and intermittent technology migration. So that's sort of levels that what I'd said previously.
Let me start now with the Silicon Valley and given that Peterson Way was just part I'll give you some sense of the thesis around on this site and our views of the Valley. So having sold innovation place last quarter, our portfolio is unfortunately, it's pretty small down there. It's really comprised of 570,000 square feet of Mountain View, single-story product, where we actually completed another 89,000 square feet of leases this quarter, with average starting rents of $50 triple net, which is more than double the expiring rents on that space. And then we have our stand-alone office building down in Mountain View, which is only 141,000 square feet. And we have our land redevelopment parcel on North First in San Jose. That's the totality of our portfolio down there.
The difficulty we've been having over the last 4, 5 years is finding high-quality buildings or sites within acceptable basis/return ratio. And the Peterson Way site offers an opportunity for us to deliver products in 2023 at a cost basis of under $700 a square foot, and that assumes cost escalation on the cost side of the equation in terms of our building materials, labor, et cetera, and an initial return in excess of 7% at rents that are less than 10% above market rents today.
So we have a market where there is 29 million square feet of gross leasing and user activity in 2015. The market size of about 240 million square feet. So it's a market we definitely want to be a part of, and there was 11 million square feet of absorption in 2015. In the first quarter, there were another 8 leases over a 100,000 square feet each, including 275,000 square feet from Google, and another 200,000 square feet from Apple and those are clearly the 2 dominant users of space and they've had a dramatic influence on the market. But there are lots of other companies down there like Facebook, NVIDIA, and Broadcom, and VMware and Palo Alto Networks that are really leaders in their perspective fields and they are -- these are growing companies and what they're looking for is new, modern, efficient products to house their growth. So this is what we're going to hopefully build, and this is the demand that we're going to satisfy.
Jumping over to the city. As we discussed in our call, in January, we see velocity in the San Francisco CBD has moderated from the levels we saw in '14 and early '15. Actually, that's been a continuation into the beginning of 2016. I think the big difference between the market then, i.e., in '14 and '15, and today is really the lack of large growth requirements and by that, I mean, big tenants over 300,000 square feet. So at the moment, there's no 300,000 square foot or greater requirement that we are tracking in the market. In '13, '14 and '15, you had unprecedented large growth from Google, in Dropbox, in Salesforce.com and Uber, and Stripe and Slack and LinkedIn and they're just not there today. However, there continues to be lots of active tech demand and in the first quarter, AirBnB and Twilio and Comcast and Stripe all took down blocks over 100,000 square feet each, and just in April, Lyft and Fitbit and Uber combined leased over 500,000 square feet and much of that actually was from the sublet market. So technology is still a vibrant part of the market. It's still expanding. It's just not quite in the same area that it was in '14 and '15. And interestingly, technology users now make up 31% of all of the space leased in the City of San Francisco.
The second change in the CBD market, in San Francisco has been the velocity from startups. If you look at the venture investing statistics, the seed in early-stage investing is down about 22% quarter-to-quarter from prior year. And first time that investing is down 31% and if you look at the cities sublet statistics, the overall level is very low at about 1.4 million square feet but there are significant amounts of full floor availability between 12,000 and 15,000 square feet across the south financial and the SoMa areas. This is the product that's most attractive to the startup community. Keep in mind that most sublet space has limited term, so it's not competing with the lease expiration-driven requirements from traditional tenants, which is where we are working at Embarcadero Center. So as you see, we completed another 128,000 square feet of leasing during the quarter, full floor tenants totaled 90,000 square feet of that 128,000 and new tenants coming into Embarcadero Center totaled 85,000 square feet of that 128,000. The mark-to-market on these larger transactions is between 40% and 70% on a gross basis, very consistent with what we've been seeing for the last couple of quarters and is obviously a dramatic markup in our same-store statistics this quarter. The pipeline of leases that we have going in negotiation today, at EC continues to be robust, 150,000 square feet of additional leases in negotiation, 66,000 square feet of that is either new tenants or expansions. We also have active discussions with new tenant for an additional 4 vacant floors, totaling 100,000 square feet. So it's very, very busy at Embarcadero Center. I would say, however, that relative to the end of 2015, when activity was described as strong as it has ever been in the history of our ownership, the pace of new tours has moderated a little bit.
We've signed additional leases for floors at Salesforce Tower, 108,000 square feet, which is in our statistics today. So occupancy is 59% and the next wave of these proposals are progressing and include some single floor users as well as large tenants of between 2 and 4 floors. All of the discussions involve pending lease 2017 and '18 lease expirations. The steel on the core arising into the San Francisco skyline, and we hope to have our first tenant in occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018.
Now based on conversations we've had with shareholders and analysts recently, I think it's fair to say that there's been a prevalent of concern about the next market I'm going to talk about, which is Midtown Manhattan. Our perspective has been pretty consistent since 2014 when we recognized there was going to be a supply issue from both new construction and the impending relocations that would impact lease economics. There continues to be good, not great leasing activity across the city and there are still tenant expansions across diverse industry groups, including examples of financial services companies within our portfolio that are expanding today. Some of them were recent transactions in the marketplace from an expansion perspective have included Facebook and CBS Broadcasting, Vox Media, Google, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Schroders and Chubb.
In January, we talked about the fact that the public capital market volatility was impacting the decision-making from small financial firms. And the first quarter was certainly a roller coaster for the debt and the equity markets. These conditions impact velocity at the high end, which is predominantly a small financial services for our demand pool. Across the market in the first quarter, there were 5 relocation transactions written at starting rents over $100 a square foot and that includes the Citadel lease at 425 Park. So if you move -- remove the Citadel transaction, the average lease was 10,000 square feet. So 4 leases, 10,000 square feet on average. There was clearly a change in the market in the first quarter.
During the quarter, we completed 14 deals for about 173,000 square feet. Over 100,000 square feet of our demand at starting rents over $100 a square foot. They were all renewals and explorer expansions. While we continue to see a constant and steady volume of leasing at between $80 and $120 per square foot, the velocity above $125 a square foot has slowed. We have been successful leasing smaller units across the portfolio for a number of years, and we're going to take a very similar approach to the 2 General Motors floors, we get back on July 1st. Subdividing them for smaller customers as required.
Our discussions regarding the entire FAO block continues to be very, very active. Given the magnitude of the commitment by the respective tenants, this will take some time, but we hope to have a firm signed lease later this year.
Last quarter, we announced our lease termination transaction at 250 West 55th Street, and while we have not signed a lease on any of that space in the last 90 days, we have significant conversations underway for the entire second floor and a number of food operators have presented proposals for the ground floor space. So the activity on that take back is stronger than we anticipated.
At 399 Park, we're in lease negotiations with 2 existing tenants that would expand and commit to about 175,000 square feet of the city space rolling over in '17, 125,000 square feet of that demand represents expansions by these tenants. Now we've had some questions about the roll up and roll down of the office space that Citi is going to be leaving in '17 and our expectation is that it's going to be pretty moderate with a very slight roll up. So as an example, we completed a full floor extension on one of the floors that's in question and the roll up was about 3.75% on a gross basis, i.e., pretty flat. This quarter, our New York City portfolio, CBD portfolio had a roll up of over 35% on a gross basis. So clearly, 399 Park is one of the more moderate pieces of that. Now Mike needs some significant enhancements to our supplemental package this quarter and he's going to discuss those. But the one I want to point out is the delineation of our share of the portfolio NOI by market. In the case of our Washington, D.C. region, it illustrates what we've been saying for some time, which is that our Washington, D.C. CBD portfolio is 9.5% of the company's NOI. We've seen a number of comments suggesting that the D.C. office market has turned the corner. Our view is that there has been no remarkable change in the leasing environment. Most of the D.C. law firms have completed their new installations. Between '16 and 2019, we're tracking only one law firm expiration over 100,000 square feet. The good news is that there's likelihood of little impact on any downsizing on the market. The bad news is that there's still activity being generated from this sector. The GSA continues to be very -- take a very measured approach to their renewals and is now hunkering into what we refer to as election inertia, which contributes to pushing out decisions. In spite of the challenging environment, we did complete 117,000 square foot lease at WeWork at Met Square this quarter as well as get another 17,000 square feet of the uncommitted space at 601 Mass Avenue lease.
This quarter, we also completed a 60,000 square foot renewal in Reston Town Center, starting rents in the mid-50s and 5 smaller transactions totaling 17,000 square feet. Reston continues to be 97% leased. One green shoot in the Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia marketplace comes from a group of midsized technology tenants that have slowly expanding. We have a few of these tenants in our Reston portfolio, some direct and actually some subtenants, and they are prime candidates for that next building in Town Center that Owen mentioned.
The Boston region continues to be a magnet for life science industry and established tech companies as well as for startup technology and maker organizations. This has led to a continual improvement in leasing momentum in the greater Boston market this quarter. Leasing velocity in the Waltham Lexington submarket in particular has accelerated during the last few months as a result of the type of demand and much of it is organic expansion. When we purchased a colony in 2011, there was about 50,000 square feet of technology tenants and no life science companies in the park. Today, we have over 500,000 square feet of these users and almost every one of them is in an expansion mode. This quarter, we completed another 179,000 square feet in our suburban portfolio, and we have responded to more than 500,000 square feet of additional portfolio over the last month. Virtually every pharma company has put down a base in the Cambridge market and coupled with the growth of the biotech industry and the tech titans that are there. We have a market where the availability rate is under 5%. We are in active lease discussions, as Owen described, on a 100% of our recently permitted commercial density, which will likely involve terminating some leases and potentially taking down some existing buildings in order to accommodate the new growth. We expect to make our site-specific applications this year, with a potential construction commencement in early 2017. And again, as Owen said, as part of this new development, we will also build additional residential high-rise product.
The Boston CBD continues to be a very steady market as supply has been absorbed over the last 2 years, so there isn't speculative development going on in the Seaport area. While we do have a few technology tenants expanding into the overall market, much of the demand is still lease expiration-driven. General Electric is going to be moving to accommodation of new construction, in the rehab building, currently owned by P&G and not utilizing existing inventory. This quarter, we completed over 520,000 square feet of leasing and that includes the work we did at 100 Federal Street, which is about 400,000 square feet of that. We also did 28,000 square feet at the top of 200 Clarendon, a 50,000 square feet at Prudential Center.
Activity at 120 St. James, where we have 170,000 square feet of the availability has picked up dramatically and although we haven't signed any leases, we have a number of tenants reviewing their options at the building and they range from between 32,000 square feet, which will be partial floor to the entire 170,000 square foot block. All of those tenants will have occupancy in late '17 or early '18.
Last quarter, we provided a score card for our revenue bridge. We continue to make progress and with additional transactions this quarter, leasing at Embarcadero Center, the Prudential Tower, 200 Clarendon and 250 West 55th Street, we've accomplished about $48 million of that $80 million bridge.
And with that, I'll turn the floor over to Mike."
368278,331205601,976746,"Boston Properties Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Doug mentioned, we made some changes to our supplemental financial report this quarter that I'd like to go over. The purpose was really to more clearly reflect the characteristics and performance of our share of t",1001,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. As Doug mentioned, we made some changes to our supplemental financial report this quarter that I'd like to go over. The purpose was really to more clearly reflect the characteristics and performance of our share of the portfolio, given the sizable impacts of the consolidated joint ventures that we have put in place in the last couple of years.
In addition to delineating the geographic and tenant diversification in this manner, we've included supplemental information in our same-property NOI performance stages to include both the consolidated portfolio performance that we historically provided as well as the performance of our share portfolio. You will also note that we folded our R&D segment into our office segment this quarter to the immaterial size of the R&D portfolio, especially after the sale of 415 Main Street in Cambridge during the first quarter.
Lastly, as Owen mentioned, we're embarking on several significant repositioning projects within the portfolio, which we consider nonrecurring in nature. In our capital expenditure disclosure, in the supplemental, we're now segregating the capital spend for these projects, which have a total budget of approximately $165 million to be spent over the next few years.
Now turning to our results for the quarter. As you can see from our press release, we reported first quarter funds from operations of $1.63 per share, which is $0.03 per share, or about $5 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The performance of our portfolio drove approximately $4 million of this outperformance, with about half of it coming from faster-than-projected leasing activity. We continue to successfully execute early renewals at Embarcadero Center and in our Mountain View properties at a significant rent roll up that are straight-lined into our revenues upon lease signing.
We also incurred earlier-than-projected occupancy from new leasing in smaller pieces across the portfolio. Approximately $2 million of the improvement resulted from lower-than-projected operating expenses that stemmed from warmer-than-normal weather conditions in the Northeast, which reduced our utilities expense a little bit as well as the deferral of repair and maintenance expenses that we project will be incurred later this year.
On development and management services fee income, we're approximately $1 million ahead of our projected -- projection. The majority relates to higher-than-anticipated service income generated in the portfolio. We also signed an agreement to act as development manager for the tenant that acquired our former Innovation Place project in North San Jose, and we will earn a multi-year development fee for work that commenced this quarter.
Our first quarter same-property performance was solid, with the combined portfolio cash NOI, up 5.6% and GAAP NOI, up 1.5% from the first quarter last year. As I mentioned, the company share of NOI growth differs from the combined results, and if you pull out the noncontrolling interest share, our share of the portfolio performance is even better. This quarter, our share of cash NOI growth was 7% and GAAP NOI growth was 2.8% from 2015, which is the new level of detail we provided on Page 41 of the supplemental under the heading Adjusted Combined.
As we look out to the remainder of 2016, we project our same-property growth to moderate through the year. Our same-property cash NOI growth will be impacted by free rent that was in place in the first quarter of 2015 but burned off during the year. And both GAAP and cash NOI will be negatively impacted by the pending vacancy of 70,000 square feet in the mid-rise at 767 Fifth Avenue and 150,000 square feet at 601 Lexington Avenue, where we've completed a series of lease terminations and relocations that will allow us to redevelop the low rise buildings starting later this year. We expect this portion of the building to be out of service for about 2 years. The redevelopment will result in a longer period of downtime but in late 2018, when we've reintroduced the new retail and low-rise building to the market, we expect it will enhance the long-term value and future cash flow from the building.
Our leasing activity in the portfolio is steady and generally, in line with our prior projections. Overall, we modestly increased our combined same-property NOI growth projections for GAAP NOI, and we still project roughly breakeven growth in 2015, and we continue to expect our combined same-property cash NOI growth to be 1% to 3% from 2015. Again, when you remove the noncontrolling interest share from the consolidated portfolio, our share of growth for both GAAP and cash is projected to be 100 basis points higher. The increase in our GAAP NOI projection is reflected in our guidance for noncash straight-line rents, which is now $40 million to $55 million for the full year.
We acquired Peterson Way this quarter, with a plan to complete entitlement and develop the site in the future. In the meantime, the building is 100% leased for the next 5 years, and it's projected to generate approximately a 4.6% cash return and a 5.8% GAAP return. As a result, we've increased our 2016 guidance for the incremental NOI contribution from our nonsame property portfolio. That includes our new developments and our acquisitions to $38 million to $44 million. The projected 2016 incremental contribution from these developments and acquisitions for 2015 represents 3% year-over-year growth on our share of the total portfolio NOI.
We also increased our guidance for development and management services income by $2 million at the midpoint and now project services income of $22 million to $26 million for the year. The impact of these changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operations to $5.85 to $5.95 per share. This is an increase of $0.05 per share at the midpoint, consisting of $0.02 per share from better projected portfolio performance, $0.02 from acquisitions and $0.01 from higher projected development and management services income.
That completes our formal remarks. I'd appreciate it if the operator would open up the line for any questions."

And hopefully, over time, that the City of New York will have a demand generator that allows us to start that building with a significant pre-leasing commitment associated with it. I think that the challenge with New York City and I'll let John Powers comment on this, is that while there are plenty of tenants who are paying above $100 a square foot, there are not a lot of big tenants that would be anchor tenants that would be paying over a $100 of square foot in size. And so I think the market has to be naturally positioned to accommodate the demand that is there as opposed to a hope that simply, rising rents will be achieved by the traditional large-scale tenant demand that the city currently sees.

So as that gets a larger portion of each particular quarter, that's what's driving it. And then I think the second area would be our New York portfolio at the General Motors Building, where we have significant embedded upside.

We won't need to use mezzanine debt to get to that level. The cash flow of that property has grown pretty dramatically over the last 10 years that we've owned it, as we've rolled up rents pretty constantly over that time frame. And there's still -- it's still under-rented from a lease rate perspective. So from a debt underwriting perspective, lenders will be comfortable with the cash flow characteristics and the future cash flow characteristics. It's obviously a large loan. So that's the biggest challenge with it, is that the current financing is $1.6 billion. It's naturally going to be good for the CMBS market. The CMBS market can easily handle a loan of that size typically. But that market has been a little bit more volatile over the last 6 to 9 months, although I would say that most of the volatility is when you start to get into the higher leverage points. So when you're talking about a loan that is 40% to 50% leveraged, that market is more -- is a better place to be today than if you're talking about a loan that is 60% to 65% leveraged. So we could finance this loan today in the CMBS market based upon the leverage points that we have. The existing loan is a syndicate of a bunch of banks and insurance companies. So it's also possible to execute in that type of environment, where you would have somebody help you put together a large syndicate. So I think there's a couple of different ways for us to tackle this. It doesn't expire until the end of '17. So obviously, there's time, but we're -- we've put in some hedges for about 1/3 of the exposure at this point. So that's kind of where I see that standing."

So the good news is that the occupancy number that you were describing and the contribution from the properties that are in that occupancy number is significantly under-weighted. In other words, if it were leased, the relative rent that it would achieve is de minimis relative to the rents that we're achieving in our CBD properties. So as an example, the Washington, D.C. vacancy is in our VA 95 product. And it's interesting. It's actually the first time in the 20-some-odd years that we've had significant availability in that particular part. But the net rents -- or the net rents that we're achieving are $13 a square foot. The big pieces of availability in our portfolio are at Tower Center in New Brunswick, which is in excess of 300,000 square feet of that availability, and then the property in South San Francisco at Gateway. So if you pull those 3 out, the VA 95 couple, the Gateway and the Tower Center, you have a very different picture.

We want to perform the real estate skill, lease the buildings and get a proper price for them. But -- and I would say, if you go back and look at the asset sales that we've done, clearly, we've done some of the large joint ventures on the urban assets.

And for that reason, if you pro forma what we're going to look like over the next few years, the San Francisco component of our overall results is going to grow materially, primarily driven by the sales of the delivery of the Salesforce Tower, but also by some of the other projects that we delivered last year, like 680, 690, 535 Mission and so forth. So it has been a conscious effort. And I think it's going to continue to be a conscious effort that we're going to grow our company in areas where there's the greatest tenant demand, which today is technology and life sciences.

As usual, I'll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions as we see them, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another strong quarter with FFO per share $0.04 above consensus, primarily due to accelerated lease termination income. We've also increased the midpoint of our full-year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.06. In the quarter, we leased 925,000 square feet, nearly half of that in the New York region and this quarterly volume is above historical averages by number of leases but below on total square feet. Our portfolio occupancy is now 90.8%, down 20 basis points from the end of the first quarter. We had another quarter of strong rent roll ups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the second quarter up 18% on a gross basis and 28% on a net basis compared to prior lease. As we anticipate our leasing spreads continue to be strongest in San Francisco and Boston and positive in all regions. 
Now, moving to the economy. U.S. economic growth continues to be sluggish and slowing. First quarter GDP has been reported at 1.1%, down from 1.4% in the fourth quarter of last year, and estimates for all of 2016 are approximately 2% after downward revision. The important picture is -- been recently healthy with 287,000 jobs created in June but has been volatile throughout 2016. Also, the unemployment rate has been relatively flat at 4.9%. Now economically the most significant news for the quarter was the U.K. surprise referendum outcome to leave the European Union. We've also had a series of tragic terrorist events and an attempted coup in Turkey. There's already evidence of a slowdown in the U.K. economy and the IMF predicts the global GDP will follow. Sterling has dropped over 10% and Central banks in Europe and the U.K. are all signaling an accommodated posture. Given dollar strength and slowing growth, we believe that it will be more difficult for the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase rates further in the near term. The 10 year U.S. treasury has dropped 30 basis points to 1.6% over the quarter as a result. Lower rates have fueled record highs for the S&P 500 and a surge in REIT share prices in the U.S. Given the growth in the U.S. economy, albeit anemic, office markets nationally continue to improve slowly. Net absorption was 8.4 million square feet for the second quarter. Vacancy improved 10 basis points to 13.8%, asking rents rose 6.5% year-over-year. Construction levels are up 5% year-over-year but remain at 2.2% of total stock, which is slightly above long-term averages. We continue to see the strongest space demand in innovation centers. So how are we managing our business given this environment of sluggish growth, punctuated by increasingly frequent economic and political events and an uncertain presidential election in November? First, we will continue to take advantage of reasonably healthy tenant demand and lease up our existing vacancy and new developments. Second, we'll focus our new investment activity around innovation centers where we see the strongest prospects for growth. And lastly, we will also protect the downside given the prospect of volatility by requiring pre-leasing for new office development, avoiding the purchase of stabilized assets at low cap rate and keeping our overall corporate leverage at conservative levels. 
Moving to private market real estate valuation. We believe prices remain strong for prime assets and gateway markets. As evidence, we've seen a number of transactions in addition to what I've discussed last quarter in our core markets that were recently committed in 2016. In Cambridge, 1 Kendall Square, which is a 645,000 square-foot office lab and retail asset sold for $1,124 a square foot and a low 4s initial cap rate, though the sale did include a 173,000 square-foot development site, the buyer was a U.S. REIT with a capital partner. In New York, a partial interest in 7 West 34th Street, which is a 477,000 square foot office building fully lent to Amazon was sold for $1,176 a square foot at a low to mid-4s cap rate to an Asian investor. In San Francisco, the piers on the Embarcadero waterfront, albeit a small 82,000 square-foot building sold for a low 4s cap rate and $1,250 a square foot, which is a record for San Francisco and this was sold to a U.S. pension advisor. And in L.A, 12100 Wilshire and 11601 Wilshire sold at separate transactions to U.S. REIT, possibly with non-U.S. capital partners at a mid-3s cap rates and approximately $625 a square foot. As cap rates spread widen with increasing interest rates and European investment are exacerbated by Brexit and other geopolitical events, we continue to see a tailwind for U.S. real estate valuation, particularly on our core markets. 
Our capital strategy remains unchanged and that we are investing primarily in new developments and redevelopments, funded partially by select asset dispositions and the balance with debt financing. So let me start with acquisitions. This quarter, we closed the purchase of a 50% interest in Colorado Center located in Santa Monica, California and that closed on July 1. Colorado Center comprises 1.2 million square feet on a 15-acre site and is one of the premier office campuses in West Los Angeles. Though the complex is very well parked with 3,100 stalls located 1 block from the Bergamot Station and the newly opened commuter rail line between downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica. 
Moving to economics, the property is 68% leased which provides us with a significant upside opportunity. Our net purchase price is $504 million or $850 a square foot and renovation and tenant capital will be required to lease a property. So the going in NOI cap rate is 3.4%, upon full lease up of the complex, we expect to achieve yields of approximately 5.5% and over 6% after a full mark-to-market of the tenant base. Teachers owns the other 50% of Colorado Center and we will provide all leasing property and construction management for the asset. We also look forward to advancing our relationship with Teachers as part of this investment. In addition to the financial aspects of transactions, Colorado Center has provided Boston Properties with the opportunity to enter the West Los Angeles market with a significant asset. We view West L.A. as an important innovation center and currently one of the most vibrant office markets in the United States. Our intent is to methodically over time, build up Los Angeles into a full independent region for our company. We hired the on-site property management staff and Ray Richie is providing senior-level direction to our Colorado Center in Los Angeles effort. Property management oversight, construction development and other support are all being provided from our San Francisco office. As the Los Angeles region grows, we anticipate a migration to local personnel, both hired externally and internally transferred. 
Lastly, I'm also pleased to report we are off to a very strong start in the leasing program for Colorado Center and Doug is going to provide more details on this. Now on dispositions. We're in the market with VA95, our 11-building 740,000 square-foot suburban office campus located in Springfield, Virginia. This park may be sold in whole or part. We're pursuing a recapitalization of Metropolitan Square, a 660,000 square-foot office building located in the CBD of Washington, D.C. Given these transactions and our completed sale of 7 Kendall Center, we could reach as much as $350 million in 2016 asset sales. 
Moving to development. We remain active delivering assets into service, advancing our predevelopment pipeline and evaluating new investments. In terms of potential starts for 2016, we're competing for a 630,000 square foot office build a suite for the TSA in Springfield, Virginia. We're also commencing the full rehabilitation of the low-rise building at 601 Lexington Avenue. The building is being renamed 159 East 53rd Street and will have a segregated street entrance and lobby for 195,000 square foot office building. We remain very active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several important updates from the second quarter include at Kendall Center in Cambridge, we're in advanced discussions with an office user to fully pre-leased a 400,000 plus square foot office building which will require demolition of an existing 80,000 square-foot low-rise building. This project would not commence until 2017 and efforts continue on developing commitments and projects for the remaining approximately 500,000 square feet of potential entitlements at Kendall Center. It has been reported that Boston Properties and a local developer attempting to entitle  MacArthur Station Residences, which is a 402 unit, 25 storey residential development located adjacent to the MacArthur Bart Station in the neighborhood of Oakland, California. We signed a letter of intent to invest in the project and are working on the entitlement process. Given the high cost of multifamily products in the San Francisco market, we believe we can deliver high-quality units at approximately 20% discount to San Francisco rents in a location that is a 16-minute transit ride from the Embarcadero station in downtown San Francisco. The project will not commence until 2017, also subject to achieving entitlement. This past quarter, we also delivered 3 projects fully into service including 601 Mass. Avenue in Washington, 10 CityPoint in Waltham and 804 Carnegie Center in Princeton. In the aggregate, these buildings comprise 850,000 square feet or 94% leased, cost $487 million to build and are being delivered at a 7.8% NOI return on cost, which is above our projection. Given the value of the properties at a much lower cap rate, deliver of these projects again demonstrates the value creation power of our development platform. Now given the delivery, at the end of the second quarter, our development pipeline now consists of 8 new projects and 1 redevelopment, representing 3.8 million square feet and $2.1 billion in projected costs. Our budgeted NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 52% pre-leased. We expect the addition of these projects to our in service portfolio to add materially to our company's growth's over the next 3 years. So to conclude, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value in the years ahead. We have a clear and achievable plan to materially grow FFO to the lease up of existing assets the delivery of new buildings or development. We have selected non-core assets for sales to raise capital and ensure continued portfolio refreshment. We have significant entitled and unentitled land holdings that will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet is strong with conservative leverage which we'll allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that present themselves in the coming. So's with that, let me turn it over to Doug."
368278,374803736,1013526,"Boston Properties Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everyone. I won't touch on global interest rate environment and the pending election, Brexit, global political events. And if you take these things altogether, this should elevate uncertainty volatility and they impact capital",2268,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everyone. I won't touch on global interest rate environment and the pending election, Brexit, global political events. And if you take these things altogether, this should elevate uncertainty volatility and they impact capital spending decisions. In our business, a long-term lease up is a major investment and requires a significant capital outlay on the part of the tenant. If you listen to any of the real estate market conditions calls or read the quarterly update that are put up by the leasing brokerage community, I think it's pretty clear that the leasing velocity across many of our markets is feeling this impact. In addition, while the national statistics may show very little general inflation, we can tell you that very tightly labor conditions in the construction industry have pushed up the price of competitive improvement work. So it's easier today to delay all of these commitments and it's cheaper from a capital investment perspective to renew. So let me give you some specifics on our reasons and I'm going to start with San Francisco. During the first quarter, we completed a 128,000 square feet of office leasing at. During the second quarter, we completed over 158,000 square feet of office leasing and as of July 1, we had more than 233,000 square feet of full floor leases under negotiation. These leases average a positive mark-to-market of more than 40% on a gross basis, 70% on a net basis, very consistent with the leasing spreads that we're reporting on a quarterly supplemental. It at the same time, I will tell you that the overall leasing velocity in the San Francisco CBD is well off the level for 2014 and early 2015, there are couple of explanations for this. First, as I described last quarter, the city at the moment is not the experiencing the unprecedented large growth from tech companies, Google and Dropbox and Salesforce.com, Uber, Stripes Black, LinkedIn were so active in 2014 and 2015 with significant expansion. Yet there is still growing tech demand. In the first quarter, Airbnb and Twilio and Comcast and Stripe also down block of about 100,000 square feet and during the second quarter, Lift, Fit Bit, Expedia,  Reddit combined, have lease over 650,000 square feet of space. And today, there are more than a dozen active requirements from technology users looking for 100,000 square feet or more, including a couple that are close to 200,000 square feet. Twitch, Nerd Wallet and are those. Second, and mostly recently, high-quality, well-built sublet space has served as the dominant large block availability. And much of the recent demand has flowed into this quadrant. 3 of the 4 largest yields in the second quarter of over 100,000 square feet went to sublet space. Sublet availability has remained flat with the activity compensating for additional availability. Third, small space sublets are much less active, if you exclude capital raised by Uber and Snapchat during the second quarter. Overall, venture investing is pretty down significantly year-to-year. Early stage investing is down from the prior year and first time, investing is also down. These are the kinds of companies that gets funded and that are putting small spaces on to the market and are also the kind of companies that would be occupants. Finally, financial services and professional services firm continues to be neutral demand generators. At Salesforce tower, we continue to negotiate with the same group of transactions we were working on last quarter, plus a few additions. Most of those discussions involve tenants with late 2017 and 2018 lease expirations. The structure of the building is up to about the 40th floor and we expect to have our first tenants in occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018. We anticipate delivering the first block of space to Salesforce.com in the second quarter of '17 and then, we have 4 future delivery dates that extend out into the fourth quarter of 2018. We will not recognize revenue until the tenants has impleaded their buildup on a fallback for basis. Given the were going to be receiving aspirin. So at this point, we think it's prudent for modeling purposes to assume though NOI in 2017 the startup operating expenses will offset any rents. We have been extremely active quarter in the New York City region while statistically, overall midtown market activity was little bit light, we think it's largely because renewals have been prevalent and they're really not that typically included in this activity as measured by the major brokerage firm. Our total New York regional activity in the second quarter was over 435,000 square feet and it included 320,000 square feet of renewals and expansion at 399 Park Avenue. We have now re-leased 155,000 square feet of our 2017 City Bake office exploration and 49,000 square feet of the 2017 Morgan Lewis exploration. The overall rent up in these spaces was about 2% which is very consistent with my past remarks where I said the 399 was basically a flat building. They included over 110,000 square feet of space at starting rents over $100,000 a square foot. This quarter across the portfolio, our New York City roll up was about 14%. Our repositioning preconstruction activities are underway at 399 and we should be under construction by the fourth quarter. On July 1, 2 full floor high-rise at the General Motors building became available. While we continue to see a consistent and steady flow of leasing volumes between $80 and $125 a square foot, above this is little bit slower. We have been successful leasing smaller suites across our portfolio and are going to take a similar approach to the 2 General Motors. We have shown the space and we have issued proposal to a number of tenants proportions of these floors. The most exciting news of the General Motors building is that the Under Armour has leased 53,000 square feet of the former FAO space. Their plans are being developed as we speak and we expect they will create an incredibly dynamic expense for their brand, the building, and the city when they open. At the moment, we still have a temporary tenant utilizing the space and we anticipate turning the space over to Under Armour sometime in 2018. There are 17,000 square feet remaining and we'll likely become part of the other retailing units at the building. We don't believe it's appropriate to discuss the economics of the lease but our contribution to our $80 million revenue bridge is consistent with our prior projection. We are in deep lease negotiations with more than 55,000 square feet of the space that was sublet to a lease termination last quarter at 250 West 55th. While we expect to have the lease signed in the third quarter, the space is in rock condition and we will not recognize revenue until the tenant has completed its installation which will likely not occur until the end of '17 or early '18. All of our remaining prebuilt suites are under lease negotiations and we may break one of the 2 remaining floors of the top of the building the great additional inventory. At the June meetings, we had a number of comments suggesting that the D.C. CBD office market had turned the corner again. Our view has not changed and we have not seen any demonstrable positive change in the leasing market in D.C. in the CBD. Between '16 and '19, we are tracking only one uncommitted law firm expiration over 100,000 square feet. D.C. is truly a full releasing market for any sizable space. We are currently engaged ourselves with 2 law firms with 2020 expiration of over 100,000 square feet for our availability at that time. The GSA continue to have a very measured approach for their renewals and we're not aware of any requirements with our net demand generators. The market is now hunkering into its election inertia, which contribute to pushing out decisions. In spite of the challenging environment, we did complete 20 office leases totaling 150,000 square feet across the region. D.C. will continue to see new products come on the market even in the form of gut renovation and in some cases, ground-up development such as Capital at Crossing which is currently building 900,000 square feet of speculative product right now. This is likely to govern any significant recovery. As we enter the quarter, our Reston portfolio was 97% leased, leaving us with a smattering of small spaces. We did 6 mobiles this quarter, with starting rent in the mid-50s, our Town Center portfolio continues to outperform the rest of Northern Virginia. The merger of a number of government contractors with large installations in our Reston Town Center assets has created a medium term sublet space in our portfolio. With all the spaces being used, these contractors are looking for cost saving opportunities and this space is the most marketable in their portfolio. With very little direct space, we are eager to work with our tenants on new potential transactions which typically require additional sub-terms. We continue to see the Boston suburban market is having the strongest relevant demand growth across our portfolio. While we only completed 55,000 square feet of leases this quarter, we have more than 400,000 square feet of leases in negotiation from series of life science, technology and even a few financial services organizations. Leasing velocity in the Lexington submarket has accelerated during last few months as a result of this demand and much of it is organic expansion. Last quarter, I mentioned we had over 450,000 square feet of technology and life science company used at Bay Colony. Today, we're negotiating another 100,000 square feet of life science and technology expansions or relocations at that park. It's been widely discussed that the Cambridge market continues to be one of the tightest in the country with availability rates under 5%. Virtually every major pharma company has put down a base in the Cambridge market and coupled with the growth of the biotech industry and the tech titans, they are very strong demand drivers. I will describe the active discussion on the first phase of a new development of North. In addition to our development, MIT has approval for additional 1.3 million square feet of office and lab space. And the RFP for the site has been issued and offers will be view in the coming weeks. The current zoning of the Volpi site are nongovernmental owner allows for 1.17 million square feet of commercial space and 973,000 square feet of residential development. I mentioned a few quarters ago that Microsoft, which leases 134,000 square feet in our 255 Main Street building had chosen to consolidate and might exercise a termination option in its lease. Well, we did in fact receive that notice and the lease will expire on December 31, 2017, allowing us the opportunity to release that space well before the original exploration date. As lease today, the weighted average rental rate on the 216,000 square feet at 255 Main Street is more than $25 a square foot below market. The Boston CBD continues to be a lease expiration driven market with a steady flow of new technology companies entering or expanding, but that's nothing like what's going on in San Francisco. We leased another mid-rise floor at 200 Clarendon. We signed our first LOI for a full floor at 120 St. James. We have a full floor lease under negotiating at 11100 Avenue we're going to get back in 2017 and we're negotiating a 2.5 floor deal for Prudential Tower. 888 Street, our new office building is going to be opening in the third quarter, 71% leased with 2 or 3 floors in occupancy. The retail is going to open in December and the anchor office tenant which is 154,000 square feet is not planning on moving in until the fourth quarter of '17, so we don't anticipate our full run rate until the very end of '17 of that development. The flagship credential retail development is fully leased. We anticipate will be opening of the fourth quarter of '16 in the final retail tenants will be opened by mid-2017. We are off to a great start in Los Angeles as Owen suggested. Colorado Center is a 6 building campus with floor space between 30,000 square feet and 62,000 square feet. It is a large user project and it fits terrifically with our operating platform design. The West LA market has had a string of strong recorded rental rate growth as it benefits from both the creativity and entrepreneurship of local content, creators and providers and it is a growing labor market for a number of the San Francisco-based tech companies that are trying to broaden their workforce reach. In the 4 weeks that we have owned the property, we have signed a letter of intent with 160,000 square feet user and in active discussion with another tenants for 60,000 square feet as well as discussion with existing tenants for expansion. If we complete simply these 2 leases, we will have leased 63% of the available space. We have also hired a set of design professionals and consultants that are assisting us with our future repositioning plan. Let me end my comments with a further update on our revenue bridge. With additional leasing in Embarcadero Center and at the General Motors building, we have now pushed our completed transactions to over $58 million of the $80 million that we anticipated to receive by the end of 2017. And with that, I'll turn the floor over to Mike."
368278,374803736,1013526,"Boston Properties Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning.

I just want to start with a quick summary of where we see the debt markets today. We do have some refinancing opportunities coming up and the debt markets have been open and improving in the face of the recent volatility in the rate market and the uncertainty in the global recovery after Brexit. We have 2 mortgages that are maturing in the next 8 months. 1 is a $350 million mortgage at Embarcadero Center floor. It has a 7% GAAP interest rate that expires on December 1 and the second is a $750 million mortgage on 599 Lexington Avenue with a 5.4 percent GAAP interest rate that expires on March 1, 2017. Both of these loans have an open window and we can pay them off with no penalty this September and refinance it at significantly lower interest expense. We also used $500 million of our cash balances to fund the acquisition of Colorado Center in July, bringing our available cash down to approximately $700 million after quarter end. With $1.3 billion remaining to fund our development pipeline over the next couple of years, we may also look to enhance our liquidity with additional financing. Overall, our balance sheet remains conservatively leveraged and we have substantial capacity to add debt to fund new investments. Our leverage expected improve as we achieved a significant earnings contribution projected from our development as we move into late 2017 and 2018. Additionally, last week, Moody's announced a positive outlook on our unsecured debt ratings. The bond market has performed well through the recent volatility and our credits spreads have tightened, even with the most recent slight run up in long-term rates, we believe that we can borrow for 10 years in the unsecured bond market at around 3%. We also have access to the secured debt markets were comparable borrowing costs are in the low to mid-3% range for high quality properties that have reasonable leverage. You should also recall that we've entered into hedges for an additional amount of $550 million, targeting financing in the second half of 2016 at the 10-year swap rate of 2.42%. So at today's interest rate, we would have to amortize approximately 100 basis points of hedging cost into our interest expense at the first $550 million financing. Although we're evaluating the markets as we always are, we have not assumed any early financing activity in our earnings guidance. 
Turning to our earnings results for the quarter, you could see from her press release that we recorded second quarter FFO of $1.43 per share. That is $0.06 per share or about $10 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The biggest factor and are exceeding our guidance was termination income that was approximately $6 million or $0.04 per share higher than our projection. All of this income was in our guidance for later in 2016, supra percents an acceleration of the timing of income recognition and to the second quarter but has no impact on our full-year projection. The largest peak was related to 100,000 Square foot space at 399 park are the new that had an edge release exploration in late 2017. We were able to sign a replacement lease for this space with the client seeking to occupy earlier and this in conjunction with the other lease that Doug mentioned represents 200,000 square feet of forward leasing which is a great start in covering our late 2017 exposure at 399 Park. The performance of our portfolio drove approximately $4 million or $0.02 per share of the outperformance this quarter. Revenue was slightly ahead of expectations while expenses, primarily utility and repair maintenance expense, were lower by about $3 million. Over $2 million of the expense reduction is related to R&M projects that have been reforecast into the back half of the year. So this portion will not flow through to our full-year guidance. As an property performance moderated this quarter but it was still strong with our share of combined cash and the why of 4.7% at combined GAAP and a why of 0.7% from the same quarter last year, the most significant impact affecting this quarter was 140,000 Square feet of space at 601 Lexington Avenue has expired midway through the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate our same property NOI growth to continue to moderate for the rest of 2016. We will have downtime between leases for the 80,000 square feet of high-rise space at 750 75th Avenue that Doug talk about. We also have 160,000 square feet expiring this quarter at 191 Spring street which is in suburban Boston from a client who relocated and expanded at 10 CityPoint. We're working on up proposal for the majority of the space but there will likely be 12 to 18 months of downtime between leases. On the positive side, we are and expecting to continue to exceed growth from lease up and roll up of rents at Embarcadero Center, Prudential Center and 200 Clarendon Street. Overall, the leasing activity that we see is in line with expectation and we assume our share of same property combined in a way in 2016 will be up between 0.25% and 1.75% on a GAAP basis and between 2% and 4% on a cash basis over 2015. In our non-same property portfolio, we acquired Colorado Center this quarter and it is projected to add approximately $0.05 per share to our 2016 FFO. Based upon in tradition we're increasing our guidance for the incremental contribution from the non-same property portfolio to $46 million to $52 million over 2015. Colorado Center also has an impact on our noncash rents as there are several leases that are in free rent periods for the remainder of 2016. We received a credit from the seller equal to the amount of 3 rent but the accounting rules require this to be reflected as  a reduction in the purchase price as opposed to rental income which is was part of the reason why the net purchase price came down to $504 million. We now project our noncash rents in 2016 to be $52 million to $65 million. As you think about the change in our full-year guidance, remember that we had included within our prior guidance of virtually all of the second quarter earnings Pete. We just expected it to occur later in the year. So the impact of the remaining changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operation to $5.92 to $5.99 per share. This is an increase of $0.06 per share at the midpoint, consisting of $0.05 per share from the acquisition of Colorado Center and $0.01 per share of better projected portfolio performance. I just want to close by adding some comments about 2017, although we will not be providing formal guidance until next quarter. First, just a reminder, that in 2016, we recorded $57 million in termination income which is much higher than typical and is primarily due to the large termination at 250 West 55th Street last quarter. This represents $0.34 per share of 2016 earnings that we do not expect to recur at the same level in 2017. Second is the described in a development pipeline, more than half of the leasing at 88 was the Street and all the producing at Salesforce Tower will not commence revenue at late '17 and late '18. The space is leased and the revenue equipment is in line with our previous projection that we outlined in our investor presentation as recently as June that show the projected quarterly development run rate accelerating as we move into 2018. Also, we've captured a good portion of the $80 million in NOI growth of that we've been projecting and we will see the impact in our revenues, particularly at the Prudential Center and Embarcadero Center next year. As Doug described, the majority of the projected revenue from the lease up of other properties such as 767 5th Avenue, 601 Lex, 200 Clarendon Street and 120 St James will likely hit by 2018. That completes all of our formal remarks. Operator, if you can open up the line for questions, that would be great. Thanks."

As you think about your stated strategy and one of the components is to being astute investors and looking at market timing for investment decisions by acquiring properties in times of opportunities, I take it you sort of you Colorado Center as part of L.A. but I'm curious to know what's going on in U.K. certainly, what's going on in Canada, you go to Toronto and London in the past. The currency is certainly, a lot more stronger today and 1 could argue that those are the opportune times to get to the market. So how should investors -- how should we think about -- how are you thinking about it today and maybe that is something that could be on the table?"

We obviously made a significant move on that piece of the strategy last quarter and also, London has been on our list. And our view of London is that it will continue to be a great world city and will be an interesting market for real estate investment and development. So that hasn't changed. However, in the short-term and medium-term, given the Brexit vote, there are more uncertainties about economic growth and space demand. We don't know the impacts on trade policy, what that's going to do to GDP growth. We don't know the impacts on for financial institution. What impact that will have on jobs in London. And so as we think about London, there's already been a 10% drop in the pound, which is helpful as a dollar investor but we also think pricing for assets should also change, given these uncertainties that I described. So we're still looking, we're still active but we're conscious of this additional and we would expect us to be reflected in pricing.

So most of the investment that we've been making is -- has been in ground up development as you know. I described 3 projects that we delivered this quarter at 7.8% cash yield for a brand-new asset again in our core markets which we think is very value creative. So when looking at everything that's offered in West L.A. We're looking at development opportunities though not as many given restrictions that are on development in West L.A. which is one of the attraction, honestly of the market, so we're looking at that and I think would also certainly, be more interested in assets like Colorado Center that are very high-quality but they had something that needs to be done. So when we bought Colorado Center, it was 68% leased and there was an upside opportunity in our minds from leasing it up which I think as Doug described, we're very much on track in doing. So, yes, we could go out and pay, purchase the pipeline of assets that continue to be offered in the marketplace but we want to be selective about getting high-quality asset, getting an asset that is positioned for our type of tenants which are generally larger and also we would prefer an acquisition where there's something that we can do to add value as a property company."

We will have a couple of tenants at 888 that will take occupancy later this year, that have a benefit to the company. Also interest expense, we talked about the fact that we don't have any early refinancing in our guidance but we do have the Embarcadero Center and it's a 70% loan, so there's an assumption on our guidance, so there's going to be much lower interest expense when we refinance that in the fourth quarter. The other thing I would mention would be operating expenses which are cyclically highest in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter, primarily due to utilities where the HVAC is obviously expensive in the hotter times of the year that we're sitting in right now, actually. So there's a kind of the most of the drivers and there's some positive that we talked about in terms of leasing activity later in the year that we're driving later in the year, things like continued activity at Embarcadero Center were we got renewals that we're working on and trying to sign kind of a blended extension or get some GAAP lift later in the year. So those kind of things."

A good chunk of, I would say, half of the Embarcadero Center stuff will be late this year and next year. And the Prudential Center stuff would be in next year, but not this year and then, there's some big pieces that I think will be later. We're going to get the lease up at 200 Clarendon Street and perhaps a floor at 120 St. James that will hit sometime in 2017, so the majority of that is I see as being later because most of that space is we have to wait until the tenant occupies to recognize revenue on that space and we talk about Under Armour and the timing of that. And then, 100 Federal Street which is another big piece and the lease is fully signed but right now we're relocating another tenant to create the floors. We're not going to be able to deliver those floors until sometime in the middle of '17. So some of that will be on '17 and then into '18. So I didn't give you the numbers but that's hopefully helpful with some guidance on the timing."

As usual, I'll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions as we see them, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another strong quarter with FFO per share $0.04 above consensus, primarily due to accelerated lease termination income. We've also increased the mid-point of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.06. In the quarter, we leased 925,000 square feet, nearly half of that in the New York region and this quarterly volume is above historical averages by number of leases but below on total square feet. Our portfolio occupancy is now 90.8%, down 20 basis points from the end of the first quarter. We had another quarter of strong rent roll-ups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the second quarter up 18% on a gross basis and 28% on a net basis compared to prior lease. As we anticipate, our leasing spreads continue to be strongest in San Francisco and Boston and positive in all regions. 
Now moving to the economy. U.S. economic growth continues to be sluggish and slowing. First quarter GDP has been reported at 1.1%, down from 1.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. And estimates for all of 2016 are approximately 2% after downward revision. The employment picture is -- been recently healthy with 287,000 jobs created in June, but has been volatile throughout 2016. Also, the unemployment rate has been relatively flat at 4.9%. Now economically the most significant news for the quarter was the U.K. surprise referendum outcome to leave the European Union. We've also had a series of tragic terrorist events and an attempted coup in Turkey. There's already evidence of a slowdown in the U.K. economy and the IMF predicts the global GDP will follow. Sterling has dropped over 10% and central banks in Europe and the U.K. are all signaling an accommodated posture. 
Given dollar strength and slowing growth, we believe that it will be more difficult for the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase rates further in the near term. The 10-year U.S. treasury has dropped 30 basis points to 1.6% over the quarter as a result. Lower rates have fueled record highs for the S&P 500 and a surge in REIT share prices in the U.S. Given the growth in the U.S. economy, albeit anemic, office markets nationally continue to improve slowly. Net absorption was 8.4 million square feet for the second quarter. Vacancy improved 10 basis points to 13.8%, asking rents rose 6.5% year-over-year. Construction levels are up 5% year-over-year, but remain at 2.2% of total stock, which is slightly above long-term averages. We continue to see the strongest space demand in innovation centers. So how are we managing our business given this environment of sluggish growth, punctuated by increasingly frequent economic and political events and an uncertain presidential election in November? 
First, we will continue to take advantage of reasonably healthy tenant demand and lease up our existing vacancy and new developments. Second, we'll focus our new investment activity around innovation centers where we see the strongest prospects for growth. And lastly, we will also protect the downside given the prospect of volatility by requiring preleasing for new office development, avoiding the purchase of stabilized assets at low cap rates and keeping our overall corporate leverage at conservative levels. 
Moving to private market real estate valuation. We believe prices remain strong for prime assets and gateway markets. As evidence, we've seen a number of transactions, in addition to what I've discussed last quarter in our core markets that were recently committed in 2016. In Cambridge, 1 Kendall Square, which is a 645,000 square foot office lab and retail asset sold for $1,124 a square foot and a low 4s initial cap rate. Though the sale did include a 173,000 square-foot development site, the buyer was a U.S. REIT with a capital partner. In New York, a partial interest in 7 West 34th Street, which is a 477,000 square foot office building fully let to Amazon was sold for $1,176 a square foot at a low to mid-4s cap rate to an Asian investor. In San Francisco, the piers on the Embarcadero waterfront, albeit a small 82,000 square-foot building sold for a low 4s cap rate and $1,250 a square foot, which is a record for San Francisco. And this was sold to a U.S. pension adviser. And in L.A., 12100 Wilshire and 11601 Wilshire sold in separate transactions to U.S. REIT, possibly with non-U.S. capital partners at a mid-3s cap rates and approximately $625 a square foot. As cap rates spread widen with increasing interest rates and risk the European investment are exacerbated by Brexit and other geopolitical events, we continue to see a tailwind for U.S. real estate valuations, particularly on our core markets. 
Our capital strategy remains unchanged and that we are investing primarily in new developments and redevelopments, funded partially by select asset dispositions and the balance with debt financing. So let me start with acquisitions. This quarter, we closed the purchase of a 50% interest in Colorado Center located in Santa Monica, California, and that closed on July 1. Colorado Center comprises 1.2 million square feet on a 15-acre site and is one of the premier office campuses in West Los Angeles. Though the complex is very well parked with 3,100 stalls located 1 block from Bergamot Station on the newly opened commuter rail line between downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica. 
Moving to economics, the property is 68% leased, which provides us with a significant upside opportunity. Our net purchase price is $504 million or $850 a square foot. And renovation and tenant capital will be required to lease a property. So the going in NOI cap rate is 3.4%. Upon full lease-up of the complex, we expect to achieve yields of approximately 5.5% and over 6% after a full mark-to-market of the tenant base. Teachers owns the other 50% of Colorado Center, and we will provide all leasing property and construction management for the asset. We also look forward to advancing our relationship with teachers as part of this investment. In addition to the financial aspects of transaction, Colorado Center has provided Boston Properties with the opportunity to enter the West Los Angeles market with a significant asset. We view West L.A. as an important innovation center and currently one of the most vibrant office markets in the United States. Our intent is to methodically over time, build up Los Angeles into a full independent region for our company. We hired the on-site property management staff, and Ray Ritchey is providing senior level direction to our Colorado Center in Los Angeles efforts. Property management oversight, construction development and other support are all being provided from our San Francisco office. As the Los Angeles region grows, we anticipate a migration to local personnel, both hired externally and internally transferred. 
Lastly, I'm also pleased to report we are off to a very strong start in the leasing program for Colorado Center, and Doug's going to provide more details on this. Now on dispositions. We're in the market with VA95, our 11-building 740,000 square-foot suburban office campus located in Springfield, Virginia. This park may be sold in whole or part. We're pursuing a recapitalization of Metropolitan Square, a 660,000 square-foot office building located in the CBD of Washington, D.C. Given these transactions and our completed sale of 7 Kendall Center, we could reach as much as $350 million in 2016 asset sales. 
Moving to development. We remain active delivering assets into service, advancing our predevelopment pipeline and evaluating new investments. In terms of potential starts for 2016, we're competing for a 630,000 square foot office build to suit for the TSA in Springfield, Virginia. We're also commencing the full rehabilitation of the low-rise building at 601 Lexington Avenue. The building is being renamed 159 East 53rd Street and will have a segregated street entrance and lobby for 195,000 square foot office building. We remain very active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several important updates from the second quarter include: At Kendall Center in Cambridge, we're in advanced discussions with an office user to fully prelease a 400,000 plus square foot office building, which will require demolition of an existing 80,000 square foot low-rise building. This project would not commence until 2017, and efforts continue on developing commitments and projects for the remaining approximately 500,000 square feet of potential entitlements at Kendall Center. 
It has been reported that Boston Properties and a local developer attempting to entitle MacArthur Station Residences, which is a 402 unit, 25 storey residential development located adjacent to the MacArthur BART Station in the Temescal neighborhood of Oakland, California. We signed a letter of intent to invest in the project and are working on the entitlement process. Given the high cost of multifamily products in the San Francisco market, we believe we can deliver high-quality units at approximately a 20% discount to San Francisco rents in a location that is a 16-minute transit ride from the Embarcadero BART station in downtown San Francisco. The project will not commence until 2017, also subject to achieving entitlement. This past quarter, we also delivered 3 projects fully into service including 601 Mass. Avenue in Washington, 10 CityPoint in Waltham and 804 Carnegie Center in Princeton. In the aggregate, these buildings comprise 850,000 square feet or 94% leased, costs $487 million to build and are being delivered at a 7.8% NOI return on cost, which is above our projection. Given the value of the property is at a much lower cap rate, delivery of these projects again demonstrates the value-creation power of our development platform. Now given the deliveries, at the end of the second quarter, our development pipeline now consists of 8 new projects and 1 redevelopment, representing 3.8 million square feet and $2.1 billion in projected costs. 
Our budgeted NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7%, and the commercial component of the pipeline is 52% preleased. We expect the addition of these projects to our in-service portfolio to add materially to our company's growth's over the next 3 years. 
So to conclude, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value in the years ahead. We have a clear and achievable plan to materially grow FFO to the lease-up of existing assets and the delivery of new buildings through development. We have selected noncore assets for sales to raise capital and ensure continued portfolio refreshment. We have significant entitled and unentitled land holdings that will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet is strong with conservative leverage which we'll allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that present themselves in coming quarters. So with that, let me turn it over to Doug."

Owen touched on the global interest rate environment and the pending election, Brexit, global political events. And if you take these things all together, these issues elevate uncertainty and volatility. And they impact capital spending decisions. 
In our business, a long-term lease-up is a major investment and requires a significant capital outlay on the part of the tenant. If you've listened to any of the real estate market conditions calls or read the quarterly updates that are put out by the leasing brokerage community, I think it's pretty clear that the leasing velocity across many of our markets is feeling this impact. In addition, while the national statistics may show very little general inflation, we can tell you that very tight labor conditions in the construction industry have pushed up the price of tenant improvement work. So it's easier today to delay all these commitments, and it's cheaper from a capital investment perspective to renew. 
So let me give you some specifics on our reasons, and I'm going to start with San Francisco. During the first quarter, we completed a 128,000 square feet of office leasing at EC. During the second quarter, we completed over 158,000 square feet of office leasing. And as of July 1, we had more than 233,000 square feet of full floor leases under negotiation. These leases average a positive mark-to-market of more than 40% on a gross basis, 70% on a net basis, very consistent with the leasing spreads that were reported in our quarterly supplemental. Yet at the same time, I will tell you that the overall leasing velocity in the San Francisco CBD is well off the levels of 2014 and early 2015. And there are a couple of explanations for this. First, as I described last quarter, the city at the moment is not experiencing the unprecedented large growth from tech companies, Google and Dropbox and Salesforce.com, Uber, Stripes, Black, LinkedIn were so active in 2014 and 2015 with significant expansion. Yet there is still growing tech demand. In the first quarter, Airbnb and Twilio and Quantcast and Stripe all took down blocks of about 100,000 square feet each. And during the second quarter, Lift, Fitbit, Travana, Expedia, Reddit combined, have leased over 650,000 square feet of space. And today, there are more than a dozen active requirements from technology users looking for 100,000 square feet or more, including a couple that are close to 200,000 square feet. Twitch, NerdWallet and Meraki are those. 
Second and mostly recently, high quality, well-built sublet space has served as the dominant large block availability. And much of the recent demand has flowed into this quadrant. 3 of the 4 largest yields in the second quarter of over 100,000 square feet went to sublet space. Sublet availability has remained flat with the activity compensating for additional availability. Third, small space sublets are much less active, if you exclude capital raised by Uber and Snapchat during the second quarter. Overall, venture investing is pretty down significantly year-to-year. Even early stage investing is down from the prior year. And first time, investing is also down. These are the kinds of companies that gets funded and that are putting small spaces on to the market and are also the kind of companies that would be occupants. 
Finally, financial services and professional services firm continued at best to be neutral-demand generators. At Salesforce tower, we continue to negotiate with the same group of transactions we were working on last quarter, plus a few additions. Most of those discussions involve tenants with late 2017 and 2018 lease expirations. The structure of the building is up to about the 40th floor. And we expect to have our first tenants in occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018. We anticipate delivering the first block of space to Salesforce.com in the second quarter of '17. And then we have 4 future delivery dates that extend out into the fourth quarter of 2018. We will not recognize revenue until the tenant has completed their build-out on a floor-by-floor basis, even though we're going to be receiving cash rent 
So at this point, we think it's prudent for modeling purposes to assume no NOI in 2017 has startup operating expenses will offset any revenue. We had an extremely active quarter in the New York City region. While statistically, overall midtown market activity was a little bit light, we think it's largely because renewals have been prevalent and they're really not typically included in the leasing activity as measured by the major brokerage firm. Our total New York regional activity in the second quarter was over 435,000 square feet and it included 320,000 square feet of renewals and expansions at 399 Park Avenue. We have now released 155,000 square feet of the 2017 Citibank office expirations and 49,000 square feet of the 2017 Morgan Lewis exploration. The overall rent-up in these spaces was about 2%, which is very consistent with my past remarks where I said the 399 was basically a flat building. They included over 110,000 square feet of space at starting rents over $100 a square foot. This quarter across the portfolio, our New York City roll-up was about 14%. Our repositioning preconstruction activities are underway at 399 and we should be under construction by the fourth quarter. 
On July 1, 2 full floor high-rise floors at the General Motors building became available. While we continue to see a consistent and steady flow of leasing volumes that's between $80 and $125 a square foot, the velocity above this is a little bit slower. We have been successful leasing smaller suites across our portfolio and are going to take a similar approach to the 2 General Motors floors. We have shown the space. And we have issued proposal to a number of tenants, proportions of these floors. 
The most exciting news at the General Motors building is that the Under Armour has leased 53,000 square feet of the former FAO space. Their plans are being developed as we speak, and we expect they will create an incredibly dynamic experience for their brand, the building, and the city when they open. At the moment, we still have a temporary tenant utilizing the space, and we anticipate turning the space over to Under Armour some time in 2018. There are 17,000 square feet remaining, and we'll likely become part of one of the other retailing units at the building. We don't believe it's appropriate to discuss the economics of the lease, but our contribution to our $80 million revenue bridge is consistent with our prior projection. We are in deep lease negotiations with more than 55,000 square feet of the space that was subject to our lease termination last quarter at 250 West 55th. While we expect to have the lease signed in the third quarter, the space is in rock condition, and we will not recognize revenue until the tenant has completed its installation, which will likely not occur until the end of '17 or early '18. All of our remaining prebuilt suites are under lease negotiations and we may break one of the 2 remaining floors of the top of the building to create additional inventory. 
At the June NAREIT meetings, we've got a number of comments suggesting that the D.C. CBD office market had turned the corner again. Our view has not changed, and we have not seen any demonstrable positive change in the leasing market in D.C. in the CBD. Between '16 and '19, we are tracking only 1 uncommitted law firm expiration over 100,000 square feet. D.C. is truly a full releasing market for any sizable space. We are currently engaged ourselves with 2 law firms with 2020 expiration of over 100,000 square feet for our availability at that time. The GSA continued to have a very measured approach to their renewals, and we're not aware of any requirements with our net demand generators. The market is now hunkering into its election inertia, which contribute to pushing out decisions. In spite of the challenging environment, we did complete 20 office leases totaling 150,000 square feet across the region. D.C. will continue to see new products come on the market even in the form of gut renovation, and in some cases, ground-up development, such as Capital Crossing, which is currently building 900,000 square feet of speculative product right now. This is likely to govern any significant recovery. As we enter the quarter, our Reston portfolio was 97% leased, leaving us with a smattering of small spaces. We did 6 small deals this quarter, with starting rent in the mid-50s. Our Town Center portfolio continues to outperform the rest of Northern Virginia. The merger of a number of government contractors with large installations in our Reston Town Center assets has created a medium-term sublet space in our portfolio. With all the spaces being used, these contractors are looking for cost-saving opportunities. And this space is their most marketable in their portfolio. With very little direct space, we are eager to work with our tenants on new potential transactions, which typically require additional sub-terms. 
We continue to see the Boston suburban market as having the strongest relevant demand growth across our portfolio. While we only completed 55,000 square feet of leases this quarter, we have more than 400,000 square feet of leases in negotiation from series of life science, technology and even a few financial services organizations. Leasing velocity in the Waltham-Lexington submarket has accelerated during the last few months as a result of this demand and much of it is organic expansion. 
Last quarter, I mentioned we had over 450,000 square feet of technology and life science company used at Bay Colony. Today, we're negotiating another 100,000 square feet of life science and technology expansions or relocations at that park. It's been widely discussed that the Cambridge market continues to be one of the tightest in the country with availability rates under 5%. Virtually every major pharma company has put down a base in the Cambridge market. And coupled with the growth of the biotech industry and the tech titans, they are very strong demand drivers. 
I want to describe the active lease discussion on the first phase of our new development on the north parcel. In addition to our development, MIT has approvals for an additional 1.3 million square feet of office and lab space. And the RFP for the Volpe site has been issued, and offers will be due in the coming weeks. The current zoning of the Volpe site for a nongovernmental owner allows for 1.17 million square feet of commercial space and 970,000 square feet of residential development. I mentioned a few quarters ago that Microsoft, which leases 124,000 square feet in our 255 Main Street building had chosen to consolidate and might exercise a termination option in its lease. Well, we did in fact receive that notice, and the lease will expire on December 31, 2017, allowing us the opportunity to release that space well before the original expiration date. 
As leased today, the weighted average rental rate on the 216,000 square feet at 255 Main Street is more than $25 a square foot below market. The Boston CBD continues to be a lease expiration driven market with a steady flow of new technology companies entering or expanding, but that's nothing like what's going on in San Francisco. We leased another mid-rise floor at 200 Clarendon. We signed our first LOI for a full floor at 120 St. James. We have a full floor lease under negotiation at 111 Huntington Avenue. On a floor, we're going to get back in 2017. And we're negotiating a 2.5 floor deal for Prudential Tower. 
888 Wilson Street, our new office building is going to be opening in the third quarter, 71% leased with 2 or 3 floors in occupancy. The retail is going to open in December, and the anchor office tenant which is 154,000 square feet is not planning on moving in until the fourth quarter of '17, so we don't anticipate our full run rate until the very end of '17 on that development. The flagship Prudential retail redevelopment is fully leased. We anticipate Eataly will be opening in the fourth quarter of '16, and the final retail tenants will be opened by mid-2017. We are off to a great start in Los Angeles, as Owen suggested. 
Colorado Center is a 6 building campus with floor space between 30,000 square feet and 62,000 square feet. It is a large user project, and it fits terrifically with our operating platform design. The West L.A. market has had a string of strong quarters of rental rate growth as it benefits from both the creativity and entrepreneurship of local content, creators and providers. And it is a growing labor market for a number of the San Francisco-based tech companies that are trying to broaden their workforce reach. In the 4 weeks that we have owned the property, we have signed a letter of intent with 160,000 square feet user and are in active discussion with another tenant for 60,000 square feet as well as discussiona with existing tenants for expansion. If we complete simply these 2 leases, we will have leased 63% of the available space. We have also hired a set of design professionals and consultants that are assisting us with our future repositioning plan. 
Let me end my comments with a further update on our revenue bridge. With the additional leasing at Embarcadero Center and at the General Motors building, we have now pushed our completed transactions to over $58 million of the $80 million that we anticipated to receive by the end of 2017. And with that, I'll turn the floor over to Mike."
368278,374803736,1013992,"Boston Properties Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I just want to start with a quick summary of where we see the debt markets today.

I just want to start with a quick summary of where we see the debt markets today. We do have some refinancing opportunities coming up, and the debt markets have been opened and improving in the face of the recent volatility in the rate market and the uncertainty in the global recovery after Brexit. We have 2 mortgages that are maturing in the next 8 months. 1 is a $350 million mortgage at Embarcadero Center floor. It has a 7% GAAP interest rate that expires on December 1 and the second is a $750 million mortgage on 599 Lexington Avenue with a 5.4% GAAP interest rate that expires on March 1, 2017. Both of these loans have an open window, and we can pay them off with no penalty commencing this September and refinance it significantly lower interest expense. We also used $500 million of our cash balances to fund the acquisition of Colorado Center in July, bringing our available cash down to approximately $700 million after quarter end. With $1.3 billion remaining to fund our development pipeline over the next couple of years, we may also look to enhance our liquidity with additional financing. 
Overall, our balance sheet remains conservatively leveraged, and we have substantial capacity to add debt to fund new investments. Our leverage is expected to improve as we achieved the significant earnings contribution projected from our developments as we move into late 2017 and 2018. 
Additionally, last week, Moody's announced a positive outlook on our unsecured debt ratings. The bond market has performed well through the recent volatility and our credit spreads have tightened. Even with the most recent slight run up in long-term rates, we believe that we can borrow for 10 years in the unsecured bond market at around 3%. We also have access to the secured debt markets where comparable borrowing costs are in the low to mid-3% range for high-quality properties that have reasonable leverage. You should also recall that we've entered into hedges for a notional amount of $550 million, targeting financing in the second half of 2016 at a 10-year swap rate of 2.42%. So at today's interest rate, we would have to amortize approximately 100 basis points of hedging cost into our interest expense on the first $550 million financing. Although we're evaluating the markets as we always are, we have not assumed any early financing activity in our earnings guidance. 
Turning to our earnings results for the quarter, you could see from our press release that we recorded second quarter FFO of $1.43 per share. That is $0.06 per share or about $10 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The biggest factor and are exceeding our guidance was termination income that was approximately $6 million or $0.04 per share higher than our projection. All of this income was in our guidance for later in 2016. So it represents an acceleration of the timing of income recognition into the second quarter that has no impact on our full year projection. 
The largest peaks was related to 100,000 square foot space at 399 Park Avenue that had a natural lease expiration in late 2017. We were able to sign a replacement lease for this space with the client seeking to occupy earlier. And this, in conjunction with the other lease that Doug mentioned, represents 200,000 square feet of forward leasing, which is a great start in covering our late 2017 exposure at 399 Park. The performance of our portfolio drove approximately $4 million or $0.02 per share of the outperformance this quarter. Revenue was slightly ahead of expectations, while expenses, primarily utility and repair maintenance expense were lower by about $3 million. Over $2 million of the expense reduction is related to R&M projects that have been reforecast into the back half of the year. So this portion will not flow through to our full year guidance. 
Our same property performance moderated this quarter, but it was still strong with our share of combined cash NOI of 4.7% and combined GAAP NOI of 0.7% from the second quarter last year. The most significant impact affecting this quarter was 140,000 square feet of space at 601 Lexington Avenue that expired midway through the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate our same property NOI growth to continue to moderate for the rest of 2016. We will have downtime between leases for the 80,000 square feet of high-rise space at 767 Fifth Avenue that Doug talked about. We also have 160,000 square feet expiring this quarter at 191 Spring Street which is in suburban Boston from a client who relocated and expanded at 10 CityPoint. We're working on up proposal for the majority of the space, but there will likely be 12 to 18 months of downtime between leases. On the positive side, we are and expect to continue to see growth from lease-up and roll-up of rents at Embarcadero Center, Prudential Center and 200 Clarendon Street. 
Overall, the leasing activity we are seeing is in line with our expectations, and we assume our share of same property combined NOI and 2016 will be up between 0.25% and 1.75% on a GAAP basis; and between 2% and 4% on a cash basis over 2016. In our nonsame property portfolio, we acquired Colorado Center this quarter and it is projected to add approximately $0.05 per share to our 2016 FFO. Based upon in tradition we're increasing our guidance for the incremental contribution from the nonsame property portfolio to $46 million to $52 million over 2015. Colorado Center also has an impact on our noncash rents as there are several leases that are in free rent periods for the remainder of 2016. We received a credit from the seller equal to the amount of 3 rents, but the accounting rules require this to be reflected as a reduction in the purchase price as opposed to rental income, which is part of the reason why the net purchase price came down to $504 million. We now project our noncash rents in 2016 to be $52 million to $65 million. 
As you think about the change in our full year guidance, remember that we had included within our prior guidance virtually all of the second quarter earnings peak. We just expected it to occur later in the year. So the impact of the remaining changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operation to $5.92 to $5.99 per share. This is an increase of $0.06 per share at the midpoint, consisting of $0.05 per share from the acquisition of Colorado Center and $0.01 per share of better projected portfolio performance. 
I just want to close by adding some comments about 2017, although we will not be providing formal guidance until next quarter. First, just a reminder, that in 2016, we recorded $57 million in termination income which is much higher than typical and is primarily due to the large termination at 250 West 55th Street last quarter. This represents $0.34 per share of 2016 earnings that we do not expect to recur at the same level in 2017. Second is Doug described in our development pipeline, more than half of the leasing at 888 Boylson Street and all of the preleasing at Salesforce Tower will not commence GAAP revenue until late in '17 and early -- and ends in 2018. The space is leased and the revenue commencement is in line with our previous projection that we outlined in our investor presentation as recently as June that show the projected quarterly development run rate accelerating as we move into 2018. Also, we've captured a good portion of the $80 million in NOI growth that we've been projecting. And we will see the impact in our revenues, particularly at the Prudential Center and Embarcadero Center next year. As Doug described, the majority of the projected revenue from the lease-up of other properties, such as 767 Fifth Avenue, 601 Lex, 200 Clarendon Street and 120 St. James will likely hit by 2018. 
That completes all of our formal remarks. Operator, if you could open up the lines for questions, that would be great. Thanks."

Question, Owen or Doug. As you think about your stated strategy, and one of the components is to, of being astute investors and looking at market timing for investment decisions by acquiring properties in times of opportunity, I take it you sort of view Colorado Center as part of the L.A. But I'm curious if you think about what's going on in the U.K., sorting what's going on up in Canada, you put the Toronto and London in the past. The U.S. currency is certainly a lot more stronger today and one could argue that those would be opportune times to get into the market. So how should investors -- how should we think about -- your -- how you're thinking about it today and whether that could be something else on the table?"

And our view of London is that it will continue to be a great world city and will be an interesting market for real estate investment and development, so that hasn't changed. However, in the short term and medium term, given the Brexit vote, there are more uncertainties about economic growth and space demand. We don't know the impacts on trade policy, what that's going to do to the GDP growth. We don't know the impacts on passporting for financial institutions, what impact that will have on jobs in London. And so as we think about London, there's already been a 10% drop in the pound, which is helpful as a dollar investor, but we also think pricing for assets should also change, given these uncertainties that I described. So we're still looking, we're still active, but we're conscious of these additional drifts and would expect those to be reflected in pricing. And then, lastly, we're not particularly active looking at Toronto."

The question is the timing of when some of those spaces get filled and when the revenue recognition associated with those spaces are, and whether that is in '17 or pushing into '18. So I just -- it's a little bit of a timing game, but these are all really, really high-quality spaces. And I think we're proving that we're getting all the roll ups through the leasing that we're doing.

He's actually there right now, which is why he's not on this call, and he's been very proactive about meeting every tenant that we've made a proposal to, which I think is a different approach than the current -- the former ownership had with regards to leasing.

Where is the tenant coming from? Are existing portfolio from outside? But there's no question as we evaluate new developments, and we have a lot to evaluate even in our own company because of the large land holdings that we have. Preleasing is an absolute requirement, and our desire to have it be larger in the portfolio is there. So that is definitely happening. However, I think we still see projects, and I've described a couple of them, particularly there are several of the projects that we're looking at right now are actually 100% preleased. And those are the kinds of projects that we want to be doing and will create value for shareholders, even if we are layer in the economic cycle. As it relates to Dock72 leasing, I -- we're just too far away from delivery to expect much significant preletting.

The other thing I would mention would be operating expenses, which are cyclically highest in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter, primarily due to utilities where the HVAC is obviously a little more expensive in the hotter times of the year that we're sitting in right now, actually. So those are kind of most of the drivers. And there's some positives that we talked about in terms of leasing activity later in the year that we're guiding later in the year, things like continued activity at Embarcadero Center where we got renewals that we're working on that we're trying to sign that will have kind of a blend and extend where we'll get some GAAP lift later in the year.

But the majority of that, I see, as being later because that is -- most of that space is, we have to wait until the tenant occupies to recognize revenue on that space. And then we've talked about Under Armour and the timing of that. And then, 100 Federal Street, which is another big piece of it, the lease is fully signed.

As usual, I'll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions as we see them, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another strong quarter with FFO per share $0.04 above consensus, primarily due to accelerated lease termination income. We've also increased the mid-point of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.06. In the quarter, we leased 925,000 square feet, nearly half of that in the New York region and this quarterly volume is above historical averages by number of leases but below on total square feet. Our portfolio occupancy is now 90.8%, down 20 basis points from the end of the first quarter. We had another quarter of strong rent roll-ups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the second quarter up 18% on a gross basis and 28% on a net basis compared to prior lease. As we anticipated, our leasing spreads continue to be strongest in San Francisco and Boston and positive in all regions. 
Now moving to the economy. U.S. economic growth continues to be sluggish and slowing. First quarter GDP has been reported at 1.1%, down from 1.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. And estimates for all of 2016 are approximately 2% after downward revision. The employment picture is -- been recently healthy with 287,000 jobs created in June, but has been volatile throughout 2016. Also, the unemployment rate has been relatively flat at 4.9%. Now economically the most significant news for the quarter was the U.K. surprise referendum outcome to leave the European Union. We've also had a series of tragic terrorist events and an attempted coup in Turkey. There's already evidence of a slowdown in the U.K. economy and the IMF predicts the global GDP will follow. Sterling has dropped over 10% and central banks in Europe and the U.K. are all signaling an accommodated posture. 
Given dollar strength and slowing growth, we believe that it will be more difficult for the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase rates further in the near term. The 10-year U.S. treasury has dropped 30 basis points to 1.6% over the quarter as a result. Lower rates have fueled record highs for the S&P 500 and a surge in REIT share prices in the U.S. Given the growth in the U.S. economy, albeit anemic, office markets nationally continue to improve slowly. Net absorption was 8.4 million square feet for the second quarter. Vacancy improved 10 basis points to 13.8%, asking rents rose 6.5% year-over-year. Construction levels are up 5% year-over-year, but remain at 2.2% of total stock, which is slightly above long-term averages. We continue to see the strongest space demand in innovation centers. So how are we managing our business given this environment of sluggish growth, punctuated by increasingly frequent economic and political events and an uncertain presidential election in November? 
First, we will continue to take advantage of reasonably healthy tenant demand and lease up our existing vacancy in new developments. Second, we'll focus our new investment activity around innovation centers where we see the strongest prospects for growth. And lastly, we will also protect the downside given the prospect of volatility by requiring preleasing for new office development, avoiding the purchase of stabilized assets of low cap rates and keeping our overall corporate leverage at conservative levels. 
Moving to private market real estate valuation. We believe prices remain strong for prime assets and gateway markets. As evidence, we've seen a number of transactions, in addition to what I've discussed last quarter in our core markets that were recently committed in 2016. In Cambridge, 1 Kendall Square, which is a 645,000 square foot office lab and retail asset sold for $1,124 a square foot and a low 4s initial cap rate. Though the sale did include a 173,000 square-foot development site, the buyer was a U.S. REIT with a capital partner. In New York, a partial interest in 7 West 34th Street, which is a 477,000 square foot office building fully let to Amazon was sold for $1,176 a square foot at a low to mid-4s cap rate to an Asian investor. In San Francisco, the piers on the Embarcadero waterfront, albeit a small 82,000 square-foot building sold for a low 4s cap rate and $1,250 a square foot, which is a record for San Francisco. And this was sold to a U.S. pension adviser. And in L.A., 12100 Wilshire and 11601 Wilshire sold in separate transactions to U.S. REITs, possibly with non-U.S. capital partners at a mid-3s cap rates and approximately $625 a square foot. As cap rates spreads widen with decreasing interest rates and risks to European investment are exacerbated by Brexit and other geopolitical events, we continue to see a tailwind for U.S. real estate valuations, particularly in our core markets. 
Our capital strategy remains unchanged and that we are investing primarily in new developments and redevelopments, funded partially by select asset dispositions and the balance with debt financing. So let me start with acquisitions. This quarter, we closed the purchase of a 50% interest in Colorado Center located in Santa Monica, California, and that closed on July 1. Colorado Center comprises 1.2 million square feet on a 15-acre site and is one of the premier office campuses in West Los Angeles. Though the complex is very well parked with 3,100 stalls it's located 1 block from Bergamot Station on the newly opened commuter rail line between downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica. 
Moving to economics, the property is 68% leased, which provides us with a significant upside opportunity. Our net purchase price is $504 million or $850 a square foot. And renovation and tenant capital will be required to lease a property. So the going in NOI cap rate is 3.4%. Upon full lease-up of the complex, we expect to achieve yields of approximately 5.5% and over 6% after a full mark-to-market of the tenant base. Teachers owns the other 50% of Colorado Center, and we will provide all leasing property and construction management for the asset. We also look forward to advancing our relationship with teachers as part of this investment. In addition to the financial aspects of transaction, Colorado Center has provided Boston Properties with the opportunity to enter the West Los Angeles market with a significant asset. We view West L.A. as an important innovation center and currently one of the most vibrant office markets in the United States. Our intent is to methodically over time, build up Los Angeles into a full independent region for our company. We hired the on-site property management staff, and Ray Ritchey is providing senior level direction to our Colorado Center in Los Angeles efforts. Property management oversight, construction development and other support are all being provided from our San Francisco office. As the Los Angeles region grows, we anticipate a migration to local personnel, both hired externally and internally transferred. 
Lastly, I'm also pleased to report we are off to a very strong start in the leasing program for Colorado Center, and Doug's going to provide more details on this. Now on dispositions. We're in the market with VA95, our 11-building 740,000 square-foot suburban office campus located in Springfield, Virginia. This park may be sold in whole or part. We're pursuing a recapitalization of Metropolitan Square, a 660,000 square-foot office building located in the CBD of Washington, D.C. Given these transactions and our completed sale of 7 Kendall Center, we could reach as much as $350 million in 2016 asset sales. 
Moving to development. We remain active delivering assets into service, advancing our predevelopment pipeline and evaluating new investments. In terms of potential starts for 2016, we're competing for a 630,000 square foot office build to suit for the TSA in Springfield, Virginia. We're also commencing the full rehabilitation of the low-rise building at 601 Lexington Avenue. The building is being renamed 159 East 53rd Street and will have a segregated street entrance and lobby for 195,000 square foot office building. We remain very active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several important updates from the second quarter include: At Kendall Center in Cambridge, we're in advanced discussions with an office user to fully prelease a 400,000 plus square foot office building, which will require demolition of an existing 80,000 square foot low-rise building. This project would not commence until 2017, and efforts continue on developing commitments and projects for the remaining approximately 500,000 square feet of potential entitlements at Kendall Center. 
It has been reported that Boston Properties and a local developer attempting to entitle MacArthur Station Residences, which is a 402 unit, 25 storey residential development located adjacent to the MacArthur BART Station in the Temescal neighborhood of Oakland, California. We signed a letter of intent to invest in the project and are working on the entitlement process. Given the high cost of multifamily products in the San Francisco market, we believe we can deliver high-quality units at approximately a 20% discount to San Francisco rents in a location that is a 16-minute transit ride from the Embarcadero BART station in downtown San Francisco. The project will not commence until 2017, also subject to achieving entitlement. This past quarter, we also delivered 3 projects fully into service including 601 Mass. Avenue in Washington, 10 CityPoint in Waltham and 804 Carnegie Center in Princeton. In the aggregate, these buildings comprise 850,000 square feet or 94% leased, costs $487 million to build and are being delivered at a 7.8% NOI return on cost, which is above our projection. Given the value of the property is at a much lower cap rate, delivery of these projects again demonstrates the value-creation power of our development platform. Now given the deliveries, at the end of the second quarter, our development pipeline now consists of 8 new projects and 1 redevelopment, representing 3.8 million square feet and $2.1 billion in projected costs. 
Our budgeted NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7%, and the commercial component of the pipeline is 52% preleased. We expect the addition of these projects to our in-service portfolio to add materially to our company's growth's over the next 3 years. 
So to conclude, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value in the years ahead. We have a clear and achievable plan to materially grow FFO through the lease-up of existing assets and the delivery of new buildings through development. We have selected noncore assets for sale to raise capital and ensure continued portfolio refreshment. We have significant entitled and unentitled land holdings that we'll continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet is strong with conservative leverage which will allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that present themselves in coming quarters. So with that, let me turn it over to Doug."

Owen touched on the global interest rate environment and the pending election, Brexit, global political events. And if you take these things all together, these issues elevate uncertainty and volatility. And they impact capital spending decisions. 
In our business, a long-term lease is a major investment and requires a significant capital outlay on the part of the tenant. If you've listened to any of the real estate market conditions calls or read the quarterly updates that are put out by the leasing brokerage community, I think it's pretty clear that the leasing velocity across many of our markets is feeling this impact. In addition, while the national statistics may show very little general inflation, we can tell you that very tight labor conditions in the construction industry have pushed up the price of tenant improvement work. So it's easier today to delay all these commitments, and it's cheaper from a capital investment perspective to renew. 
So let me give you some specifics on our reasons, and I'm going to start with San Francisco. During the first quarter, we completed a 128,000 square feet of office leasing at EC. During the second quarter, we completed over 158,000 square feet of office leasing. And as of July 1, we had more than 233,000 square feet of full floor leases under negotiation. These leases average a positive mark-to-market of more than 40% on a gross basis, 70% on a net basis, very consistent with the leasing spreads that were reported in our quarterly supplemental. Yet at the same time, I will tell you that the overall leasing velocity in the San Francisco CBD is well off the levels of 2014 and early 2015. And there are a couple of explanations for this. First, as I described last quarter, the city at the moment is not experiencing the unprecedented large growth from tech companies, Google and Dropbox and Salesforce.com, Uber, Stripe, Slack, LinkedIn were so active in 2014 and 2015 with significant expansion. Yet there is still growing tech demand. In the first quarter, Airbnb and Twilio and Quantcast and Stripe all took down blocks of about 100,000 square feet each. And during the second quarter, Lift, Fitbit, Travana, Expedia, Reddit combined, have leased over 650,000 square feet of space. And today, there are more than a dozen active requirements from technology users looking for 100,000 square feet or more, including a couple that are close to 200,000 square feet. Twitch, NerdWallet and Meraki are those. 
Second and mostly recently, high quality, well-built sublet space has served as the dominant large block availability. And much of the recent demand has flowed into this quadrant. 3 of the 4 largest yields in the second quarter of over 100,000 square feet went to sublet space. Sublet availability has remained flat with the activity compensating for additional availability. Third, small space sublets are much less active. If you exclude capital raised by Uber and Snapchat during the second quarter, overall venture investing is pretty down significantly year-to-year. Seed and early stage investing is down from the prior year. And first-time investing is also down. These are the kinds of companies that gets funded and that are putting small spaces on to the market and are also the kind of companies that would be occupants. 
Finally, financial services and professional services firms continued at best to be neutral-demand generators. At Salesforce tower, we continue to negotiate with the same group of transactions we were working on last quarter, plus a few additions. Most of those discussions involve tenants with late 2017 and 2018 lease expirations. The structure of the building is up to about the 40th floor. And we expect to have our first tenants in occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018. We anticipate delivering the first block of space to Salesforce.com in the second quarter of '17. And then we have 4 future delivery dates that extend out until the fourth quarter of 2018. We will not recognize revenue until the tenant has completed their build-out on a floor-by-floor basis, even though we're going to be receiving cash rent 
So at this point, we think it's prudent for modeling purposes to assume no NOI in 2017 as startup operating expenses will offset any revenue. We had an extremely active quarter in the New York City region. While statistically, overall midtown market activity was a little bit light, we think it's largely because renewals have been prevalent and they're really not typically included in the leasing activity as measured by the major brokerage firms. Our total New York regional activity in the second quarter was over 435,000 square feet and it included 320,000 square feet of renewals and expansions at 399 Park Avenue. We have now released 155,000 square feet of the 2017 Citibank office expirations and 49,000 square feet of the 2017 Morgan Lewis exploration. The overall rent-up in these spaces was about 2%, which is very consistent with my past remarks where I said the 399 was basically a flat building. They included over 110,000 square feet of space at starting rents over $100 a square foot. This quarter across the portfolio, our New York City roll-up was about 14%. Our repositioning preconstruction activities are underway at 399 and we should be under construction by the fourth quarter. 
On July 1, 2 full floor high-rise floors at the General Motors building became available. While we continue to see a consistent and steady flow of leasing volumes that's between $80 and $125 a square foot, the velocity above this is a little bit slower. We have been successful leasing smaller suites across our portfolio and are going to take a similar approach to the 2 General Motors floors. We have shown the space. And we have issued proposal to a number of tenants, proportions of these floors. 
The most exciting news at the General Motors building is that the Under Armour has leased 53,000 square feet of the former FAO space. Their plans are being developed as we speak, and we expect they will create an incredibly dynamic experience for their brand, the building, and the city when they open. At the moment, we still have a temporary tenant utilizing the space, and we anticipate turning the space over to Under Armour some time in 2018. There are 17,000 square feet remaining, and it will likely become part of one of the other retailing units at the building. We don't believe it's appropriate to discuss the economics of the lease, but our contribution to our $80 million revenue bridge is consistent with our prior projection. We are in deep lease negotiations with more than 55,000 square feet of the space that was subject to our lease termination last quarter at 250 West 55th. While we expect to have the lease signed in the third quarter, the space is in raw condition, and we will not recognize revenue until the tenant has completed its installation, which will likely not occur until the end of '17 or early '18. All of our remaining prebuilt suites are under lease negotiations and we may break one of the 2 remaining floors of the top of the building to create additional inventory. 
At the June NAREIT meetings, we've got a number of comments suggesting that the D.C. CBD office market had turned the corner again. Our view has not changed, and we have not seen any demonstrable positive change in the leasing market in D.C. in the CBD. Between '16 and '19, we are tracking only 1 uncommitted law firm expiration over 100,000 square feet. D.C. is truly a forward leasing market for any sizable space. We are currently engaged ourselves with 2 law firms with 2020 expiration of over 100,000 square feet for our availability at that time. The GSA continued to have a very measured approach to their renewals, and we're not aware of any requirements that are net demand generators. The market is now hunkering into its election inertia, which contributes to pushing out decisions. In spite of the challenging environment, we did complete 20 office leases totaling 150,000 square feet across the region. D.C. will continue to see new products come on the market either in the form of gut renovation, and in some cases, ground-up development, such as Capital Crossing, which is currently building 900,000 square feet of speculative product right now. This is likely to govern any significant recovery. As we enter the quarter, our Reston portfolio was 97% leased, leaving us with a smattering of small spaces. We did 6 small deals this quarter, with starting rent in the mid-50s. Our Town Center portfolio continues to outperform the rest of Northern Virginia. The merger of a number of government contractors with large installations in our Reston Town Center assets has created a medium-term sublet space in our portfolio. While all the space is being used, these contractors are looking for cost-saving opportunities. And this space is their most marketable in their portfolios. With very little direct space, we are eager to work with our tenants on new potential transactions, which typically require additional stub terms.
We continue to see the Boston suburban market as having the strongest relevant demand growth across our portfolio. While we only completed 55,000 square feet of leases this quarter, we have more than 400,000 square feet of leases in negotiation from a series of life science, technology and even a few financial services organizations. Leasing velocity in the Waltham-Lexington submarket has accelerated during the last few months as a result of this demand and much of it is organic expansion. 
Last quarter, I mentioned we had over 450,000 square feet of technology and life science company used at Bay Colony. Today, we're negotiating another 100,000 square feet of life science and technology expansions or relocations at that park. It's been widely discussed that the Cambridge market continues to be one of the tightest in the country with availability rates under 5%. Virtually every major pharma company has put down a base in the Cambridge market. And coupled with the growth of the biotech industry and the tech titans, there are very strong demand drivers. 
I want to describe the active lease discussion on the first phase of our new development on the north parcel. In addition to our development, MIT has approvals for an additional 1.3 million square feet of office and lab space. And the RFP for the Volpe site has been issued, and offers will be due in the coming weeks. The current zoning of the Volpe site for a nongovernmental owner allows for 1.17 million square feet of commercial space and 970,000 square feet of residential development. I mentioned a few quarters ago that Microsoft, which leases 124,000 square feet in our 255 Main Street building had chosen to consolidate and might exercise a termination option in its lease. Well, we did in fact receive that notice, and the lease will expire on December 31, 2017, allowing us the opportunity to re-lease that space well before the original expiration date. 
As leased today, the weighted average rental rate on the 216,000 square feet at 255 Main Street is more than $25 a square foot below market. The Boston CBD continues to be a lease expiration driven market with a steady flow of new technology companies entering or expanding, but that's nothing like what's going on in San Francisco. We leased another mid-rise floor at 200 Clarendon. We signed our first LOI for a full floor at 120 St. James. We have a full floor lease under negotiation at 111 Huntington Avenue, on a floor we're going to get back in 2017. And we're negotiating a 2.5 floor deal for Prudential Tower. 
888 Wilson Street, our new office building is going to be opening in the third quarter, 71% leased with 2 or 3 floors in occupancy. The retail is going to open in December, and the anchor office tenant which is 154,000 square feet is not planning on moving in until the fourth quarter of '17, so we don't anticipate our full run rate until the very end of '17 on that development. The flagship Prudential retail redevelopment is fully leased. We anticipate Eataly will be opening in the fourth quarter of '16, and the final retail tenants will be opened by mid-2017. We are off to a great start in Los Angeles, as Owen suggested. 
Colorado Center is a 6 building campus with floor space between 30,000 square feet and 62,000 square feet. It is a large user project, and it fits terrifically with our operating platform design. The West L.A. market has had a string of strong quarters of rental rate growth as it benefits from both the creativity and entrepreneurship of local content, creators and providers. And it is a growing labor market for a number of the San Francisco-based tech companies that are trying to broaden their workforce reach. In the 4 weeks that we have owned the property, we have signed a letter of intent with a 160,000 square foot user and are in active discussion with another tenant for 60,000 square feet as well as discussions with existing tenants for expansion. If we complete simply these 2 leases, we will have leased 63% of the available space. We have also hired a set of design professionals and consultants that are assisting us with our future repositioning plan. 
Let me end my comments with a further update on our revenue bridge. With the additional leasing at Embarcadero Center and at the General Motors building, we have now pushed our completed transactions to over $58 million of the $80 million that we anticipated to receive by the end of 2017. And with that, I'll turn the floor over to Mike."
368278,374803736,1014153,"Boston Properties Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I just want to start with a quick summary of where we see the debt markets today. We do have some refinancing opportunities coming up, and the debt markets have been opened and improving in the face of the recent volatil",1370,"Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I just want to start with a quick summary of where we see the debt markets today. We do have some refinancing opportunities coming up, and the debt markets have been opened and improving in the face of the recent volatility in the rates market and the uncertainty in the global recovery after Brexit. We have 2 mortgages that are maturing in the next 8 months. 1 is a $350 million mortgage on Embarcadero Center four. It has a 7% GAAP interest rate that expires on December 1 and the second is a $750 million mortgage on 599 Lexington Avenue with a 5.4% GAAP interest rate that expires on March 1, 2017. Both of these loans have an open window, and we can pay them off with no penalty commencing this September and refinance at significantly lower interest expense. We also used $500 million of our cash balances to fund the acquisition of Colorado Center in July, bringing our available cash down to approximately $700 million after quarter end. With $1.3 billion remaining to fund in our development pipeline over the next couple of years, we may also look to enhance our liquidity with additional financing. 
Overall, our balance sheet remains conservatively leveraged, and we have substantial capacity to add debt to fund new investments. Our leverage is expected to improve as we achieved the significant earnings contribution projected from our developments as we move into late 2017 and 2018. 
Additionally, last week, Moody's announced a positive outlook on our unsecured debt ratings. The bond market has performed well through the recent volatility and our credit spreads have tightened. Even with the most recent slight run up in long-term rates, we believe that we can borrow for 10 years in the unsecured bond market at around 3%. We also have access to the secured debt markets where comparable borrowing costs are in the low to mid-3% range for high-quality properties that have reasonable leverage. You should also recall that we've entered into hedges for a notional amount of $550 million, targeting financing in the second half of 2016 at a 10-year swap rate of 2.42%. So at today's interest rates, we would have to amortize approximately 100 basis points of hedging cost into our interest expense on the first $550 million of financing. Although we're evaluating the markets as we always are, we have not assumed any early financing activity in our earnings guidance. 
Turning to our earnings results for the quarter, you could see from our press release that we reported second quarter FFO of $1.43 per share. That is $0.06 per share or about $10 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The biggest factor in our exceeding our guidance was termination income that was approximately $6 million or $0.04 per share higher than our projection. All of this income was in our guidance for later in 2016. So it represents an acceleration of the timing of income recognition into the second quarter that has no impact on our full year projection. 
The largest piece was related to 100,000 square foot space at 399 Park Avenue that had a natural lease expiration in late 2017. We were able to sign a replacement lease for this space with the client seeking to occupy earlier. And this, in conjunction with the other lease that Doug mentioned, represents 200,000 square feet of forward leasing, which is a great start in covering our late 2017 exposure at 399 Park. The performance of our portfolio drove approximately $4 million or $0.02 per share of the outperformance this quarter. Revenue was slightly ahead of expectations, while expenses, primarily utilities and repair maintenance expense were lower by about $3 million. Over $2 million of the expense reduction is related to R&M projects that have been reforecast into the back half of the year. So this portion will not flow through to our full year guidance. 
Our same property performance moderated this quarter, but it was still strong with our share of combined cash NOI of 4.7% and combined GAAP NOI of 0.7% from the second quarter last year. The most significant impact affecting this quarter was 140,000 square feet of space at 601 Lexington Avenue that expired midway through the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate our same property NOI growth to continue to moderate for the rest of 2016. We will have downtime between leases for the 80,000 square feet of high-rise space at 767 Fifth Avenue that Doug talked about. We also have 160,000 square feet expiring this quarter at 191 Spring Street which is in suburban Boston from a client who relocated and expanded at 10 CityPoint. We're working on a proposal for the majority of the space, but there will likely be 12 to 18 months of downtime between leases. On the positive side, we are and expect to continue to see growth from lease-up and roll-up of rents at Embarcadero Center, Prudential Center and 200 Clarendon Street. 
Overall, the leasing activity we are seeing is in line with our expectations, and we assume our share of same property combined NOI and 2016 will be up between 0.25% and 1.75% on a GAAP basis, and between 2% and 4% on a cash basis over 2015. In our nonsame property portfolio, we acquired Colorado Center this quarter and it is projected to add approximately $0.05 per share to our 2016 FFO. Based upon its addition we're increasing our guidance for the incremental contribution from the nonsame property portfolio to $46 million to $52 million over 2015. Colorado Center also has an impact on our noncash rents as there are several leases that are in free rent periods for the remainder of 2016. We received a credit from the seller equal to the amount of free rent, but the accounting rules require this to be reflected as a reduction in the purchase price as opposed to rental income, which is part of the reason why the net purchase price came down to $504 million. We now project our noncash rents in 2016 to be $52 million to $65 million. 
As you think about the change in our full year guidance, remember that we had included within our prior guidance virtually all of the second quarter earnings peak. We just expected it to occur later in the year. So the impact of the remaining changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operation to $5.92 to $5.99 per share. This is an increase of $0.06 per share at the midpoint, consisting of $0.05 per share from the acquisition of Colorado Center and $0.01 per share of better projected portfolio performance. 
I just want to close by adding some comments about 2017, although we will not be providing formal guidance until next quarter. First, just a reminder, that in 2016, we recorded $57 million in termination income which is much higher than typical and is primarily due to the large termination at 250 West 55th Street last quarter. This represents $0.34 per share of 2016 earnings that we do not expect to recur at the same level in 2017. Second as Doug described in our development pipeline, more than half of the leasing at 888 Boylson Street and all of the preleasing at Salesforce Tower will not commence GAAP revenue until late in '17 and early -- and into 2018. The space is leased and the revenue commencement is in line with our previous projection that we outlined in our investor presentation as recently as June that show the projected quarterly development run rate accelerating as we move into 2018. Also, we've captured a good portion of the $80 million in NOI growth that we've been projecting. And we will see the impact in our revenues, particularly at the Prudential Center and Embarcadero Center next year. As Doug described, the majority of the projected revenue from the lease-up of other properties, such as 767 Fifth Avenue, 601 Lex, 200 Clarendon Street and 120 St. James will likely hit by 2018. 
That completes all of our formal remarks. Operator, if you could open up the lines for questions, that would be great. Thanks."

Question, Owen or Doug. As you think about your stated strategy, and one of the components is to, of being astute investors and looking at market timing for investment decisions by acquiring properties in times of opportunity, I take it you sort of view Colorado Center as part of the L.A. But I'm curious if you think about what's going on in the U.K., sorting what's going on up in Canada, you've looked at Toronto and London in the past. The U.S. currency is certainly a lot more stronger today and one could argue that those would be opportune times to get into the market. So how should investors -- how should we think about -- your -- how you're thinking about it today and whether that could be something else on the table?"

So Michael -- we have, as you know, targeted a handful of markets for potential expansion of the company, one of those was L.A. We obviously made a significant move on that piece of the strategy last quarter, and also London has been on our list. And our view of London is that it will continue to be a great world city and will be an interesting market for real estate investment and development, so that hasn't changed. However, in the short term and medium term, given the Brexit vote, there are more uncertainties about economic growth and space demand. We don't know the impacts on trade policy, what that's going to do to the GDP growth. We don't know the impacts on passporting for financial institutions, what impact that will have on jobs in London. And so as we think about London, there's already been a 10% drop in the pound, which is helpful as a dollar investor, but we also think pricing for assets should also change, given these uncertainties that I described. So we're still looking, we're still active, but we're conscious of these additional drifts and would expect those to be reflected in pricing. And then, lastly, we're not particularly active looking at Toronto."

Several years ago, we came to a conclusion that in order to be relevant in terms of retail formats, which is so important to our mixed-use projects, we had to have a large component of experiential retail. Our major decision was the decision to shut down our traditional food court, which was a high-performing food court, one of the highest grossing in North America and repositioning with Italy. That will open up this November. We continue to see strong demand, not only across these mixed-use high-density projects, but the urban markets are incredibly high in demand. And we consistently see it, whether it's at Prudential Center where we have very few spaces remaining in terms of our repositioning of the entire asset, but we're also seeing it in our limited amount of retail we have in Cambridge. And then, also the significant amount we have preleased at our Hub project at North Station with our partners, the Jacobs, at Delaware North. And I think both those projects are indicative of that.

Yes, I think that given the slowness in the economy, we have raised the bar, so to speak, in the level of preleasing that we require on new development. It's -- everyone always asks for a number of this and that's not possible to provide because it depends on the size of the building, the activity level in the market, the speed of delivery, every piece of -- every circumstance is different. Where is the tenant coming from? Our existing portfolio from outside? But there's no question as we evaluate new developments, and we have a lot to evaluate even in our own company because of the large land holdings that we have. Preleasing is an absolute requirement, and our desire to have it be larger in the portfolio is there. So that is definitely happening. However, I think we still see projects, and I've described a couple of them, particularly several of the projects that we're looking at right now are actually 100% preleased. And those are the kinds of projects that we want to be doing and will create value for shareholders, even if we are layer in the economic cycle. As it relates to Dock72 leasing, I -- we're just too far away from delivery to expect much significant preletting. We're clearly in the market speaking with potential tenant, marketing the asset, but I think it's too early to expect -- for us to expect to have significantly preletting."

And also interest expense, we talked about the fact that we don't have any early refinancing in our guidance, but we do have the Embarcadero Center on [indiscernible] and it's a 7% loan, so there's an assumption on our guidance, so there's going to be much lower interest expense when we refinance that in the fourth quarter. The other thing I would mention would be operating expenses, which are cyclically highest in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter, primarily due to utilities where the HVAC is obviously a little more expensive in the hotter times of the year that we're sitting in right now, actually. So those are kind of most of the drivers. And there's some positives that we talked about in terms of leasing activity later in the year that we're guiding later in the year, things like continued activity at Embarcadero Center where we got renewals that we're working on that we're trying to sign that will have kind of a blend and extend where we'll get some GAAP lift later in the year. So it's those kind of things."

I can't give you exact numbers. I would say that somewhere between $15 million to $20 million is in today because that was, if you look at our slide, there was 535 Mission and 350 Bush lease up within there, and that is done. A good chunk of, I would say, half of the Embarcadero Center stuff will be in late this year and next year. And the Prudential Center stuff will be in next year, but not this year. And then, there's some big pieces that I think will be later. We're going to get some of the lease up at 200 Clarendon Street and perhaps a floor at 120 St. James that will hit sometime in '17. But the majority of that, I see, as being later because that is -- most of that space is, we have to wait until the tenant occupies to recognize revenue on that space. And then we've talked about Under Armour and the timing of that. And then, 100 Federal Street, which is another big piece of it, the lease is fully signed. But right now we're relocating another tenant to create the floors. We're not going to be able to deliver those floors until sometime in the middle of '17. So some of that will be into '17 and then into '18. So I didn't give you the numbers, but that's hopefully helpful with some guidance on the timing."

As usual, I'll cover our quarterly results, the macro market conditions as we see them as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another strong quarter with FFO per share $0.04 above consensus, primarily due to accelerated lease termination income. We've also increased the mid-point of our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance by $0.06. In the quarter, we leased 925,000 square feet, nearly half of that in the New York region and this quarterly volume is above historical averages by number of leases but below on total square feet. Our portfolio occupancy is now 90.8%, down 20 basis points from the end of the first quarter. We had another quarter of strong rent roll-ups in our leasing activity with rental rates on leases that commenced in the second quarter up 18% on a gross basis and 28% on a net basis compared to prior lease. As we anticipated, our leasing spreads continue to be strongest in San Francisco and Boston and positive in all regions. 
Now moving to the economy. U.S. economic growth continues to be sluggish and slowing. First quarter GDP has been reported at 1.1%, down from 1.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. And estimates for all of 2016 are approximately 2% after downward revision. The employment picture is -- been recently healthy with 287,000 jobs created in June, but has been volatile throughout 2016. Also, the unemployment rate has been relatively flat at 4.9%. Now economically the most significant news for the quarter was the U.K. surprise referendum outcome to leave the European Union. We've also had a series of tragic terrorist events and an attempted coup in Turkey. There's already evidence of a slowdown in the U.K. economy and the IMF predicts the global GDP will follow. Sterling has dropped over 10% and central banks in Europe and the U.K. are all signaling an accommodated posture. 
Given dollar strength and slowing growth, we believe that it will be more difficult for the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase rates further in the near term. The 10-year U.S. treasury has dropped 30 basis points to 1.6% over the quarter as a result. Lower rates have fueled record highs for the S&P 500 and a surge in REIT share prices in the U.S. Given the growth in the U.S. economy, albeit anemic, office markets nationally continue to improve slowly. Net absorption was 8.4 million square feet for the second quarter. Vacancy improved 10 basis points to 13.8%, asking rents rose 6.5% year-over-year. Construction levels are up 5% year-over-year, but remain at 2.2% of total stock, which is slightly above long-term averages. We continue to see the strongest space demand in innovation centers. So how are we managing our business given this environment of sluggish growth, punctuated by increasingly frequent economic and political events and an uncertain presidential election in November? 
First, we will continue to take advantage of reasonably healthy tenant demand and lease up our existing vacancy in new developments. Second, we'll focus our new investment activity around innovation centers where we see the strongest prospects for growth. And lastly, we will also protect the downside given the prospect of volatility by requiring preleasing for new office development, avoiding the purchase of stabilized assets of low cap rates and keeping our overall corporate leverage at conservative levels. 
Moving to private market real estate valuation. We believe prices remain strong for prime assets and gateway markets. As evidence, we've seen a number of transactions, in addition to what I've discussed last quarter in our core markets that were recently committed in 2016. In Cambridge, 1 Kendall Square, which is a 645,000 square foot office lab and retail asset sold for $1,124 a square foot and a low 4s initial cap rate. Though the sale did include a 173,000 square-foot development site, the buyer was a U.S. REIT with a capital partner. In New York, a partial interest in 7 West 34th Street, which is a 477,000 square foot office building fully let to Amazon was sold for $1,176 a square foot at a low to mid-4s cap rate to an Asian investor. In San Francisco, the piers on the Embarcadero waterfront, albeit a small 82,000 square-foot building sold for a low 4s cap rate and $1,250 a square foot, which is a record for San Francisco. And this was sold to a U.S. pension adviser. And in L.A., 12100 Wilshire and 11601 Wilshire sold in separate transactions to U.S. REITs, possibly with non-U.S. capital partners at a mid-3s cap rates and approximately $625 a square foot. As cap rates spreads widen with decreasing interest rates and risks to European investment are exacerbated by Brexit and other geopolitical events, we continue to see a tailwind for U.S. real estate valuations, particularly in our core markets. 
Our capital strategy remains unchanged and that we are investing primarily in new developments and redevelopments, funded partially by select asset dispositions and the balance with debt financing. So let me start with acquisitions. This quarter, we closed the purchase of a 50% interest in Colorado Center located in Santa Monica, California, and that closed on July 1. Colorado Center comprises 1.2 million square feet on a 15-acre site and is one of the premier office campuses in West Los Angeles. Though the complex is very well parked with 3,100 stalls it's located 1 block from Bergamot Station on the newly opened commuter rail line between downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica. 
Moving to economics, the property is 68% leased, which provides us with a significant upside opportunity. Our net purchase price is $504 million or $850 a square foot. And renovation and tenant capital will be required to lease a property. So the going in NOI cap rate is 3.4%. Upon full lease-up of the complex, we expect to achieve yields of approximately 5.5% and over 6% after a full mark-to-market of the tenant base. Teachers owns the other 50% of Colorado Center, and we will provide all leasing property and construction management for the asset. We also look forward to advancing our relationship with teachers as part of this investment. In addition to the financial aspects of transaction, Colorado Center has provided Boston Properties with the opportunity to enter the West Los Angeles market with a significant asset. We view West L.A. as an important innovation center and currently one of the most vibrant office markets in the United States. Our intent is to methodically over time, build up Los Angeles into a full independent region for our company. We hired the on-site property management staff, and Ray Ritchey is providing senior level direction to our Colorado Center in Los Angeles efforts. Property management oversight, construction development and other support are all being provided from our San Francisco office. As the Los Angeles region grows, we anticipate a migration to local personnel, both hired externally and internally transferred. 
Lastly, I'm also pleased to report we are off to a very strong start in the leasing program for Colorado Center, and Doug's going to provide more details on this. Now on dispositions. We're in the market with VA95, our 11-building 740,000 square-foot suburban office campus located in Springfield, Virginia. This park may be sold in whole or part. We're pursuing a recapitalization of Metropolitan Square, a 660,000 square-foot office building located in the CBD of Washington, D.C. Given these transactions and our completed sale of 7 Kendall Center, we could reach as much as $350 million in 2016 asset sales. 
Moving to development. We remain active delivering assets into service, advancing our predevelopment pipeline and evaluating new investments. In terms of potential starts for 2016, we're competing for a 630,000 square foot office build to suit for the TSA in Springfield, Virginia. We're also commencing the full rehabilitation of the low-rise building at 601 Lexington Avenue. The building is being renamed 159 East 53rd Street and will have a segregated street entrance and lobby for 195,000 square foot office building. We remain very active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several important updates from the second quarter include: At Kendall Center in Cambridge, we're in advanced discussions with an office user to fully prelease a 400,000 plus square foot office building, which will require demolition of an existing 80,000 square foot low-rise building. This project would not commence until 2017, and efforts continue on developing commitments and projects for the remaining approximately 500,000 square feet of potential entitlements at Kendall Center. 
It has been reported that Boston Properties and a local developer attempting to entitle MacArthur Station Residences, which is a 402 unit, 25 storey residential development located adjacent to the MacArthur BART Station in the Temescal neighborhood of Oakland, California. We signed a letter of intent to invest in the project and are working on the entitlement process. Given the high cost of multifamily products in the San Francisco market, we believe we can deliver high-quality units at approximately a 20% discount to San Francisco rents in a location that is a 16-minute transit ride from the Embarcadero BART station in downtown San Francisco. The project will not commence until 2017, also subject to achieving entitlement. This past quarter, we also delivered 3 projects fully into service including 601 Mass. Avenue in Washington, 10 CityPoint in Waltham and 804 Carnegie Center in Princeton. In the aggregate, these buildings comprise 850,000 square feet or 94% leased, costs $487 million to build and are being delivered at a 7.8% NOI return on cost, which is above our projection. Given the value of the property is at a much lower cap rate, delivery of these projects again demonstrates the value-creation power of our development platform. Now given the deliveries, at the end of the second quarter, our development pipeline now consists of 8 new projects and 1 redevelopment, representing 3.8 million square feet and $2.1 billion in projected costs. 
Our budgeted NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7%, and the commercial component of the pipeline is 52% preleased. We expect the addition of these projects to our in-service portfolio to add materially to our company's growth's over the next 3 years. 
So to conclude, we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for success and ability to create shareholder value in the years ahead. We have a clear and achievable plan to materially grow FFO through the lease-up of existing assets and the delivery of new buildings through development. We have selected noncore assets for sale to raise capital and ensure continued portfolio refreshment. We have significant entitled and unentitled land holdings that we'll continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet is strong with conservative leverage which will allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that present themselves in coming quarters. So with that, let me turn it over to Doug."

Owen touched on the global interest rate environment and the pending election, Brexit, global political events. And if you take these things all together, these issues elevate uncertainty and volatility. And they impact capital spending decisions. 
In our business, a long-term lease is a major investment and requires a significant capital outlay on the part of the tenant. If you've listened to any of the real estate market conditions calls or read the quarterly updates that are put out by the leasing brokerage community, I think it's pretty clear that the leasing velocity across many of our markets is feeling this impact. In addition, while the national statistics may show very little general inflation, we can tell you that very tight labor conditions in the construction industry have pushed up the price of tenant improvement work. So it's easier today to delay all these commitments, and it's cheaper from a capital investment perspective to renew. 
So let me give you some specifics on our reasons, and I'm going to start with San Francisco. During the first quarter, we completed a 128,000 square feet of office leasing at EC. During the second quarter, we completed over 158,000 square feet of office leasing. And as of July 1, we had more than 233,000 square feet of full floor leases under negotiation. These leases average a positive mark-to-market of more than 40% on a gross basis, 70% on a net basis, very consistent with the leasing spreads that were reported in our quarterly supplemental. Yet at the same time, I will tell you that the overall leasing velocity in the San Francisco CBD is well off the levels of 2014 and early 2015. And there are a couple of explanations for this. First, as I described last quarter, the city at the moment is not experiencing the unprecedented large growth from tech companies, Google and Dropbox and Salesforce.com, Uber, Stripe, Slack, LinkedIn were so active in 2014 and 2015 with significant expansion. Yet there is still growing tech demand. In the first quarter, Airbnb and Twilio and Quantcast and Stripe all took down blocks of about 100,000 square feet each. And during the second quarter, Lift, Fitbit, Travana, Expedia, Reddit combined, have leased over 650,000 square feet of space. And today, there are more than a dozen active requirements from technology users looking for 100,000 square feet or more, including a couple that are close to 200,000 square feet. Twitch, NerdWallet and Meraki are those. 
Second and mostly recently, high quality, well-built sublet space has served as the dominant large block availability. And much of the recent demand has flowed into this quadrant. 3 of the 4 largest yields in the second quarter of over 100,000 square feet went to sublet space. Sublet availability has remained flat with the activity compensating for additional availability. Third, small space sublets are much less active. If you exclude capital raised by Uber and Snapchat during the second quarter, overall venture investing is pretty down significantly year-to-year. Seed and early stage investing is down from the prior year. And first-time investing is also down. These are the kinds of companies that gets funded and that are putting small spaces on to the market and are also the kind of companies that would be occupants. 
Finally, financial services and professional services firms continued at best to be neutral-demand generators. At Salesforce tower, we continue to negotiate with the same group of transactions we were working on last quarter, plus a few additions. Most of those discussions involve tenants with late 2017 and 2018 lease expirations. The structure of the building is up to about the 40th floor. And we expect to have our first tenants in occupancy in late 2017 or early 2018. We anticipate delivering the first block of space to Salesforce.com in the second quarter of '17. And then we have 4 future delivery dates that extend out until the fourth quarter of 2018. We will not recognize revenue until the tenant has completed their build-out on a floor-by-floor basis, even though we're going to be receiving cash rent 
So at this point, we think it's prudent for modeling purposes to assume no NOI in 2017 as startup operating expenses will offset any revenue. We had an extremely active quarter in the New York City region. While statistically, overall midtown market activity was a little bit light, we think it's largely because renewals have been prevalent and they're really not typically included in the leasing activity as measured by the major brokerage firms. Our total New York regional activity in the second quarter was over 435,000 square feet and it included 320,000 square feet of renewals and expansions at 399 Park Avenue. We have now released 155,000 square feet of the 2017 Citibank office expirations and 49,000 square feet of the 2017 Morgan Lewis exploration. The overall rent-up in these spaces was about 2%, which is very consistent with my past remarks where I said the 399 was basically a flat building. They included over 110,000 square feet of space at starting rents over $100 a square foot. This quarter across the portfolio, our New York City roll-up was about 14%. Our repositioning preconstruction activities are underway at 399 and we should be under construction by the fourth quarter. 
On July 1, 2 full floor high-rise floors at the General Motors building became available. While we continue to see a consistent and steady flow of leasing volumes that's between $80 and $125 a square foot, the velocity above this is a little bit slower. We have been successful leasing smaller suites across our portfolio and are going to take a similar approach to the 2 General Motors floors. We have shown the space. And we have issued proposal to a number of tenants, proportions of these floors. 
The most exciting news at the General Motors building is that the Under Armour has leased 53,000 square feet of the former FAO space. Their plans are being developed as we speak, and we expect they will create an incredibly dynamic experience for their brand, the building, and the city when they open. At the moment, we still have a temporary tenant utilizing the space, and we anticipate turning the space over to Under Armour some time in 2018. There are 17,000 square feet remaining, and it will likely become part of one of the other retailing units at the building. We don't believe it's appropriate to discuss the economics of the lease, but our contribution to our $80 million revenue bridge is consistent with our prior projection. We are in deep lease negotiations with more than 55,000 square feet of the space that was subject to our lease termination last quarter at 250 West 55th. While we expect to have the lease signed in the third quarter, the space is in raw condition, and we will not recognize revenue until the tenant has completed its installation, which will likely not occur until the end of '17 or early '18. All of our remaining prebuilt suites are under lease negotiations and we may break one of the 2 remaining floors of the top of the building to create additional inventory. 
At the June NAREIT meetings, we've got a number of comments suggesting that the D.C. CBD office market had turned the corner again. Our view has not changed, and we have not seen any demonstrable positive change in the leasing market in D.C. in the CBD. Between '16 and '19, we are tracking only 1 uncommitted law firm expiration over 100,000 square feet. D.C. is truly a forward leasing market for any sizable space. We are currently engaged ourselves with 2 law firms with 2020 expiration of over 100,000 square feet for our availability at that time. The GSA continued to have a very measured approach to their renewals, and we're not aware of any requirements that are net demand generators. The market is now hunkering into its election inertia, which contributes to pushing out decisions. In spite of the challenging environment, we did complete 20 office leases totaling 150,000 square feet across the region. D.C. will continue to see new products come on the market either in the form of gut renovation, and in some cases, ground-up development, such as Capital Crossing, which is currently building 900,000 square feet of speculative product right now. This is likely to govern any significant recovery. As we enter the quarter, our Reston portfolio was 97% leased, leaving us with a smattering of small spaces. We did 6 small deals this quarter, with starting rent in the mid-50s. Our Town Center portfolio continues to outperform the rest of Northern Virginia. The merger of a number of government contractors with large installations in our Reston Town Center assets has created a medium-term sublet space in our portfolio. While all the space is being used, these contractors are looking for cost-saving opportunities. And this space is their most marketable in their portfolios. With very little direct space, we are eager to work with our tenants on new potential transactions, which typically require additional stub terms.
We continue to see the Boston suburban market as having the strongest relevant demand growth across our portfolio. While we only completed 55,000 square feet of leases this quarter, we have more than 400,000 square feet of leases in negotiation from a series of life science, technology and even a few financial services organizations. Leasing velocity in the Waltham-Lexington submarket has accelerated during the last few months as a result of this demand and much of it is organic expansion. 
Last quarter, I mentioned we had over 450,000 square feet of technology and life science company used at Bay Colony. Today, we're negotiating another 100,000 square feet of life science and technology expansions or relocations at that park. It's been widely discussed that the Cambridge market continues to be one of the tightest in the country with availability rates under 5%. Virtually every major pharma company has put down a base in the Cambridge market. And coupled with the growth of the biotech industry and the tech titans, there are very strong demand drivers. 
I want to describe the active lease discussion on the first phase of our new development on the north parcel. In addition to our development, MIT has approvals for an additional 1.3 million square feet of office and lab space. And the RFP for the Volpe site has been issued, and offers will be due in the coming weeks. The current zoning of the Volpe site for a nongovernmental owner allows for 1.17 million square feet of commercial space and 970,000 square feet of residential development. I mentioned a few quarters ago that Microsoft, which leases 124,000 square feet in our 255 Main Street building had chosen to consolidate and might exercise a termination option in its lease. Well, we did in fact receive that notice, and the lease will expire on December 31, 2017, allowing us the opportunity to re-lease that space well before the original expiration date. 
As leased today, the weighted average rental rate on the 216,000 square feet at 255 Main Street is more than $25 a square foot below market. The Boston CBD continues to be a lease expiration driven market with a steady flow of new technology companies entering or expanding, but that's nothing like what's going on in San Francisco. We leased another mid-rise floor at 200 Clarendon. We signed our first LOI for a full floor at 120 St. James. We have a full floor lease under negotiation at 111 Huntington Avenue, on a floor we're going to get back in 2017. And we're negotiating a 2.5 floor deal for Prudential Tower. 
888 Wilson Street, our new office building is going to be opening in the third quarter, 71% leased with 2 or 3 floors in occupancy. The retail is going to open in December, and the anchor office tenant which is 154,000 square feet is not planning on moving in until the fourth quarter of '17, so we don't anticipate our full run rate until the very end of '17 on that development. The flagship Prudential retail redevelopment is fully leased. We anticipate Eataly will be opening in the fourth quarter of '16, and the final retail tenants will be opened by mid-2017. We are off to a great start in Los Angeles, as Owen suggested. 
Colorado Center is a 6 building campus with floor space between 30,000 square feet and 62,000 square feet. It is a large user project, and it fits terrifically with our operating platform design. The West L.A. market has had a string of strong quarters of rental rate growth as it benefits from both the creativity and entrepreneurship of local content, creators and providers. And it is a growing labor market for a number of the San Francisco-based tech companies that are trying to broaden their workforce reach. In the 4 weeks that we have owned the property, we have signed a letter of intent with a 160,000 square foot user and are in active discussion with another tenant for 60,000 square feet as well as discussions with existing tenants for expansion. If we complete simply these 2 leases, we will have leased 63% of the available space. We have also hired a set of design professionals and consultants that are assisting us with our future repositioning plan. 
Let me end my comments with a further update on our revenue bridge. With the additional leasing at Embarcadero Center and at the General Motors building, we have now pushed our completed transactions to over $58 million of the $80 million that we anticipated to receive by the end of 2017. And with that, I'll turn the floor over to Mike."
368278,374803736,1014651,"Boston Properties Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I just want to start with a quick summary of where we see the debt markets today. We do have some refinancing opportunities coming up, and the debt markets have been opened and improving in the face of the recent volatil",1370,"Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I just want to start with a quick summary of where we see the debt markets today. We do have some refinancing opportunities coming up, and the debt markets have been opened and improving in the face of the recent volatility in the rates market and the uncertainty in the global recovery after Brexit. We have 2 mortgages that are maturing in the next 8 months. 1 is a $350 million mortgage on Embarcadero Center four. It has a 7% GAAP interest rate that expires on December 1 and the second is a $750 million mortgage on 599 Lexington Avenue with a 5.4% GAAP interest rate that expires on March 1, 2017. Both of these loans have an open window, and we can pay them off with no penalty commencing this September and refinance at significantly lower interest expense. We also used $500 million of our cash balances to fund the acquisition of Colorado Center in July, bringing our available cash down to approximately $700 million after quarter end. With $1.3 billion remaining to fund in our development pipeline over the next couple of years, we may also look to enhance our liquidity with additional financing. 
Overall, our balance sheet remains conservatively leveraged, and we have substantial capacity to add debt to fund new investments. Our leverage is expected to improve as we achieved the significant earnings contribution projected from our developments as we move into late 2017 and 2018. 
Additionally, last week, Moody's announced a positive outlook on our unsecured debt ratings. The bond market has performed well through the recent volatility and our credit spreads have tightened. Even with the most recent slight run up in long-term rates, we believe that we can borrow for 10 years in the unsecured bond market at around 3%. We also have access to the secured debt markets where comparable borrowing costs are in the low to mid-3% range for high-quality properties that have reasonable leverage. You should also recall that we've entered into hedges for a notional amount of $550 million, targeting financing in the second half of 2016 at a 10-year swap rate of 2.42%. So at today's interest rates, we would have to amortize approximately 100 basis points of hedging cost into our interest expense on the first $550 million of financing. Although we're evaluating the markets as we always are, we have not assumed any early financing activity in our earnings guidance. 
Turning to our earnings results for the quarter, you could see from our press release that we reported second quarter FFO of $1.43 per share. That is $0.06 per share or about $10 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The biggest factor in our exceeding our guidance was termination income that was approximately $6 million or $0.04 per share higher than our projection. All of this income was in our guidance for later in 2016. So it represents an acceleration of the timing of income recognition into the second quarter that has no impact on our full year projection. 
The largest piece was related to 100,000 square foot space at 399 Park Avenue that had a natural lease expiration in late 2017. We were able to sign a replacement lease for this space with the client seeking to occupy earlier. And this, in conjunction with the other lease that Doug mentioned, represents 200,000 square feet of forward leasing, which is a great start in covering our late 2017 exposure at 399 Park. The performance of our portfolio drove approximately $4 million or $0.02 per share of the outperformance this quarter. Revenue was slightly ahead of expectations, while expenses, primarily utilities and repair maintenance expense were lower by about $3 million. Over $2 million of the expense reduction is related to R&M projects that have been reforecast into the back half of the year. So this portion will not flow through to our full year guidance. 
Our same property performance moderated this quarter, but it was still strong with our share of combined cash NOI of 4.7% and combined GAAP NOI of 0.7% from the second quarter last year. The most significant impact affecting this quarter was 140,000 square feet of space at 601 Lexington Avenue that expired midway through the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate our same property NOI growth to continue to moderate for the rest of 2016. We will have downtime between leases for the 80,000 square feet of high-rise space at 767 Fifth Avenue that Doug talked about. We also have 160,000 square feet expiring this quarter at 191 Spring Street which is in suburban Boston from a client who relocated and expanded at 10 CityPoint. We're working on a proposal for the majority of the space, but there will likely be 12 to 18 months of downtime between leases. On the positive side, we are and expect to continue to see growth from lease-up and roll-up of rents at Embarcadero Center, Prudential Center and 200 Clarendon Street. 
Overall, the leasing activity we are seeing is in line with our expectations, and we assume our share of same property combined NOI and 2016 will be up between 0.25% and 1.75% on a GAAP basis, and between 2% and 4% on a cash basis over 2015. In our nonsame property portfolio, we acquired Colorado Center this quarter and it is projected to add approximately $0.05 per share to our 2016 FFO. Based upon its addition we're increasing our guidance for the incremental contribution from the nonsame property portfolio to $46 million to $52 million over 2015. Colorado Center also has an impact on our noncash rents as there are several leases that are in free rent periods for the remainder of 2016. We received a credit from the seller equal to the amount of free rent, but the accounting rules require this to be reflected as a reduction in the purchase price as opposed to rental income, which is part of the reason why the net purchase price came down to $504 million. We now project our noncash rents in 2016 to be $52 million to $65 million. 
As you think about the change in our full year guidance, remember that we had included within our prior guidance virtually all of the second quarter earnings peak. We just expected it to occur later in the year. So the impact of the remaining changes results in our increasing our guidance range for 2016 funds from operation to $5.92 to $5.99 per share. This is an increase of $0.06 per share at the midpoint, consisting of $0.05 per share from the acquisition of Colorado Center and $0.01 per share of better projected portfolio performance. 
I just want to close by adding some comments about 2017, although we will not be providing formal guidance until next quarter. First, just a reminder, that in 2016, we recorded $57 million in termination income which is much higher than typical and is primarily due to the large termination at 250 West 55th Street last quarter. This represents $0.34 per share of 2016 earnings that we do not expect to recur at the same level in 2017. Second as Doug described in our development pipeline, more than half of the leasing at 888 Boylson Street and all of the preleasing at Salesforce Tower will not commence GAAP revenue until late in '17 and early -- and into 2018. The space is leased and the revenue commencement is in line with our previous projection that we outlined in our investor presentation as recently as June that show the projected quarterly development run rate accelerating as we move into 2018. Also, we've captured a good portion of the $80 million in NOI growth that we've been projecting. And we will see the impact in our revenues, particularly at the Prudential Center and Embarcadero Center next year. As Doug described, the majority of the projected revenue from the lease-up of other properties, such as 767 Fifth Avenue, 601 Lex, 200 Clarendon Street and 120 St. James will likely hit by 2018. 
That completes all of our formal remarks. Operator, if you could open up the lines for questions, that would be great. Thanks."

Question, Owen or Doug. As you think about your stated strategy, and one of the components is to, of being astute investors and looking at market timing for investment decisions by acquiring properties in times of opportunity, I take it you sort of view Colorado Center as part of the L.A. But I'm curious if you think about what's going on in the U.K., sorting what's going on up in Canada, you've looked at Toronto and London in the past. The U.S. currency is certainly a lot more stronger today and one could argue that those would be opportune times to get into the market. So how should investors -- how should we think about -- your -- how you're thinking about it today and whether that could be something else on the table?"

So Michael -- we have, as you know, targeted a handful of markets for potential expansion of the company, one of those was L.A. We obviously made a significant move on that piece of the strategy last quarter, and also London has been on our list. And our view of London is that it will continue to be a great world city and will be an interesting market for real estate investment and development, so that hasn't changed. However, in the short term and medium term, given the Brexit vote, there are more uncertainties about economic growth and space demand. We don't know the impacts on trade policy, what that's going to do to the GDP growth. We don't know the impacts on passporting for financial institutions, what impact that will have on jobs in London. And so as we think about London, there's already been a 10% drop in the pound, which is helpful as a dollar investor, but we also think pricing for assets should also change, given these uncertainties that I described. So we're still looking, we're still active, but we're conscious of these additional drifts and would expect those to be reflected in pricing. And then, lastly, we're not particularly active looking at Toronto."

So yes, we could go out and pay, purchase the pipeline of assets that continue to be offered in the marketplace, but we want to be selective about getting a high-quality asset, giving an asset that is positioned for our type of tenants, which are generally larger.

Where is the tenant coming from? Our existing portfolio from outside? But there's no question as we evaluate new developments, and we have a lot to evaluate even in our own company because of the large land holdings that we have. Preleasing is an absolute requirement, and our desire to have it be larger in the portfolio is there. So that is definitely happening. However, I think we still see projects, and I've described a couple of them, particularly several of the projects that we're looking at right now are actually 100% preleased.

The other thing I would mention would be operating expenses, which are cyclically highest in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter, primarily due to utilities where the HVAC is obviously a little more expensive in the hotter times of the year that we're sitting in right now, actually. So those are kind of most of the drivers. And there's some positives that we talked about in terms of leasing activity later in the year that we're guiding later in the year, things like continued activity at Embarcadero Center where we got renewals that we're working on that we're trying to sign that will have kind of a blend and extend where we'll get some GAAP lift later in the year.

But the majority of that, I see, as being later because that is -- most of that space is, we have to wait until the tenant occupies to recognize revenue on that space.

368278,404556925,1061614,"Boston Properties Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll cover our quarterly results, market conditions, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share of $0.01 ab",1812,"Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll cover our quarterly results, market conditions, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share of $0.01 above our prior guidance, primarily due to portfolio outperformance. We also increased our full year 2016 FFO per share projection by $0.03. For the quarter, we leased just under 900,000 square feet, which is below our historical averages. However, we have a very robust pipeline of in-service and development leasing activity, which we think will be signed before calendar year-end and which will bring our annual leasing for 2016 in line with or possibly above average. Our in-service portfolio occupancy is now 89.6%, which is down 120 basis points from the end of the second quarter, and this is due primarily to the addition of Colorado Center to the portfolio. We had another quarter of positive rent roll-ups in our leasing activity, with rental rates on leases that commenced in the third quarter up 6% on a gross basis and 8% on a net basis compared to prior lease. 
Now moving to the economy. U.S. economic growth continues to be positive but as we all know, it's been sluggish. Second quarter GDP growth has been revised up to 1.4%. It was 0.8% in the first quarter and estimates for all of '16 are 2% or less. The employment picture continues to improve gradually, with 156,000 jobs created in September and the unemployment rate has remained flat at 5%. Wages have perked up a bit, up 2.6%, though inflation remained low at 1.1% for the third quarter. 
Moving to capital markets. The 10-year U.S. Treasury has risen approximately 40 basis points to 1.75 [ph] the from the lows in July which has sparked a seemingly harsh REIT market correction of 5.5 plus percent over the past month. Though the status signaling won [ph] rate hike before year-end, further increases in the short to medium term we think will be tempered by low interest rates in the developed world, dollar strength, sluggish growth in the U.S. and low inflation. [ph] Given the growth in U.S. economy, office market nationally continue to improve, albeit more slowly. Net absorption was 8.7 million feet for the third quarter and the vacancy rate was flat to last quarter but improved 30 basis points from a year ago. Asking rents rose nearly 6% year-over-year and construction levels are up 6% year-over-year and are 2.3% of total stock, which is above the long-term average of 1.9% for the U.S. office market.
Moving to private real estate capital markets. We believe interest from primarily non-U.S. investors remains healthy for prime assets and gateway markets. However, transaction volumes are below 2015 levels and domestic institutional investors have been less of a factor in this segment of the market. Commodity assets are more difficult to sell, and there are fewer bidders for Class A trophies. [ph] There are, however, several examples of Class A assets continuing to sell for favorable prices in the third quarter. In Cambridge, 245 First Street, [ph] which is a 300,000 square-foot office and lab building sold to a domestic pension fund adviser for $1,020 per square foot in a mid-4 [ph] cap rate. In San Francisco, a sovereign wealth fund purchased a minority position in 101st Street and 303 Second Street for approximately $950,000 a square foot, which is a low 4s cap rate. And finally, in West L.A, 233 Wilshire was acquired by U.S. REIT in partnership with a sovereign wealth fund for $1,080 per square foot and low to mid-4s cap rate and there's a pipeline of additional deals in the West L.A. market we think with similar pricing metrics. We believe the relative stability of the U.S. market, given Brexit and other global turbulence, as well as the fact that U.S. cap rates spreads treasuries remain above long-term averages will provide a cushion for U.S. real estate valuations, particularly in our core markets. 
So in summary, operating performance improvement in office remains positive but is later in the cycle and slowing slightly. Interest rates are up modestly but will likely remain low and private capital flows into our space remain healthy, though somewhat diminished from previous quarters. Given this economic picture, we'll continue to take advantage of reasonably healthy tenant demand and lease up our existing vacancy and new developments. We'll focus our new your investment activity on new development and asset refurbishment in innovation centers where we see the strongest prospects for growth. We will also protect the downside by requiring pre-leasing for new office development, avoiding the purchase of stabilized assets at low cap rates, selectively selling assets and keeping our overall corporate leverage at conservative levels. 
Moving to the execution of our capital strategy. As you know, we completed the acquisition of Colorado Center in West L.A. last quarter. We had a very -- we've had very strong leasing activity at the project and are completing our redevelopment plan. We are also actively seeking to grow West L.A. into another major region for Boston Properties over the long term and are reviewing a number of on and off market opportunities. However, we will remain discipline and patient and focus only on investment that creates attractive returns to shareholders. 
Moving to dispositions. We recently completed with Blackstone the recapitalization of Metropolitan Square, which is a 620,000 square foot office building, 75% leased, located in close proximity to the White House in Washington, D.C. We've reduced our interest from 51% to 20% and will retain the leasing and management of the property. Pricing on a 100% basis was $360 million or $581 a square foot and the building will likely require an additional $160 per square foot of capital to complete its positioning. We realized $56 million of proceeds for the sale of our interest, net of existing financing, and we experienced a 14.2% leveraged IRR in the portion was sold over our 18 year period of ownership. We're also delighted to be developing a larger relationship with Blackstone through this transaction. 
We also closed in the third quarter the sale of a parcel in our broad run business park in County for $18 million. And finally, we've withdrawn from the market our VA 95 business Park in Springfield, Virginia. During the marketing process, the major tenant in the park, U.S. Customs, issued an RFP for a consolidation in Northern Virginia. The result and uncertainty around retaining this tenant diminished investor interest in the asset that ultimately we could end up benefiting from the consolidation opportunity. We do not anticipate any additional sales in 2016 though we intend to continue to sell non-core assets in 2017, subject to market conditions. Including these transactions, in 2016, we will complete the monetization of 3 assets for total gross proceeds on a hour share basis of $235 million, which is in line with projections provided at the beginning of the year. 
Moving to development. We remain active delivering assets in to service, advancing our predevelopment pipeline and evaluating new investments. In terms of starts for the quarter, we commenced the full redevelopment of the 220,000 square-foot low-rise building at 601 Lexington Avenue, 195,000 square-foot office component of the building is being renamed 159 East 53rd Street and will have a new dedicated street entrance and lobby providing branding opportunities for major tenants. The building is being re-clad, creating 30% more vision glass, a new high-efficiency HVAC system will be installed and access to the building's extensive and redesigned outdoor terraces will be improved. The 25,000 square-foot retail atrium is also being completely redeveloped with a prominent at grade entrance on 53rd Street and will house multiple dining amenities and a fitness center. Our share of the total budgeted cost of this project is $106 million and we forecast the yield on the office component to be in line with our target NOI yield of 7% for development. Returns on the retail announced or plaza components will be partially driven by the enhancements we realized and lease rate in velocity due to this new amenity for our 3 major office assets at the 53rd Street in Lexington Avenue. 
We also anticipate starting the development of an amenity building in the outdoor -- existing outdoor plaza at 100 Federal Street in Boston in the fourth quarter. We remain active advening our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several updates from this quarter include at Kendall Center in Cambridge, we're in the final stages of executing a lease with a major technology company to build their 476,000 square-foot headquarters at 145 Broadway, which will require a demolition of an existing 80,000 square-foot low-rise building on the site. Total budgeted development costs are $517 million or $1,086 per square foot with land at market value and the first year development NOI yield is projected to be approximately 7%. The project will not commence until 2017 and efforts continue on developing commitments and projects for the remaining 600,000 square feet of potential entitlements at Kendall Center. 
We're pursuing -- further, we're pursuing multiple new pre-lease development opportunity in the Washington, D.C. region, all of which are potential 2017 starts. On deliveries. This month, we delivered into service 12 65 Main Street in Waltham, Mass. This -- the building which we own in partnership with a local developer is 115,000 square feet and 100% leased to C&J Clarke. We are generating a 7.7% yield on our $26 million investment in this redevelopment. At the end of the third quarter, our development pipeline now consists of 8 new projects and 2 redevelopments totaling 4 million square feet and $2.2 billion in projected costs. Our projected NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 50% pre-let. We expect the addition of these projects to our in-service portfolio to add materially to our company's growth over the next 3 years. 
So to conclude, we continue to remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for creating shareholder value in the quarters ahead. We have a clear and achievable plan to materially grow FFO through to the development and delivery of new building, as well as the lease up of existing assets for which we currently have a particularly strong backlog of potential leases. We selected non-core assets for sales to rates capital and ensure continued portfolio improvement. We have significant entitled and unentitled landholdings that will continue to push through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet remains strong with conservative leverage which will allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that present themselves in coming quarters. So let me turn the call over to Doug for a further review of the market."
368278,404556925,1061614,"Boston Properties Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So this is the third quarter and we introduced our 2017 earnings guidance last night and I'm going to devote my time this morning to providing the operating background that's behind our estimates and to describe the",2815,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So this is the third quarter and we introduced our 2017 earnings guidance last night and I'm going to devote my time this morning to providing the operating background that's behind our estimates and to describe the key drivers of our occupancy and revenue growth over the short term, as well as those situations where we have in fact completed transactions, signed leases, but are not going to be recognizing any revenue until 2018 and there's a significant amount of that. In a number of instances, our estimates reflect investment and repositioning decisions that were made during the past 12 months, which have a direct impact on our 2017 GAAP revenues and I want to take the time to provide incremental impact of those decisions. So let me now give you some specifics on our reasons and I'll start with San Francisco. So during the first quarter, we completed 128,000 square feet of office leasing at Embarcadero Center. During the second quarter, 158,000 square feet of leases and during the third quarter, we completed an additional 219,000 square feet of leasing. All of these leases average a positive mark-to-market of more than 40% on a gross basis and 70% on a net basis, very consistent with the leasing spreads we've been reporting in a quarterly supplemental. The incremental revenue from the deals we've now signed in San Francisco since the third quarter of last year, is over $16.5 million and will be at a full run rate starting in the third quarter of '17. The overall market conditions we've been describing in the last few quarters in the San Francisco CBD really remain the same. And while it may make a headline, the rate of activity in 2016 is not going to be quite at the level it was in '15 which by the way was just off the peak market of 2014. We actually think the real news is the stability of the market in San Francisco CBD. Each quarter, there continues to be a new crop of significant technology company lease expansions in addition to the traditional lease exploration driven market demand. This quarter, Switch signed a lease at 350 Bush for 185,000 square feet. FitBit took over 300,000 square feet off the sublet market; Lift has taken over 280,000 square feet at 185 Berry; Adobe is in the market and expanding by 200,000 square feet; Slack, which started at our building at 680 Fulsom in an 11,000 square-foot pre-build suite in 2014 is now looking for more than 200,000 square feet. And NerdWallet continues to be in the market for over 100,000 square feet. 
Continuing the trend we saw in the second quarter, high-quality, well-built sublet space is hitting the market and getting quickly absorbed and has really served the dominant large block availability. The largest block of sublet space in the market statistically last quarter was a 400,000 square-foot block at 211 Main, so there's no more sublet availability. And the largest block of space on the market this quarter was up over at Twitter's buildings up on upper market. It appears now that space has been put under lease negotiations with a growing startup technology company. Sublet availability has remained flat with growing technology expansion compensating for additional availability. Salesforce Tower is the tallest building in the city and we are now able to take prospective tenants up to the available floors and allow them to visually and physically experience the breath division glass, the calm free floors, the volume of the slab to slab heights and the views. We have 5 floors under lease negotiations, which are what our expectations was for the year and hope to have all of these leases signed by year-end. Only 1 full floor future prospect is actually located at Embarcadero Center, so it's all incremental in the demand. The structure of the building is up about 56 floors and we expect to have our first tenants in occupancy in late 2017. 
I've said this last quarter but I want to repeat it again. We anticipate delivering the first block of space to Salesforce.com in the second quarter of '17 and then we have 4 future delivery dates that extend into the fourth quarter of '18. We do not recognize revenue until the tenants have completed their build out on a floor by floor basis, even though we're going to be receiving cash rent. Our 2017 earning estimates continue to assume we're not going to record GAAP revenue from Salesforce.com's lease in 2017. Rent commencement on the other 4 tenant floors is likely to start in the fourth quarter with accompanying of capitalized interest but is offset by the startup of operating expenses and taxes for the whole building. When the building is fully leased with tenants and occupancy, which we expect to occur in '19, we anticipate an initial stabilized net operating income of between $80 million and $85 million. 
Our Mountain Dew activity continue to be very strong still. We're renewing our single story product at over $55 triple net, but occupancy gains are slower at 611 Gateway. We will start the year there with 186,000 square feet of availability and we're unlikely to see much incremental revenue from that space in '17. Going down the coast to our new market in West L.A. Activity there is robust and we anticipate signing leases for more than 200,000 square feet of our 380,000 -- 385,000 square feet of availability in the coming days and extending another 190,000 square feet. The West L.A. market has had a string of strong quarters of rental rate growth as it benefits from both the creativity and entrepreneurship of local content, creators and providers, the explosion of new content from new economy entertainment companies and the growing labor market for a number of San Francisco-based technology companies that are trying to broaden their workforce reach. Since July, the submarket has seen more than 400,000 square feet of signed leases and there's another 790,000 square feet of activities in the market including our transactions in process. Rent to move more than 10% for these large blocks of space since our purchase in July. 
I want to start my discussion in the New York region with our retail tenancy. At 250 West 55th, we have signed a lease for 55,000 square feet including the second floor with the operator of an experiential thematic visitor destination that expects to be opened by the end of 2017. Since the space needs to be improved, we have not included any revenue in our 2017 estimates while this space is lease. You will recall that our 2016 results included termination income equivalent to 4.5 years of rent. We expect to replace this income from this space after 23 months. At 757 Fifth, we have more clarity on the timing on the retail revenue from the various spaces. We expect to deliver this space to Under Armour in the second half of 2018. So going back, in 2014, prior to the termination of the FAO lease, when all of the retail was leased, we had about $64 million of revenue from the retail spaces at the General Motors Building. All the space is now committed, but in 2017, as we work through the transition, we will have about $51 million of revenue. In the second half of 2018, when the transition is complete, we anticipate an annual run rate of over $85 million of revenue with a pretty conservative protection for percentage rent from the tenants. We own 60% of this joint venture. We're not anticipating any office rent growth and probably slightly higher concessions around our midtown office portfolio in '17. The conditions we have been describing for the last 2 years remain in control. New supply continue to come into the market. The large financial players continue to shrink their cost structures and in certain instances, they've chosen to move to new owned facilities on the far West side, creating additional inventory. Landlords that are putting capital into older assets are attracting tenants. Major League Baseball at 1271 6th Avenue just took 400,000 square feet and Level at 390 Madison Avenue just took 250,000 square feet being the most recent example. The market is active for larger tenants in the mid-80s across midtown. While the market for space over $100 a square Foot obviously has less velocity. I think the most significant change in our Manhattan leasing is that we have seen a significant pickup in demand for our 2 floors, the available floors at 767 5th Avenue, which total about 80,000 square feet. We have a lease for 24,000 square feet out for execution. We actual expect it to get signed today and we have 3 other tenants looking at between 40,000 square feet and 20,000 Square feet. Again, we won't recognize revenue in '17 but the expected contribution is over $7.5 million from this 80,000 square feet. If you look at it statistically, there's actually been a significant amount of space leased at over $100,000 a square foot and that even excludes the lease at 425. More than in fact in 2015 but the typical relocation deal is still under 10,000 square feet. So you have to do a lot of deals to lease space. Our total New York regional activity in the third quarter was about 113,000 square feet. We're negotiating leases for 60,000 of our 87,000 square feet of 2017 rollover at $5.99. It's all price in the 80s and we expect to receive income from some of those spaces in '17. We completed the relocation of all of the tenants from the low rise at 159 East -- 1590 53rd Street. This was our 1 opportunity to dramatically rebuild the space in conjunction with our plan to reintroduce the public spaces. In order to complete the work, we took back 70,000 square feet in 2016, which resulted in termination payments and a rent roll down, which is why you see negative statistics in our supplemental in the New York region this quarter. When we made this decision to proceed with this investment in the late 2015, we recognize that we were going to be reducing the pro rata share of the revenue from the office space by about $5.5 million. That's we're experiencing in 2017. We're now marketing 195,000 market block of space that we hope to deliver to tenants in '18 with revenue commencing in '19. 
At 399 Park Avenue, we've commenced an extensive renovation and had lease about 204,000 square feet of the coming up rollover and we have another 500,000 square feet that is uncommitted including about 100,000 square feet of space that is currently rented at about $45 a square foot. The existing lease explorations from city and the law firm expiring August and September of '17 and while we expect to lease significant portions of the space during the year, we anticipate having to remove the existing improvement and may not have tenants in place with the revenue recognition until 2018. Our other New York City assets have very modest near-term exploration or vacancies. We've signed leases on negotiations ongoing that will create significant amounts of incremental income but the opportunities to drive '17 revenue are limited. 
Going down to D.C.. The D.C. CBD office market fundamentals have not experience much in the way of new demand generators and we haven't really seen any demonstrable positive change in the leasing markets. Landlords are competing on any available space, concessions in D.C. on leases of 10 years or more, typically include the year of free rent and more than $110 of tenant improvement allowance. D.C. is truly a forward leasing market for any sizable space. But there continues to be speculative buildings under construction, believe it or not, aging beauties that are being repositioned and 11 operational buildings with between 100,000 and 400,000 square feet of available space. That's the market we're dealing with. The GSA continue to have a very measured approach to its renewals and we're not aware of any requirements that are net generators of demand. We're negotiating some short-term renewals with the GSA for 196,000 square feet of our 2017 lease explorations. In spite of the challenging environment, we are chipping away at all of our availability with about half of 47,000 square feet of available space under negotiation at 601 Mac, that's the building that opened late last September, and we have another half a dozen leases under 15,000 square feet either signed or in active negotiations at other D.C. CBD assets. 
In Reston, we completed another 6 leases totaling 69,000 square feet, where the average starting rents spills in the mid-50s and we made 2 proposals to large users for our proposed new 270,000 square-foot signature development. Our Reston portfolio continues to be 97% leased, leaving us with a very small smattering of availability. There's actually been a pickup of activity at our VA 95 product, the product that Owen was describing and we're actually in negotiations with 2 tenants for between 53,000 square feet and 69,000 square feet of our availability there. We actually picked up another 31,000 square-foot tenant at our AJ6 building in Maryland. 
As Owen reported, we are close to executing a lease from approximately 476,000 square-foot office building on the site of our existing 97,000 square-foot office building, 145 Broadway. We are moving through the formal review process with the city of Cambridge. We anticipate vacating 145 Broadway during the second quarter of '17 and commencing construction soon after. We are eliminating, taking off the board, $2.3 million of income on an annualized basis until the building comes into service in December of 2019. This is captured in our 2017 projections. So you're starting to get the theme. The demand growth in our Boston suburban portfolio continue to outpace the other submarkets. This quarter, we completed 173,000 square feet of leases and we have more than 475,000 square feet of renewals and relocations with growing tenants in progress. High-quality spaces at a premium and we anticipate additional rent growth in '17. One of our negotiations is for our building at 173, which we took out of service in 2016 in order to complete a major refurbishment. We spent an incremental $16 million and expect to increase income by more than $1.2 million when the tenant takes initial occupancy during the third quarter of 2017. This is yet another example of us purposely forgoing current income in order to create higher long-term value. 
The Boston CBD market continue to be a lease exploration driven market with a steady flow of new technology companies. One of them are interesting phenomenon is that all the large users that have been entering the ""Innovation District"" or the seaport area, for the most part, traditional, tenants seeking new large blocks of space and most of the smaller and growing technology companies are located in the financial district, Uptown, which is what we call the North Station area or the Back Bay. During the quarter, we leased about 50,000 square feet in our CBD portfolio, but this month, we expect to complete 64,000 square feet of leasing at 888 Waltham Street. Again, I think the lease will get done in the next day or so, bringing us to 89% leased. We've signed 108,000 square feet at the Prudential Center, including 76,000 square feet of new tenants, bringing the occupancy in the Prudential Center to 98% and we've signed 54,000 square feet at 120 St. James, the low-rise portion of 200 Clarendon. As we discussed on our last call, 888 is not going to hit its stabilized run rate until November of 2017 when the occupied floors 4 through 10 or 154,000 square feet. And while we leased more than 1.2 million square feet at 200 Clarendon since we took possession in 2011 and it's a 1.6 million square foot building, we still have 120,000 square feet of low-rise space and 125,000 square feet of high rise. While the low-rise space is very attractive to nonfinancial tenants, the high-rise floors continue to be driven by traditional lease exploration driven users and the activity in this area has been less robust. We expect to lease a large portion of the space over the next 12 month but we're not projecting revenue in '17. 
In summary, we have executed on a significant portion of our plan and we have a significant amount of contractual revenues in both our operated properties and our development assets that will increase our earnings over the coming year. We've now executed on about $72 million of our $80 million bridge but we still have a few significant lease explorations that were part of that bridge that we still need to cover. And with that, I will turn the call over to Mike."
368278,404556925,1061614,"Boston Properties Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I'm just going to start with a couple of quick comments on our balance sheet and then, I'll jump to our earnings results and our guidance. We completed a significant transaction in the debt up markets this past quarter.",1696,"Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I'm just going to start with a couple of quick comments on our balance sheet and then, I'll jump to our earnings results and our guidance. We completed a significant transaction in the debt up markets this past quarter. We raised $1 billion 10 year bond issuance at 2.75% coupon. If you include the settlement of a portion of our hedges, the all in GAAP interest rate on that financing is 3.5%. We use the proceeds to repay 2 mortgages that had a weighted average GAAP interest rate of about 5.9%, so you will see the impact of the 240 basis points reduction show up as lower interest expense in our run rate going forward. Our cash balances have dropped to just over $400 million after the acquisition of Colorado Center, funding of our developments and the repayment of debt. We project our development spend to approach $1 billion through the end of 2017 and we anticipate either using our currently untapped line of credit or raising additional debt capital as a personal funding source. 
Our guidance currently assumes the use of our line so it's certainly possible that we may complete a new debt issuance and hold the cash short term which will be dilutive to our earnings guidance. With the run-up in treasury rates over the last couple of months, our borrowing cost for 10 years in the bond market is currently about 3.2%. If you assume a $500 million debt issuance at the beginning of 2017, it will reduce our 2017 earnings guidance by about $0.05 a share. The other major debt transaction that we have our eye on is the pending refinancing of our $1.6 billion mortgage on 767 Fifth Avenue that expires next October. This is a consolidated joint venture with our share being 60% and we expect to refinance it in the mortgage market. We currently account for this loan under fair value accounting, so the GAAP interest rate is only about 3%. With the mortgage market currently pricing comparable large loans in the mid-3% range, the refinancing will likely increase our GAAP interest expense. We've also entered into hedges for $450 million of this at a 10 year treasury rate of 2.60% that will impact the transaction. The current cash interest rate on the loan is 6%. So on a cash basis, we anticipate a significant reduction in the interest rate that should in inert to our cash flow. Our earnings for the quarter reported at $1.42 per share, which was $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our portfolio performed ahead of our expectations, generating NOI approximately $3 million above our projection due to a combination of rental revenue outperformance and operational expense savings. The majority of the revenue came from San Francisco where we completed a number of leases earlier than we projected, including some renewals with a strong roll up that we started a straight line upon signing. As you can see on our mark-to-market stats, we continue to experience dramatic rent roll ups in our activity in San Francisco. The outperformance of the portfolio was offset by a $1.8 million impairment we booked this quarter on a land parcel in suburban Maryland. This is the last parcel we own and a land assemblage we considered exiting over the past several years, having sold 2 other parcels and booking gains totaling $5.5 million. Our FFO guidance for the rest of 2016, up $5.97 to $5.99 represents an increase of $0.03 per share at the midpoint from last quarter's guidance. All of the increase M&A from the performance of the portfolio due primarily to leasing success in the Boston and San Francisco market. Our guidance now assumes our share of 2016 combined same property cash NOI growth of between 3.5% and 4% growth over 2015, which is at the high-end of our prior range. As you look at 2017, the most important factor to remember is the impact of the amount of termination income that we recorded in 2016. We project 2016 termination income of approximately $58 million. The lion share of this came from 1 large termination at 250 West 55th street and several at 601 Lexington Avenue where we needed to relocate tenants from the low-rise to the high-rise in order to allow our redevelopment to move ahead. Our 2017 guidance assumes only modest termination income. So this represents a loss of $0.31 per share of projected FFO from 2016 to 2017. 
In the portfolio, Doug described our activity New York City and Boston where we're successfully signing leases and letters of intent but much of the impact will be in '18. Although some of our leasing efforts will not result in immediate revenue recognition, we do assume solid growth in same property portfolio in 2017. In Boston, we've signed leases on virtually all of the vacant space at the Prudential Tower and we expect Italy and the rest of the Prudential shops releasing effort to be open and revenue generated by the first quarter. We also start to deliver floors to Putnam at 100 Federal Street and we expect moderate additional lease up at 200 Clarendon Street. In aggregate, our guidance assumes this activity at $17 million to $25 million of incremental NOI to 2017. In San Francisco, we've had a tremendous success both leasing up our vacancy and rolling up rents on renewals at Embarcadero Center this year. This was reflected in 2016 but will be even stronger in 2017 where we project an incremental $18 million to $25 million of NOI, equating to growth of more than 10% for the region. On a cash basis, the growth is even greater at the cash mark-to-market takes hold of our early renewal activity. The impact of the growth we're experiencing in Boston and San Francisco for both increased occupancy and a roll up to higher rental rate is projected to be partially offset by a decline in the contribution from the New York portfolio. The contribution from the Washington portfolio is projected to be relatively flat. As Doug described, in New York City, we will not see any real impact from the significant leasing we're doing at 767 Fifth Avenue and at 250 West 55th Street until 2018. We expect a temporary loss of income from 500,000 square feet of roll over at 399 Park Avenue at the second half of the year. Overall, our guidance assumes NOI from the New York City portfolio to be down $5 million to $10 million into 2017 from 2016. So in aggregate, our guidance assumes our share of combined same property NOI to grow between 2% and 3.5% in 2017 over 2016 and on a cash basis, we assume between 2% and 4% growth of our share of combined same property NOI over the same period. Our non-same property portfolio includes our [indiscernible] and the impact of taking buildings out of service for redevelopment. Our redevelopment projects include combined 159 East 53rd Street in New York, 145 Broadway in Cambridge and one of our suburban Boston assets, 191 Spring Street. We expect this redevelopments to generate an accretive development return on investment but in 2017 will result in a loss of approximately $8 million of NY compared to 2016. This includes both rental income as well as the expensing of demolition costs that we projected $4 million in 2016 and $7 million in 2017. 
On the positive side, we expect to generate NOI growth from a full year of the acquisition of Colorado Center and from our development deliveries. Though as Doug described, our development deliveries will be much more impactful to 2018 based upon the anticipated occupancy dates for our major pre-leases. In aggregate, our guidance assumes our non-same property portfolio will add an incremental $18 million to $30 million of NOI in 2017. The other area where we expect significant change on our earnings in 2017 is through lower interest expense from the combination of debt refinancing, completed in 2016 as well as higher capitalized interest associated with our development pipeline. Our guidance for 2017 assumes net interest expense of between $378 million and $391 million, which is a reduction of $21 million at the midpoint of 2016. We assume capitalized interest to be between $50 million and $60 million in 2017. 
So in summary, based on these assumptions, we project our 2017 funds from operation to be between $6.05 and $6.23. This is an increase of $0.16 per share from the midpoint of our 2016 projected FFO. At the midpoint, the increase in FFO over 2016 is the result of $0.23 per share of growth from our share of our combined same property portfolio, $0.14 per share of incremental NOI from development deliveries and acquisitions, $0.12 per share from lower interest expense, $0.01 per share from higher development and management services income that we project to be offset by a reduction and $0.03 per share from higher G&A expense and $0.31 per share of lower projected termination income. Again, the biggest item to consider when looking at our 2017 FFO growth is the impact of all the termination income that we recorded in 2016 that has not projected at anywhere near the same level in 2017. If you exclude the impact of termination income, our FFO per share at the midpoint of our guidance range is projected to be up 8.5% over 2016. 
I also want to make a quick comment on our dividends. Our estimate for 2016 tax before income before gains on sale is roughly in line with our current dividend rate of $2.60 per share. As we forecast the income generated from our development pipeline delivering over the next few years, combined with the anticipated organic growth in the portfolio and assuming moderating asset sales, our taxable income is projected to grow meaningfully. We've been working with our board on evaluating our dividend strategy and anticipate that our annual dividend will likely increase in both the short term and the longer-term to continue to match our flexible income to our dividend. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line up for questions?"

I mean, we clearly feel that we're going to make a profitable investment in Colorado Center, which is great and was certainly one of the objectives and the other objectives is to get us into the LA market, which we think will be attractive and an important market for the company over the long term. But we don't intend to go out and make new investments just to grow in L.A. Each investment that Colorado Center did, has to stand on its own and in our opinion, create attractive return for shareholders. And so when I think -- also if you look at the overall company, we entered the San Francisco market in the late '90s and it still is the smallest region of the 4 primary markets of the company and here we are, nearly 20 years later. So our intent is to grow, we view the investment in LA as strategic but we're going to wait for opportunities we, again think makes sense and pencil from a return perspective. So where we are in the market today, I don't think you should expect us to go out and purchase stabilize assets in more kind of cap rate environment. Those are not the kinds of things that we're going to be doing. We're going to be looking at new developments. We're going to be looking at assets that needs some repositioning or least up. Our focus will be on a handful of markets in West L.A. and I don't think you should put a confined timeframe on it like 6 months or 12 months.

I think the CMBS market has come back there very strong in the summertime after kind of a week volatile first quarter and beginning of second quarter.

So you got swap rates that are below treasury rates and then, you got -- for leverage rates that are 50% to 60%, the spreads are very, very tight on CMBS, so they're competitive. So I think now the light companies are trying to become more competitive and put out capital. They have more to put out by the end of the year, so I think it's pretty competitive.

I think in New York City, many landlords have taken the recipe that we've been working with for a number of years and prebuilding space and if you prebuild a suite, you're giving a lot more money in the space than you are when you're giving out allowance. But in theory, you're reducing the free rent concession significantly and/or improving your velocity. I described this transaction environment in Washington, D.C. It's pretty close to where it was last year. Maybe it's slightly higher. I think the greater San Francisco market is actually -- concessions have gone down a little bit in the sense that many tenants are sort of deciding that renewing in place on average is a more economical experience for them because of the cost associated with having to relocate. So if you have a tenant place, you can get away with a smaller concession than with a new tenant coming into that space. And then, in the Boston market, CBD probably had slight increase in its tenant improvement numbers, not significant, rent really hasn't become a factor in this market at all and our suburban market actually has seen a decrease overall in concessions because honestly, because of the stronger market and the availability of high-quality spaces is becoming limited."

That when you have a lease exploration tendency and they have a particular day on which their space is leasing, the market has become more flexible on meeting that date. So we were used to be that a bit of a stronger market, if you have a lease exploration in January 1, 2018, and the traditional 10 year deal was 12 months of free rent and $65 or $75 of TIs, that would be where the transaction package would be. Today, if you have a lease exploration on January 30 or February 1 or March 30 or April 1, you might get the same concession package but your rent commencement date will be a little bit drawn out. So effectively, your NER, if you want to call it that has gone down slightly but in reality, it's a way to meet the demand of the marketplace as opposed to actually increase concessions and I think that's the flexibility that's being required.

As usual, I'll cover our quarterly results, market conditions, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share of $0.01 ab",1804,"Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll cover our quarterly results, market conditions, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share of $0.01 above our prior guidance, primarily due to portfolio outperformance. We also increased our full year 2016 FFO per share projection by $0.03. For the quarter, we leased just under 900,000 square feet, which is below our historical averages. However, we have a very robust pipeline of in-service and development leasing activity, which we think will be signed before calendar year-end and which will bring our annual leasing for 2016 in line with or possibly above average. Our in-service portfolio occupancy is now 89.6%, which is down 120 basis points from the end of the second quarter, and this is due primarily to the addition of Colorado Center to the portfolio. We had another quarter of positive rent roll-ups in our leasing activity, with rental rates on leases that commenced in the third quarter up 6% on a gross basis and 8% on a net basis compared to prior lease. 
Now moving to the economy. U.S. economic growth continues to be positive but as we all know, it's been sluggish. Second quarter GDP growth has been revised up to 1.4%. It was 0.8% in the first quarter and estimates for all of '16 are 2% or less. The employment picture continues to improve gradually, with 156,000 jobs created in September and the unemployment rate has remained flat at 5%. Wages have perked up a bit, up 2.6%, though inflation remained low at 1.1% for the third quarter. 
Moving to capital markets. The 10-year U.S. Treasury has risen approximately 40 basis points to 1.75% from the lows in July which has sparked a seemingly harsh REIT market correction of 5.5 plus percent over the past month. Though the Fed is signaling one rate hike before year-end, further increases in the short to medium term we think will be tempered by low interest rates in the developed world, dollar strength, sluggish growth in the U.S. and low inflation. Given the growth in U.S. economy, office market nationally continue to improve, albeit more slowly. Net absorption was 8.7 million feet for the third quarter and the vacancy rate was flat to last quarter but improved 30 basis points from a year ago. Asking rents rose nearly 6% year-over-year and construction levels are up 6% year-over-year and are 2.3% of total stock, which is above the long-term average of 1.9% for the U.S. office market.
Moving to private real estate capital markets. We believe interest from primarily non-U.S. investors remains healthy for prime assets and gateway markets. However, transaction volumes are below 2015 levels and domestic institutional investors have been less of a factor in this segment of the market. Commodity assets are more difficult to sell, and there are fewer bidders for Class A trophies. There are, however, several examples of Class A assets continuing to sell for favorable prices in the third quarter. In Cambridge, 245 First Street, which is a 300,000 square foot office and lab building sold to a domestic pension fund adviser for $1,020 per square foot in a mid-4s cap rate. In San Francisco, a sovereign wealth fund purchased a minority position in 100 First Street and 303 Second Street for approximately $950,000 a square foot, which is a low 4s cap rate. And finally, in West L.A, 233 Wilshire was acquired by U.S. REIT in partnership with a sovereign wealth fund for $1,080 per square foot and a low to mid-4s cap rate. And there's a pipeline of additional deals in the West L.A. market we think with similar pricing metrics. We believe the relative stability of the U.S. market, given Brexit and other global turbulence, as well as the fact that U.S. cap rates spread to treasuries remain above long-term averages will provide a cushion for U.S. real estate valuations, particularly in our core markets.
So in summary, operating performance improvement in office remains positive but is later in the cycle and slowing slightly. Interest rates are up modestly but will likely remain low, and private capital flows into our space remain healthy, though somewhat diminished from previous quarters. Given this economic picture, we'll continue to take advantage of the reasonably healthy tenant demand and lease-up our existing vacancy and new developments. We'll focus our new your investment activity on new development and asset refurbishment in innovation centers where we see the strongest prospects for growth. We will also protect the downside by requiring pre-leasing for new office development, avoiding the purchase of stabilized assets at low cap rates, selectively selling assets and keeping our overall corporate leverage at conservative levels. 
Moving to the execution of our capital strategy. As you know, we completed the acquisition of Colorado Center in West L.A. last quarter. We've had very strong leasing activity at the project and are completing our redevelopment plan. We are also actively seeking to grow West L.A. into another major region for Boston Properties over the long term and are reviewing a number of on- and off-market opportunities. However, we will remain disciplined and patient and focus only on investments that create attractive returns for shareholders. 
Moving to dispositions. We recently completed with Blackstone the recapitalization of Metropolitan Square, which is a 620,000 square foot office building, 75% leased, located in close proximity to the White House in Washington, D.C. We've reduced our interest from 51% to 20% and will retain the leasing and management of the property. Pricing on a 100% basis was $360 million or $581 a square foot, and the building will likely require an additional $160 per square foot of capital to complete its repositioning. We realized $56 million of proceeds for the sale of our interest, net of existing financing, and we experienced a 14.2% leveraged IRR in the portion we sold over our 18-year period of ownership. We're also delighted to be developing a larger relationship with Blackstone through this transaction. 
We also closed in the third quarter the sale of a parcel in our Broad Run Business Park in Loudon County for $18 million. And finally, we've withdrawn from the market our VA 95 Business Park in Springfield, Virginia. During the marketing process, the major tenant in the park, U.S. Customs, issued an RFP for a consolidation in Northern Virginia. The result and uncertainty around retaining this tenant diminished investor interest in the asset that ultimately we could end up benefiting from the consolidation opportunity. We do not anticipate any additional sales in 2016, though we intend to continue to sell noncore assets in 2017, subject to market conditions. Including these transactions, in 2016, we will complete the monetization of 3 assets for total gross proceeds on an our share basis of $235 million, which is in line with projections provided at the beginning of the year. 
Moving to development. We remain active delivering assets in to service, advancing our predevelopment pipeline and evaluating new investments. In terms of starts for the quarter, we commenced the full redevelopment of the 220,000 square foot low-rise building at 601 Lexington Avenue. 195,000 square foot office component of the building is being renamed 159 East 53rd Street and will have a new dedicated street entrance and lobby providing branding opportunities for major tenants. The building is being re-clad, creating 30% more vision glass, a new high-efficiency HVAC system will be installed and access to the building's extensive and redesigned outdoor terraces will be improved. The 25,000 square foot retail atrium is also being completely redeveloped, with the prominent at grade entrance on 53rd Street and will house multiple dining amenities and a fitness center. Our share of the total budgeted cost of this project is $106 million and we forecast the yield on the office component to be in line with our target NOI yield of 7% for development. Returns on the retail and outdoor plaza components will be partially driven by the enhancements we realized in lease rate and velocity due to this new amenity for our 3 major office assets at the 53rd Street in Lexington Avenue. 
We also anticipate starting the development of an amenity building in the outdoor -- existing outdoor plaza at 100 Federal Street in Boston in the fourth quarter. We remain active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several updates from this quarter include: at Kendall Center in Cambridge, we're in the final stages of executing a lease with a major technology company to build their 476,000 square foot headquarters at 145 Broadway, which will require a demolition of an existing 80,000 square foot low-rise building on the site. Total budgeted development costs are $517 million or $1,086 per square foot with land at market value and the first year development NOI yield is projected to be approximately 7%. The project will not commence until 2017, and efforts continue on developing commitments and projects for the remaining 600,000 square feet of potential entitlements at Kendall Center. 
We're pursuing -- further, we're pursuing multiple new pre-lease development opportunities in the Washington, D.C. region, all of which are potential 2017 starts. On deliveries, this month, we delivered into service 1265 Main Street in Waltham, Mass. This -- the building, which we own in partnership with a local developer, is 115,000 square feet and 100% leased to C&J Clark. We're generating a 7.7% yield on our $26 million investment in this redevelopment. At the end of the third quarter, our development pipeline now consists of 8 new projects and 2 redevelopments, totaling 4 million square feet and $2.2 billion in projected costs. Our projected NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 50% pre-let. We expect the addition of these projects to our in-service portfolio to add materially to our company's growth over the next few years. 
So to conclude, we continue to remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for creating shareholder value in the quarters ahead. We have a clear and achievable plan to materially grow FFO through the development and delivery of new building, as well as the lease-up of existing assets for which we currently have a particularly strong backlog of potential leases. We selected noncore assets for sale to raise capital and ensure continued portfolio improvement. We have significant entitled and unentitled landholdings that will continue to push-through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet remained strong with conservative leverage, which will allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that present themselves in coming quarters. 
So let me turn the call over to Doug for a further review of our markets."
368278,404556925,1062050,"Boston Properties Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So this is the third quarter, and we introduced our 2017 earnings guidance last night, and I'm going to devote my time this morning to providing the operating background that's behind our estimates and to describe th",2832,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So this is the third quarter, and we introduced our 2017 earnings guidance last night, and I'm going to devote my time this morning to providing the operating background that's behind our estimates and to describe the key drivers of our occupancy and revenue growth over the short term, as well as those situations where we have in fact completed transactions, signed leases, but are not going to be recognizing any revenue until 2018, and there's a significant amount of that. 
In a number of instances, our estimates reflect investment and repositioning decisions that were made during the past 12 months, which have a direct impact on our 2017 GAAP revenues, and I want to take the time to provide the incremental impact of those decisions. So let me now give you some specifics on our regions, and I'll start with San Francisco. 
So during the first quarter, we completed 128,000 square feet of office leasing at Embarcadero Center, during the second quarter, 158,000 square feet of leases and during the third quarter, we completed an additional 219,000 square feet of leasing. All of these leases average a positive mark-to-market of more than 40% on a gross basis and 70% on a net basis, very consistent with the leasing spreads we've been reporting in our quarterly supplementals. The incremental revenue from the deals we've now signed in San Francisco since the third quarter of last year is over $16.5 million and will be at a full run rate starting in the third quarter of '17. The overall market conditions we've been describing in the last few quarters in the San Francisco CBD really remained the same. And while it may make a headline to write that the rate of activity in '16 is not going to be quite at the level as it was in '15, which by the way was just off the peak market of 2014, we actually think the real news is the stability of the market in San Francisco CBD. Each quarter, there continues to be a new crop of significant technology company lease expansions in addition to the traditional lease expiration-driven market demand. This quarter, Twitch signed a lease at 350 Bush for 185,000 square feet; Fitbit took over 300,000 square feet off the sublet market; Lift has taken over 280,000 square feet at 185 Berry; Adobe is in the market and expanding by 200,000 square feet; Slack, which started at our building at 680 Folsom in an 11,000 square-foot pre-build suite in 2014, is now looking for more than 200,000 square feet; and NerdWallet continues to be in the market for over 100,000 square feet. 
Continuing the trend we saw in the second quarter, high-quality, well-built sublet space is hitting the market and getting quickly absorbed and has really served the dominant large block availability. The largest block of sublet space in the market statistics last quarter was a 400,000 square-foot block at 211 Main, while Schwab renewed, so there's no more sublet availability. And the largest block of space on the market this quarter was up over at Twitter's buildings up on the upper market, and it appears now that space has been put under lease negotiations with a growing startup technology company. Sublet availability has remained flat, with growing technology expansions compensating for additional availability. Salesforce Tower is the tallest building in the city and we are now able to take prospective tenants up to the available floors and allow them to visually and physically experience the breadth of vision glass, the column-free floors, the volume of the slab-to-slab heights and the views. We have 5 floors under lease negotiations, which is what our expectation was for the year, and hope to have all of these leases signed by year-end. Only one full floor future prospect is actually located at Embarcadero Center, so it's all incremental in the demand. The structure of the building is up about 56 floors and we expect to have our first tenants in occupancy in late 2017. 
I've said this last quarter, but I want to repeat it again. We anticipate delivering the first block of space to Salesforce.com in the second quarter of '17, and then we have 4 future delivery dates that extend into the fourth quarter of '18. We do not recognize revenue until the tenants have completed their buildout on a floor-by-floor basis even though we're going to be receiving cash rent. Our 2017 earning estimates continue to assume we're not going to record GAAP revenue from Salesforce.com's lease in 2017. Rent commencement on the other 4 tenant floors is likely to start in the fourth quarter, with accompanying cessation of capitalized interest but is offset by the startup of operating expenses and taxes for the whole building. When the building is fully leased with tenants and occupancy, which we expect to occur in '19, we anticipate an initial stabilized net operating income of between $80 million and $85 million.
Our Mountain View activity continued to be very strong still. We're renewing our single story product at over $55 triple net, but occupancy gains are slower at 611 Gateway. We will start the year there with 186,000 square feet of availability and we're unlikely to see much incremental revenue from that space in '17. 
Going down the coast to our new market in West L.A. Activity there is robust and we anticipate signing leases for more than 200,000 square feet of our 380,000 -- 385,000 square feet of availability in the coming days and extending another 190,000 square feet. The West L.A. market has had a string of strong quarters of rental rate growth as it benefits from both the creativity and entrepreneurship of local content, creators and providers, the explosion of new content from new economy entertainment companies and the growing labor market for a number of San Francisco-based technology companies that are trying to broaden their workforce reach. Since July, the submarket has seen more than 400,000 square feet of signed leases, and there's another 790,000 square feet of activity in the market, including our transactions in process. Rents have moved more than 10% for these large blocks of space since our purchase in July. 
I want to start my discussion in the New York region with our retail tenancy. At 250 West 55th, we have signed a lease for 55,000 square feet, including the second floor, with the operator of an experiential thematic visitor destination that expects to be opened by the end of 2017. Since the space needs to be improved, we have not included any revenue in our 2017 estimates, but the space is leased. You will recall that our 2016 results included termination income equivalent to 4.5 years of rent. We expect to replace this income from this space after 23 months. At 767 Fifth, we have more clarity on the timing of the retail revenue from the various spaces. We expect to deliver this space to Under Armour in the second half of 2018. 
So going back, in 2014, prior to the termination of the FAO Schwarz lease when all of the retail was leased, we had about $64 million of revenue from the retail spaces at the General Motors Building. All the space is now committed, but in 2017, as we work through the transition, we will have about $51 million of revenues. In the second half of 2018, when the transition is complete, we anticipate an annual run rate of over $85 million of revenue, with a pretty conservative projection for percentage rent from the tenants. We own 60% of this joint venture. 
We're not anticipating any office rent growth and probably slightly higher concessions around our Midtown office portfolio in '17. The conditions we have been describing for the last few years remain in control. New supply continues to come into the market. The large financial players continue to shrink their cost structures, and in certain instances, they've chosen to move to new owned facilities on the far west side, creating additional inventory. Landlords that are putting capital into older assets are attracting tenants. Major League Baseball at 1271 6th Avenue just took 400,000 square feet and Hogan Lovells at 390 Madison Avenue just took 250,000 square feet being the most recent examples. The market is active for larger tenants in the mid-80s across midtown, while the market for space over $100 a square foot obviously has less velocity. I think the most significant change in our Manhattan leasing is that we have seen a significant pickup in demand for our 2 floors, the available floors at 767 Fifth Avenue, which total about 80,000 square feet. We have a lease for 24,000 square feet out for execution. We actually expect it get it signed today. And we have 3 other tenants looking at between 40,000 and 20,000 Square feet. Again, we won't recognize revenue in '17, but the expected contribution is over $7.5 million from this 80,000 square feet. If you look at it statistically, there's actually been a significant amount of space leased at over $100,000 a square foot, and that even excludes the Citadel lease at $425, more than, in fact, in 2015. But the typical relocation deal is still under 10,000 square feet, so you have to do a lot of deals to lease space. Our total New York regional activity in the third quarter was about 113,000 square feet. We're negotiating leases for 60,000 of our 87,000 square feet of 2017 rollover at $5.99. It's all price in the 80s and we expect to receive income from some of those spaces in '17. We've completed the relocation of all of the tenants from the low rise at 159 East  53rd Street. This was our one opportunity to dramatically rebuild the space in conjunction with our plan to reintroduce the public spaces. In order to complete the work, we took back 70,000 square feet in 2016, which resulted in termination payments and a rent roll-down, which is why you see negative statistics in our supplemental in the New York region this quarter. When we made this decision to proceed with this investment in the late 2015, we recognized that we were going to be reducing the pro rata share of the revenue from the office space by about $5.5 million. That's what we're experiencing in 2017. We're now marketing 195,000 square foot block of space that we hope to deliver to tenants in '18, with revenue commencing in '19. 
At 399 Park Avenue, we've commenced an extensive renovation and have leased about 204,000 square feet of the coming up rollover and we have another 0.5 million square feet that is uncommitted, including about 100,000 square feet of concourse space that's currently rented at about $45 a square foot. The existing lease expirations from Citi and the law firm expire in August and September of '17, and while we expect to lease significant portions of the space during the year, we anticipate having to remove the existing improvements and may not have tenants in place with the revenue recognition until 2018. Our other New York City assets have very modest near-term expirations or vacancies. We've signed leases or negotiations ongoing that will create significant amounts of incremental income, but the opportunities to drive '17 revenue are limited. 
Going down to D.C. The D.C. CBD office market fundamentals have not experienced much in the way of new demand generators and we haven't really seen any demonstrable positive change in the leasing markets. Landlords are competing on any available space and concessions in D.C. on leases of 10 years or more, typically include a year of free rent and more than $110 of tenant improvement allowance. D.C. is truly a forward-leasing market for any sizable space. But there continues to be speculative buildings under construction, believe it or not, aging beauties that are being repositioned and 11 operational buildings with between 100,000 and 400,000 square feet of available space. That's the market we're dealing with. The GSA continued to have a very measured approach to its renewals and we're not aware of any requirements that are net generators of demand. We're negotiating short-term renewals with the GSA for 196,000 square feet of our 2017 lease expirations. In spite of the challenging environment, we are chipping away at all of our availability with about half of 47,000 square feet of available space under negotiation at 601 Mass that's the building that opened late last September. And we have another half a dozen leases under 15,000 square feet, either signed or in active negotiations on other D.C. assets -- CBD assets. 
In Reston, we completed another 6 leases totaling 69,000 square feet, where the average starting rent still is in the mid-50s and we have made 2 proposals to large users for our proposed new 270,000 square foot signature development. Our Reston portfolio continues to be 97% leased, leaving us with a very small smattering of availability. There has actually been a pickup of activity at our VA 95 product, the product that Owen was describing, and we're actually in negotiations with 2 tenants for between 53,000 and 69,000 square feet of our availability there. And we also picked up another 31,000 square foot tenant at our AJ6 building in Maryland. 
As Owen reported, we are close to executing a lease for an approximately 476,000 square foot office building on the site of our existing 97,000 square foot office building, 145 Broadway. We are moving through the formal review process with the City of Cambridge. We anticipate vacating 145 Broadway during the second quarter of '17 and commencing construction soon after. We are eliminating, taking off the board, $2.3 million of income on annualized basis until the building comes into service in December of 2019. This is captured in our 2017 projections, so you're starting to get the theme. The demand growth in our Boston suburban portfolio continued to outpace the other submarkets. This quarter, we completed 173,000 square feet of leases and we have more than 475,000 square feet of renewals and relocations with growing tenants in progress. High-quality space is at a premium and we anticipate additional rent growth in '17. One of our negotiations is for our building at 170 Tracer Lane, which we took out of service in 2016 in order to complete a major refurbishment. We spent an incremental $16 million and expect to increase income by more than $1.2 million when the tenant takes initial occupancy during the third quarter of 2017. This is yet another example of us purposely forgoing current income in order to create higher long-term value. 
The Boston CBD market continued to be a lease expiration-driven market, with a steady flow of new technology companies. One of the more interesting phenomenon is that all the large users that have been entering the ""Innovation District"" or the seaport area are, for the most part, traditional [indiscernible] tenants seeking new large blocks of space, and most of the smaller and growing technology companies are located in the financial district, Uptown, which is what we call the North Station area or the Back Bay. During the quarter, we leased about 50,000 square feet in our CBD portfolio, but this month, we expect to complete 64,000 square feet of leasing at 888 Boylston Street. Again, I think the leases will get done in the next day or so, bringing us to 89% leased. We've signed 108,000 square feet at the Prudential Center, including 76,000 square feet of new tenants, bringing the occupancy in the Prudential Center to 98%, and we've signed 54,000 square feet at 120 St. James, the low-rise portion of 200 Clarendon. As we discussed on our last call, 888 is not going to hit its stabilized run rate until November of 2017 when Natixis occupied floors 4 through 10, or 154,000 square feet. And while we've leased more than 1.2 million square feet at 200 Clarendon since we took possession in 2011, and it's a 1.6 million square foot building, we still have 120,000 square feet of low-rise space and 125,000 square feet of high rise. While the low-rise space is very attractive to nonfinancial tenants, the high-rise floors continue to be driven by traditional lease expiration-driven users and the activity in this area has been less robust. We expect to lease a large portion of the space over the next 12 months, but we're not projecting revenue in '17. 
In summary, we've executed on a significant portion of our plan and we have a significant amount of contractual revenues in both our operating properties and our development assets that will increase our earnings over the coming years. We've now executed on about $72 million of our $80 million bridge, but we still have a few significant lease expirations that were part of that bridge that we will still need to cover. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Mike."
368278,404556925,1062050,"Boston Properties Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Great. Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I'm just going to start with a couple of quick comments on our balance sheet and then I'll jump to our earnings results and our guidance. We completed a significant transaction in the debt markets this past quarte",1687,"Great. Great. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I'm just going to start with a couple of quick comments on our balance sheet and then I'll jump to our earnings results and our guidance. We completed a significant transaction in the debt markets this past quarter. We raised $1 billion 10-year bond issuance at 2.75% coupon. If you include the settlement of a portion of our hedges, the all-in GAAP interest rate on that financing is 3.5%. We used the proceeds to repay 2 mortgages that had a weighted average GAAP interest rate of about 5.9%, so you will see the impact of the 240 basis point reduction show up as lower interest expense in our run rate going forward. Our cash balances have dropped to just over $400 million after the acquisition of Colorado Center, funding of our developments and the repayment of debt. We project our development spend to approach $1 billion through the end of 2017, and we anticipate either using our currently untapped line of credit or raising additional debt capital as a personal funding source. 
Our guidance currently assumes the use of our line, so it's certainly possible that we may complete a new debt issuance and hold the cash short term, which will be dilutive to our earnings guidance. With the run-up in treasury rates over the last couple of months, our borrowing cost for 10 years in the bond market is currently about 3.2%. If you assume a $500 million debt issuance at the beginning of 2017, it will reduce our 2017 earnings guidance by about $0.05 a share. The other major debt transaction that we have our eye on is the pending refinancing of our $1.6 billion mortgage on 767 Fifth Avenue that expires next October. This is a consolidated joint venture, with our share being 60%, and we expect to refinance it in the mortgage market. We currently account for this loan under fair value accounting, so the GAAP interest rate is only about 3%. With the mortgage market currently pricing comparable large loans in the mid-3% range, the refinancing will likely increase our GAAP interest expense. We've also entered into hedges for $450 million of this at a 10-year treasury rate of 2.62% that will impact the transaction. The current cash interest rate on the loan is 6%. So on a cash basis, we anticipate a significant reduction in the interest rate that should enter into our cash flow. 
Our earnings for the quarter were reported at $1.42 per share, which was $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our portfolio performed ahead of our expectations, generating NOI approximately $3 million above our projections due to a combination of rental revenue outperformance and operating expense savings. The majority of the revenue beat came from San Francisco, where we completed a number of leases earlier than we projected, including some renewals with strong roll-ups that we started to straight line upon signing. As you can see on our mark-to-market stats, we continue to experience dramatic rent roll-ups in our activity in San Francisco. 
The outperformance in the portfolio was offset by a $1.8 million impairment we booked this quarter on a land parcel in suburban Maryland. This is the last parcel we own in a land assemblage we've considered exiting over the past several years, having sold 2 other parcels and booking gains totaling $5.5 million. Our FFO guidance for the rest of 2016 of $5.97 to $5.99 represents an increase of $0.03 per share at the midpoint from last quarter's guidance. All of the increase emanates &A from the performance of the portfolio due primarily to leasing success in the Boston and San Francisco markets. Our guidance now assumes our share of 2016 combined same property cash NOI growth of between 3.5% and 4% over 2015, which is at the high end of our prior range. 
As you look at 2017, the most important factor to remember is the impact of the amount of termination income that we recorded in 2016. We project 2016 termination income of approximately $58 million. The lion's share of this came from one large termination at 250 West 55th street and several at 601 Lexington Avenue, where we needed to relocate tenants from the low-rise to the high-rise in order to allow our redevelopment to move ahead. Our 2017 guidance assumes only modest termination income, so this represents a loss of $0.31 per share of projected FFO from 2016 to 2017. 
In the portfolio, Doug described our activity in New York City and Boston, where we're successfully signing leases and letters of intent, but much of the impact will be in '18. Although some of our leasing efforts will not result in immediate revenue recognition, we do assume solid growth in same-property portfolio in 2017. In Boston, we've signed leases on virtually all of the vacant space at the Prudential Tower and we expect Eataly and the rest of the Prudential shops' releasing effort to be open and revenue-generating by the first quarter. We also start to deliver floors to Putnam at 100 Federal Street, and we expect moderate additional lease-up at 200 Clarendon Street. In aggregate, our guidance assumes this activity adds $17 million to $25 million of incremental NOI to 2017. 
In San Francisco, we've had a tremendous success, both leasing up our vacancy and rolling up rents on renewals at Embarcadero Center this year. This was reflected in 2016 but will be even stronger in 2017 where we project an incremental $18 million to $25 million of NOI, equating to growth of more than 10% for the region. On a cash basis, the growth is even greater as the cash mark-to-market takes hold on our early renewal activity. The impact of the growth we're experiencing in Boston and San Francisco from both increased occupancy and a roll-up to higher rental rate is projected to be partially offset by a decline in the contribution from the New York portfolio. The contribution from the Washington portfolio is projected to be relatively flat. As Doug described, in New York City, we will not see any real impact from the significant leasing we're doing at 767 Fifth Avenue and at 250 West 55th Street until 2018. We expect, a temporary loss of income from 500,000 square feet of rollover at 399 Park Avenue in the second half of the year. Overall, our guidance assumes NOI from the New York City portfolio to be down $5 million to $10 million into 2017 from 2016. So in aggregate, our guidance assumes our share of combined same property NOI to grow between 2% and 3.5% in 2017 over 2016. And on a cash basis, we assume between 2% and 4% growth of our share of combined same-property NOI over the same period. 
Our non-same property portfolio includes our development deliveries, acquisitions, dispositions and the impact of taking buildings out of service for redevelopment. Our redevelopment projects include 159 East 53rd Street in New York, 145 Broadway in Cambridge and one of our suburban Boston assets, 191 Spring Street. We expect this redevelopments to generate an accretive development return on investment, but in 2017, will result in the loss of approximately $8 million of NOI compared to 2016. This includes both lost rental income as well as the expensing of demolition costs that we projected $4 million in 2016 and $7 million in 2017. 
On the positive side, we expect to generate NOI growth from a full year of the acquisition of Colorado Center and from our development deliveries, though as Doug described, our development deliveries will be much more impactful to 2018 based upon the anticipated occupancy dates for our major pre-leases. In aggregate, our guidance assumes our non-same property portfolio will add an incremental $18 million to $30 million of NOI in 2017. 
The other area where we expect significant change on our earnings in 2017 is through lower-interest expense from the combination of debt refinancing completed in 2016 as well as higher capitalized interest associated with our development pipeline. Our guidance for 2017 assumes net interest expense of between $378 million and $391 million, which is a reduction of $21 million at the midpoint from 2016. We assume capitalized interest to be between $50 million and $60 million in 2017. 
So in summary, based on these assumptions, we project our 2017 funds from operation to be between $6.05 and $6.23. This is an increase of $0.16 per share from the midpoint of our 2016 projected FFO. At the midpoint, the increase in FFO over 2016 is the result of $0.23 per share of growth from our share of our combined same-property portfolio, $0.14 per share of incremental NOI from development deliveries and acquisitions, $0.12 per share from lower interest expense, $0.01 per share from higher development and management services income, so we project to be offset by a reduction and $0.03 per share from higher G&A expense and $0.31 per share of lower projected termination income. Again, the biggest item to consider when looking at our 2017 FFO growth is the impact of all the termination income that we recorded in 2016 that is not projected at anywhere near the same level in 2017. If you exclude the impact of termination income, our FFO per share at the midpoint of our guidance range is projected to be up 8.5% over 2016. 
I also want to make a quick comment on our dividends. Our estimate for 2016 taxable income before gains on sale is roughly in line with our current dividend rate of $2.60 per share. As we forecast the income generated from our development pipeline delivering over the next few years, combined with the anticipated organic growth in the portfolio and assuming moderating asset sales, our taxable income is projected to grow meaningfully. We've been working with our board on evaluating our dividend strategy and anticipate that our annual dividend will likely increase in both the short term and the longer-term to continue to match our taxable income to our dividend. 
That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line up for questions?"

But we don't intend to go out and make new investments just to grow in L.A. Each investment, as Colorado Center did, has to stand on its own and, in our opinion, create attractive return for shareholders. And so when I think -- and if you also look at the overall company, we entered the San Francisco market in the late '90s, and it still is the smallest region of the 4 primary markets of the company, here we are, nearly 20 years later. So our intent is to grow. We view the investment in L.A. as strategic, but we're going to wait for opportunities that, again, we think makes sense and pencil from a return perspective. And so where we are in the market today, I don't think you should expect us to go out and purchase stabilized assets in more kind of cap rate environment. Those are not the kinds of things that we're going to be doing. We're going to be looking at new developments, we're going to be looking at assets that need some repositioning or lease-up. Our focus will be on a handful of markets in West L.A. and I don't think you should put a confined timeframe on it, like 6 months or 12 months.

I think, in New York City, many landlords have taken the recipe that we've been working with for a number of years and prebuilding space. And if you prebuild a suite, you're giving a lot more money in the space than you are when you're giving out an allowance. But in theory, you're reducing the free rent concession significantly and/or improving your velocity. I described this sort of transaction environment in Washington, D.C. It's pretty close to where it was last year, maybe it's slightly higher. I think the greater San Francisco market is actually -- concessions have come down a little bit in the sense that many tenants are sort of deciding that renewing in place, on average, is a more economical experience for them because of the costs associated with having to relocate. So if you have a tenant in place, you can get away with a smaller concession than with a new tenant coming into that space. And then, in the Boston market, the CBD had probably slight increase in its tenant improvement numbers. Not significant, free rent really hasn't become a factor in this market at all, and our suburban market, actually, I think has seen a decrease, overall, in concessions because honestly, because of the stronger market and the availability of high-quality space is becoming limited."

So we were -- it used to be that in a bit of a stronger market, if you have a lease expiration on January 1, 2018, and the traditional 10-year deal was 12 months of free rent and $65 or $75 of TIs, that would be where the transaction package would be. Today, if you have a lease expiration on January 30 or February 1 or March 30 or April 1, you might get the same concession package, but your rent commencement date would be a little bit drawn out. So effectively, your NER, if you want to call it that, has gone down slightly but it's, in reality, just a way to meet the demand of the marketplace as opposed to actually increase concessions. And I think that's the flexibility that's being required. In addition, as I said before, Jed, there is more landlord-oriented work that is going on in Manhattan in the form of prebuilds or other landlord-required obligation to tenant spaces.

As usual, I'll cover our quarterly results, market conditions, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share of $0.01 ab",1803,"Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll cover our quarterly results, market conditions, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share of $0.01 above our prior guidance, primarily due to portfolio outperformance. We also increased our full year 2016 FFO per share projection by $0.03. For the quarter, we leased just under 900,000 square feet, which is below our historical averages. However, we have a very robust pipeline of in-service and development leasing activity, which we think will be signed before calendar year-end and which will bring our annual leasing for 2016 in line with or possibly above averages.  Our in-service portfolio occupancy is now 89.6%, which is down 120 basis points from the end of the second quarter, and this is due primarily to the addition of Colorado Center to the portfolio. We had another quarter of positive rent roll-ups in our leasing activity, with rental rates on leases that commenced in the third quarter up 6% on a gross basis and 8% on a net basis compared to prior lease. 
Now moving to the economy. U.S. economic growth continues to be positive, but as we all know, it's been sluggish. Second quarter GDP growth has been revised up to 1.4%. It was 0.8% in the first quarter and estimates for all of '16 are 2% or less. The employment picture continues to improve gradually, with 156,000 jobs created in September and the unemployment rate has remained flat at 5%. Wages have perked up a bit, up 2.6%, though inflation remained low at 1.1% for the third quarter. 
Moving to capital markets. The 10-year U.S. Treasury has risen approximately 40 basis points to 1.75% from lows in July which has sparked a seemingly harsh REIT market correction of 5.5 plus percent over the past month. Though the Fed is signaling one rate hike before year-end, further increases in the short to medium term we think will be tempered by low interest rates in the developed world's dollar strength, sluggish growth in the U.S. and low inflation. Given the growth in the U.S. economy, office market nationally continue to improve, albeit more slowly. Net absorption was 8.7 million feet for the third quarter and the vacancy rate was flat to last quarter but improved 30 basis points from a year ago. Asking rents rose nearly 6% year-over-year and construction levels are up 6% year-over-year and are 2.3% of total stock, which is above the long-term average of 1.9% for the U.S. office market.
Moving to private real estate capital markets. We believe interest from primarily non-U.S. investors remains healthy for prime assets and gateway markets. However, transaction volumes are below 2015 levels and domestic institutional investors have been less of a factor in this segment of the market. Commodity assets are more difficult to sell, and there are fewer bidders for Class A trophies. There are, however, several examples of Class A assets continuing to sell for favorable prices in the third quarter. In Cambridge, 245 First Street, which is a 300,000 square foot office and lab building sold to a domestic pension fund adviser for $1,020 per square foot in a mid-4s cap rate. In San Francisco, a sovereign wealth fund purchased a minority position in 100 First Street and 303 Second Street for approximately $950,000 a square foot, which is a low 4s cap rate. And finally, in West L.A, 233 Wilshire was acquired by U.S. REIT in partnership with a sovereign wealth fund for $1,080 per square foot and a low to mid-4s cap rate. And there's a pipeline of additional deals in the West L.A. market we think with similar pricing metrics. We believe the relative stability of the U.S. market, given Brexit and other global turbulence, as well as the fact that U.S. cap rates spread to treasuries remain above long-term averages will provide a cushion for U.S. real estate valuations, particularly in our core markets.
So in summary, operating performance improvement in office remains positive but is later in the cycle and slowing slightly. Interest rates are up modestly but will likely remain low, and private capital flows into our space remain healthy, though somewhat diminished from previous quarters. Given this economic picture, we'll continue to take advantage of a reasonably healthy tenant demand and lease-up our existing vacancy and new developments. We'll focus our new your investment activity on new development and asset refurbishment in innovation centers where we see the strongest prospects for growth. We will also protect the downside by requiring pre-leasing for new office development, avoiding the purchase of stabilized assets at low cap rates, selectively selling assets and keeping our overall corporate leverage at conservative levels. 
Moving to the execution of our capital strategy. As you know, we completed the acquisition of Colorado Center in West L.A. last quarter. We've had very strong leasing activity at the project and are completing our redevelopment plans.  We are also actively seeking to grow West L.A. into another major region for Boston Properties over the long term and are reviewing a number of on- and off-market opportunities. However, we will remain disciplined and patient and focus only on investments that create attractive returns for shareholders. 
Moving to dispositions. We recently completed with Blackstone, the recapitalization of Metropolitan Square, which is a 620,000 square foot office building, 75% leased, located in close proximity to the White House in Washington, D.C. We've reduced our interest from 51% to 20% and will retain the leasing and management of the property. Pricing on a 100% basis was $360 million or $581 a square foot, and the building will likely require an additional $160 per square foot of capital to complete its repositioning. We realized $56 million of proceeds for the sale of our interest, net of existing financing, and we experienced a 14.2% leveraged IRR in the portion we sold over our 18-year period of ownership. We're also delighted to be developing a larger relationship with Blackstone through this transaction. 
We also closed in the third quarter the sale of a parcel in our Broad Run Business Park in Loudon County for $18 million. And finally, we've withdrawn from the market our VA 95 Business Park in Springfield, Virginia. During the marketing process, the major tenant in the park, U.S. Customs, issued an RFP for a consolidation in Northern Virginia. The result and uncertainty around retaining this tenant diminished investor interest in the asset that ultimately we could end up benefiting from the consolidation opportunity. We do not anticipate any additional sales in 2016, though we intend to continue to sell noncore assets in 2017, subject to market conditions. Including these transactions, in 2016, we will complete the monetization of 3 assets for total gross proceeds on an our share basis of $235 million, which is in line with projections provided at the beginning of the year. 
Moving to development. We remain active delivering assets into service, advancing our predevelopment pipeline and evaluating new investments. In terms of starts for the quarter, we commenced the full redevelopment of the 220,000 square foot low-rise building at 601 Lexington Avenue. The 195,000 square foot office component of the building is being renamed 159 East 53rd Street and will have a new dedicated street entrance and lobby, providing branding opportunities for a major tenant.  The building is being re-clad, creating 30% more vision glass, a new high-efficiency HVAC system will be installed and access to the building's extensive and redesigned outdoor terraces will be improved. The 25,000 square foot retail atrium is also being completely redeveloped, with a prominent at grade entrance on 53rd Street and will house multiple dining amenities and a fitness center. Our share of the total budgeted cost of this project is $106 million and we forecast the yield on the office component to be in line with our target NOI yield of 7% for development. Returns on the retail and outdoor plaza components will be partially driven by the enhancements we realize in lease rate and velocity due to this new amenity for our 3 major office assets at 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue. 
We also anticipate starting the development of an amenity building in the outdoor -- existing outdoor plaza at 100 Federal Street in Boston in the fourth quarter. We remain active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several updates from this quarter include: at Kendall Center in Cambridge, we're in the final stages of executing a lease with a major technology company to build their 476,000 square foot headquarters at 145 Broadway, which will require demolition of an existing 80,000 square foot low-rise building on the site. Total budgeted development costs are $517 million or $1,086 per square foot with land at market value and the first year development NOI yield is projected to be approximately 7%. The project will not commence until 2017, and efforts continue on developing commitments and projects for the remaining 600,000 square feet of potential entitlements at Kendall Center. 
We're pursuing -- further, we're pursuing multiple new pre-lease development opportunities in the Washington, D.C. region, all of which are potential 2017 starts. On deliveries, this month, we delivered into service 1265 Main Street in Waltham, Mass. This -- the building, which we own in partnership with a local developer, is 115,000 square feet and 100% leased to C&J Clark. We're generating a 7.7% yield on our $26 million investment in this redevelopment. At the end of the third quarter, our development pipeline now consists of 8 new projects and 2 redevelopments, totaling 4 million square feet and $2.2 billion in projected costs. Our projected NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 50% pre-let. We expect the addition of these projects to our in-service portfolio to add materially to our company's growth over the next 3 years. 
So to conclude, we continue to remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for creating shareholder value in the quarters ahead. We have a clear and achievable plan to materially grow FFO through the development and delivery of new building, as well as the lease-up of existing assets for which we currently have a particularly strong backlog of potential leases. We selected noncore assets for sale to raise capital and ensure continued portfolio improvement. We have significant entitled and unentitled landholdings that we'll continue to push-through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet remains strong with conservative leverage, which will allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that present themselves in coming quarters. 
So let me turn the call over to Doug for a further review of our markets."

So this is the third quarter, and we introduced our 2017 earnings guidance last night, and I'm going to devote my time this morning to providing the operating background that's behind our estimates and to describe th",2835,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So this is the third quarter, and we introduced our 2017 earnings guidance last night, and I'm going to devote my time this morning to providing the operating background that's behind our estimates and to describe the key drivers of our occupancy and revenue growth over the short term, as well as those situations where we have in fact completed transactions, signed leases, but are not going to be recognizing any revenue until 2018, and there's a significant amount of that. 
In a number of instances, our estimates reflect investment and repositioning decisions that were made during the past 12 months, which have a direct impact on our 2017 GAAP revenues, and I want to take the time to provide the incremental impact of those decisions. So let me now give you some specifics on our regions, and I'll start with San Francisco. 
So during the first quarter, we completed 128,000 square feet of office leasing at Embarcadero Center, during the second quarter, 158,000 square feet of leases and during the third quarter, we completed an additional 219,000 square feet of leasing. All of these leases average a positive mark-to-market of more than 40% on a gross basis and 70% on a net basis, very consistent with the leasing spreads we've been reporting in our quarterly supplementals. The incremental revenue from the deals we've now signed in San Francisco since the third quarter of last year is over $16.5 million and will be at a full run rate starting in the third quarter of '17. The overall market conditions we've been describing in the last few quarters in the San Francisco CBD really remain the same. And while it may make a headline to write that the rate of activity in '16 is not going to be quite at the level as it was in '15, which by the way was just off the peak market of 2014, we actually think the real news is the stability of the market in San Francisco CBD. Each quarter, there continues to be a new crop of significant technology company lease expansions in addition to the traditional lease expiration-driven market demand. This quarter, Twitch signed a lease at 350 Bush for 185,000 square feet; Fitbit took over 300,000 square feet off the sublet market; Lyft has taken over 280,000 square feet at 185 Berry; Adobe is in the market and expanding by 200,000 square feet; Slack, which started at our building at 680 Folsom in an 11,000 square-foot pre-built suite in 2014, is now looking for more than 200,000 square feet; and NerdWallet continues to be in the market for over 100,000 square feet. 
Continuing the trend we saw in the second quarter, high-quality, well-built sublet space is hitting the market and getting quickly absorbed and has really served the dominant large block availability. The largest block of sublet space in the market statistics last quarter was a 400,000 square-foot block at 211 Main, while Schwab renewed, so there's no more sublet availability. And the largest block of space on the market this quarter was up over at Twitter's buildings up on the upper market, and it appears now that space has been put under lease negotiation with a growing startup technology company. Sublet availability has remained flat, with growing technology expansions compensating for additional availability. Salesforce Tower is the tallest building in the city and we are now able to take prospective tenants up to the available floors and allow them to visually and physically experience the breadth of vision glass, the column-free floors, the volume of the slab-to-slab heights and the views. We have 5 floors under lease negotiation, which is what our expectation was for the year, and hope to have all of these leases signed by year-end. Only one full floor future prospect is actually located at Embarcadero Center, so it's all incremental in the demand. The structure of the building is up about 56 floors and we expect to have our first tenants in occupancy in late 2017. 
I said this last quarter, but I want to repeat it again. We anticipate delivering the first block of space to Salesforce.com in the second quarter of '17, and then we have 4 future delivery dates that extend into the fourth quarter of '18. We do not recognize revenue until the tenants have completed their buildout on a floor-by-floor basis even though we're going to be receiving cash rent. Our 2017 earning estimates continue to assume we're not going to record GAAP revenue from Salesforce.com's lease in 2017. Rent commencement on the other 4 tenant floors is likely to start in the fourth quarter, with accompanying cessation of capitalized interest, but is offset by the startup of operating expenses and taxes for the whole building. When the building is fully leased with tenants and occupancy, which we expect to occur in '19, we anticipate an initial stabilized net operating income of between $80 million and $85 million.
Our Mountain View activity continues to be very strong still. We're renewing our single story product at over $55 triple net, but occupancy gains are slower out at 611 Gateway. We will start the year there with 186,000 square feet of availability and we're unlikely to see much incremental revenue from that space in '17. 
Going down the coast to our new market in West L.A. Activity there is robust and we anticipate signing leases for more than 200,000 square feet of our 380,000 -- 385,000 square feet of availability in the coming days and extending another 190,000 square feet. The West L.A. market has had a string of strong quarters of rental rate growth as it benefits from both the creativity and entrepreneurship of local content, creators and providers, the explosion of new content from new economy entertainment companies and the growing labor market for a number of San Francisco-based technology companies that are trying to broaden their workforce reach. Since July, the submarket has seen more than 400,000 square feet of signed leases, and there's another 790,000 square feet of activity in the market, including our transactions in process. Rents have moved more than 10% for these large blocks of space since our purchase in July. 
I want to start my discussion in the New York region with our retail tenancy. At 250 West 55th, we have signed a lease for 55,000 square feet, including the second floor, with the operator of an experiential thematic visitor destination that expects to be opened by the end of 2017. Since the space needs to be improved, we have not included any revenue in our 2017 estimates, but the space is leased. You will recall that our 2016 results included termination income equivalent to 4.5 years of rent. We expect to replace this income from this space after 23 months. At 767 Fifth, we have more clarity on the timing of the retail revenue from the various spaces. We expect to deliver this space to Under Armour in the second half of 2018. 
So going back, in 2014, prior to the termination of the FAO Schwarz lease when all of the retail was leased, we had about $64 million of revenue from the retail spaces at the General Motors Building. All the space is now committed, but in 2017, as we work through the transition, we will have about $51 million of revenues. In the second half of 2018, when the transition is complete, we anticipate an annual run rate of over $85 million of revenue, with a pretty conservative projection for percentage rent from the tenants. We own 60% of this joint venture. 
We're not anticipating any office rent growth and probably slightly higher concessions around our Midtown office portfolio in '17. The conditions we have been describing for the last few years remain in control. New supply continues to come into the market. The large financial players continue to shrink their cost structures, and in certain instances, they've chosen to move to new owned facilities on the far west side, creating additional inventory. Landlords that are putting capital into older assets are attracting tenants. Major League Baseball at 1271 6th Avenue just took 400,000 square feet and Hogan Lovells at 390 Madison Avenue just took 250,000 square feet, being the most recent examples. The market is active for larger tenants in the mid-80s across midtown, while the market for space over $100 a square foot obviously has less velocity. I think the most significant change in our Manhattan leasing is that we have seen a significant pickup in demand for our 2 floors, the available floors at 767 Fifth Avenue, which total about 80,000 square feet. We have a lease for 24,000 square feet out for execution. We actually expect it get it signed today. And we have 3 other tenants looking at between 40,000 and 20,000 Square feet. Again, we won't recognize revenue in '17, but the expected contribution is over $7.5 million from this 80,000 square feet. If you look at it statistically, there's actually been a significant amount of space leased at over $100 a square foot, and that even excludes the Citadel lease at $425, more than, in fact, in 2015. But the typical relocation deal is still under 10,000 square feet, so you have to do a lot of deals to lease space. Our total New York regional activity in the third quarter was about 113,000 square feet. We're negotiating leases for 60,000 of our 87,000 square feet of 2017 rollover at 599. It's all priced in the 80s, and we expect to receive income from some of those spaces in '17. We completed the relocation of all of the tenants from the low rise at 159 East 53rd Street. This was our one opportunity to dramatically rebuild the space in conjunction with our plan to reintroduce the public spaces. In order to complete the work, we took back 70,000 square feet in 2016, which resulted in termination payments and a rent roll-down, which is why you see negative statistics in our supplemental in the New York region this quarter. When we made this decision to proceed with this investment in late 2015, we recognized that we were going to be reducing the pro rata share of the revenue from the office space by about $5.5 million. That's what we're experiencing in 2017. We're now marketing 195,000 square foot block of space that we hope to deliver to tenants in '18, with revenue commencing in '19. 
At 399 Park Avenue, we've commenced an extensive renovation and have leased about 204,000 square feet of the coming up rollover and we have another 0.5 million square feet that is uncommitted, including about 100,000 square feet of concourse space that's currently rented at about $45 a square foot. The existing lease expirations from Citi and the law firm expire in August and September of '17, and while we expect to lease significant portions of the space during the year, we anticipate having to remove the existing improvements and may not have tenants in place with the revenue recognition until 2018. Our other New York City assets have very modest near-term expirations or vacancies. We've signed leases or negotiations are ongoing that will create significant amounts of incremental income, but the opportunities to drive '17 revenue are limited. 
Going down to D.C. The D.C. CBD office market fundamentals have not experienced much in the way of new demand generators and we haven't really seen any demonstrable positive change in the leasing markets. Landlords are competing on any available space and concessions in D.C. on leases of 10 years or more, typically include a year of free rent and more than $110 of tenant improvement allowances.  D.C. is truly a forward-leasing market for any sizable space. But there continues to be speculative buildings under construction, believe it or not, aging beauties that are being repositioned and 11 operational buildings with between 100,000 and 400,000 square feet of available space. That's the market we're dealing with. The GSA continues to have a very measured approach to its renewals and we're not aware of any requirements that are net generators of demand. We're negotiating short-term renewals with the GSA for 196,000 square feet of our 2017 lease expirations. In spite of the challenging environment, we are chipping away at all of our availability with about half of 47,000 square feet of available space under negotiation at 601 Mass.  That's the building that opened late last September. And we have another half a dozen leases under 15,000 square feet, either signed or in active negotiations on other D.C. assets -- CBD assets. 
In Reston, we completed another 6 leases totaling 69,000 square feet, where the average starting rent still is in the mid-50s and we have made 2 proposals to large users for our proposed new 270,000 square foot signature development. Our Reston portfolio continues to be 97% leased, leaving us with a very small smattering of availability. There has actually been a pickup of activity at our VA 95 product, the product that Owen was describing, and we're actually in negotiations with 2 tenants for between 53,000 and 69,000 square feet of our availability there. And we also picked up another 31,000 square foot tenant at our AJ6 building in Maryland. 
As Owen reported, we are close to executing a lease for an approximately 476,000 square foot office building on the site of our existing 97,000 square foot office building, 145 Broadway. We are moving through the formal review process with the City of Cambridge. We anticipate vacating 145 Broadway during the second quarter of '17 and commencing construction soon after. We are eliminating, taking off the board, $2.3 million of income on an annualized basis until the building comes into service in December of 2019. This is captured in our 2017 projections, so you're starting to get the theme. The demand growth in our Boston suburban portfolio continues to outpace the other submarkets. This quarter, we completed 173,000 square feet of leases and we have more than 475,000 square feet of renewals and relocations with growing tenants in progress. High-quality space is at a premium and we anticipate additional rent growth in '17. One of our negotiations is for our building at 170 Tracer Lane, which we took out of service in 2016 in order to complete a major refurbishment. We spent an incremental $16 million and expect to increase the income by more than $1.2 million when the tenant takes initial occupancy during the third quarter of 2017. This is yet another example of us purposely forgoing current income in order to create higher long-term value. 
The Boston CBD market continues to be a lease expiration-driven market, with a steady flow of new technology companies. One of the more interesting phenomena is that all the large users that have been entering the ""Innovation District"" or the seaport area are, for the most part, traditional FIRREA tenants seeking new large blocks of space, and most of the smaller and growing technology companies are located in the financial district, Uptown, which is what we call the North Station area or the Back Bay. During the quarter, we leased about 50,000 square feet in our CBD portfolio, but this month, we expect to complete 64,000 square feet of leasing at 888 Boylston Street. Again, I think those leases will get done in the next day or so, bringing us to 89% leased. We've signed 108,000 square feet at the Prudential Center, including 76,000 square feet of new tenants, bringing the occupancy in the Prudential Center to 98%, and we've signed 54,000 square feet at 120 St. James, the low-rise portion of 200 Clarendon. As we discussed on our last call, 888 is not going to hit its stabilized run rate until November of 2017 when Natixis occupies floors 4 through 10, or 154,000 square feet. And while we've leased more than 1.2 million square feet at 200 Clarendon since we took possession in 2011, and it's a 1.6 million square foot building, we still have 120,000 square feet of low-rise space and 125,000 square feet of high rise. While the low-rise space is very attractive to nonfinancial tenants, the high-rise floors continue to be driven by traditional lease expiration-driven users and the activity in this area has been less robust. We expect to lease a large portion of the space over the next 12 months, but we're not projecting revenue in '17. 
In summary, we've executed on a significant portion of our plan and we have a significant amount of contractual revenues in both our operating properties and our development assets that will increase our earnings over the coming years. We've now executed on about $72 million of our $80 million bridge, but we still have a few significant lease expirations that were part of that bridge that we will still need to cover. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Mike."
368278,404556925,1062372,"Boston Properties Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Great.   Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I'm just going to start with a couple of quick comments on our balance sheet and then I'll jump to our earnings results and our guidance. We completed a significant transaction in the debt markets this past quarter. We",1686,"Great.   Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I'm just going to start with a couple of quick comments on our balance sheet and then I'll jump to our earnings results and our guidance. We completed a significant transaction in the debt markets this past quarter. We raised $1 billion 10-year bond issuance at 2.75% coupon. If you include the settlement of a portion of our hedges, the all-in GAAP interest rate on that financing is 3.5%. We used the proceeds to repay 2 mortgages that had a weighted average GAAP interest rate of about 5.9%, so you will see the impact of the 240 basis point reduction show up as lower interest expense in our run rate going forward. Our cash balances have dropped to just over $400 million after the acquisition of Colorado Center, funding of our developments and the repayment of debt. We project our development spend to approach $1 billion through the end of 2017, and we anticipate either using our currently untapped line of credit or raising additional debt capital as a personal funding source. 
Our guidance currently assumes the use of our line, so it's certainly possible that we may complete a new debt issuance and hold the cash short term, which would be dilutive to our earnings guidance. With the run-up in treasury rates over the last couple of months, our borrowing cost for 10 years in the bond market is currently about 3.2%. If you assume a $500 million debt issuance at the beginning of 2017, it would reduce our 2017 earnings guidance by about $0.05 a share. The other major debt transaction that we have our eye on is the pending refinancing of our $1.6 billion mortgage on 767 Fifth Avenue that expires next October. This is a consolidated joint venture, with our share being 60%, and we expect to refinance it in the mortgage market. We currently account for this loan under fair value accounting, so the GAAP interest rate is only about 3%. With the mortgage market currently pricing comparable large loans in the mid-3% range, the refinancing will likely increase our GAAP interest expense. We've also entered into hedges for $450 million of this at a 10-year treasury rate of 2.62% that will impact the transaction. The current cash interest rate on the loan is 6%. So on a cash basis, we anticipate a significant reduction in the interest rate that should enter into our cash flow. 
Our earnings for the quarter were reported at $1.42 per share, which was $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our portfolio performed ahead of our expectations, generating NOI approximately $3 million above our projections due to a combination of rental revenue outperformance and operating expense savings. The majority of the revenue beat came from San Francisco, where we completed a number of leases earlier than we projected, including some renewals with strong roll-ups that we started to straight line upon signing. As you can see on our mark-to-market stats, we continue to experience dramatic rent roll-ups in our activity in San Francisco. 
The outperformance in the portfolio was offset by a $1.8 million impairment we booked this quarter on a land parcel in suburban Maryland. This is the last parcel we own in a land assemblage we've considered exiting over the past several years, having sold 2 other parcels and booking gains totaling $5.5 million. Our FFO guidance for the rest of 2016 of $5.97 to $5.99 represents an increase of $0.03 per share at the midpoint from last quarter's guidance. All of the increase emanates from the performance of the portfolio due primarily to leasing success in the Boston and San Francisco markets. Our guidance now assumes our share of 2016 combined same property cash NOI growth of between 3.5% and 4% over 2015, which is at the high end of our prior range. 
As you look at 2017, the most important factor to remember is the impact of the amount of termination income that we recorded in 2016. We project 2016 termination income of approximately $58 million. The lion's share of this came from one large termination at 250 West 55th street and several at 601 Lexington Avenue, where we needed to relocate tenants from the low-rise to the high-rise in order to allow our redevelopment to move ahead. Our 2017 guidance assumes only modest termination income, so this represents a loss of $0.31 per share of projected FFO from 2016 to 2017. 
In the portfolio, Doug described our activity in New York City and Boston, where we're successfully signing leases and letters of intent, but much of the impact will be in '18. Although some of our leasing efforts will not result in immediate revenue recognition, we do assume solid growth in same-property portfolio in 2017. In Boston, we've signed leases on virtually all of the vacant space at the Prudential Tower and we expect Eataly and the rest of the Prudential shops' releasing effort to be open and revenue-generating by the first quarter. We also start to deliver floors to Putnam at 100 Federal Street, and we expect moderate additional lease-up at 200 Clarendon Street. In aggregate, our guidance assumes this activity adds $17 million to $25 million of incremental NOI to 2017. 
In San Francisco, we've had a tremendous success, both leasing up our vacancy and rolling up rents on renewals at Embarcadero Center this year. This was reflected in 2016 but will be even stronger in 2017 where we project an incremental $18 million to $25 million of NOI, equating to growth of more than 10% for the region. On a cash basis, the growth is even greater as the cash mark-to-market takes hold on our early renewal activity. The impact of the growth we're experiencing in Boston and San Francisco from both increased occupancy and a roll-up to higher rental rates is projected to be partially offset by a decline in the contribution from the New York portfolio. The contribution from the Washington portfolio is projected to be relatively flat. As Doug described, in New York City, we will not see any real impact from the significant leasing we're doing at 767 Fifth Avenue and at 250 West 55th Street until 2018. We expect a temporary loss of income from 500,000 square feet of rollover at 399 Park Avenue in the second half of the year. Overall, our guidance assumes NOI from the New York City portfolio to be down $5 million to $10 million into 2017 from 2016. So in aggregate, our guidance assumes our share of combined same property NOI to grow between 2% and 3.5% in 2017 over 2016. And on a cash basis, we assume between 2% and 4% growth of our share of combined same-property NOI over the same period. 
Our non-same property portfolio includes our development deliveries, acquisitions, dispositions and the impact of taking buildings out of service for redevelopment. Our redevelopment projects include 159 East 53rd Street in New York, 145 Broadway in Cambridge and one of our suburban Boston assets, 191 Spring Street. We expect these redevelopments to generate an accretive development return on investment, but in 2017, will result in the loss of approximately $8 million of NOI compared to 2016. This includes both lost rental income as well as the expensing of demolition costs that we project at $4 million in 2016 and $7 million in 2017. 
On the positive side, we expect to generate NOI growth from a full year of the acquisition of Colorado Center and from our development deliveries, though as Doug described, our development deliveries will be much more impactful to 2018 based upon the anticipated occupancy dates for our major pre-leases. In aggregate, our guidance assumes our non-same property portfolio will add an incremental $18 million to $30 million of NOI in 2017. 
The other area where we expect significant change on our earnings in 2017 is through lower-interest expense from the combination of debt refinancing completed in 2016 as well as higher capitalized interest associated with our development pipeline. Our guidance for 2017 assumes net interest expense of between $378 million and $391 million, which is a reduction of $21 million at the midpoint from 2016. We assume capitalized interest to be between $50 million and $60 million in 2017. 
So in summary, based on these assumptions, we project our 2017 funds from operation to be between $6.05 and $6.23. This is an increase of $0.16 per share from the midpoint of our 2016 projected FFO. At the midpoint, the increase in FFO over 2016 is the result of $0.23 per share of growth from our share of our combined same-property portfolio, $0.14 per share of incremental NOI from development deliveries and acquisitions, $0.12 per share from lower interest expense, $0.01 per share from higher development and management services income, so we project to be offset by a reduction and $0.03 per share from higher G&A expense and $0.31 per share of lower projected termination income. Again, the biggest item to consider when looking at our 2017 FFO growth is the impact of all the termination income that we recorded in 2016 that is not projected at anywhere near the same level in 2017. If you exclude the impact of termination income, our FFO per share at the midpoint of our guidance range is projected to be up 8.5% over 2016. 
I also want to make a quick comment on our dividends. Our estimate for 2016 taxable income before gains on sale is roughly in line with our current dividend rate of $2.60 per share. As we forecast the income generated from our development pipeline delivering over the next few years, combined with the anticipated organic growth in the portfolio and assuming moderating asset sales, our taxable income is projected to grow meaningfully. We've been working with our board on evaluating our dividend strategy and anticipate that our annual dividend will likely increase in both the short term and the longer-term to continue to match our taxable income to our dividend. 
That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line up for questions?"

I mean, we clearly feel that we're going to make a profitable investment in Colorado Center, which is great and was certainly one of the objectives, and the other objectives was to get us into the L.A. market, which we think will be an attractive and an important market for the company over the long term. But we don't intend to go out and make new investments just to grow in L.A. Each investment, as Colorado Center did, has to stand on its own and, in our opinion, create attractive return for shareholders. And so when I think -- and if you also look at the overall company, we entered the San Francisco market in the late '90s, and it still is the smallest region of the 4 primary markets of the company, here we are, nearly 20 years later. So our intent is to grow. We view the investment in L.A. as strategic, but we're going to wait for opportunities that, again, we think make sense and pencil from a return perspective. And so where we are in the market today, I don't think you should expect us to go out and purchase stabilized assets in more of a kind of cap rate environment. Those are not the kinds of things that we're going to be doing. We're going to be looking at new developments, we're going to be looking at assets that need some repositioning or lease-up. Our focus will be on a handful of markets in West L.A. and I don't think you should put a confined timeframe on it, like 6 months or 12 months.

I think that the CMBS market has come back very strong in the summertime after kind of a weak volatile first quarter and beginning of the second quarter.

You've got swap rates that are below treasury rates and you got -- for leverage rates that are 50% to 60%, the spreads are very, very tight on CMBS, so they're competitive. So I think now the life companies are trying to become more competitive and put out capital. They have more to put out by the end of the year, so I think it's pretty competitive. And I think that when we look at 767 Fifth Avenue, that's a big loan. That is going to be more aligned with the CMBS market, I would imagine, because you would have to put together many other life companies to put that together, given its size and the fact that most life companies are maxing out at a couple of hundred to maybe $400 million at most. Or we could do of large kind of bank loan transaction, which is actually what we have today when we originally did the deal."

I think, in New York City, many landlords have taken the recipe that we've been working with for a number of years and prebuilding space. And if you prebuild a suite, you're giving a lot more money in the space than you are when you're giving an allowance. But in theory, you're reducing the free rent concession significantly and/or improving your velocity. I described this sort of transaction environment in Washington, D.C. It's pretty close to where it was last year, maybe it's slightly higher. I think the greater San Francisco market it's up actually -- concessions have come down a little bit in the sense that many tenants are sort of deciding that renewing in place, on average, is a more economical experience for them because of the costs associated with having to relocate. So if you have a tenant in place, you can get away with a smaller concession than with a new tenant coming into that space. And then, in the Boston market, the CBD has probably had a slight increase in its tenant improvement numbers, not significant.  Free rent really hasn't become a factor in this market at all, and our suburban market, actually, I think has seen a decrease, overall, in concessions because honestly, because of the stronger market and the availability of high-quality space is becoming limited."

So I think the way the market is working is that when you have -- and most of the Midtown activity is lease expiration-driven, there's not a tremendous amount of growth, that when you have a lease expiration tendency and they have a particular day on which their space is leasing, the market has become more flexible on meeting that date. So where it used to be that in a bit of a stronger market, if you had a lease expiration on January 1, 2018, and the traditional 10-year deal was 12 months of free rent and $65 or $75 of TIs, that would be what the transaction package would be. Today, if you have a lease expiration on January 30 or February 1 or March 30 or April 1, you might get the same concession package, but your rent commencement date would be a little bit drawn out. So effectively, your NER, if you want to call it that, has gone down slightly but it's, in reality, just a way to meet the demand of the marketplace as opposed to actually increase concessions. And I think that's the flexibility that's being required. In addition, as I said before, Jed, there is more landlord-oriented work that is going on in Manhattan in the form of prebuilds or other landlord-required obligations to tenant spaces.

As usual, I'll cover our quarterly results, market conditions, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share of $0.01 ab",1803,"Thank you, Arista. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll cover our quarterly results, market conditions, as well as our current capital strategy and investment activity. On current results, we produced another solid quarter with FFO per share of $0.01 above our prior guidance, primarily due to portfolio outperformance. We also increased our full year 2016 FFO per share projection by $0.03. For the quarter, we leased just under 900,000 square feet, which is below our historical averages. However, we have a very robust pipeline of in-service and development leasing activity, which we think will be signed before calendar year-end and which will bring our annual leasing for 2016 in line with or possibly above averages.  Our in-service portfolio occupancy is now 89.6%, which is down 120 basis points from the end of the second quarter, and this is due primarily to the addition of Colorado Center to the portfolio. We had another quarter of positive rent roll-ups in our leasing activity, with rental rates on leases that commenced in the third quarter up 6% on a gross basis and 8% on a net basis compared to prior lease. 
Now moving to the economy. U.S. economic growth continues to be positive, but as we all know, it's been sluggish. Second quarter GDP growth has been revised up to 1.4%. It was 0.8% in the first quarter and estimates for all of '16 are 2% or less. The employment picture continues to improve gradually, with 156,000 jobs created in September and the unemployment rate has remained flat at 5%. Wages have perked up a bit, up 2.6%, though inflation remained low at 1.1% for the third quarter. 
Moving to capital markets. The 10-year U.S. Treasury has risen approximately 40 basis points to 1.75% from lows in July which has sparked a seemingly harsh REIT market correction of 5.5 plus percent over the past month. Though the Fed is signaling one rate hike before year-end, further increases in the short to medium term we think will be tempered by low interest rates in the developed world's dollar strength, sluggish growth in the U.S. and low inflation. Given the growth in the U.S. economy, office market nationally continue to improve, albeit more slowly. Net absorption was 8.7 million feet for the third quarter and the vacancy rate was flat to last quarter but improved 30 basis points from a year ago. Asking rents rose nearly 6% year-over-year and construction levels are up 6% year-over-year and are 2.3% of total stock, which is above the long-term average of 1.9% for the U.S. office market.
Moving to private real estate capital markets. We believe interest from primarily non-U.S. investors remains healthy for prime assets and gateway markets. However, transaction volumes are below 2015 levels and domestic institutional investors have been less of a factor in this segment of the market. Commodity assets are more difficult to sell, and there are fewer bidders for Class A trophies. There are, however, several examples of Class A assets continuing to sell for favorable prices in the third quarter. In Cambridge, 245 First Street, which is a 300,000 square foot office and lab building sold to a domestic pension fund adviser for $1,020 per square foot in a mid-4s cap rate. In San Francisco, a sovereign wealth fund purchased a minority position in 100 First Street and 303 Second Street for approximately $950,000 a square foot, which is a low 4s cap rate. And finally, in West L.A, 233 Wilshire was acquired by U.S. REIT in partnership with a sovereign wealth fund for $1,080 per square foot and a low to mid-4s cap rate. And there's a pipeline of additional deals in the West L.A. market we think with similar pricing metrics. We believe the relative stability of the U.S. market, given Brexit and other global turbulence, as well as the fact that U.S. cap rates spread to treasuries remain above long-term averages will provide a cushion for U.S. real estate valuations, particularly in our core markets.
So in summary, operating performance improvement in office remains positive but is later in the cycle and slowing slightly. Interest rates are up modestly but will likely remain low, and private capital flows into our space remain healthy, though somewhat diminished from previous quarters. Given this economic picture, we'll continue to take advantage of a reasonably healthy tenant demand and lease-up our existing vacancy and new developments. We'll focus our new your investment activity on new development and asset refurbishment in innovation centers where we see the strongest prospects for growth. We will also protect the downside by requiring pre-leasing for new office development, avoiding the purchase of stabilized assets at low cap rates, selectively selling assets and keeping our overall corporate leverage at conservative levels. 
Moving to the execution of our capital strategy. As you know, we completed the acquisition of Colorado Center in West L.A. last quarter. We've had very strong leasing activity at the project and are completing our redevelopment plans.  We are also actively seeking to grow West L.A. into another major region for Boston Properties over the long term and are reviewing a number of on- and off-market opportunities. However, we will remain disciplined and patient and focus only on investments that create attractive returns for shareholders. 
Moving to dispositions. We recently completed with Blackstone, the recapitalization of Metropolitan Square, which is a 620,000 square foot office building, 75% leased, located in close proximity to the White House in Washington, D.C. We've reduced our interest from 51% to 20% and will retain the leasing and management of the property. Pricing on a 100% basis was $360 million or $581 a square foot, and the building will likely require an additional $160 per square foot of capital to complete its repositioning. We realized $56 million of proceeds for the sale of our interest, net of existing financing, and we experienced a 14.2% leveraged IRR in the portion we sold over our 18-year period of ownership. We're also delighted to be developing a larger relationship with Blackstone through this transaction. 
We also closed in the third quarter the sale of a parcel in our Broad Run Business Park in Loudon County for $18 million. And finally, we've withdrawn from the market our VA 95 Business Park in Springfield, Virginia. During the marketing process, the major tenant in the park, U.S. Customs, issued an RFP for a consolidation in Northern Virginia. The result and uncertainty around retaining this tenant diminished investor interest in the asset that ultimately we could end up benefiting from the consolidation opportunity. We do not anticipate any additional sales in 2016, though we intend to continue to sell noncore assets in 2017, subject to market conditions. Including these transactions, in 2016, we will complete the monetization of 3 assets for total gross proceeds on an our share basis of $235 million, which is in line with projections provided at the beginning of the year. 
Moving to development. We remain active delivering assets into service, advancing our predevelopment pipeline and evaluating new investments. In terms of starts for the quarter, we commenced the full redevelopment of the 220,000 square foot low-rise building at 601 Lexington Avenue. The 195,000 square foot office component of the building is being renamed 159 East 53rd Street and will have a new dedicated street entrance and lobby, providing branding opportunities for a major tenant.  The building is being re-clad, creating 30% more vision glass, a new high-efficiency HVAC system will be installed and access to the building's extensive and redesigned outdoor terraces will be improved. The 25,000 square foot retail atrium is also being completely redeveloped, with a prominent at grade entrance on 53rd Street and will house multiple dining amenities and a fitness center. Our share of the total budgeted cost of this project is $106 million and we forecast the yield on the office component to be in line with our target NOI yield of 7% for development. Returns on the retail and outdoor plaza components will be partially driven by the enhancements we realize in lease rate and velocity due to this new amenity for our 3 major office assets at 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue. 
We also anticipate starting the development of an amenity building in the outdoor -- existing outdoor plaza at 100 Federal Street in Boston in the fourth quarter. We remain active advancing our predevelopment pipeline for projects that would start after 2016. Several updates from this quarter include: at Kendall Center in Cambridge, we're in the final stages of executing a lease with a major technology company to build their 476,000 square foot headquarters at 145 Broadway, which will require demolition of an existing 80,000 square foot low-rise building on the site. Total budgeted development costs are $517 million or $1,086 per square foot with land at market value and the first year development NOI yield is projected to be approximately 7%. The project will not commence until 2017, and efforts continue on developing commitments and projects for the remaining 600,000 square feet of potential entitlements at Kendall Center. 
We're pursuing -- further, we're pursuing multiple new pre-lease development opportunities in the Washington, D.C. region, all of which are potential 2017 starts. On deliveries, this month, we delivered into service 1265 Main Street in Waltham, Mass. This -- the building, which we own in partnership with a local developer, is 115,000 square feet and 100% leased to C&J Clark. We're generating a 7.7% yield on our $26 million investment in this redevelopment. At the end of the third quarter, our development pipeline now consists of 8 new projects and 2 redevelopments, totaling 4 million square feet and $2.2 billion in projected costs. Our projected NOI yield for these developments is in excess of 7% and the commercial component of the pipeline is 50% pre-let. We expect the addition of these projects to our in-service portfolio to add materially to our company's growth over the next 3 years. 
So to conclude, we continue to remain very enthusiastic about our prospects for creating shareholder value in the quarters ahead. We have a clear and achievable plan to materially grow FFO through the development and delivery of new building, as well as the lease-up of existing assets for which we currently have a particularly strong backlog of potential leases. We selected noncore assets for sale to raise capital and ensure continued portfolio improvement. We have significant entitled and unentitled landholdings that we'll continue to push-through the design and permitting process and add selectively to our development pipeline in future years. Our balance sheet remains strong with conservative leverage, which will allow us to pursue and act on investment opportunities that present themselves in coming quarters. 
So let me turn the call over to Doug for a further review of our markets."

So this is the third quarter, and we introduced our 2017 earnings guidance last night, and I'm going to devote my time this morning to providing the operating background that's behind our estimates and to describe th",2835,"Thanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So this is the third quarter, and we introduced our 2017 earnings guidance last night, and I'm going to devote my time this morning to providing the operating background that's behind our estimates and to describe the key drivers of our occupancy and revenue growth over the short term, as well as those situations where we have in fact completed transactions, signed leases, but are not going to be recognizing any revenue until 2018, and there's a significant amount of that. 
In a number of instances, our estimates reflect investment and repositioning decisions that were made during the past 12 months, which have a direct impact on our 2017 GAAP revenues, and I want to take the time to provide the incremental impact of those decisions. So let me now give you some specifics on our regions, and I'll start with San Francisco. 
So during the first quarter, we completed 128,000 square feet of office leasing at Embarcadero Center, during the second quarter, 158,000 square feet of leases and during the third quarter, we completed an additional 219,000 square feet of leasing. All of these leases average a positive mark-to-market of more than 40% on a gross basis and 70% on a net basis, very consistent with the leasing spreads we've been reporting in our quarterly supplementals. The incremental revenue from the deals we've now signed in San Francisco since the third quarter of last year is over $16.5 million and will be at a full run rate starting in the third quarter of '17. The overall market conditions we've been describing in the last few quarters in the San Francisco CBD really remain the same. And while it may make a headline to write that the rate of activity in '16 is not going to be quite at the level as it was in '15, which by the way was just off the peak market of 2014, we actually think the real news is the stability of the market in San Francisco CBD. Each quarter, there continues to be a new crop of significant technology company lease expansions in addition to the traditional lease expiration-driven market demand. This quarter, Twitch signed a lease at 350 Bush for 185,000 square feet; Fitbit took over 300,000 square feet off the sublet market; Lyft has taken over 280,000 square feet at 185 Berry; Adobe is in the market and expanding by 200,000 square feet; Slack, which started at our building at 680 Folsom in an 11,000 square-foot pre-built suite in 2014, is now looking for more than 200,000 square feet; and NerdWallet continues to be in the market for over 100,000 square feet. 
Continuing the trend we saw in the second quarter, high-quality, well-built sublet space is hitting the market and getting quickly absorbed and has really served the dominant large block availability. The largest block of sublet space in the market statistics last quarter was a 400,000 square-foot block at 211 Main, while Schwab renewed, so there's no more sublet availability. And the largest block of space on the market this quarter was up over at Twitter's buildings up on the upper market, and it appears now that space has been put under lease negotiation with a growing startup technology company. Sublet availability has remained flat, with growing technology expansions compensating for additional availability. Salesforce Tower is the tallest building in the city and we are now able to take prospective tenants up to the available floors and allow them to visually and physically experience the breadth of vision glass, the column-free floors, the volume of the slab-to-slab heights and the views. We have 5 floors under lease negotiation, which is what our expectation was for the year, and hope to have all of these leases signed by year-end. Only one full floor future prospect is actually located at Embarcadero Center, so it's all incremental in the demand. The structure of the building is up about 56 floors and we expect to have our first tenants in occupancy in late 2017. 
I said this last quarter, but I want to repeat it again. We anticipate delivering the first block of space to Salesforce.com in the second quarter of '17, and then we have 4 future delivery dates that extend into the fourth quarter of '18. We do not recognize revenue until the tenants have completed their buildout on a floor-by-floor basis even though we're going to be receiving cash rent. Our 2017 earning estimates continue to assume we're not going to record GAAP revenue from Salesforce.com's lease in 2017. Rent commencement on the other 4 tenant floors is likely to start in the fourth quarter, with accompanying cessation of capitalized interest, but is offset by the startup of operating expenses and taxes for the whole building. When the building is fully leased with tenants and occupancy, which we expect to occur in '19, we anticipate an initial stabilized net operating income of between $80 million and $85 million.
Our Mountain View activity continues to be very strong still. We're renewing our single story product at over $55 triple net, but occupancy gains are slower out at 611 Gateway. We will start the year there with 186,000 square feet of availability and we're unlikely to see much incremental revenue from that space in '17. 
Going down the coast to our new market in West L.A. Activity there is robust and we anticipate signing leases for more than 200,000 square feet of our 380,000 -- 385,000 square feet of availability in the coming days and extending another 190,000 square feet. The West L.A. market has had a string of strong quarters of rental rate growth as it benefits from both the creativity and entrepreneurship of local content, creators and providers, the explosion of new content from new economy entertainment companies and the growing labor market for a number of San Francisco-based technology companies that are trying to broaden their workforce reach. Since July, the submarket has seen more than 400,000 square feet of signed leases, and there's another 790,000 square feet of activity in the market, including our transactions in process. Rents have moved more than 10% for these large blocks of space since our purchase in July. 
I want to start my discussion in the New York region with our retail tenancy. At 250 West 55th, we have signed a lease for 55,000 square feet, including the second floor, with the operator of an experiential thematic visitor destination that expects to be opened by the end of 2017. Since the space needs to be improved, we have not included any revenue in our 2017 estimates, but the space is leased. You will recall that our 2016 results included termination income equivalent to 4.5 years of rent. We expect to replace this income from this space after 23 months. At 767 Fifth, we have more clarity on the timing of the retail revenue from the various spaces. We expect to deliver this space to Under Armour in the second half of 2018. 
So going back, in 2014, prior to the termination of the FAO Schwarz lease when all of the retail was leased, we had about $64 million of revenue from the retail spaces at the General Motors Building. All the space is now committed, but in 2017, as we work through the transition, we will have about $51 million of revenues. In the second half of 2018, when the transition is complete, we anticipate an annual run rate of over $85 million of revenue, with a pretty conservative projection for percentage rent from the tenants. We own 60% of this joint venture. 
We're not anticipating any office rent growth and probably slightly higher concessions around our Midtown office portfolio in '17. The conditions we have been describing for the last few years remain in control. New supply continues to come into the market. The large financial players continue to shrink their cost structures, and in certain instances, they've chosen to move to new owned facilities on the far west side, creating additional inventory. Landlords that are putting capital into older assets are attracting tenants. Major League Baseball at 1271 6th Avenue just took 400,000 square feet and Hogan Lovells at 390 Madison Avenue just took 250,000 square feet, being the most recent examples. The market is active for larger tenants in the mid-80s across midtown, while the market for space over $100 a square foot obviously has less velocity. I think the most significant change in our Manhattan leasing is that we have seen a significant pickup in demand for our 2 floors, the available floors at 767 Fifth Avenue, which total about 80,000 square feet. We have a lease for 24,000 square feet out for execution. We actually expect it get it signed today. And we have 3 other tenants looking at between 40,000 and 20,000 Square feet. Again, we won't recognize revenue in '17, but the expected contribution is over $7.5 million from this 80,000 square feet. If you look at it statistically, there's actually been a significant amount of space leased at over $100 a square foot, and that even excludes the Citadel lease at $425, more than, in fact, in 2015. But the typical relocation deal is still under 10,000 square feet, so you have to do a lot of deals to lease space. Our total New York regional activity in the third quarter was about 113,000 square feet. We're negotiating leases for 60,000 of our 87,000 square feet of 2017 rollover at 599. It's all priced in the 80s, and we expect to receive income from some of those spaces in '17. We completed the relocation of all of the tenants from the low rise at 159 East 53rd Street. This was our one opportunity to dramatically rebuild the space in conjunction with our plan to reintroduce the public spaces. In order to complete the work, we took back 70,000 square feet in 2016, which resulted in termination payments and a rent roll-down, which is why you see negative statistics in our supplemental in the New York region this quarter. When we made this decision to proceed with this investment in late 2015, we recognized that we were going to be reducing the pro rata share of the revenue from the office space by about $5.5 million. That's what we're experiencing in 2017. We're now marketing 195,000 square foot block of space that we hope to deliver to tenants in '18, with revenue commencing in '19. 
At 399 Park Avenue, we've commenced an extensive renovation and have leased about 204,000 square feet of the coming up rollover and we have another 0.5 million square feet that is uncommitted, including about 100,000 square feet of concourse space that's currently rented at about $45 a square foot. The existing lease expirations from Citi and the law firm expire in August and September of '17, and while we expect to lease significant portions of the space during the year, we anticipate having to remove the existing improvements and may not have tenants in place with the revenue recognition until 2018. Our other New York City assets have very modest near-term expirations or vacancies. We've signed leases or negotiations are ongoing that will create significant amounts of incremental income, but the opportunities to drive '17 revenue are limited. 
Going down to D.C. The D.C. CBD office market fundamentals have not experienced much in the way of new demand generators and we haven't really seen any demonstrable positive change in the leasing markets. Landlords are competing on any available space and concessions in D.C. on leases of 10 years or more, typically include a year of free rent and more than $110 of tenant improvement allowances.  D.C. is truly a forward-leasing market for any sizable space. But there continues to be speculative buildings under construction, believe it or not, aging beauties that are being repositioned and 11 operational buildings with between 100,000 and 400,000 square feet of available space. That's the market we're dealing with. The GSA continues to have a very measured approach to its renewals and we're not aware of any requirements that are net generators of demand. We're negotiating short-term renewals with the GSA for 196,000 square feet of our 2017 lease expirations. In spite of the challenging environment, we are chipping away at all of our availability with about half of 47,000 square feet of available space under negotiation at 601 Mass.  That's the building that opened late last September. And we have another half a dozen leases under 15,000 square feet, either signed or in active negotiations on other D.C. assets -- CBD assets. 
In Reston, we completed another 6 leases totaling 69,000 square feet, where the average starting rent still is in the mid-50s and we have made 2 proposals to large users for our proposed new 270,000 square foot signature development. Our Reston portfolio continues to be 97% leased, leaving us with a very small smattering of availability. There has actually been a pickup of activity at our VA 95 product, the product that Owen was describing, and we're actually in negotiations with 2 tenants for between 53,000 and 69,000 square feet of our availability there. And we also picked up another 31,000 square foot tenant at our AJ6 building in Maryland. 
As Owen reported, we are close to executing a lease for an approximately 476,000 square foot office building on the site of our existing 97,000 square foot office building, 145 Broadway. We are moving through the formal review process with the City of Cambridge. We anticipate vacating 145 Broadway during the second quarter of '17 and commencing construction soon after. We are eliminating, taking off the board, $2.3 million of income on an annualized basis until the building comes into service in December of 2019. This is captured in our 2017 projections, so you're starting to get the theme. The demand growth in our Boston suburban portfolio continues to outpace the other submarkets. This quarter, we completed 173,000 square feet of leases and we have more than 475,000 square feet of renewals and relocations with growing tenants in progress. High-quality space is at a premium and we anticipate additional rent growth in '17. One of our negotiations is for our building at 170 Tracer Lane, which we took out of service in 2016 in order to complete a major refurbishment. We spent an incremental $16 million and expect to increase the income by more than $1.2 million when the tenant takes initial occupancy during the third quarter of 2017. This is yet another example of us purposely forgoing current income in order to create higher long-term value. 
The Boston CBD market continues to be a lease expiration-driven market, with a steady flow of new technology companies. One of the more interesting phenomena is that all the large users that have been entering the ""Innovation District"" or the seaport area are, for the most part, traditional FIRREA tenants seeking new large blocks of space, and most of the smaller and growing technology companies are located in the financial district, Uptown, which is what we call the North Station area or the Back Bay. During the quarter, we leased about 50,000 square feet in our CBD portfolio, but this month, we expect to complete 64,000 square feet of leasing at 888 Boylston Street. Again, I think those leases will get done in the next day or so, bringing us to 89% leased. We've signed 108,000 square feet at the Prudential Center, including 76,000 square feet of new tenants, bringing the occupancy in the Prudential Center to 98%, and we've signed 54,000 square feet at 120 St. James, the low-rise portion of 200 Clarendon. As we discussed on our last call, 888 is not going to hit its stabilized run rate until November of 2017 when Natixis occupies floors 4 through 10, or 154,000 square feet. And while we've leased more than 1.2 million square feet at 200 Clarendon since we took possession in 2011, and it's a 1.6 million square foot building, we still have 120,000 square feet of low-rise space and 125,000 square feet of high rise. While the low-rise space is very attractive to nonfinancial tenants, the high-rise floors continue to be driven by traditional lease expiration-driven users and the activity in this area has been less robust. We expect to lease a large portion of the space over the next 12 months, but we're not projecting revenue in '17. 
In summary, we've executed on a significant portion of our plan and we have a significant amount of contractual revenues in both our operating properties and our development assets that will increase our earnings over the coming years. We've now executed on about $72 million of our $80 million bridge, but we still have a few significant lease expirations that were part of that bridge that we will still need to cover. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Mike."
368278,404556925,1062845,"Boston Properties Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Great.   Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I'm just going to start with a couple of quick comments on our balance sheet and then I'll jump to our earnings results and our guidance. We completed a significant transaction in the debt markets this past quarter. We",1686,"Great.   Thanks, Doug. Good morning. I'm just going to start with a couple of quick comments on our balance sheet and then I'll jump to our earnings results and our guidance. We completed a significant transaction in the debt markets this past quarter. We raised $1 billion 10-year bond issuance at 2.75% coupon. If you include the settlement of a portion of our hedges, the all-in GAAP interest rate on that financing is 3.5%. We used the proceeds to repay 2 mortgages that had a weighted average GAAP interest rate of about 5.9%, so you will see the impact of the 240 basis point reduction show up as lower interest expense in our run rate going forward. Our cash balances have dropped to just over $400 million after the acquisition of Colorado Center, funding of our developments and the repayment of debt. We project our development spend to approach $1 billion through the end of 2017, and we anticipate either using our currently untapped line of credit or raising additional debt capital as a personal funding source. 
Our guidance currently assumes the use of our line, so it's certainly possible that we may complete a new debt issuance and hold the cash short term, which would be dilutive to our earnings guidance. With the run-up in treasury rates over the last couple of months, our borrowing cost for 10 years in the bond market is currently about 3.2%. If you assume a $500 million debt issuance at the beginning of 2017, it would reduce our 2017 earnings guidance by about $0.05 a share. The other major debt transaction that we have our eye on is the pending refinancing of our $1.6 billion mortgage on 767 Fifth Avenue that expires next October. This is a consolidated joint venture, with our share being 60%, and we expect to refinance it in the mortgage market. We currently account for this loan under fair value accounting, so the GAAP interest rate is only about 3%. With the mortgage market currently pricing comparable large loans in the mid-3% range, the refinancing will likely increase our GAAP interest expense. We've also entered into hedges for $450 million of this at a 10-year treasury rate of 2.62% that will impact the transaction. The current cash interest rate on the loan is 6%. So on a cash basis, we anticipate a significant reduction in the interest rate that should enter into our cash flow. 
Our earnings for the quarter were reported at $1.42 per share, which was $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our portfolio performed ahead of our expectations, generating NOI approximately $3 million above our projections due to a combination of rental revenue outperformance and operating expense savings. The majority of the revenue beat came from San Francisco, where we completed a number of leases earlier than we projected, including some renewals with strong roll-ups that we started to straight line upon signing. As you can see on our mark-to-market stats, we continue to experience dramatic rent roll-ups in our activity in San Francisco. 
The outperformance in the portfolio was offset by a $1.8 million impairment we booked this quarter on a land parcel in suburban Maryland. This is the last parcel we own in a land assemblage we've considered exiting over the past several years, having sold 2 other parcels and booking gains totaling $5.5 million. Our FFO guidance for the rest of 2016 of $5.97 to $5.99 represents an increase of $0.03 per share at the midpoint from last quarter's guidance. All of the increase emanates from the performance of the portfolio due primarily to leasing success in the Boston and San Francisco markets. Our guidance now assumes our share of 2016 combined same property cash NOI growth of between 3.5% and 4% over 2015, which is at the high end of our prior range. 
As you look at 2017, the most important factor to remember is the impact of the amount of termination income that we recorded in 2016. We project 2016 termination income of approximately $58 million. The lion's share of this came from one large termination at 250 West 55th street and several at 601 Lexington Avenue, where we needed to relocate tenants from the low-rise to the high-rise in order to allow our redevelopment to move ahead. Our 2017 guidance assumes only modest termination income, so this represents a loss of $0.31 per share of projected FFO from 2016 to 2017. 
In the portfolio, Doug described our activity in New York City and Boston, where we're successfully signing leases and letters of intent, but much of the impact will be in '18. Although some of our leasing efforts will not result in immediate revenue recognition, we do assume solid growth in same-property portfolio in 2017. In Boston, we've signed leases on virtually all of the vacant space at the Prudential Tower and we expect Eataly and the rest of the Prudential shops' releasing effort to be open and revenue-generating by the first quarter. We also start to deliver floors to Putnam at 100 Federal Street, and we expect moderate additional lease-up at 200 Clarendon Street. In aggregate, our guidance assumes this activity adds $17 million to $25 million of incremental NOI to 2017. 
In San Francisco, we've had a tremendous success, both leasing up our vacancy and rolling up rents on renewals at Embarcadero Center this year. This was reflected in 2016 but will be even stronger in 2017 where we project an incremental $18 million to $25 million of NOI, equating to growth of more than 10% for the region. On a cash basis, the growth is even greater as the cash mark-to-market takes hold on our early renewal activity. The impact of the growth we're experiencing in Boston and San Francisco from both increased occupancy and a roll-up to higher rental rates is projected to be partially offset by a decline in the contribution from the New York portfolio. The contribution from the Washington portfolio is projected to be relatively flat. As Doug described, in New York City, we will not see any real impact from the significant leasing we're doing at 767 Fifth Avenue and at 250 West 55th Street until 2018. We expect a temporary loss of income from 500,000 square feet of rollover at 399 Park Avenue in the second half of the year. Overall, our guidance assumes NOI from the New York City portfolio to be down $5 million to $10 million into 2017 from 2016. So in aggregate, our guidance assumes our share of combined same property NOI to grow between 2% and 3.5% in 2017 over 2016. And on a cash basis, we assume between 2% and 4% growth of our share of combined same-property NOI over the same period. 
Our non-same property portfolio includes our development deliveries, acquisitions, dispositions and the impact of taking buildings out of service for redevelopment. Our redevelopment projects include 159 East 53rd Street in New York, 145 Broadway in Cambridge and one of our suburban Boston assets, 191 Spring Street. We expect these redevelopments to generate an accretive development return on investment, but in 2017, will result in the loss of approximately $8 million of NOI compared to 2016. This includes both lost rental income as well as the expensing of demolition costs that we project at $4 million in 2016 and $7 million in 2017. 
On the positive side, we expect to generate NOI growth from a full year of the acquisition of Colorado Center and from our development deliveries, though as Doug described, our development deliveries will be much more impactful to 2018 based upon the anticipated occupancy dates for our major pre-leases. In aggregate, our guidance assumes our non-same property portfolio will add an incremental $18 million to $30 million of NOI in 2017. 
The other area where we expect significant change on our earnings in 2017 is through lower-interest expense from the combination of debt refinancing completed in 2016 as well as higher capitalized interest associated with our development pipeline. Our guidance for 2017 assumes net interest expense of between $378 million and $391 million, which is a reduction of $21 million at the midpoint from 2016. We assume capitalized interest to be between $50 million and $60 million in 2017. 
So in summary, based on these assumptions, we project our 2017 funds from operation to be between $6.05 and $6.23. This is an increase of $0.16 per share from the midpoint of our 2016 projected FFO. At the midpoint, the increase in FFO over 2016 is the result of $0.23 per share of growth from our share of our combined same-property portfolio, $0.14 per share of incremental NOI from development deliveries and acquisitions, $0.12 per share from lower interest expense, $0.01 per share from higher development and management services income, so we project to be offset by a reduction and $0.03 per share from higher G&A expense and $0.31 per share of lower projected termination income. Again, the biggest item to consider when looking at our 2017 FFO growth is the impact of all the termination income that we recorded in 2016 that is not projected at anywhere near the same level in 2017. If you exclude the impact of termination income, our FFO per share at the midpoint of our guidance range is projected to be up 8.5% over 2016. 
I also want to make a quick comment on our dividends. Our estimate for 2016 taxable income before gains on sale is roughly in line with our current dividend rate of $2.60 per share. As we forecast the income generated from our development pipeline delivering over the next few years, combined with the anticipated organic growth in the portfolio and assuming moderating asset sales, our taxable income is projected to grow meaningfully. We've been working with our board on evaluating our dividend strategy and anticipate that our annual dividend will likely increase in both the short term and the longer-term to continue to match our taxable income to our dividend. 
That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line up for questions?"

When you look at the companies out there, whether it's Dougie [ph] or Hudson, they're buying like individual deals or maybe a portfolio like Westwood. But the number of the properties that meet sort of the Boston criteria don't seem as widespread at least to those of us. So maybe if you can just provide a little bit more perspective on what you guys see as the opportunity set both in aggregate, and then, maybe as far as timing, if it's something that's within -- we should wait another 6 months or maybe another 12-plus before we see more investment?"

I mean, we clearly feel that we're going to make a profitable investment in Colorado Center, which is great and was certainly one of the objectives, and the other objectives was to get us into the L.A. market, which we think will be an attractive and an important market for the company over the long term. But we don't intend to go out and make new investments just to grow in L.A. Each investment, as Colorado Center did, has to stand on its own and, in our opinion, create attractive return for shareholders. And so when I think -- and if you also look at the overall company, we entered the San Francisco market in the late '90s, and it still is the smallest region of the 4 primary markets of the company, here we are, nearly 20 years later. So our intent is to grow. We view the investment in L.A. as strategic, but we're going to wait for opportunities that, again, we think make sense and pencil from a return perspective. And so where we are in the market today, I don't think you should expect us to go out and purchase stabilized assets in more of a kind of cap rate environment. Those are not the kinds of things that we're going to be doing. We're going to be looking at new developments, we're going to be looking at assets that need some repositioning or lease-up. Our focus will be on a handful of markets in West L.A. and I don't think you should put a confined timeframe on it, like 6 months or 12 months. We're going to be careful and patient and wait for the right opportunity."

So I think now the life companies are trying to become more competitive and put out capital. They have more to put out by the end of the year, so I think it's pretty competitive. And I think that when we look at 767 Fifth Avenue, that's a big loan. That is going to be more aligned with the CMBS market, I would imagine, because you would have to put together many other life companies to put that together, given its size and the fact that most life companies are maxing out at a couple of hundred to maybe $400 million at most.

I think, in New York City, many landlords have taken the recipe that we've been working with for a number of years and prebuilding space. And if you prebuild a suite, you're giving a lot more money in the space than you are when you're giving an allowance. But in theory, you're reducing the free rent concession significantly and/or improving your velocity. I described this sort of transaction environment in Washington, D.C. It's pretty close to where it was last year, maybe it's slightly higher. I think the greater San Francisco market it's up actually -- concessions have come down a little bit in the sense that many tenants are sort of deciding that renewing in place, on average, is a more economical experience for them because of the costs associated with having to relocate. So if you have a tenant in place, you can get away with a smaller concession than with a new tenant coming into that space. And then, in the Boston market, the CBD has probably had a slight increase in its tenant improvement numbers, not significant.  Free rent really hasn't become a factor in this market at all, and our suburban market, actually, I think has seen a decrease, overall, in concessions because honestly, because of the stronger market and the availability of high-quality space is becoming limited."

So you're talking about total adjustments to our FFO of $280 million to $320 million, something like that.

So I think the way the market is working is that when you have -- and most of the Midtown activity is lease expiration-driven, there's not a tremendous amount of growth, that when you have a lease expiration tendency and they have a particular day on which their space is leasing, the market has become more flexible on meeting that date. So where it used to be that in a bit of a stronger market, if you had a lease expiration on January 1, 2018, and the traditional 10-year deal was 12 months of free rent and $65 or $75 of TIs, that would be what the transaction package would be. Today, if you have a lease expiration on January 30 or February 1 or March 30 or April 1, you might get the same concession package, but your rent commencement date would be a little bit drawn out. So effectively, your NER, if you want to call it that, has gone down slightly but it's, in reality, just a way to meet the demand of the marketplace as opposed to actually increase concessions. And I think that's the flexibility that's being required. In addition, as I said before, Jed, there is more landlord-oriented work that is going on in Manhattan in the form of prebuilds or other landlord-required obligations to tenant spaces.

We also -- a lot of those decisions also were driven by the need we had for capital to fund our development pipeline, and which we've been employing. We will certainly consider selling additional assets in the future if we need the capital for a new investment that we make or for additional development. But what we're not doing is just selling assets when we don't have a need for capital.
