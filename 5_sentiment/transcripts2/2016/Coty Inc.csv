This morning, we'll provide you with a brief update on the expected merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business, other corporate developments and Q2 and year-to-date results. Then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions. 
Our efforts right now are all about creating a very healthy platform for Coty to become the strong leader and challenger in the beauty industry that we aim for it to be. This quarter, we made good progress on that objective, both on the merger acquisition front and the underlying Coty business side. 
Starting with the core Coty business. Q2 showed continued improvement in business fundamentals. Coty revenue trends remain muted with a 1% like-for-like decline, and we do expect the Q2 trend to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year as we continue to rationalize nonstrategic product lines and businesses. However, and encouragingly, power brands experienced solid mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter, very much helped by our strategy of focusing and investing in these key brands. 
We also continue to show strong momentum in driving profit and cash flow generation. Our year-to-date operating profit grew high single digits, with adjusted operating income growing 13% at constant currency, an impressive growth in operating margin. At the same time, our strong networking capital improvement contributed to significant growth in free cash flow generation. These results show that we can continue to build a healthier and better business despite subdued revenue growth performance. 
On the merger and acquisition side, we've made good progress on our Bourjois acquisition. As of today, the local Bourjois businesses have been integrated within Coty local subsidiaries. Also, Bourjois and Coty processes as well as information technology are now fully aligned We continue to see good growth opportunities for this brand and remain confident that it will be margin-accretive to our call of business in fiscal 2017. 
Since announcing the acquisition of Beamly in the second quarter, these top-holding leaders in this Digital Marketing company have started to engage and work with the Coty brands on several digital campaigns. We are confident, by bringing in Beamly's cutting-edge digital engagement platform in house, we will continue to strengthen Coty's marketing and branding efforts. 
In addition, we announced on February 1 the completion of the acquisition of the Hypermarcas Beauty & Personal Care business. As a reminder, Hypermarcas is a highly profitable business, with operating margins above Coty levels. This transaction will strengthen Coty's exposure to Brazil, which is one of the largest and growing beauty markets in the world. 
We believe it will also provide an excellent platform to integrate the existing small Coty business into sizable P&G Specialty Beauty Business in Brazil. 
And as announced last week, we signed a new fragrance license agreement with Tiffany & Co., an international renowned jeweler, which we believe will further strengthen our future position as the industry leader in fragrances. 
On the P&G Specialty Beauty Business merger, we confirmed the transfer of 10 P&G fragrance licenses, including global powerhouses such as Hugo Boss, Gucci and Lacoste. We are making excellent progress to close the P&G Specialty Beauty Business merger in the second half of calendar 2016, and we are happy to report that we have received antitrust approval from the U.S., among other countries. And we are actively engaged in discussions with the EU antitrust authorities. We have also materially advanced structuring and staffing our future organization and are well-advanced in setting up the teams and work stream supporting our IT system requirements and blueprinting the integration plan for the combined businesses. 
And as I discussed on the last call, we believe the new consumer-centric and category-focused organizational structure, our strong brand portfolio, together with our new leadership team, will position Coty well to realize its ambition of becoming a true leader and challenger in the beauty industry and drive profitable growth and shareholder value over time. 
I will now hand over the call to Patrice."

Total Q2 net revenues declined 1% like-for-like, with an improvement in the Fragrance segment trends compared to Q1 and a solid core Cosmetics growth in spite of the decline in the U.S. main market. I'm happy to report that fiscal year to date, the adjusted gross margin increased a very strong 130 basis points to 60.9%, reflecting our continuous effort in driving supply chain efficiencies and reducing discounting activity. 
We keep on building a better business even in the phase out soft topline trends, with adjusted operating income growing 5% fiscal year-to-date, with a much more substantial 13% increase at constant currency. The year-to-date adjusted operating margin at actual rates grew 160 basis points, with meaningful margin increase in Color Cosmetics up 330 basis points and Skin & Body Care up 420 basis points. The Fragrance segment margin increased 20 basis points to 20.2%. 
As we discussed on the last call, given the market conditions in our global footprint, FX continued to pressure our revenues and operating income. Fiscal year-to-date, FX lowered net revenues and operating income by over 600 basis points. 
Our year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS was $0.98 compared to $0.73 in the prior year, reflecting, in part, the benefit from the favorable tax of $113.3 million this year compared to a $32.5 million settlement in the prior period. Our Global Efficiency Program remains on track, as we have recognized cumulative savings of approximately $170 million through the second quarter of fiscal 2016, driven by fixed cost reduction, indirect procurement savings, footprint consolidation and more streamlined operations in China. As a reminder, we expect to generate savings of approximately $270 million through fiscal '17. 
On the balance sheet, as a reminder, we closed on $4.5 billion credit facility this quarter to refinance existing Coty debt with new borrowings subject to longer maturities. As of today, we have [indiscernible] approximately 40% of our outstanding net floating rate debt into FX rates at an owning cost below 3%, with an average maturities between 3 and 5 years. 
In addition, certain lenders have committed to loan up to $4.5 billion with P&G, which is expected to be conveyed to Coty in connection with the expected merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business. 
With regard to the merger, the initial filing of our registration statement in connection with the transaction is expected to be filed in April. This registration document will include [indiscernible] information for the Beauty Brands we're acquiring from P&G through December 31, 2015. 
Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation allows us to continue to advance on our strategic and financial objectives. 
I'm very happy to report that fiscal year-to-date, we generated $517.1 million in operating cash flow and $438.7 million in free cash flow, each up over $160 million versus the prior year. Supported by these strong cash flow generation, we completed our $700 million share buyback program during the second quarter. In total, this fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 26 million Class A shares, and we also returned almost $90 million of cash to shareholders as dividends. 
We also announced this morning that the Board has authorized an incremental $500 million of share repurchase program. We will remain opportunistic in the way we use this authorization. It further supports our commitment to return cash to shareholder. 
Finally, on February 1, we completed the acquisition of Hypermarcas Beauty & Personal Care business, which we believe, as Bart said, will be a great platform to integrate our current and future business in Brazil. We are very excited to expand our footprint in Brazil with this portfolio of leading brands. 
The execution of the Bourjois acquisition, in line with our expectations, as well as the timely closing of the Hypermarcas acquisition, demonstrates our ability to successfully execute on our M&A growth strategy. 
Thank you. I will now open the call for questions."

So while we cannot comment on the disclosure of our performance of the business that are not, today, a part of Coty, we do want to highlight a couple of points. So first, it is our understanding that the disclosure in the public filings you referenced reflect the sales and profitability of the 47 brands that were part of the P&G's portfolio and now classified as discontinued operation, rather than the 41 brands that Coty would be acquiring as part of the planned merger. So 4 of the 47 brands have already been sold or discontinued by P&G. Second, we also understand the negative FX impacts accounted for a very substantial component of the reported decline of the sales of these 47 brands. Third, we also understand that the organic growth rate of the 41 brands we are acquiring is in line with the like-for-like trend that we are seeing in the Coty business, both for Q2 fiscal '16 and year-to-date.

So when I say rationalization of the portfolio, I really am referring to several items. First, there is a rationalization of a very small brands, which is in the tail of the portfolio. But there's also a discontinuation of certain lines, business lines or product lines of brands, in particular, when they're in places where we don't really want to see them. I'll give you a classic example. Selling OPI, hardware stores is probably not the smartest idea we could do as a company, which is passionate about beauty. And so there is also a rationalization of some businesses in locations where it shouldn't be. So it is both basically a rationalization of small brands and taking out kind of like business situations and to clean that up. And that is an ongoing effort, which will not stop in this quarter or the next quarter and will continue postmerger."

Before we start talking about more deals, as you know, we have a few basically to execute at the moment. So I'm going to refrain from commenting on new deals. The Hypermarcas business is really critical business enabler, both basically in the P&G transaction as well as to establish a long-term interesting business in Brazil. And the reason for that is very, very straightforward. The Coty business is very, very small, and therefore, has a very critical mass infrastructure. The P&G business is a carveout, and as a result, has a very large of a soft critical mass infrastructure. Just to give me some perspective, the P&G transaction in Brazil would have come with one salesperson. I don't have to tell you that that's not good enough to run a Brazilian business. So the Hypermarcas organization is the full sledge infrastructure business. It has everything. It has a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and logistics infrastructure. It has also state-of-the-art basically go-to-market infrastructure and a management team, which has proven to be successful in the market from a market share point of view. So as we speak, we are starting to degrade the Coty business into Hypermarcas. And then once that's done, they will get ready to integrate the P&G business. So Hypermarcas is really the main body that is going to be used in order to integrate and the Coty business and the P&G business, rather than Hypermarcas not integrated in Coty. Really, Coty is being integrated into Hypermarcas. Clearly,  it gets renamed Coty, but just to be across the clear, from a critical mass but any, that's where the point of gravity lies, and that's very much of an enabler to get deals done as well as to have a healthy business platform going forward."

In markets like Brazil, if you don't have your own manufacturing infrastructure and your own go-to-market infrastructure, it is very difficult to be successful as many multinational company because you cannot basically work with third parties in these 2 areas. So it is a massive accelerator. The fact that Coty doesn't have its own manufacturing infrastructure and has a substandard go-to-market infrastructure, the fact that the P&G business does not really have a local manufacturing infrastructure postdeal and doesn't really have a good go-to-market infrastructure is seriously handicapping just taking over the P&G business. So it really is a massive accelerator for us. The other good thing about Hypermarcas is that it's a proven management team. They're gaining as we speak in practically every category that they operate. And so I genuinely believe that this is a massive accelerator for us to be successful even in not in the long term, even in the longer term in Brazil. Clearly, the first job is to absorb these new business -- absorb Coty and then the P&G business. That's the first job. And then shortly thereafter, I would hope that we are going to see a acceleration in terms of the whole platform."

Mass continues to do well in Color Cosmetics. It does not do very well in Fragrance. Retail is focused on Beauty Business. Clearly, that depends on what retail you talk about. Some retailers are getting increasingly better at it. For instance, the drug trade in the U.S., some drug retailers are doing a substantially better business than they did before on the overall beauty business.

So I think in terms of A&CP spending, as you know, we make A distinction between what we really think is strategic spend and nonstrategic spend, the difference being that strategic spend is actually what the consumer sees. Nonstrategic spend is kind of like the money we waste in the office. So clearly, producing a commercial is nonstrategic spend because of the consumer doesn't see it. So clearly, the actual airing of a commercial would be strategic spend. Strategic spend, other things would be it like the furniture that we use in Color Cosmetics in stores or the beauty assistance that we use on the Fragrance business. So those are all basically strategic components. I can tell you that the strategic spend is substantially increasing in particular because we're seeing -- we've cut the nonstrategic spend. And on top of that, even within strategic spend, we've gotten greater efficiencies in the media buying area. So overall, the output is substantially increasing. Clearly, I would have liked to see a bigger response to that in terms of top line growth.

We're going to be anniversary that substantial share of gain in the second half of this year. So we're going to see a little bit more of a flattening out of the growth profile clearly in terms of Color Cosmetics for Coty as a result because we are going to index year-on-year. But the nail category is largely flat in the U.S. for the time being while we are gaining share. Clearly, we are working on initiatives to further enhance category growth and the market share for Sally Hansen. OPI is a very different business. OPI really should not be in a very massive way into retail because mostly salon brand. And like I already detailed to you, we are rationalizing some of the OPI business outside of salon simply because we believe that this is salon brand, and it's a brand that salon owners should be proud of to use.  And we do want to see a proliferation across many channels of this brand. Here the effort is very much in terms of driving both category intermittent salons. And there are different segments, which are relevant to that and we working on innovations, which is too early for me to discuss. Marc Jacobs and Calvin Klein, so in terms of specialty retailers, yes, there's a promotional arena out there in terms of the high-end retailers run Christmas, as we will know, in particular because online, I don't have to tell you, is an increasing percentage of the total markets.

It is accommodation of category and channel. So in terms of the category performance, I already detailed a little bit what the market growth rates are. So if you look at the overall growth rate of the current business, and I have to exclude hair coloring and retailing, styling because I don't have the data at this stage, we have some data, but I'm not comfortable enough to discuss those with you today. If you look at the overall market growth rate in beauty in North America and Europe at the moment, it's probably slightly north of 1%. You're going to see fragrance business, which is flat to marginally up, with basically prestige growing faster the mass. And then you see a skin care business, which is now growing at a much more modest rate in the low single digits and a Color Cosmetics was category, which is still doing reasonably well, growing several percentage points, with basically nail more flattish and with the other parts still showing very healthy growth. And that gives you a rough basically perspective on a category basis. On basically Hypermarcas and other geographies, so I don't have to tell you that still today, and including the P&G transaction, we are still predominantly a North America and a Western European bases or European business. So -- which is still the bulk of our business. So we need to, over time, increase our exposure to developing markets. I know that it is maybe most recently not the hardest story developing markets, but over time, longer term, developing markets, in our minds, remain markets higher growth rates. And this is also why, clearly, with the Hypermarcas transaction because we believe that this is going to be growth-accretive overtime.

This morning, we'll provide you with a brief update on the expected merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business, other corporate developments and Q2 and year-to-date results. Then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions. 
Our efforts right now are all about creating a very healthy platform for Coty to become the strong leader and challenger in the beauty industry that we aim for it to be. This quarter, we made good progress on that objective, both on the merger acquisition front and the underlying Coty business side.
Starting with the core Coty business. Q2 showed continued improvement in business fundamentals. Coty revenue trends remain muted with a 1% like-for-like decline, and we do expect the Q2 trend to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year as we continue to rationalize nonstrategic product lines and businesses. However, and encouragingly, power brands experienced solid mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter, very much helped by our strategy of focusing and investing in these key brands.
We also continue to show strong momentum in driving profit and cash flow generation. Our year-to-date operating profit grew high single digits, with adjusted operating income growing 13% at constant currency, an impressive growth in operating margin. At the same time, our strong networking capital improvement contributed to significant growth in free cash flow generation. These results show that we can continue to build a healthier and better business despite subdued revenue growth performance.
On the merger and acquisition side, we've made good progress on our Bourjois acquisition. As of today, the local Bourjois businesses have been integrated within Coty local subsidiaries. Also, Bourjois and Coty processes as well as information technology are now fully aligned We continue to see good growth opportunities for this brand and remain confident that it will be margin-accretive to our call of business in fiscal 2017. 
Since announcing the acquisition of Beamly in the second quarter, these top-holding leaders in this Digital Marketing company have started to engage and work with the Coty brands on several digital campaigns. We are confident, by bringing in Beamly's cutting-edge digital engagement platform in-house. We will continue to strengthen Coty's marketing and branding efforts.
In addition, we announced on February 1 the completion of the acquisition of the Hypermarcas Beauty & Personal Care business. As a reminder, Hypermarcas is a highly profitable business, with operating margins above Coty levels. This transaction will strengthen Coty's exposure to Brazil, which is one of the largest and growing beauty markets in the world.  We believe it will also provide an excellent platform to integrate the existing small Coty business into sizable P&G Specialty Beauty Business in Brazil. 
And as announced last week, we signed a new fragrance license agreement with Tiffany & Co., an international renowned jeweler, which we believe will further strengthen our future position as the industry leader in fragrances.
On the P&G Specialty Beauty Business merger, we confirm the transfer of 10 P&G fragrance licenses, including global powerhouses such as Hugo Boss, Gucci and Lacoste. We are making excellent progress to close the P&G Specialty Beauty Business merger in the second half of calendar 2016, and we are happy to report that we have received antitrust approval from the U.S., among other countries. And we are actively engaged in discussions with the EU antitrust authorities. We have also materially advanced on structuring and staffing our future organization and are well advanced in setting up the teams and work stream supporting our IT system requirements and blueprinting the integration plan for the combined businesses. 
And as I discussed on the last call, we believe the new consumer-centric and category-focused organizational structure, our strong brand portfolio, together with our new leadership team, will position Coty well to realize its ambition of becoming a true leader and challenger in the beauty industry and drive profitable growth and shareholder value over time. 
I will now hand over the call to Patrice."

Total Q2 net revenues declined 1% like-for-like, with an improvement in the Fragrance segment trends compared to Q1, and a solid Color Cosmetics segment growth with in spite of the decline in the U.S. main mark",656,"Thank you, Bart, and good morning, everyone. Total Q2 net revenues declined 1% like-for-like, with an improvement in the Fragrance segment trends compared to Q1, and a solid Color Cosmetics segment growth with in spite of the decline in the U.S. main market. I'm happy to report that fiscal year to date, the adjusted gross margin increased a very strong 130 basis points to 60.9%, reflecting our continuous effort in driving supply chain efficiencies and reducing discounting activity.
We keep on building a better business even in the phase of soft topline trends, with adjusted operating income growing 5% fiscal year-to-date, with a much more substantial 13% increase at constant currency. The year-to-date adjusted operating margin at actual rates grew 160 basis points, with meaningful margin increase in Color Cosmetics up 330 basis points and Skin & Body Care up 420 basis points. The Fragrance segment margin increased 20 basis points to 20.2%.
As we discussed on the last call, given the market conditions in our global footprint, FX continued to pressure our revenues and operating income. Fiscal year-to-date, FX lowered net revenues and operating income by over 600 basis points. 
Our year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS was $0.98 compared to $0.73 in the prior year, reflecting, in part, the benefit from the favorable tax settlement  of $113.3 million this year compared to a $32.5 million settlement in the prior period. Our Global Efficiency program remains on track, as we have recognized cumulative savings of approximately $170 million through the second quarter of fiscal 2016, driven by fixed cost reduction, indirect procurement savings, footprint consolidation and more streamlined operations in China. As a reminder, we expect to generate savings of approximately $270 million through fiscal '17.
On the balance sheet, as a reminder, we closed on a $4.5 billion credit facility this quarter to refinance existing Coty debt with new borrowings subject to longer maturities. As of today, we have swapped approximately 40% of our outstanding net floating rate debt into fixed rates at an owning cost below 3%, with an average maturities between 3 and 5 years. 
In addition, certain lenders have committed to loan up to $4.5 billion, an affiliate of P&G, which is expected to be conveyed to Coty in connection with the expected merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business.
With regard to the merger, the initial filing of our registration statement in connection with the transaction is expected to be filed in April. This registration document will include historical financial information for the Beauty Brands we're acquiring from P&G through December 31, 2015.
Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation allowed us to continue to advance on our strategic and financial objectives.
I'm very happy to report that fiscal year-to-date, we generated $517.1 million in operating cash flow and $438.7 million in free cash flow, each up over $160 million versus the prior year. Supported by these strong cash flow generation, we completed our $700 million share buyback program during the second quarter. In total, this fiscal year, we repurchased approximatively 26 million Class A shares, and we also returned almost $90 million of cash to shareholders as dividends.
We also announced this morning that the Board has authorized an incremental $500 million of share repurchase program. We will remain opportunistic in the way we use this authorization. It further supports our commitment to return cash to shareholder.
Finally, on February 1, we completed the acquisition of Hypermarcas Beauty & Personal Care business, which we believe, as Bart said, will be a great platform to integrate our current and future business in Brazil. We are very excited to expand our footprint in Brazil with this portfolio of leading brands. 
The execution of the Bourjois acquisition, in line with our expectations as well as the timely closing of the Hypermarcas acquisition demonstrate our ability to successfully execute on our M&A growth strategy.
Thank you. I will now open the call for questions."

So while we cannot comment on the disclosure of our performance of the business that are not, today, a part of Coty, we do want to highlight a couple of points. So first, it is our understanding that the disclosure in the public filings you referenced reflect the sales and profitability of the 47 brands that were part of the P&G's portfolio and now classified as discontinued operation, rather than the 41 brands that Coty would be acquiring as part of the planned merger. So 4 of the 47 brands have already been sold or discontinued by P&G. Second, we also understand the negative FX impacts accounted for a very substantial component of the reported decline in the sales of these 47 brands. Third, we also understand that the organic growth rate of the 41 brands we are acquiring is in line with the like-for-like trend that we are seeing in the Coty business, both for Q2 fiscal '16 and year-to-date.

So when I say rationalization of the portfolio, I really referring to several items. First, there is a rationalization of a very small brands, which is in the tail of the portfolio. But there's also a discontinuation of certain lines, business lines or product lines of brands, in particular, when they're in places where we don't really want to really see them. I'll give you a classic example. Selling OPI nail polish in hardware stores is probably not the smartest idea we could do as a company, which is passionate about beauty. And so there is also a rationalization of some businesses in locations where it shouldn't be. So it is both basically a rationalization of small brands and taking out kind of like business situations and to clean that up. And that is an ongoing effort, which will not stop in this quarter or the next quarter and will continue postmerger."

Before we start talking about more deals, as you know, we have a few basically to execute at the moment. So I'm going to refrain from commenting on new deals. The Hypermarcas business is really a critical business enabler, both basically in the P&G transaction as well as to establish a long-term interesting business in Brazil. And the reason for that is very, very straightforward. The Coty business is very, very small, and therefore, has a very subcritical mass infrastructure. The P&G business is a carve out, and as a result, has a very much of a subcritical mass infrastructure. Just to give you some perspective, the P&G transaction in Brazil would have come with one salesperson. I don't have to tell you that that's not good enough to run a Brazilian business. So the Hypermarcas organization is a full fledge infrastructure business. It has everything. It has the state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and logistics infrastructure. It has also state-of-the-art basically go-to-market infrastructure and a management team, which has proven to be successful in the market from a market share point of view. So as we speak, we are starting to integrate the Coty business into Hypermarcas. And then once that's done, they will get ready to integrate the P&G business. So Hypermarcas is really the main body that is going to be used in order to integrate and the Coty business and the P&G business, rather than Hypermarcas not integrated in Coty. Really, Coty is being integrated into Hypermarcas. Clearly, it gets renamed Coty, but just to be close to clear, from a critical mass point of view, that's where the point of gravity lies, and that's in a very much of an enabler to get deals done as well as to have a healthy business platform going forward."

In markets like Brazil, if you don't have your own manufacturing infrastructure and your own go-to-market infrastructure, it is very difficult to be successful as a native multinational company because you cannot basically work with third parties in these 2 areas. So it is a massive accelerator. The fact that Coty doesn't have its own manufacturing infrastructure and has a substandard go-to-market infrastructure, the fact that the P&G business does not really have a local manufacturing infrastructure postdeal and doesn't really have a good go-to-market infrastructure is seriously handicapping, just taking over the P&G business. So it really is a massive accelerator for us. The other good thing about Hypermarcas is, it's a proven management team. They're gaining share as we speak in practically every category that they operate. And so I genuinely believe that this is a massive accelerator for us to be successful even in not in the long term, even in the medium term in Brazil. Clearly, the first job is to absorb these new business -- absorb Coty and then the P&G business. That's the first job. And then shortly thereafter, I would hope that we are going to see an acceleration in terms of the whole platform."

I think we are not ready yet to share the synergies, but in terms of one-off costs and CapEx, it is a significant enabler into the transaction.

It's not the same. Mass continues to do well in Color Cosmetics. Does not do very well in Fragrance. Retail is focused on Beauty Business. Clearly, that depends on what retailer you talk about. Some retailers are getting increasingly better at it. For instance, the drug trade in the U.S., some drug retailers are doing a substantially better business than they did before on the overall beauty business. Digital engagement on core brands, digital, we are in a phase where we're trying to transform the business to enter to digital world as accepting it, that it is a core component of the entire business.

So I think in terms of A&CP spending, as you know, we make a distinction between what we really think is strategic spend and nonstrategic spend, the difference being that strategic spend is actually what the consumer sees. Nonstrategic spend is kind of like the money we waste in the office. So clearly, producing a commercial is nonstrategic spend because the consumer doesn't see it. So clearly, the actual airing of a commercial would be strategic spend. Strategic spend, other things would be, it like the furniture that we use in Color Cosmetics in stores or the beauty assistants that we use on the Fragrance business. So those are all basically strategic components. I can tell you that the strategic spend is substantially increasing, in particular, because we're seeing -- we've cut the nonstrategic spend. And on top of that, even within strategic spend, we've gotten greater efficiencies in the media buying area. So overall, the output is substantially increasing. Clearly, I would have liked to see a bigger response to that in terms of top line growth.

We are going to anniversary that substantial share of gain in the second half of this year. So we're going to see a little bit more of a flattening out of the growth profile, clearly in terms of Color Cosmetics for Coty as a result because we are going to index year-on-year. So but the nail category is largely flat in the U.S. for the time being while we are gaining share. Clearly, we are working on initiatives to further enhance category growth and the market share for Sally Hansen. OPI is a very different business. OPI really should not be in a very massive way into retail because mostly salon brand. And like I already detailed to you, we are rationalizing some of the OPI business outside of salon simply because we believe that this is salon brand, and it's a brand that salon owners should be proud of to use.  And we don't want to see a proliferation across many channels of this brand's. Here the effort is very much in terms of driving, both category and share within salons. And there are different segments, which are relevant in that and we're working on innovations, which it's too early for me to discuss. Marc Jacobs and Calvin Klein, so in terms of special retailers, yes, there's a promotional arena out there in terms of the high-end retailers around Christmas as we will know, in particular because online, I don't have to tell you, it is in it's increasing percentage of the total markets.

And my second question has to do with -- it was very helpful that what you mentioned, the -- about Hypermarcas and what is the rationale about Hypermarcas acquisition. Could you tell us, based on that and also heading towards the integration with Procter, whether there are some geographies that you feel that you need to invest more ahead of the deal to get that kind of go-to-market capability in place ahead of the deal?"

So our performance measurement going forward is not going to be so much by channel. Is really going to be by category. So on the Luxury Division is going to be responsible for Fragrance and Skin Care. And so we'll be reporting in Fragrance and Skin Care Business. Our Consumer Beauty business is going to be responsible for Color Cosmetics, Hair Coloring and Styling as well as Body Care in the mass retail channel, and we're going to report it as such and finally we are going to have a professional business, which is going to report. So it is the combination of category and channel. So in terms of the category performance, I already detailed a little bit what the market growth rates are. So if you look at the overall growth rate of the current business, and I have to exclude hair coloring and retailing, styling because I don't have the data at this stage, we have some data, but I'm not comfortable enough to discuss those with you today. If you look at the overall market growth rate in Beauty in North America and Europe, at the moment, is probably slightly north of 1%. You're going to see in Fragrance business, which is flat to marginally up with basically prestige growing faster the mass. And then you see in Skin care business, which is now growing at a much more modest rate in the low single digits and in Color Cosmetics business -- category, which is still doing reasonably well, growing several percentage points, with basically nail more flattish and with the other parts still showing very healthy growth. And that gives you a rough basically perspective on a category basis. On basically Hypermarcas and other geographies, so I don't have to tell you that still today, and including the P&G transaction, we are still predominantly a North America and a Western European business or European business. So -- which is still the bulk of our business. So we need to, over time, increase our exposure to developing markets. I know this is, maybe most recently not the hardest story developing markets, but over time, longer term, developing markets, in our mind, remain markets with higher growth rates. And this is also why, clearly, we did the Hypermarcas transaction because we believe that this is going to be growth-accretive over time. And will come as no surprise considering our minimal presence we still have in Asia and in Africa and Middle East, we also need to expand in those geographies. So hope that answers your question."

This morning, we'll provide you with a brief update on the expected merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business, other corporate developments and Q2 and year-to-date results. Then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions. 
Our efforts right now are all about creating a very healthy platform for Coty to become the strong leader and challenger in the beauty industry that we aim for it to be. This quarter, we made good progress on that objective, both on the merger acquisition front and the underlying Coty business side.
Starting with the core Coty business. Q2 showed continued improvement in business fundamentals. Coty revenue trends remain muted with a 1% like-for-like decline, and we do expect the Q2 trend to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year as we continue to rationalize nonstrategic product lines and businesses. However, and encouragingly, power brands experienced solid mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter, very much helped by our strategy of focusing and investing in these key brands.
We also continue to show strong momentum in driving profit and cash flow generation. Our year-to-date operating profit grew high single digits, with adjusted operating income growing 13% at constant currency, an impressive growth in operating margin. At the same time, our strong networking capital improvement contributed to significant growth in free cash flow generation. These results show that we can continue to build a healthier and better business despite subdued revenue growth performance.
On the merger and acquisition side, we've made good progress on our Bourjois acquisition. As of today, the local Bourjois businesses have been integrated within Coty local subsidiaries. Also, Bourjois and Coty processes as well as information technology are now fully aligned We continue to see good growth opportunities for this brand and remain confident that it will be margin-accretive to our call of business in fiscal 2017. 
Since announcing the acquisition of Beamly in the second quarter, these top quality leaders in this Digital Marketing company have started to engage and work with the Coty brands on several digital campaigns. We are confident, by bringing in Beamly's cutting-edge digital engagement platform in-house. We will continue to strengthen Coty's marketing and branding efforts.
In addition, we announced on February 1 the completion of the acquisition of the Hypermarcas Beauty & Personal Care business. As a reminder, Hypermarcas is a highly profitable business, with operating margins above Coty levels. This transaction will strengthen Coty's exposure to Brazil, which is one of the largest and growing beauty markets in the world.  We believe it will also provide an excellent platform to integrate the existing small Coty business and the sizable P&G Specialty Beauty Business in Brazil. 
And as announced last week, we signed a new fragrance license agreement with Tiffany & Co., an international renowned jeweler, which we believe will further strengthen our future position as the industry leader in fragrances.
On the P&G Specialty Beauty Business merger, we confirm the transfer of 10 P&G fragrance licenses, including global powerhouses such as Hugo Boss, Gucci and Lacoste. We are making excellent progress to close the P&G Specialty Beauty Business merger in the second half of calendar 2016, and we are happy to report that we have received antitrust approval from the U.S., among other countries. And we are actively engaged in discussions with the EU antitrust authorities. We have also materially advanced on structuring and staffing our future organization and are well advanced in setting up the teams and work streams supporting our IT system requirements and blueprinting the integration plan for the combined businesses. 
And as I discussed on the last call, we believe the new consumer-centric and category-focused organizational structure, our strong brand portfolio, together with our new leadership team, will position Coty well to realize its ambition of becoming a true leader and challenger in the beauty industry and drive profitable growth and shareholder value over time. 
I will now hand over the call to Patrice."

Total Q2 net revenues declined 1% like-for-like, with an improvement in the Fragrance segment trends compared to Q1, and a solid Color Cosmetics segment growth with -- in spite of the decline of the U.S. main market. I'm happy to report that fiscal year to date, the adjusted gross margin increased a very strong 130 basis points to 60.9%, reflecting our continuous effort in driving supply chain efficiencies and reducing discounting activity.
We keep on building a better business even in the face of soft topline trends, with adjusted operating income growing 5% fiscal year-to-date, with a much more substantial 13% increase at constant currency. The year-to-date adjusted operating margin at actual rate grew 160 basis points with meaningful margin increase in Color Cosmetics up 330 basis points and Skin & Body Care up 420 basis points. The Fragrance segment margin increased 20 basis points to 20.2%.
As we discussed on the last call, given the market conditions in our global footprint, FX continued to pressure our revenues and operating income. Fiscal year-to-date, FX lowered net revenues and operating income by over 600 basis points. 
Our year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS was $0.98 compared to $0.73 in the prior year, reflecting, in part, the benefit from the favorable tax settlement  of $113.3 million this year compared to a $32.5 million settlement in the prior year period. Our Global Efficiency program remains on track, as we have recognized cumulative savings of approximately $170 million through the second quarter of fiscal 2016, driven by fixed cost reduction, indirect procurement savings, footprint consolidation and more streamlined operations in China. As a reminder, we expect to generate savings of approximately $270 million through fiscal '17.
On the balance sheet, as a reminder, we closed on a $4.5 billion credit facility this quarter to refinance existing Coty debt with new borrowings subject to longer maturities. As of today, we have swapped approximately 40% of our outstanding net floating rate debt into fixed rates at an owning [ph] cost below 3%, with an average maturities between 3 and 5 years. 
In addition, certain lenders have committed to loan up to $4.5 billion to an affiliate of P&G, which is expected to be conveyed to Coty in connection with the expected merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business.
With regard to the merger, the initial filing of our registration statement in connection with the transaction is expected to be filed in April. This registration document will include historical financial information for the beauty brands we are acquiring from P&G through December 31, 2015.
Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation allowed us to continue to advance on our strategic and financial objectives.
I'm very happy to report that fiscal year-to-date, we generated $517.1 million in operating cash flow and $438.7 million in free cash flow, each up over $160 million versus the prior year. Supported by this strong cash flow generation, we completed our $700 million share buyback program during the second quarter. In total, this fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 26 million Class A shares, and we also returned almost $90 million of cash to shareholders as dividends.
We also announced this morning that the Board has authorized an incremental $500 million of share repurchase program. We will remain opportunistic in the way we use this authorization. It further supports our commitment to return cash to shareholders.
Finally, on February 1, we completed the acquisition of Hypermarcas Beauty & Personal Care business, which we believe, as Bart said, will be a great platform to integrate our current and future business in Brazil. We are very excited to expand our footprint in Brazil with this portfolio of leading brands. 
The execution of the Bourjois acquisition, in line with our expectations as well as the timely closing of the Hypermarcas acquisition demonstrate our ability to successfully execute on our M&A growth strategy.
Thank you. I will now open the call for questions."

So 4 of the 47 brands have already been sold or discontinued by P&G. Second, we also understand that negative FX impacts accounted for a very substantial component of the reported decline in the sales of these 47 brands. Third, we also understand that the organic growth rate of the 41 brands we are acquiring is in line with the like-for-like trends that we are seeing in the Coty business, both for Q2 fiscal '16 and year-to-date.

So when I say rationalization of the portfolio, I'm really referring to several items. First, there is a rationalization of very small brands, which sit in the tail of the portfolio. But there's also a discontinuation of certain lines, business lines or product lines of brands, in particular, when they're in places where we don't want to really see them. I'll give you a classic example. Selling OPI nail polish in hardware stores is probably not the smartest idea we could do as a company which is passionate about beauty. And so there is also a rationalization of some businesses in locations where it shouldn't be. So it is both basically a rationalization of small brands and taking out kind of like business situations and to clean that up.

Before we start talking about more deals, as you know, we have a few basically to execute at the moment. So I'm going to refrain from commenting on new deals. The Hypermarcas business is really a critical business enabler, both basically in the P&G transaction as well as to establish a long-term interesting business in Brazil. And the reason for that is very, very straightforward. The Coty business is very, very small, and therefore, has a very subcritical mass infrastructure. The P&G business is a carve out, and as a result, has a very much of a subcritical mass infrastructure. Just to give you some perspective, the P&G transaction in Brazil would have come with one salesperson. I don't have to tell you that that's not good enough to run a Brazilian business. So the Hypermarcas organization is a full fledged infrastructure business. It has everything. It has a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and logistics infrastructure. It has also a state-of-the-art, basically, go-to-market infrastructure and a management team which has proven to be successful in the market from a market share point of view. So as we speak, we are starting to integrate the Coty business into Hypermarcas. And then once that's done, they will get ready to integrate the P&G business. So Hypermarcas is really the main body that is going to be used in order to integrate and the Coty business and the P&G business, rather than Hypermarcas not integrated in Coty. Really, Coty is being integrated into Hypermarcas. Clearly, it gets renamed Coty, but just to be crystal clear, from a critical mass point of view, that's where the point of gravity lies, and that's very much of an enabler to get the deals done as well as to have a healthy business platform going forward."

In markets like Brazil, if you don't have your own manufacturing infrastructure and your own go-to-market infrastructure, it is very difficult to be successful as a major multinational company because you cannot basically work with third parties in these 2 areas. So it is a massive accelerator. The fact that Coty doesn't have its own manufacturing infrastructure and has a substandard go-to-market infrastructure, the fact that the P&G business does not really have a local manufacturing infrastructure postdeal and doesn't really have a good go-to-market infrastructure is seriously handicapping just taking over the P&G business. So it really is a massive accelerator for us. The other good thing about Hypermarcas is, it's a proven management team. They're gaining share as we speak in practically every category that they operate. And so I genuinely believe that this is a massive accelerator for us to be successful even in -- not in the long term, even in the medium term in Brazil. Clearly, the first job is to absorb these new business -- absorb Coty and then the P&G business. That's the first job. But then shortly thereafter, I would hope that we are going to see an acceleration in terms of the whole platform."

It does not do very well in Fragrance. Retailers focus on Beauty Business, clearly, that depends on what retailer you talk about. Some retailers are getting increasingly better at it. For instance, the drug trade in the U.S., some drug retailers are doing a substantially better business than they did before on the overall beauty business.

So I think in terms of A&CP spending, as you know, we make a distinction between what we really think is strategic spend and nonstrategic spend, the difference being that strategic spend is actually what the consumer sees. Nonstrategic spend is kind of like the money we waste in the office. So clearly, producing a commercial is nonstrategic spend because the consumer doesn't see it. So clearly, the actual airing of a commercial would be strategic spend. Strategic spend, other things would be, is like the furniture that we use in Color Cosmetics in stores or the beauty assistants that we use on the Fragrance business. So those are all basically strategic components. I can tell you that the strategic spend is substantially increasing, in particular, because we're seeing -- we've cut the nonstrategic spend. And on top of that, even within the strategic spend, we've gotten greater efficiencies in the media buying area. So overall, the output is substantially increasing. Clearly, I would have liked to see a bigger response to that in terms of top line growth.

One is what happens at retail, and the other one is what happens in salons. So in terms of retail, which should be the predominant domain of -- or is the domain of Sally Hansen. So the nail category, at the moment, is largely flat. Sally Hansen, as you well know, has done extremely well behind the launch of Miracle Gel, has gained substantial share. We are going to anniversary that substantial share gain in the second half of this year. So we're going to see a little bit more of a flattening out of the growth profile, clearly in terms of Color Cosmetics for Coty as a result because we are going to index year-on-year. So but the nail category is largely flat in the U.S. for the time being while we are gaining share. Clearly, we are working on initiatives to further enhance category growth and the market share for Sally Hansen. OPI is a very different business. OPI really should not be in a very massive way into retail because it's mostly a salon brand. And like I already detailed to you, we are rationalizing some of the OPI business outside of salon simply because we believe that this is a salon brand, and it's a brand that salon owners should be proud of to use.  And we don't want to see a proliferation across many channels of this brand. Here the effort is very much in terms of driving, both category and share within salons. And there are different segments which are relevant in that and we're working on innovations, which it's too early for me to discuss. Marc Jacobs and Calvin Klein, so in terms of specialty retailers, yes, there's a promotional arena out there in terms of the high-end retailers around Christmas as we well know, in particular because online, I don't have to tell you, is an increasing percentage of the total market. And so that's not changing. As you've seen from our results, we have stayed largely above the fray in this area. And hopefully, by investing, really investing in consumer pull promotion -- in consumer pull rather than discounting, we are going to continue to stay above the fray."

So basically, Professional, Luxury and Consumer. If you can tell us, which channels you are doing better and what would be the growth rate vis-a-vis the minus 1 like-for-like and what is, you believe, the channel growth in general. And my second question has to do with -- it was very helpful that what you mentioned about Hypermarcas and what is the rationale about the Hypermarcas acquisition. Could you tell us, based on that and also heading towards the integration with Procter, whether there are some geographies that you feel that you need to invest more ahead of the deal to get that kind of go-to-market capability in place ahead of the deal?"

So our performance measurement going forward is not going to be so much by channel. It is really going to be by category. So the Luxury Division is going to be responsible for Fragrance and Skin Care. And so we'll be reporting in Fragrance and Skin Care Business. Our Consumer Beauty business is going to be responsible for Color Cosmetics, Hair Coloring and Styling as well as Body Care in the mass retail channel, and we're going to report it as such and finally we are going to have a Professional business, which is going to report. So it is a combination of category and channel. So in terms of the category performance, I already detailed a little bit what the market growth rates are. So if you look at the overall growth rate of the current business, and I have to exclude hair coloring and retailing -- styling because I don't have the data at this stage, we have some data, but I'm not comfortable enough to discuss those with you today. If you look at the overall market growth rate in Beauty in North America and Europe, at the moment, it's probably slightly north of 1%. You're going to see a Fragrance business which is flat to marginally up with basically prestige growing faster the mass. And then you see a Skin care business which is now growing at a much more modest rate in the low single digits and a Color Cosmetics business -- category, which is still doing reasonably well, growing several percentage points, with basically nail more flattish and with the other parts still showing very healthy growth. And that gives you a rough, basically, perspective on a category basis. On basically Hypermarcas and other geographies, so I don't have to tell you that still today, and including the P&G transaction, we are still predominantly a North America and a Western European business or a European business, which is still the bulk of our business. So we need to, over time, increase our exposure to developing markets. I know this is, maybe most recently not the hottest story, developing markets, but over time, longer term, developing markets, in our mind, remain markets with higher growth rates. And this is also why, clearly, we did the Hypermarcas transaction because we believe that this is going to be growth-accretive over time. And it will come as no surprise considering our minimal presence we still have in Asia and in Africa, Middle East, we also need to expand in those geographies. So I hope that answers your question."

This morning, we'll provide you with a brief update on the expected merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business, other corporate developments and Q2 and year-to-date results. Then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions. 
Our efforts right now are all about creating a very healthy platform for Coty to become the strong leader and challenger in the beauty industry that we aim for it to be. This quarter, we made good progress on that objective, both on the merger acquisition front and the underlying Coty business side.
Starting with the core Coty business. Q2 showed continued improvement in business fundamentals. Coty revenue trends remain muted with a 1% like-for-like decline, and we do expect the Q2 trend to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year as we continue to rationalize nonstrategic product lines and businesses. However, and encouragingly, power brands experienced solid mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter, very much helped by our strategy of focusing and investing in these key brands.
We also continue to show strong momentum in driving profit and cash flow generation. Our year-to-date operating profit grew high single digits, with adjusted operating income growing 13% at constant currency, an impressive growth in operating margin. At the same time, our strong networking capital improvement contributed to significant growth in free cash flow generation. These results show that we can continue to build a healthier and better business despite subdued revenue growth performance.
On the merger and acquisition side, we've made good progress on our Bourjois acquisition. As of today, the local Bourjois businesses have been integrated within Coty local subsidiaries. Also, Bourjois and Coty processes as well as information technology are now fully aligned We continue to see good growth opportunities for this brand and remain confident that it will be margin-accretive to our call of business in fiscal 2017. 
Since announcing the acquisition of Beamly in the second quarter, these top quality leaders in this Digital Marketing company have started to engage and work with the Coty brands on several digital campaigns. We are confident, by bringing in Beamly's cutting-edge digital engagement platform in-house. We will continue to strengthen Coty's marketing and branding efforts.
In addition, we announced on February 1 the completion of the acquisition of the Hypermarcas Beauty & Personal Care business. As a reminder, Hypermarcas is a highly profitable business, with operating margins above Coty levels. This transaction will strengthen Coty's exposure to Brazil, which is one of the largest and growing beauty markets in the world.  We believe it will also provide an excellent platform to integrate the existing small Coty business and the sizable P&G Specialty Beauty Business in Brazil. 
And as announced last week, we signed a new fragrance license agreement with Tiffany & Co., an international renowned jeweler, which we believe will further strengthen our future position as the industry leader in fragrances.
On the P&G Specialty Beauty Business merger, we confirm the transfer of 10 P&G fragrance licenses, including global powerhouses such as Hugo Boss, Gucci and Lacoste. We are making excellent progress to close the P&G Specialty Beauty Business merger in the second half of calendar 2016, and we are happy to report that we have received antitrust approval from the U.S., among other countries. And we are actively engaged in discussions with the EU antitrust authorities. We have also materially advanced on structuring and staffing our future organization and are well advanced in setting up the teams and work streams supporting our IT system requirements and blueprinting the integration plan for the combined businesses. 
And as I discussed on the last call, we believe the new consumer-centric and category-focused organizational structure, our strong brand portfolio, together with our new leadership team, will position Coty well to realize its ambition of becoming a true leader and challenger in the beauty industry and drive profitable growth and shareholder value over time. 
I will now hand over the call to Patrice."

Total Q2 net revenues declined 1% like-for-like, with an improvement in the Fragrance segment trends compared to Q1, and a solid Color Cosmetics segment growth with -- in spite of the decline of the U.S. main market. I'm happy to report that fiscal year to date, the adjusted gross margin increased a very strong 130 basis points to 60.9%, reflecting our continuous effort in driving supply chain efficiencies and reducing discounting activity.
We keep on building a better business even in the face of soft topline trends, with adjusted operating income growing 5% fiscal year-to-date, with a much more substantial 13% increase at constant currency. The year-to-date adjusted operating margin at actual rate grew 160 basis points with meaningful margin increase in Color Cosmetics up 330 basis points and Skin & Body Care up 420 basis points. The Fragrance segment margin increased 20 basis points to 20.2%.
As we discussed on the last call, given the market conditions in our global footprint, FX continued to pressure our revenues and operating income. Fiscal year-to-date, FX lowered net revenues and operating income by over 600 basis points. 
Our year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS was $0.98 compared to $0.73 in the prior year, reflecting, in part, the benefit from the favorable tax settlement  of $113.3 million this year compared to a $32.5 million settlement in the prior year period. Our Global Efficiency program remains on track, as we have recognized cumulative savings of approximately $170 million through the second quarter of fiscal 2016, driven by fixed cost reduction, indirect procurement savings, footprint consolidation and more streamlined operations in China. As a reminder, we expect to generate savings of approximately $270 million through fiscal '17.
On the balance sheet, as a reminder, we closed on a $4.5 billion credit facility this quarter to refinance existing Coty debt with new borrowings subject to longer maturities. As of today, we have swapped approximately 40% of our outstanding net floating rate debt into fixed rates at an all-in cost below 3%, with an average maturities between 3 and 5 years. 
In addition, certain lenders have committed to loan up to $4.5 billion to an affiliate of P&G, which is expected to be conveyed to Coty in connection with the expected merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business.
With regard to the merger, the initial filing of our registration statement in connection with the transaction is expected to be filed in April. This registration document will include historical financial information for the beauty brands we are acquiring from P&G through December 31, 2015.
Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation allowed us to continue to advance on our strategic and financial objectives.
I'm very happy to report that fiscal year-to-date, we generated $517.1 million in operating cash flow and $438.7 million in free cash flow, each up over $160 million versus the prior year. Supported by this strong cash flow generation, we completed our $700 million share buyback program during the second quarter. In total, this fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 26 million Class A shares, and we also returned almost $90 million of cash to shareholders as dividends.
We also announced this morning that the Board has authorized an incremental $500 million of share repurchase program. We will remain opportunistic in the way we use this authorization. It further supports our commitment to return cash to shareholders.
Finally, on February 1, we completed the acquisition of Hypermarcas Beauty & Personal Care business, which we believe, as Bart said, will be a great platform to integrate our current and future business in Brazil. We are very excited to expand our footprint in Brazil with this portfolio of leading brands. 
The execution of the Bourjois acquisition, in line with our expectations as well as the timely closing of the Hypermarcas acquisition demonstrate our ability to successfully execute on our M&A growth strategy.
Thank you. I will now open the call for questions."

So 4 of the 47 brands have already been sold or discontinued by P&G. Second, we also understand that negative FX impacts accounted for a very substantial component of the reported decline in the sales of these 47 brands.

So when I say rationalization of the portfolio, I'm really referring to several items. First, there is a rationalization of very small brands, which sit in the tail of the portfolio. But there's also a discontinuation of certain lines, business lines or product lines of brands, in particular, when they're in places where we don't want to really see them. I'll give you a classic example. Selling OPI nail polish in hardware stores is probably not the smartest idea we could do as a company which is passionate about beauty. And so there is also a rationalization of some businesses in locations where it shouldn't be. So it is both basically a rationalization of small brands and taking out kind of like business situations and to clean that up.

Before we start talking about more deals, as you know, we have a few basically to execute at the moment. So I'm going to refrain from commenting on new deals. The Hypermarcas business is really a critical business enabler, both basically in the P&G transaction as well as to establish a long-term interesting business in Brazil. And the reason for that is very, very straightforward. The Coty business is very, very small, and therefore, has a very subcritical mass infrastructure. The P&G business is a carve out, and as a result, has a very much of a subcritical mass infrastructure. Just to give you some perspective, the P&G transaction in Brazil would have come with one salesperson. I don't have to tell you that that's not good enough to run a Brazilian business. So the Hypermarcas organization is a full-fledged infrastructure business. It has everything. It has a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and logistics infrastructure. It has also a state-of-the-art, basically, go-to-market infrastructure and a management team which has proven to be successful in the market from a market share point of view. So as we speak, we are starting to integrate the Coty business into Hypermarcas. And then once that's done, they will get ready to integrate the P&G business. So Hypermarcas is really the main body that is going to be used in order to integrate and the Coty business and the P&G business, rather than Hypermarcas not integrated in Coty. Really, Coty is being integrated into Hypermarcas. Clearly, it gets renamed Coty, but just to be crystal clear, from a critical mass point of view, that's where the point of gravity lies, and that's very much of an enabler to get the deals done as well as to have a healthy business platform going forward."

In markets like Brazil, if you don't have your own manufacturing infrastructure and your own go-to-market infrastructure, it is very difficult to be successful as a major multinational company because you cannot basically work with third parties in these 2 areas. So it is a massive accelerator. The fact that Coty doesn't have its own manufacturing infrastructure and has a substandard go-to-market infrastructure, the fact that the P&G business does not really have a local manufacturing infrastructure postdeal and doesn't really have a good go-to-market infrastructure is seriously handicapping just taking over the P&G business. So it really is a massive accelerator for us. The other good thing about Hypermarcas is, it's a proven management team. They're gaining share as we speak in practically every category that they operate. And so I genuinely believe that this is a massive accelerator for us to be successful even in -- not in the long term, even in the medium term in Brazil. Clearly, the first job is to absorb these new business -- absorb Coty and then the P&G business. That's the first job.

I think we are not ready yet to share the synergies, but in terms of one-off costs and CapEx, it is a significant enabler into the transaction. So we will be able to cost operate with the goods already in Brazil, which significantly helps. So I think you need to think about it from a more strategic standpoint and more long-term standpoint.

It does not do very well in Fragrance. Retailers focus on Beauty Business, clearly, that depends on what retailer you talk about. Some retailers are getting increasingly better at it.

So I think in terms of A&CP spending, as you know, we make a distinction between what we really think is strategic spend and nonstrategic spend, the difference being that strategic spend is actually what the consumer sees. Nonstrategic spend is kind of like the money we waste in the office. So clearly, producing a commercial is nonstrategic spend because the consumer doesn't see it. So clearly, the actual airing of a commercial would be strategic spend. Strategic spend, other things would be, is like the furniture that we use in Color Cosmetics in stores or the beauty assistants that we use on the Fragrance business. So those are all basically strategic components. I can tell you that the strategic spend is substantially increasing, in particular, because we're seeing -- we've cut the nonstrategic spend. And on top of that, even within the strategic spend, we've gotten greater efficiencies in the media buying area. So overall, the output is substantially increasing.

One is what happens at retail, and the other one is what happens in salons. So in terms of retail, which should be the predominant domain of -- or is the domain of Sally Hansen. So the nail category, at the moment, is largely flat. Sally Hansen, as you well know, has done extremely well behind the launch of Miracle Gel, has gained substantial share. We are going to anniversary that substantial share gain in the second half of this year. So we're going to see a little bit more of a flattening out of the growth profile, clearly in terms of Color Cosmetics for Coty as a result because we are going to index year-on-year. So but the nail category is largely flat in the U.S. for the time being while we are gaining share. Clearly, we are working on initiatives to further enhance category growth and the market share for Sally Hansen. OPI is a very different business. OPI really should not be in a very massive way into retail because it's mostly a salon brand. And like I already detailed to you, we are rationalizing some of the OPI business outside of salon simply because we believe that this is a salon brand, and it's a brand that salon owners should be proud of to use.  And we don't want to see a proliferation across many channels of this brand. Here the effort is very much in terms of driving, both category and share within salons. And there are different segments which are relevant in that and we're working on innovations, which it's too early for me to discuss. Marc Jacobs and Calvin Klein, so in terms of specialty retailers, yes, there's a promotional arena out there in terms of the high-end retailers around Christmas as we well know, in particular because online, I don't have to tell you, is an increasing percentage of the total market. And so that's not changing. As you've seen from our results, we have stayed largely above the fray in this area. And hopefully, by investing, really investing in consumer pull promotion -- in consumer pull rather than discounting, we are going to continue to stay above the fray."

So basically, Professional, Luxury and Consumer. If you can tell us, which channels you are doing better and what would be the growth rate vis-a-vis the minus 1 like-for-like and what is, you believe, the channel growth in general. And my second question has to do with -- it was very helpful that what you mentioned about Hypermarcas and what is the rationale about the Hypermarcas acquisition. Could you tell us, based on that and also heading towards the integration with Procter, whether there are some geographies that you feel that you need to invest more ahead of the deal to get that kind of go-to-market capability in place ahead of the deal?"

So our performance measurement going forward is not going to be so much by channel. It is really going to be by category. So the Luxury Division is going to be responsible for Fragrance and Skin Care. And so we'll be reporting in Fragrance and Skin Care Business. Our Consumer Beauty business is going to be responsible for Color Cosmetics, Hair Coloring and Styling as well as Body Care in the mass retail channel, and we're going to report it as such and finally we are going to have a Professional business, which is going to report. So it is a combination of category and channel. So in terms of the category performance, I already detailed a little bit what the market growth rates are. So if you look at the overall growth rate of the current business, and I have to exclude hair coloring and retailing -- styling because I don't have the data at this stage, we have some data, but I'm not comfortable enough to discuss those with you today. If you look at the overall market growth rate in Beauty in North America and Europe, at the moment, it's probably slightly north of 1%. You're going to see a Fragrance business which is flat to marginally up with basically prestige growing faster the mass. And then you see a Skin care business which is now growing at a much more modest rate in the low single digits and a Color Cosmetics business -- category, which is still doing reasonably well, growing several percentage points, with basically nail more flattish and with the other parts still showing very healthy growth. And that gives you a rough, basically, perspective on a category basis. On basically Hypermarcas and other geographies, so I don't have to tell you that still today, and including the P&G transaction, we are still predominantly a North America and a Western European business or a European business, which is still the bulk of our business. So we need to, over time, increase our exposure to developing markets. I know this is, maybe most recently not the hottest story, developing markets, but over time, longer term, developing markets, in our mind, remain markets with higher growth rates. And this is also why, clearly, we did the Hypermarcas transaction because we believe that this is going to be growth-accretive over time. And it will come as no surprise considering our minimal presence we still have in Asia and in Africa, Middle East, we also need to expand in those geographies. So I hope that answers your question."

This morning, we will provide you with a brief overview of Q3 and year-to-date results as well as the detailed updates on the P&G Beauty Brands transaction. 
Our efforts to create a healthy platform for Coty to become a strong global leader and challenger in beauty remains on track. Q3 revenues, which declined minus 1% on a like-for-like basis, were consistent with our expectations from muted like-for-like trends through the end of the fiscal year as we gradually rationalized nonstrategic product lines and businesses. Power brands, on the other hand, continued to outperform the overall business, both for the quarter and year-to-date. While Q3 adjusted operating profit was down to one-off items, including the negative impact on the Brazilian Beauty Business as a result of a change in commercial terms to confirm -- conform with Coty's standards, our year-to-date adjusted operating profit was flat with solid 7% growth at constant currency. For the full fiscal 2016, we continue to expect like-for-like revenue performance relatively consistent with the year-to-date trends. We anticipate high single digit growth in adjusted operating income at constant rates for the full year, offset by negative FX impact with the adjusted operating income in line with the prior year at actual rates. These results and outlook are consistent with our strategy to build a healthier and better business despite subdued revenue growth. 
In summary, we believe we are well on track to build a healthy platform for Coty to become a global leader and challenger in the beauty industry and provide the right basis to drive profitable growth and deliver shareholder value over time. 
I will now hand over the call to Patrice."

Total Q3 net revenues declined 1% like-for-like with an improvement in the [indiscernible] segment revenue trends compared to the first half and moderate Color Cosmetics segment growth in spite of the decline in the U.S. retail nail market. 
Fiscal year-to-date, the adjusted gross margin increased a very strong 110 basis points to 61.2%, reflecting our continuous efforts in driving supply chain efficiencies. We keep on building a better business even in the face of soft top line trends with stable adjusted operating income fiscal year-to-date, with a stronger 7% increase at constant currency. The year-to-date adjusted operating margin grew 40 basis points. Our year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS was $1.08 compared to $0.91 in the prior year, in part reflecting the benefit from a favorable back settlement of $113.3 million this year compared to a $32.5 million settlement in the prior year period. 
Turning to the cash flow structure. We took the opportunity to raise an incremental EUR 465 million in term loans, and used the proceeds to partially repay the borrowings under our revolving credit facility that was drawn to fund acquisition of the Brazilian Beauty Business. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation allowed us to continue to advance on our strategic and financial objectives. Fiscal year-to-date, we generated $445.3 million in operating cash flow and $330 million in free cash flow, with free cash flow up over $100 million versus the prior year. 
During the quarter, we did not repurchase any share and expect to remain opportunistic with our existing $500 million share repurchase authorization. 
This concludes our discussion of our Q3 and fiscal year-to-date results. Bart and I will now take a couple of questions on the results, after which, w will provide you with a comprehensive update on the P&G Beauty Brands transaction."

Hypermarcas has very long basically payment terms for its customers. In addition, provided substantial discounts at month end and quarter end in order to make the numbers. We have corrected for that and put the customers much more on a Coty type policy. So what does that mean? That clearly means that the payment days or the receivable days for customers are coming down substantially, and also basically in the month end and quarter end discounts will be largely eliminated. The result of that is substantial reduction of trading and tories in Brazil. They were well over 100 days in the trade and practically cutting half. So clearly, that has an impact from the revenues. Just to reassure you, the consumption growth in Brazil remains very good. It remains ahead of the market. It remains basically in the double-digit range. So it is not an issue basically of sellout. It's a temporary issue of sell in because of the adjustment of commercial terms. I think you should expect that as basically we go forward, this gradually basically goes back to a normal level.

It clearly differs very much by market. For instance, clearly if you take the established market like U.S., U.K. and some other European countries, you see very high consumption go-to-market and you see much less consumption. So there's a substantial increase in digital happening as we speak. So I would say the gap is going to be close in the next 12 to 18 months."

First, we are going to confirm the strategic rationale of the transaction. We're going to provide an update on the transaction and the progress we have made around this",1073,"So in terms of the update on the transaction, we're really going to cover 3 subjects. First, we are going to confirm the strategic rationale of the transaction. We're going to provide an update on the transaction and the progress we have made around this on a year-to-date basis. And finally, we're going to provide an update on the financial benefit of the merger with the P&G specialty business. 
So next page please. So first, before I give the strategic rationale one more time, let me first highlight what Coty's ambition is in the beauty, is to really to transform Coty over time into a new global leader and challenger in the beauty industry, clearly, with -- or for the ultimate benefit of the shareholders. 
Now in that respect, the P&G merger clearly is a very good step in that direction. We are creating with the merger a $9 billion leader and challenger in beauty, becoming the #3 after Loreal and Estee Lauder in the industry. 
Not only do we create a much more of a scale player in beauty, we're also creating the worldwide #1 in fragrance, the next slide please. As you can see basically from the slide, which is now on the screen. So you can see that we are becoming well ahead basically of Loreal in terms of market position. In terms of Color Cosmetics, we are becoming the #3 overall, most likely the #2 basically in mass Color Cosmetics where the number of very good brands as I'll show you in a minute. 
Finally, we are adding the worldwide #2 in hair salon. Clearly, this is a new category for Coty. 
In terms of the portfolio, we are getting a very nice -- nicely balanced portfolio in terms of between categories as well as distribution channels. 
So just to take you very quickly through that. Coty consumer beauty will be 41% of the total business, with roughly $3.8 billion. Very much focused on the mass channel and on 3 categories, which is -- which are: Color Cosmetics; hair retailing, which are hair coloring and styling as well as body care; Coty Luxury, very much focused on the prestige channel and focus on Fragrance and Skin; and Coty Professional, very much focused on the salon channel, focused on hair as well as nail care. 
So a very balanced portfolio both in terms of categories and distribution channels. And most importantly, we've the very strong portfolio of brands. 
You can see Coty Luxury. There you will have the top 3 brands with Calvin Klein, Gucci and Hugo Boss. And consumer beauty, the size of the brands is more evenly balanced. You see some very strong brands like Cover Girl, Rimmel, Max Factor, Sally Hansen, et cetera. And then ultimately, in Coty Professional Beauty, you see 2 main brands, which are entering the business, which are Wella and OPI. 
Not only do we get a very strong portfolio, we're also increase seeing the critical mass across basically our top markets, and importantly, we're increasing critical mass in several of the emerging markets. So Brazil, clearly, that's a very big increase. And but that, that was off a very small base in Brazil. So clearly this doesn't even include Hypermarcas, and Brazil will become a very big market for Coty. 
Russia was a decent sized market, becomes a much bigger market for us. China also becomes a much bigger business for us. So not only are we getting substantial increase in scale in the established markets, but we also increased the scale in a number of the emerging markets. 
So overall, that gives us a very nice basically portfolio with a strong brands and skill benefits in our geographies. 
Can you please go to the previous slide please. Thank you. So it will also provide a very good opportunity to accelerate growth and improve profits and cash flow. 
So from a growth point of view, we will have, going forward, a divisional structure. Why is that important? Because the divisional structure is even much more focused structure than what we have today. So as I already showed you, it will focus very much on a single distribution channel and only 2 to 3 categories per division. And with that, we hope that we are going to get, not just increased focus, we get increased competence, and we get a much more competitive basically capability in place in order to compete in the market. 
We also are going to substantially further increase our focus on sellouts by increased digital consumer engagement, improving the in-store excellence and to drive high levels of product innovations. 
Another topic, which we still have to come to, and which will further detail post in the next couple of months is the rationalization of the portfolio and the wholesale business. Why is that important is because we still need to tighten down the focus on fewer brands and fewer doors in order to drive a higher growth and a better quality business. 
And finally, clearly, from our growth point of view, we will be looking in due time to further acquisitions, and Patrice will highlight this a little bit later. But, clearly, our pro forma financial profile will very much allow us to participate in further acquisition opportunities. 
In a minute, we'll come to profit and cash flow. But, clearly, we're anticipating material earnings per share accretion due to synergies, and we also expect substantial incremental cash flow due to both higher profits as well as [indiscernible] working capital benefits. 
Finally, we will very much, from an incentive system, make sure that the management is very much driving a combination of top line growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation. And we'll do that both through the combination of short-term bonus structure as well as long-term incentives in order to make sure that we are getting a balanced basically focus behind those 3 basically key leaders. 
So that gives you a quick snapshot of the strategic rationale basically for the business. As you can see from the slides I just presented. This is very similar to what we discussed in July. And so we are very much confirming of the strategic rationale of the merger with the P&G business. 
I'm now going to hand over to Patrice who's going to take you through the transaction updates, the progress we've made as well as the financial benefits of the transaction."

So a couple of points on the Slide 13, the transaction summary. So first on the structure. Very much of the same. So transaction proposal was valued at $12.5 billion comprised of $9.6 billion of equity and $2.9 billion of debt. We have a color mechanism of, plus or minus $1 billion, based on the trading price of Coty stock with the range of $22.06 to $27.06, with the middle range of $24.56. Based on the latest share price, and we've assumed here the price on April 13, which was for the S-4 filing of $29.81, Coty estimates that the issuance of 412 million shares and $2 billion of assume debt. The split between the P&G and the Coty shareholders will be 54%-46%. 
So now a few words on the mechanics of the transaction. The preferred option from the P&G side is to do a split off. In a split off, P&G offers its shareholders the option to exchange their shares of P&G common stock per share of the new Coty. 
For the offer to be fully subscribed, 6% of the P&G shares need to be [indiscernible], only 6% of them. In terms of timing, it's sad to say that the transaction is expected to close in the course of the month of October 2016. 
Now next slide for the updates on the progress that we have made. So as you have seen, all of you, so we have filed the S-4 on April 22. We have the uncommissioned antitrust clearance for the EU and the U.S. And we have confirmed the transfer of 10 fragrance licenses. 
Operationally, as Bart said, we have now an organization structure, we have designed an organizational structure with all the associated headcounts and the decisions regarding the locations we mainly made. 
In terms of staffing. The executive committee and the management team of the divisions have been appointed. And we are now going to the next layer. 
In terms of [indiscernible], I will come back to that on few slides, but we've done most of the work. 
In terms of portfolio and wholesale rationalization. It's fair to say that the work is still very much in progress. But what we can say at this stage is that on the portfolio rationalization, in terms of discontinuation and divestments, we would have some discontinuation divestment in the range of 6% to 8% of the combined the portfolio. So I'm sure you're going to have a lot of question on the impact on the data economics, EPS, yes, or no, et cetera, et cetera. We are not ready to answer any of these questions yet, we just want to signal to the market what we have in mind for the time being. Just still work in progress. 
In terms of go-to-market challenge, we are assessing some of the [indiscernible] in emerging markets. And of course, there's an extensive preparation in terms of processes, in terms of systems, in terms of infrastructure. There is 200 people full-time within Coty working on that with a lot of help from experts that has done this type of transaction in the past. So we're very much in motion. 
In terms of financing. So as you all know, Coty entered into a security financing commitment of $4.5 billion. We have used the opportunity to upsized this to $5 billion in last month, actually in April 2016. Galleria, which is wholly-owned by P&G, entered into a secured financing commitments of the same amount, $4.5 billion, expected to be ultimately assumed by Coty upon the close. 
Now back to Bart on the management team."

The only point I'd lik",1742,"Thank you, Bart. So now the financial update. So on Slide 17. 
So certain statements in this presentation are forward-looking statements. So I am not going to go through Calvin already, I alluded to that at the start of the call. 
The only point I'd like to emphasize is the bottom of the page where this acquisition of the P&G Beauty Brands is a complex kind of transaction. And as result of that, the integration efforts might, for a certain period of time, detract us from improving the performance of the underlying business. 
So this being said, the next 4 slides are, I'm sure, slides that most of you are expecting. So we're going to spend a bit of time on that going through these slides. 
So on the Slide #18, on the synergies. So all these 4 slides are really a refresh of the July presentation. So you will see that in the format. We did roughly the same to make sure that you have a comparable base. 
So first of the synergies. So we start from the fiscal '15 adjusted carve out EBITDA coming from P&G, which include already $380 million of synergy that's been [indiscernible] day 1. Then we have the impact of 2 of the license that are not coming with the transaction, so Dolce & Gabbana and Christina Aguilera. So we take $130 million, which is the brand contribution. 
So what is the brand contribution? The brand contribution is the gross margin deducted from all the investment in advertising consumer promotion to support and to nurture the brand. 
Then you have the synergies of $400 million, which is the basis of the July presentation.  So let me spend a little bit of time on this $400 million. 
So first point. Our ongoing position has been to build an organization by division focusing on each of the segments. 
Two, how did we do that? We did that with the bottom-up approach by function and by country. So a very in-depth work. And then we have cost the organization in each of the country, challenged against benchmark-based targets. 
So this is where we landed now with these targeted organization that has been costed. And when you compare the Coty organization versus the P&G organization minus the targeted organization, you come up with the $780 million synergies. So this $780 million synergies represent 16% of the acquired revenues. And we are very much going to be safe with 40% materializing in year 1, 70% after year 2, and 80% after year 3, and then the full synergies after year 4. 
To be able to realize these synergies, we are going to incur $1.2 billion of cost. So let me spend a little bit of time on these costs. 
So first, 90% of them are cash costs. And out of this $1.2 billion, you have 25% that is really related to the specifics of this transaction, which is a combination of the carve-out and the RMT umbrella. So this is roughly $320 million that is related to that. 
So let me give you a couple of examples on these costs. So first, you have the TSE cost. Second, P&G is a highly integrated business with a big GBS shared service center. And so we have to disentangle the P&G Beauty with the rest of the P&G business, which is increasing complexity. And as a result of that, the associated cost. 
Third, the RMT required the business of P&G to be carve-out and then integrated. What does that mean? This mean that we need to settle entering P&G entities and processes that then, after the exit of the [indiscernible], to be unwinded and integrated into the Coty processes. 
And of course, to trained people to be able to do so. 
Fourth, most of the carve out are either increasing the scope, like adding new categories, for instance, or increasing the scale. Actually, we're doing both, which increasing the complexity and then the cost associated to that. So that's roughly what is leading to 25% of the cost, which is the $320 million, which is for us due to this very unusual transaction. 
Second part of this $1.2 billion, you have roughly $135 million that is due to go-to-market [indiscernible] changes that will happen later on. This very much work in progress, but we are going to reset some of our go-to-market, some of the boat market from Galleria. 
The last part, $745 million is directly related to the synergy. So we are generating $780 million synergies with a one-off directly attributed to the synergy with $745 million. And I think this is really the way you should look at it. 
So we are building on the bottom-up basis an organization, which is extremely focused, divisionalized, focusing on their expertise in the respective the segments, by the very lean organization. 
So now what does that mean in terms of operating margin? So first, all the slides do not include aftermarket. So same start as what you have seen in July, but of course, updated. So what do you can see is that you start in the Slide 19 from the stand-alone Coty, which is 12%-plus operating margin. We added the carve-out business from P&G, which added 200 basis points. So we will result in 14% operating margin without touching the business. Then you deduct, which is an impact of 40 basis points, the impact of P&G and Christina Aguilera. And then with all the synergies, we have 430 basis points. So this means that we are going to add 600 basis points with Coty standalone business in operating profit margin over a 4-year period. May include clearly an industry leader at 18% of the margin. Our top peers are in the range of 15% to 17% operating margin percentage. So really, with this transaction, we immediately proposing ourselves to an 18% pro forma operating margin. And this doesn't include Hypermarcas, as I said. 
So now, next slide, what does that mean from an EPS standpoint? So first, this slide exclude the purchase price accounting related to the amortization. And we are currently revisiting the metrics with which we should measure the underlying performance of the business, and in doing so, what we pay attention to is that it needs to be similar to the way we measure the business on a near historical basis. And it also needs to be comparable to our peers. And that's the reason why we are currently assessing and evaluating the options to exclude the purchase price accounting-related amortization. 
So when you go through these slides, you start to see that Coty fiscal '15 adjusted EPS, which is $0.99. Then you have the dilution base addition of sales, which is the same number as what's recorded in July. Then you have the contribution of the P&G business, which is $0.83. That leads to 120 cents to 125 cents. Then you deduct the P&G and the Christina Aguilera brand contribution, which is $0.11. And then you add all the synergies that will generate, which is $0.39. 
What does this means? This means that we will increase by 50% the EPS versus the current standalone Coty business. And I really think this is the way you should look at it. We have a current standalone Coty business, which is in the range of $1 of EPS. And now we'll be more in the range of $150 after this transaction on a pro forma basis. And this is, of course, after we implement all the synergies. So after year 4. 
So now in terms of cash. Cash is king. So Slide 21. So in terms of working capital. So immediately at closing, we will generate -- we will more than double the cash generation of Coty standalone to generate on a free cash flow basis between $800 million and $900 million without further reduction of the working capital. And then you add some analysis that we have made on the working capital, and so we are refreshing this analysis by increasing the working capital synergies from $200 million to $500 million. So $500 million over 4 years. The bulk of that will be realized by the end of fiscal '18. So actually, you have 2 effects on that. The first one is that you have a one-off $500 million cash generation; and the second one is that by doing that, we will be very close to the working capital, which means that the cash conversion ratio is optimal. So your earnings are converting into cash immediately. 
Now in terms of CapEx. So we are increasing by $100 million, the CapEx basis our July assumptions, which is mainly you have 3 main legs into these CapEx of $500 million. You have real estate, because we need to stand out some organization and co-locate the division in most of the market, so that's point 1. Point 2, like in all the transaction, you have a lot of IT infrastructure that we need to build and step up. And it's fair to say that all the work that we have done in the last 2 years is now producing some really good results and is allowing us to avoid some CapEx that will have to add, provided we didn't do anything in the last 2 years. And of course, you have then the supply chain CapEx to be able to spend a couple of factories. 
So 90% of this CapEx will be in fiscal '18, and then we'll come back to a much more normal ratio CapEx, which you could estimate being 4% of top line. 
Now the capital structure. We are slightly increasing the pro forma leverage to 3.2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. Why is that? Because we are the Hypermarcas acquisition and the share buyback program that we have exhibited between the month of July and the month of December fiscal '15. We are going, as we said, the increase the dividend per share to $0.50 postclosing. And so it's clear to me, and it's clear to all of us that we're going to have a combined business with a lot of strength, flexibility with a very lean cost structure, and with a very moderate pro forma leverage of 3 times 2, which, once again, as Bart said, give us ample ammunition to further participate in the consolidation of this business. 
So now I leave the floor to Bart for the wrap up."

You've seen basically the substantial increase in pro forma EPS of roughly $0.50, of more or less $1 where it sits today, so a very substantial increase. It is targeted to generate substantial pro forma free cash flow of about $800 million to $900 million, providing ample flexibility for the future. Post rationalization of Coty's portfolio and wholesale business, which we are working on, the merger creates a clearer opportunity to accelerate growth both organically and by future M&A. And that is very much because we are going to create a different structure for the company, much more focused structure, with a more focused portfolio, with better staffing behind that, and with ample basically support level behind us. 
We have appointed already very strong new management team, which is being well aligned to drive shareholder value. 
So overall, I think I can confirm today that the strategic rationale for the transaction remains -- we've made excellent progress basically from an integration point of view year-to-date. We should be well positioned to absorb this business. And you've seen Patrice take you through the financial -- the financials, which are substantially better than when they were when we announced the transaction.

Just broadly speaking, it feels as if kind of the cost to compete in the makeup cosmetics industry has gone up. We're just seeing slower growth in the industry, slower growth from you, slower growth from Estee, and yet a continued high level of investment. And my question is, does that concern you? Do you think differently? I mean the cost savings outlook for the Procter acquisition looks fantastic, but do you think today that you might have to invest more to achieve the same level of growth that you have hoped to achieve just given the competitive dynamics in the industry?"

So clearly within the business, you've seen S-4 filings, so you have the numbers. The business is declining 2%. So clearly, if you ask me, am I excited about this? The answer is no. Within that business though, there are certain parts, which are doing very well. For instance, the salon business is performing very nicely. The fragrance business is doing better than it has done historically. On the other side, basically, we do have some concerns about Color Cosmetics and a substantial concerns about the hair coloring and styling at the retail level. So it is not a uniform picture on the P&G business. And if you ask me, am I excited about the business trends? The answer is no. There's still a lot of work that needs in order to address that. In terms of the investment levels, basically, which is required in the business. It is definitely challenging business, particularly because the industry to some extent is fragmenting in terms in pockets of both from a channel and from a brand point of view. And clearly, that requires basically stronger activity in order to maintain a growth momentum. Will that eventually mean that we need to invest more? I'm not sure because we have quite substantial investment levels on the business already. I think what is more required is that we have a tighter, more focused business in order to compete. And we'll be coming back to this when we talk about a rationalization of both basically the portfolio and the number of doors in which we compete."

This morning, we will provide you with a brief overview of Q3 and year-to-date results as well as the detailed updates on the P&G Beauty Brands transaction.
Our efforts to create a healthy platform for Coty to become a strong global leader and challenger in beauty remains on track. Q3 revenues, which declined minus 1% on a like-for-like basis, were consistent with our expectations from muted like-for-like trends through the end of the fiscal year as we gradually rationalized nonstrategic product lines and businesses. Power brands, on the other hand, continued to outperform the overall business, both for the quarter and year-to-date. While Q3 adjusted operating profit was down due to one-off items, including the negative impact on the Brazilian Beauty Business as a result of a change in commercial terms to confirm -- conform with Coty's standards, our year-to-date adjusted operating profit was flat with solid 7% growth at constant currency. For the full fiscal 2016, we continue to expect like-for-like revenue performance relatively consistent with the year-to-date trends. We anticipate high single digit growth in adjusted operating income at constant rates for the full year, offset by negative FX impact, with the adjusted operating income in line with the prior year at actual rates. These results and outlook are consistent with our strategy to build a healthier and better business despite subdued revenue growth.
In summary, we believe we are well on track to build a healthy platform for Coty to become a global leader and challenger in the beauty industry and provide the right basis to drive profitable growth and deliver shareholder value over time.
I will now hand over the call to Patrice."

Total Q3 net revenues declined 1% like-for-like with an improvement in the Fragrance segment revenue trends compared to the first half and moderate Color Cosmetics segment growth in spite of the decline in the U.S. retail nail market.
Fiscal year-to-date, the adjusted gross margin increased a very strong 110 basis points to 61.2%, reflecting our continuous efforts in driving supply chain efficiencies. We keep on building a better business, even in the face of soft top line trends, with stable adjusted operating income fiscal year-to-date with a stronger 7% increase at constant currency. The year-to-date adjusted operating margin grew 40 basis points. Our year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS was $1.08 compared to $0.91 in the prior year, in part reflecting the benefit from a favorable tax settlement of $113.3 million this year compared to a $32.5 million settlement in the prior year period.
Turning to the capital structure. We took the opportunity to raise an incremental EUR 465 million in term loans, and used the proceeds to partially repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility that were drawn to fund the acquisition of the Brazilian Beauty Business. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation allowed us to continue to advance on our strategic and financial objectives. Fiscal year-to-date, we generated $445.3 million in operating cash flow and $330 million in free cash flow, with free cash flow up over $100 million versus the prior year.
During the quarter, we did not repurchase any share and expect to remain opportunistic with our existing $500 million share repurchase authorization.
This concludes our discussion of our Q3 and fiscal year-to-date results. Bart and I will now take couple of questions on the results, after which, we will provide you with a comprehensive update on the P&G Beauty Brands transaction."

So on Hypermarcas, there was a change in commercial policy following the acquisition, just to give you some perspective. Hypermarcas has very long, basically, payment terms for its customers, in addition provided substantial discounts at month-end and quarter-end in order to make the numbers. We have corrected for that and put the customers much more on a Coty-type policy. So what does that mean? That clearly means that the payment days or the receivable days for customers are coming down substantially, and also basically, the month-end and quarter-end discounts have been largely eliminated. The result of that is a substantial reduction of trade inventories in Brazil. They were well over 100 days in the trade, and they've been practically cut in half. So clearly, that has an impact on the revenues. Just to reassure you, the consumption growth in Brazil remains very good. It remains ahead of the market. It remains basically in the double-digit range. So it is not an issue basically of sellout. It's a temporary issue of sell-in because of the adjustment of commercial terms. I think you should expect that as, basically, we go forward, this gradually, basically, goes back to a normal level.

I don't think we are that far behind, to be honest with you and with the general consumer industry. I think everybody around the industry is basically getting adjusted to the fact that consumers increasingly consume digital rather -- media rather than television or print media. It clearly differs very much by market. For instance, clearly, if you take the established markets like U.S., U.K. and some other European countries, you see very high consumption. Clearly, if you go to emerging markets, you see much less consumption. So there's a substantial increase in digital happening as we speak. So I would say the gap is going to be closed in the next 12 to 18 months."

First, we are going to confirm the strategic rationale of the transaction. We're going to provide an update on the transaction and the progress we have made around this",1075,"So in terms of the update on the transaction, we're really going to cover 3 subjects. First, we are going to confirm the strategic rationale of the transaction. We're going to provide an update on the transaction and the progress we have made around this on a year-to-date basis. And finally, we're going to provide an update on the financial benefit of the merger with the P&G specialty business.
So next page please. So first, before I give the strategic rationale one more time, let me first highlight what Coty's ambition is in the beauty, is to really to transform Coty over time into a new global leader and challenger in the beauty industry, clearly with -- for the ultimate benefit of the shareholders.
Now in that respect, the P&G merger clearly is a very good step in that direction. We are creating, with the merger, a $9 billion leader and challenger in beauty, becoming the #3 after L'Oréal and Estée Lauder in the industry. Not only do we create a much more of a scale player in beauty, we're also creating the worldwide #1 in fragrance. 
Can we have the next slide please? As you can see basically from the slide, which is now on the screen. So you can see that we are becoming well ahead basically of L'Oréal in terms of market position. In terms of Color Cosmetics, we are becoming the #3 overall, most likely the #2 basically in mass Color Cosmetics where there are a number of very good brands, as I'll show you in a minute. Finally, we are adding the worldwide #2 in hair salon. Clearly, this is a new category for Coty.
In terms of the portfolio, we are getting a very nice -- nicely balanced portfolio in terms of well -- between categories as well as distribution channels. So just to take you very quickly through that. Coty consumer beauty will be 41% of the total business with roughly $3.8 billion. Very much focused on the mass channel and on 3 categories, which is -- which are: Color Cosmetics; hair retailing, which is hair coloring and styling as well as body care; Coty Luxury, very much focused on the prestige channel and focused on Fragrance and Skin; and Coty Professional, very much focused on the salon channel, focused on hair as well as nail care. So a very balanced portfolio both in terms of categories and distribution channels, and most importantly, with very strong portfolio of brands.
You can see Coty Luxury. There, you will have -- the top 3 brands will be Calvin Klein, Gucci and Hugo Boss. And consumer beauty, the size of the brands is more evenly balanced. You see some very strong brands like Cover Girl, Rimmel, Max Factor, Sally Hansen, et cetera. And then ultimately, in Coty Professional Beauty, you see 2 main brands, which are anchoring the business, which are Wella and OPI.
Not only do we get a very strong portfolio, we're also increase seeing the critical mass across basically our top markets. And importantly, we're increasing critical mass in several of the emerging markets. So Brazil, clearly, that's a very big increase. And -- but that was off a very small base in Brazil. So clearly, this number doesn't even include Hypermarcas, and Brazil will become a very big market for Coty.
Russia was a decent-sized market -- business for us. China also becomes a much bigger business for us. So not only are we getting a substantial increase in scale in the established markets, but we have also increased the scale in a number of the emerging markets.
So overall, that gives us a very nice, basically, portfolio with strong brands and skill benefits in our geographies.
You can play the previous slide please. Thank you. So it also provides a very good opportunity to accelerate growth and improve profits and cash flow. So from a growth point of view, we will have, going forward, a divisional structure. Why is that important? Because the divisional structure is a much more focused structure than what we're having today. So as I already showed you, it will focus very much on a single distribution channel and only 2 to 3 categories per division. And with that, we hope that we are going to get, not just increased focus, we get increased competence, and we get a much more competitive, basically, capability in place in order to compete in the market.
We also are going to substantially further increase our focus on sellouts via increased digital consumer engagement, improving the in-store excellence and to drive high levels of product innovation.
Another topic, which we still have to come to, and which will further detail post in the next couple of months is the rationalization of the portfolio and the wholesale business. Why is that important is because we still need to tighten down the focus on fewer brands and fewer doors in order to drive a higher growth and a better quality business.
And finally, clearly, from a growth point of view, we will be looking, in due time, to further acquisitions, and Patrice will highlight this a little bit later. But, clearly, our pro forma financial profile will very much allow us to participate in further acquisition opportunities.
In a minute, we'll come to profit and cash flow. But clearly, we're anticipating material earnings per share accretion due to synergies, and we also expect substantial incremental cash flow due to both higher profits as well as net working capital benefits.
Finally, we will very much, from an incentive system, make sure that the management is very much driving a combination of top line growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation. And we'll do that both through the combination of short-term bonus structure as well as long-term incentives in order to make sure that we are getting a balanced, basically, focus behind those 3, basically, key leaders.
So that gives you a quick snapshot of the strategic rationale basically for the business. As you can see from the slides I just presented, this is very similar to what we discussed in July. And so we are very much confirming of the strategic rationale of the merger with the P&G business.
I'm now going to hand over to Patrice who's going to take you through the transaction updates, the progress we've made as well as the financial benefits of the transaction."

Very much of the same, so transaction proposal was valued at $12.5 billion, comprised of $9.6 billion of equity and $2.9 billion of debt. We have a",608,"Thank you, Bart. So a couple of points on the Slide 13, the transaction summary. So first on the structure. Very much of the same, so transaction proposal was valued at $12.5 billion, comprised of $9.6 billion of equity and $2.9 billion of debt. We have a color mechanism of plus or minus $1 billion based on the trading price of Coty stock with the range of $22.06 to $27.06 with the middle range of $24.56. Based on the latest share price, and we assume here the price on April 13, which was for the S-4 filing of $29.81, Coty estimates that the issuance of 412 million shares and $2 billion of assume debt. The split between the P&G and the Coty shareholders will be 54-46.
So now a few words on the mechanics of the transaction. The preferred option from the P&G side is to do a split-off. In a split-off, P&G offers its shareholders the option to exchange their shares of P&G common stock per share of the new Coty.
For the offer to be fully subscribed, 6% of the P&G shares need to be tendered, only 6% of them. In terms of timing, it's fair to say that the transaction is expected to close in the course of the month of October 2016.
Now next Slide 14, the updates on -- of the progress that we have made. So as you have seen, all of you, so we have filed the S-4 on April 22. We have the uncommissioned antitrust clearance for the EU and U.S. And we have confirmed the transfer of 10 fragrance licenses.
Operationally, as Bart said, we have now an organizational structure. We have designed an organizational structure with all the associated headcounts and the decision regarding the location has been mainly made. In terms of staffing, the executive committee and the management team of the divisions have been appointed. And we now are going to the next layer. In terms of data economics, I will come back to that on a few slides, but we've done most of the work.
In terms of portfolio and wholesale rationalization, it's fair to say that the work is still very much in progress. But what we can say at this stage is that on the portfolio rationalization, in terms of discontinuation and divestments, we'd have some discontinuation in divestment in the range of 6% to 8% of the combined new portfolio. So I'm sure you're going to have a lot of question on the impact on the data economics, is it EPS neutral, yes or no, et cetera, et cetera. We are not ready to answer any of these questions yet, we just want to signal to the market what we have in mind for the time being. We're still work in progress.
In terms of go-to-market change, we are assessing some of these, especially in emerging markets. And of course, there is an extensive preparation in terms of processes, in terms of systems, in terms of infrastructure. There is 200 people full-time within Coty working on that with a lot of help from experts that has done this type of transaction in the past. So we're very much in motion.
In terms of financing, so as you all know, Coty entered into a security financing commitment of $4.5 billion. We have used the opportunity to upsize this to $5 billion in last month, actually, in April 2016. Galleria, which is full-owned by P&G, entered into secured financing commitments of the same amount, $4.5 billion, expected to be ultimately assumed by Coty upon the close.
Now back to Bart on the management team."

So certain statements in this presentation are forward-looking statements. So I am not going to go through, Kevin already alluded to that at the start of the call. The only point I'd like t",1751,"Thank you, Bart. So now the financial update. So on the Slide 17. So certain statements in this presentation are forward-looking statements. So I am not going to go through, Kevin already alluded to that at the start of the call. The only point I'd like to emphasize is the bottom of the page where this acquisition of the P&G Beauty Brands is a complex carve-out transaction. And as a result of that, the integration efforts might, for a certain period of time, detract us from improving the performance of the underlying business.
So this being said, the next 4 slides are, I'm sure, slides that most of you are expecting. So we're going to spend a little bit of time on that going through these slides.
So on the Slide #18, on the synergies. So all these 4 slides are really a refresh of the July presentation. So you will see that in the format. We did roughly the same to make sure that you had a comparable basis.
So first of the synergies. So we start from the fiscal '15 adjusted carve-out EBITDA coming from P&G, which include already $380 million of synergy that we maturized day 1. Then we have the impact of 2 of the license that are not coming with the transaction, so Dolce & Gabbana and Christina Aguilera. So we take $130 million, which is the brand contribution.
So what is the brand contribution? The brand contribution is the gross margin deducted from all the investment in advertising consumer promotion to support and to nurture the brand.
Then you have the synergies of $400 million, which is on the basis of the July presentation. So let me spend a little bit of time on this $400 million. So first point, our ongoing position has been to build an organization by division focusing on each of the segments. Two, how did we do that? We did that with the bottom-up approach by function and by country. So a very in-depth work. And then we have cost the [indiscernible] organization in each of this country [indiscernible] challenged against benchmark-based targets.
So this is where we landed now with these targeted organization that has been costed. And when you compare the Coty organization plus the P&G organization minus the targeted organization, you come up with the $780 million synergies. So this $780 million synergies represent 16% of the acquired revenues, and they are very much going to be phased with 40% materializing in year 1, 70% after year 2, and 80% after year 3 and then the full synergies after year 4. In order to be able to realize these synergies, we are going to incur $1.2 billion of cost. So let me spend a little bit of time on these costs.
So first, 90% of them are cash costs. And out of this $1.2 billion, you have 25% that is really related to the specifics of this transaction, which is a combination of the carve-out under an RMT umbrella. So this is roughly $320 million that is related to that.
So let me give you a couple of examples on these costs. So first, you have the TSE cost. Second, P&G is a highly integrated business with a big GBS shared service center. And so we have to disentangle the P&G Beauty with the rest of the P&G business, which is increasing complexity and as a result of that associated cost. Third point, the RMT required the business of P&G to be carve-out and then integrated. What does that mean? This mean that we need to sell entering P&G entities and processes that then, after the exit of the GSA, needs to be unwinded and integrated into the Coty processes. And of course, we need to train people to be able to do so. Fourth, most of the carve-out aim at either increasing the scope, like adding new categories, for instance, or increasing the scale. Actually, we're doing both, which is increasing the complexity and then the cost associated to that. So that's roughly what is leading to 25% of the cost, which is the $320 million, which is, for us, due to this very unusual transaction.
Second part of this $1.2 billion, you have roughly $135 million that is due to go-to-market Galleria changes that will happen later on. This very much work in progress, but we are going to reset up some of our go-to-market -- some of the go-to-market from Galleria.
The last part, $745 million, is directly related to the synergy. So we are generating $780 million synergies with a one-off directly attributed to the synergy with $745 million. And I think this is really the way you should look at it. 
So we are building, on the bottom-up basis, an organization, which is extremely focused, divisionalized, focusing on their expertise in the respective the segments, but a very lean organization. 
So now what does that mean in terms of operating margin? So first, all these slides do not include Hypermarcas. So same start as what you have seen in July, but of course, updated. So what you can see is that you start in Slide 19 from the stand-alone Coty, which is 12%-plus operating margin. We added the carve-out business from P&G, which added 200 basis points. So we would result in 14% operating margin without touching the business. Then you deduct, which is an impact of 40 basis points, the impact of D&G and Christina Aguilera. And then with all the synergies, we have 430 basis points. So this mean that we are going to add 600 basis points with Coty stand-alone business in operating profit margin over a 4-year period, making Coty clearly an industry leader at 18% operating margin. Okay? Our top peers are in the range of 15% to 17% operating margin percentage. So really with this transaction, we're immediately positioning ourselves to an 18% pro forma operating margin, and this doesn't include Hypermarcas, as I said.  
So now next slide, what does that mean from an EPS standpoint? So first, this slide exclude the purchase price accounting related to the amortization. And we are currently revisiting the metrics with which we should measure the underlying performance of the business. And in doing so, what we pay attention to is that it needs to be similar to the way we measure the business on a historical basis, and it also needs to be comparable to our peers. And that's the reason why we are currently assessing and evaluating the option to exclude the purchase price accounting-related amortization. So when you go through this slide, you start with the Coty fiscal '15 adjusted EPS, which is $0.99. Then you have the dilution base addition of sales, which is the same number as what's recorded in July. Then you have the contribution of the P&G carve-out business, which is $0.83. That leads to $1.20 to $1.25. Then you deduct the D&G and the Christina Aguilera brand contribution, which is $0.11. And then you add all the synergies that will generate, which is $0.39.  What does this means? This means that we will increase by 50% the EPS versus the current stand-alone Coty business. And I really think this is the way you should look at it. We have a current standalone Coty business, which is in the range of $1 of EPS. And now we'll be more in the range of $150 after this transaction on a pro forma basis. And this is, of course, after we implement all the synergies, so after year 4. 
So now in terms of cash. Cash is king. So Slide 21. So in terms of working capital. So immediately at closing, we will generate -- we will more than double the cash generation of Coty standalone to generate on a free cash flow basis between $800 million and $900 million without further reduction of the working capital. Then you add some analysis that we have made on the working capital. And so we are refreshing this analysis by increasing the working capital synergies from $200 million to $500 million, so $0.5 billion over 4 years. The bulk of that would be realized by the end of fiscal '18. So actually, you have 2 effects on that. The first one is that you have a one-off $0.5 billion cash generation. And the second one is that by doing that, we'll be very close to the working capital, which means that the cash conversion ratio is optimal. So your earnings are converting into cash immediately.  
Now in terms of CapEx. So we are increasing by $100 million the CapEx versus our July assumption, which is mainly you have 3 main legs into these CapEx of $500 million. You have real estate, because we need to stand out some organization and co-locate the division in most of the market, so that's point one. Point two, evidently like in all the transaction, you have a lot of IT infrastructure that we need to build and step up. And it's fair to say that all the work that we have done in the last 2 years is now producing some really good results and is allowing us to avoid some CapEx that we'll have to add, provided we didn't do anything in the last 2 years. And of course, you have then the supply chain CapEx to be able to spend on a couple of factories. So 90% of this one-time CapEx will be incurred in fiscal '18, and then we'll come back to a much more normal ratio of CapEx, which you could estimate being 4% of top line. 
Now the capital structure. We are slightly increasing the pro forma leverage to 3.2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. Why is that? Because we are reflecting the Hypermarcas acquisition and the share buyback program that we have exhibited between the month of July and the month of December fiscal '15. We are going, as we said, to increase the dividend per share to $0.50 post-closing. And so it's clear to me, and it's clear to all of us that we're going to have a combined business with a lot of strategic and functional flexibility with a very lean cost structure and with a very moderate pro forma leverage of 3x2, which, once again, as Bart said, give us ample ammunition to further participate in the consolidation of this business. 
So now I leave the floor to Bart for the wrap up."

You've seen basically the substantial increase in pro forma EPS of roughly $0.50, of more or less $1 where it sits today, so a very substantial increase. It is targeted to generate substantial pro forma free cash flow of about $800 million to $900 million, providing ample flexibility for the future. Post rationalization of Coty's portfolio and wholesale business, which we are working on, the merger creates a clearer opportunity to accelerate growth, both organically and via future M&A. And that is very much, because we are going to create a different structure for the company, much more focused structure with a more focused portfolio, with better staffing behind that and with ample basically support levels behind that. We have appointed already very strong new management team, which is being well aligned to drive shareholder value. 
So overall, I think I can confirm today that the strategic rationale for the transaction remains. We've made excellent progress basically from an integration point of view year-to-date. We should be well positioned to absorb this business. And you've seen Patrice take you through the financials, which are substantially better than when they were when we announced the transaction.

And then the second thing just looking back at the quarter, you just printed your comment that the core business may suffer a little bit of disruption. Just broadly speaking, it feels as if kind of the cost to compete in the makeup, cosmetics industry has gone up. We're just seeing slower growth in the industry, slower growth from you, slower growth from Estée, and yet a continued high level of investment. And my question is, does that concern you? Do you think differently? I mean, the cost savings outlook for the Procter acquisition looks fantastic. But do you think today that you might have to invest more to achieve the same level of growth that you had hoped to achieve just given the competitive dynamics in the industry?"

So clearly within the business, you've seen the S-4 filing, so you have the numbers. The business is declining 2%. So clearly, if you ask me, am I excited about this, well, the answer is no. Within that business, though, there are certain parts which are doing very well. For instance, the salon business is performing very nicely. The fragrance business is doing better than it has done historically. On the other side, basically, we do have some concerns about Color Cosmetics and substantial concerns about the hair coloring and styling at the retail level. So it is not a uniform picture on the P&G business. And if you ask me, am I excited about the business trend, the answer is no. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done in order to address that. In terms of the investment levels, basically, which are required in the business, it is definitely challenging business and particularly because the whole industry to some extent is fragmenting in terms in pockets, both from a channel and a brand point of view. And clearly, that requires basically stronger activity in order to maintain a growth momentum. Will that eventually mean that we need to invest more? I'm not sure, because we have quite substantial investment levels on the business already. I think what is more required is that we have a tighter, more focused business in order to compete. And we'll be coming back to this when we talk about a rationalization of both basically the portfolio and the number of doors in which we compete."

So in the supply area, we have literally gone through everything in terms of buy, make and deliver, the product, and then looked at every single aspect in terms of what we can assume from an optimization point of view in terms of procurement, in terms of manufacturing, in terms of logistics. We also have costed out the entire organization down to the last head practically in every single division as well as in the corporate headquarters and any other functional support staff. We have used that basically in order to cost out entire SG&A footprint for the combined entity. So there is a very, very detailed basically calculation between all of this. So in terms of the split, it is very much balanced between, I would say, broad what you can expect in cost of goods and in SG&A. There's a relatively even split between the 2.

So from a back-office function business, we don't get any person to close the books. So we need to staff up and to standup our organization in order to be able to close the books after month 1.

This morning, we will provide you with a brief overview of Q3 and year-to-date results as well as the detailed updates on the P&G Beauty Brands transaction.
Our efforts to create a healthy platform for Coty to become a strong global leader and challenger in beauty remains on track. Q3 revenues, which declined minus 1% on a like-for-like basis, were consistent with our expectations from muted like-for-like trends through the end of the fiscal year as we gradually rationalized nonstrategic product lines and businesses. Power brands, on the other hand, continued to outperform the overall business, both for the quarter and year-to-date. While Q3 adjusted operating profit was down due to one-off items, including the negative impact on the Brazilian Beauty Business as a result of a change in commercial terms to confirm -- conform with Coty's standards, our year-to-date adjusted operating profit was flat with solid 7% growth at constant currency. For the full fiscal 2016, we continue to expect like-for-like revenue performance relatively consistent with the year-to-date trends. We anticipate high single digit growth in adjusted operating income at constant rates for the full year, offset by negative FX impact, with the adjusted operating income in line with the prior year at actual rates. These results and outlook are consistent with our strategy to build a healthier and better business despite subdued revenue growth.
In summary, we believe we are well on track to build a healthy platform for Coty to become a global leader and challenger in the beauty industry and provide the right basis to drive profitable growth and deliver shareholder value over time.
I will now hand over the call to Patrice."

Total Q3 net revenues declined 1% like-for-like with an improvement in the Fragrance segment revenue trends compared to the first half and moderate Color Cosmetics segment growth in spite of the decline in the U.S. retail nail market.
Fiscal year-to-date, the adjusted gross margin increased a very strong 110 basis points to 61.2%, reflecting our continuous efforts in driving supply chain efficiencies. We keep on building a better business, even in the face of soft top line trends, with stable adjusted operating income fiscal year-to-date with a stronger 7% increase at constant currency. The year-to-date adjusted operating margin grew 40 basis points. Our year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS was $1.08 compared to $0.91 in the prior year, in part reflecting the benefit from a favorable tax settlement of $113.3 million this year compared to a $32.5 million settlement in the prior year period.
Turning to the capital structure. We took the opportunity to raise an incremental EUR 465 million in term loans, and used the proceeds to partially repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility that were drawn to fund the acquisition of the Brazilian Beauty Business. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation allowed us to continue to advance on our strategic and financial objectives. Fiscal year-to-date, we generated $445.3 million in operating cash flow and $330 million in free cash flow, with free cash flow up over $100 million versus the prior year.
During the quarter, we did not repurchase any share and expect to remain opportunistic with our existing $500 million share repurchase authorization.
This concludes our discussion of our Q3 and fiscal year-to-date results. Bart and I will now take couple of questions on the results, after which, we will provide you with a comprehensive update on the P&G Beauty Brands transaction."

So on Hypermarcas, there was a change in commercial policy following the acquisition, just to give you some perspective. Hypermarcas has very long, basically, payment terms for its customers, in addition provided substantial discounts at month-end and quarter-end in order to make the numbers. We have corrected for that and put the customers much more on a Coty-type policy. So what does that mean? That clearly means that the payment days or the receivable days for customers are coming down substantially, and also basically, the month-end and quarter-end discounts have been largely eliminated. The result of that is a substantial reduction of trade inventories in Brazil. They were well over 100 days in the trade, and they've been practically cut in half. So clearly, that has an impact on the revenues. Just to reassure you, the consumption growth in Brazil remains very good. It remains ahead of the market. It remains basically in the double-digit range. So it is not an issue basically of sellout. It's a temporary issue of sell-in because of the adjustment of commercial terms. I think you should expect that as, basically, we go forward, this gradually, basically, goes back to a normal level.

I don't think we are that far behind, to be honest with you and with the general consumer industry. I think everybody around the industry is basically getting adjusted to the fact that consumers increasingly consume digital rather -- media rather than television or print media. It clearly differs very much by market. For instance, clearly, if you take the established markets like U.S., U.K. and some other European countries, you see very high consumption. Clearly, if you go to emerging markets, you see much less consumption. So there's a substantial increase in digital happening as we speak. So I would say the gap is going to be closed in the next 12 to 18 months."

First, we are going to confirm the strategic rationale of the transaction. We're going to provide an update on the transaction and the progress we have made around this",1077,"So in terms of the update on the transaction, we're really going to cover 3 subjects. First, we are going to confirm the strategic rationale of the transaction. We're going to provide an update on the transaction and the progress we have made around this on a year-to-date basis. And finally, we're going to provide an update on the financial benefit of the merger with the P&G specialty business.
So next page please. So first, before I give the strategic rationale. One more time, let me first highlight what Coty's ambition is in beauty, is to really to transform Coty over time into a new global leader and challenger in the beauty industry, clearly with -- for the ultimate benefit of the shareholders.
Now in that respect, the P&G merger clearly is a very good step in that direction. We are creating, with the merger, a $9 billion leader and challenger in beauty, becoming the #3 after L'Oréal and Estée Lauder in the industry. Not only do we create a much more of a scale player in beauty, we're also creating the worldwide #1 in fragrance. 
Can we have the next slide please? As you can see basically from the slide, which is now on the screen. So you can see that we are becoming well ahead basically of L'Oréal in terms of market position. In terms of Color Cosmetics, we are becoming the #3 overall, most likely the #2 basically in mass Color Cosmetics where there are a number of very good brands, as I'll show you in a minute. Finally, we are adding the worldwide #2 in hair salon. Clearly, this is a new category for Coty.
In terms of the portfolio, we are getting a very nice -- nicely balanced portfolio in terms of well -- between categories as well as distribution channels. So just to take you very quickly through that. Coty consumer beauty will be 41% of the total business with roughly $3.8 billion. Very much focused on the mass channel and on 3 categories, which is -- which are: Color Cosmetics; hair retailing, which is hair coloring and styling as well as body care; Coty Luxury, very much focused on the prestige channel and focused on Fragrance and Skin; and Coty Professional, very much focused on the salon channel, focused on hair as well as nail care. So a very balanced portfolio both in terms of categories and distribution channels, and most importantly, with a very strong portfolio of brands.
You can see Coty Luxury. There, you will have -- the top 3 brands will be Calvin Klein, Gucci and Hugo Boss. And consumer beauty, the size of the brands is more evenly balanced. You see some very strong brands like Cover Girl, Rimmel, Max Factor, Sally Hansen, et cetera. And then ultimately, in Coty Professional Beauty, you see 2 main brands, which are anchoring the business, which are Wella and OPI.
Not only do we get a very strong portfolio, we're also increasing the critical mass across basically our top markets. And importantly, we're increasing critical mass in several of the emerging markets. So Brazil, clearly, that's a very big increase. And -- but that was off a very small base in Brazil. So clearly, this number doesn't even include Hypermarcas, and Brazil will become a very big market for Coty.
Russia was a decent-sized market, becomes a much bigger business for us. China also becomes a much bigger business for us. So not only are we getting a substantial increase in scale in the established markets, but we have also increased the scale in a number of the emerging markets.
So overall, that gives us a very nice, basically, portfolio with strong brands and skill benefits in our geographies.
You can play the previous slide please. Thank you. So it also provides a very good opportunity to accelerate growth and improve profits and cash flow. So from a growth point of view, we will have, going forward, a divisional structure. Why is that important? Because the divisional structure is a much more focused structure than what we're having today. So as I already showed you, it will focus very much on a single distribution channel and only 2 to 3 categories per division. And with that, we hope that we are going to get, not just increased focus, we get increased competence, and we get a much more competitive, basically, capability in place in order to compete in the market.
We also are going to substantially further increase our focus on sellouts via increased digital consumer engagement, improving the in-store excellence and to drive high levels of product innovation.
Another topic, which we still have to come to, and which we'll further detail post in the next couple of months is the rationalization of the portfolio and the wholesale business. Why is that important is because we still need to tighten down the focus on fewer brands and fewer doors in order to drive a higher growth and a better quality business.
And finally, clearly, from a growth point of view, we will be looking, in due time, to further acquisitions, and Patrice will highlight this a little bit later. But, clearly, our pro forma financial profile will very much allow us to participate in further acquisition opportunities.
In a minute, we'll come to profit and cash flow. But clearly, we're anticipating material earnings per share accretion due to synergies, and we also expect substantial incremental cash flow due to both higher profits as well as net working capital benefits.
Finally, we will very much, from an incentive system, make sure that the management is very much driving a combination of top line growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation. And we'll do that both through the combination of short-term bonus structure as well as long-term incentives in order to make sure that we are getting a balanced, basically, focus behind those 3, basically, key leaders.
So that gives you a quick snapshot of the strategic rationale basically for the business. As you can see from the slides I just presented, this is very similar to what we discussed in July. And so we are very much confirming of the strategic rationale of the merger with the P&G business.
I'm now going to hand over to Patrice who's going to take you through the transaction updates, the progress we've made as well as the financial benefits of the transaction."

Very much of the same, so transaction proposal was valued at $12.5 billion, comprised of $9.6 billion of equity and $2.9 billion of debt. We have a",608,"Thank you, Bart. So a couple of points on the Slide 13, the transaction summary. So first on the structure. Very much of the same, so transaction proposal was valued at $12.5 billion, comprised of $9.6 billion of equity and $2.9 billion of debt. We have a color mechanism of plus or minus $1 billion based on the trading price of Coty stock with the range of $22.06 to $27.06 with the middle range of $24.56. Based on the latest share price, and we assume here the price on April 13, which was for the S-4 filing of $29.81, Coty estimates that the issuance of 412 million shares and $2 billion of assumed debt. The split between the P&G and the Coty shareholders will be 54-46.
So now a few words on the mechanics of the transaction. The preferred option from the P&G side is to do a split-off. In a split-off, P&G offers its shareholders the option to exchange their shares of P&G common stock per share of the new Coty.
For the offer to be fully subscribed, 6% of the P&G shares need to be tendered, only 6% of them. In terms of timing, it's fair to say that the transaction is expected to close in the course of the month of October 2016.
Now next Slide 14, the updates on -- of the progress that we have made. So as you have seen, all of you, so we have filed the S-4 on April 22. We have the uncommissioned antitrust clearance for the EU and U.S. And we have confirmed the transfer of 10 fragrance licenses.
Operationally, as Bart said, we have now an organizational structure. We have designed an organizational structure with all the associated headcounts and the decision regarding the location has been mainly made. In terms of staffing, the executive committee and the management team of the divisions have been appointed. And we now are going to the next layer. In terms of data economics, I will come back to that on a few slides, but we've done most of the work.
In terms of portfolio and wholesale rationalization, it's fair to say that the work is very much in progress. But what we can say at this stage is that on the portfolio rationalization, in terms of discontinuation and divestments, we'd have some discontinuation in divestment in the range of 6% to 8% of the combined new portfolio. So I'm sure you're going to have a lot of question on the impact on the data economics, is it EPS neutral, yes or no, et cetera, et cetera. We are not ready to answer any of these questions yet, we just want to signal to the market what we have in mind for the time being. There's still work in progress.
In terms of go-to-market change, we are assessing some of these, especially in emerging markets. And of course, there is an extensive preparation in terms of processes, in terms of systems, in terms of infrastructure. There is 200 people full-time within Coty working on that with a lot of help from experts that has done this type of transaction in the past. So we're very much in motion.
In terms of financing, so as you all know, Coty entered into a security financing commitment of $4.5 billion. We have used the opportunity to upsize this to $5 billion in last month, actually, in April 2016. Galleria, which is fully owned by P&G, entered into secured financing commitments of the same amount, $4.5 billion, expected to be ultimately assumed by Coty upon the close.
Now back to Bart on the management team."

So certain statements in this presentation are forward-looking statements. So I am not going to go through, Kevin already alluded to that at the start of the call. The only point I'd like t",1751,"Thank you, Bart. So now the financial update. So on the Slide 17. So certain statements in this presentation are forward-looking statements. So I am not going to go through, Kevin already alluded to that at the start of the call. The only point I'd like to emphasize is the bottom of the page where this acquisition of the P&G Beauty Brands is a complex carve-out transaction. And as a result of that, the integration efforts might, for a certain period of time, detract us from improving the performance of the underlying business.
So this being said, the next 4 slides are, I'm sure, slides that most of you are expecting. So we're going to spend a little bit of time on that going through these slides.
So on the Slide #18, on the synergies. So all these 4 slides are really a refresh of the July presentation. So you will see that in the format. We did roughly the same to make sure that you had a comparable basis.
So first on the synergies. So we start from the fiscal '15 adjusted carve-out EBITDA coming from P&G, which include already $380 million of synergy that we maturized day 1. Then we have the impact of 2 of the license that are not coming with the transaction, so Dolce & Gabbana and Christina Aguilera. So we take $130 million, which is the brand contribution.
So what is the brand contribution? The brand contribution is the gross margin deducted from all the investment in advertising consumer promotion to support and to nurture the brand.
Then you have the synergies of $400 million, which is on the basis of the July presentation. So let me spend a little bit of time on this $400 million. So first point, our ongoing position has been to build an organization by division focusing on each of the segments. Two, how did we do that? We did that with the bottom-up approach by function and by country. So a very in-depth work. And then we have cost the [indiscernible] organization in each of these country [indiscernible] challenged against benchmark-based targets.
So this is where we landed now with these targeted organization that has been costed. And when you compare the Coty organization plus the P&G organization minus the targeted organization, you come up with the $780 million synergies. So this $780 million synergies represent 16% of the acquired revenues, and they are very much going to be phased with 40% materializing in year 1, 70% after year 2, and 80% after year 3 and then the full synergies after year 4. In order to be able to realize these synergies, we are going to incur $1.2 billion of cost. So let me spend a little bit of time on these costs.
So first, 90% of them are cash costs. And out of this $1.2 billion, you have 25% that is really related to the specifics of this transaction, which is a combination of the carve-out under an RMT umbrella. So this is roughly $320 million that is related to that.
So let me give you a couple of examples on these costs. So first, you have the TSE cost. Second, P&G is a highly integrated business with a big GBS shared service center. And so we have to disentangle the P&G Beauty with the rest of the P&G business, which is increasing complexity and as a result of that associated cost. Third point, the RMT required the business of P&G to be carve-out and then integrated. What does that mean? This mean that we need to sell entering P&G entities and processes that then, after the exit of the GSA, needs to be unwinded and integrated into the Coty processes. And of course, we need to train people to be able to do so. Fourth, most of the carve-out aim at either increasing the scope, like adding new categories, for instance, or increasing the scale. Actually, we're doing both, which is increasing the complexity and then the cost associated to that. So that's roughly what is leading to 25% of the cost, which is the $320 million, which is, for us, due to this very unusual transaction.
Second part of this $1.2 billion, you have roughly $135 million that is due to go-to-market Galleria changes that will happen later on. This is very much work in progress, but we are going to reset up some of our go-to-market -- some of the go-to-market from Galleria.
The last part, $745 million, is directly related to the synergy. So we are generating $780 million synergies with a one-off directly attributed to the synergy with $745 million. And I think this is really the way you should look at it. 
So we are building, on the bottom-up basis, an organization, which is extremely focused, divisionalized, focusing on their expertise in the respective segments, but a very lean organization. 
So now what does that mean in terms of operating margin? So first, all these slides do not include Hypermarcas. So same start as what you have seen in July, but of course, updated. So what you can see is that you start in Slide 19 from the stand-alone Coty, which is 12%-plus operating margin. We added the carve-out business from P&G, which added 200 basis points. So we would result in 14% operating margin without touching the business. Then you deduct, which is an impact of 40 basis points, the impact of D&G and Christina Aguilera. And then with all the synergies, we have 430 basis points. So this mean that we are going to add 600 basis points with Coty stand-alone business in operating profit margin over a 4-year period, making Coty clearly an industry leader at 18% operating margin. Okay? Our top peers are in the range of 15% to 17% operating margin percentage. So really with this transaction, we're immediately positioning ourselves to an 18% pro forma operating margin, and this doesn't include Hypermarcas, as I said.  
So now next slide, what does that mean from an EPS standpoint? So first, this slide exclude the purchase price accounting related to the amortization. And we are currently revisiting the metrics with which we should measure the underlying performance of the business. And in doing so, what we pay attention to is that it needs to be similar to the way we measure the business on a historical basis, and it also needs to be comparable to our peers. And that's the reason why we are currently assessing and evaluating the option to exclude the purchase price accounting-related amortization. So when you go through this slide, you start with the Coty fiscal '15 adjusted EPS, which is $0.99. Then you have the dilution base addition of sales, which is the same number as what's recorded in July. Then you have the contribution of the P&G carve-out business, which is $0.83. That leads to $1.20 to $1.25. Then you deduct the D&G and the Christina Aguilera brand contribution, which is $0.11. And then you add all the synergies that will generate, which is $0.39.  What does this means? This means that we will increase by 50% the EPS versus the current stand-alone Coty business. And I really think this is the way you should look at it. We have a current stand-alone Coty business, which is in the range of $1 of EPS. And now we'll be more in the range of $150 after this transaction on a pro forma basis. And this is, of course, after we implement all the synergies, so after year 4. 
So now in terms of cash. Cash is king. So Slide 21. So in terms of working capital. So immediately at closing, we will generate -- we will more than double the cash generation of Coty stand-alone to generate on a free cash flow basis between $800 million and $900 million without further reduction of the working capital. Then you add some analysis that we have made on the working capital. And so we are refreshing this analysis by increasing the working capital synergies from $200 million to $500 million, so $0.5 billion over 4 years. The bulk of that would be realized by the end of fiscal '18. So actually, you have 2 effects on that. The first one is that you have a one-off $0.5 billion cash generation. And the second one is that by doing that, we'll be very close to the working capital, which means that the cash conversion ratio is optimal. So your earnings are converting into cash immediately.  
Now in terms of CapEx. So we are increasing by $100 million the CapEx versus our July assumption, which is mainly you have 3 main legs into this CapEx of $500 million. You have real estate, because we need to stand out some organization and co-locate the division in most of the market, so that's point one. Point two, evidently like in all the transaction, you have a lot of IT infrastructure that we need to build and step up. And it's fair to say that all the work that we have done in the last 2 years is now producing some really good results and is allowing us to avoid some CapEx that we'll have to add, provided we didn't do anything in the last 2 years. And of course, you have then the supply chain CapEx to be able to spend on a couple of factories. So 90% of this onetime CapEx will be incurred through fiscal '18, and then we'll come back to a much more normal ratio of CapEx, which you could estimate being 4% of top line. 
Now the capital structure. We are slightly increasing the pro forma leverage to 3.2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. Why is that? Because we are reflecting the Hypermarcas acquisition and the share buyback program that we have exhibited between the month of July and the month of December fiscal '15. We are going, as we said, to increase the dividend per share to $0.50 post-closing. And so it's clear to me, and it's clear to all of us, that we're going to have a combined business with a lot of strategic and functional flexibility with a very lean cost structure and with a very moderate pro forma leverage of 3x2, which, once again, as Bart said, give us ample ammunition to further participate in the consolidation of this business. 
So now I leave the floor to Bart for the wrap up."

You've seen basically the substantial increase in pro forma EPS of roughly $0.50, off more or less $1 where it sits today, so a very substantial increase. It is targeted to generate substantial pro forma free cash flow of about $800 million to $900 million, providing ample flexibility for the future. Post rationalization of Coty's portfolio and wholesale business, which we are working on, the merger creates a clearer opportunity to accelerate growth, both organically and via future M&A. And that is very much because we are going to create a different structure for the company, much more focused structure with a more focused portfolio, with better staffing behind that and with ample basically support levels behind that. We have appointed already a very strong new management team, which is being well aligned to drive shareholder value. 
So overall, I think I can confirm today that the strategic rationale for the transaction remains. We've made excellent progress basically from an integration point of view year-to-date. We should be well positioned to absorb this business. And you have seen Patrice take you through the financials, which are substantially better than where they were when we announced the transaction.

And then the second thing just looking back at the quarter, you just printed your comment that the core business may suffer a little bit of disruption. Just broadly speaking, it feels as if kind of the cost to compete in the makeup, cosmetics industry has gone up. We're just seeing slower growth in the industry, slower growth from you, slower growth from Estée, and yet a continued high level of investment. And my question is, does that concern you? Do you think differently? I mean, the cost savings outlook for the Procter acquisition looks fantastic. But do you think today that you might have to invest more to achieve the same level of growth that you had hoped to achieve just given the competitive dynamics in the industry?"

So clearly within the business, you've seen the S-4 filing, so you have the numbers. The business is declining 2%. So clearly, if you ask me, am I excited about this, well, the answer is no. Within that business, though, there are certain parts which are doing very well. For instance, the salon business is performing very nicely. The fragrance business is doing better than it has done historically. On the other side, basically, we do have some concerns about Color Cosmetics and substantial concerns about the hair coloring and styling at the retail level. So it is not a uniform picture on the P&G business. And if you ask me, am I excited about the business trend, the answer is no. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done in order to address that. In terms of the investment levels, basically, which are required in the business, it is definitely challenging business and particularly because the whole industry to some extent is fragmenting in terms in pockets, both from a channel and a brand point of view. And clearly, that requires basically stronger activity in order to maintain a growth momentum. Will that eventually mean that we need to invest more? I'm not sure, because we have quite substantial investment levels on the business already. I think what is more required is that we have a tighter, more focused business in order to compete. And we'll be coming back to this when we talk about a rationalization of both basically the portfolio and the number of doors in which we compete."

So in the supply area, we have literally gone through everything in terms of buy, make and deliver, the product, and then looked at every single aspect in terms of what we can assume from an optimization point of view in terms of procurement, in terms of manufacturing, in terms of logistics. We also have costed out the entire organization down to the last head practically in every single division as well as in the corporate headquarters and any other functional support staff. We have used that basically in order to cost out our entire SG&A footprint for the combined entity. So there is a very, very detailed basically calculation between all of this. So in terms of the split, it is very much balanced between, I would say, broad what you can expect in cost of goods and in SG&A. There's a relatively even split between the 2.

So from a back-office function business, we don't get any person to close the books. So we need to staff up and to stand up our organization in order to be able to close the books after month 1.

This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement and then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your question. 
2016 was a good year both in terms of financial results and creating a much stronger foundation and capability to position Coty for future growth. In terms of financial results, our strategy of investing in and fueling growth of our Power Brands, while driving strong profit and margin expansion, is continuing to yield results. For the full year, Power Brands net revenues grew like-for-like, outperforming the overall business. Our adjusted operating profits grew low single digits. And when excluding currency impact, it grew high single digits. Adjusted EPS grew over 20% for the year. 
In terms of strengthening the foundation of the business, we made a number of strategic moves, all of which significantly enhanced Coty's sales growth potential going forward. We closed on the Brazilian acquisition in February 2016, which showed strong revenue and profit momentum in its first full quarter results. And integration with Coty's Brazilian business is expected to be completed by September 2016, prior to the expected closing of the P&G Beauty Business transaction. 
In October 2015, we acquired the digital marketing platform Beamly, which has contributed to a step-change in our capabilities to digitally engage with our consumers. We also made substantial progress on successfully integrating the Bourjois acquisition, which closed in April 2015. The Bourjois brand has not reached profitability levels consistent with Coty's Color Cosmetics segments, while net revenues showed strong like-for-like growth in the most recent quarter. 
Our preparation for the P&G Beauty Brands transaction is well advanced with the closing of the transaction on track for October 2016. We believe the future organization, which is now largely staffed, is more focused, more experienced, and as a consequence, more competitive, ensuring greater potential for top line growth. As part of this, we are excited about the announcement of Camillo Pane as Chief Executive Officer and member of the Coty board effective the day after the closing of the transaction. Camillo has an excellent track record of accelerating growth, improving business performance and strengthening capabilities to create a best-in-class organization. 
We have also completed the cost-and-cash synergy analysis for the merger, confirming earlier announced targets of total potential cost savings of $780 million over 4 years post transaction close. We continue to evaluate the impact of the intended portfolio and wholesale business rationalization. Finally, extensive work has also been done on business process and systems integration to prepare for a smooth transition following the close of the transaction in October 2016. 
Looking to fiscal 2017, whilst it's premature to comment on the outlook for the combined business as the transaction has not yet closed, we continue our work on building a healthier and better Coty stand-alone business. We are targeting for the Coty stand-alone business like-for-like net revenue momentum to improve and return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year with solid improvements in the constant-currency adjusted operating margin and strong operating cash flow conversion. 
I'll now hand over the call to Patrice."

Total net revenues declined 1% like-for-like in the fourth quarter and full year, while constant-currency revenues increased 8% and 5%, respectively. 
During the year, our adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to 60.4%. This improvement in gross margin reflected the lower level of discount pricing activity and our continuous effort in driving supply-chain efficiencies. 
We have made significant progress in reducing our costs structure over the course of the year. We are now approximately 85% on the way through our Global Efficiency Program, having recognized approximately $230 million in savings through the end of the fiscal 2016. We remain on track to recognize the targeted $270 million in savings for fiscal '17. 
Our fiscal '16 adjusted operating income grew 3% to $622.9 million with a very strong 19% growth in the Q4 adjusted operating income. As a reminder, we have refined our adjusted metrics to exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which totaled $79.5 million in fiscal '16. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted operating income grew a strong 9% in fiscal '16 and 24% in the quarter, illustrating our continued execution on streamlining costs. As a result of these efforts, the adjusted operating margin for the year increased 60 basis points to 14.3% from 13.7% in the prior year. During the year, we continued to execute on our strategy of reducing non-strategic spend. Total A&CP spending at constant currency was in line with the prior year with a significant increase in working media spending, offset by reduction in nonstrategic A&CP spending. 
By segment, our fiscal '16 Color Cosmetics adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis points to 14.9% supported by lower promotional discounting activity and improved gross margin. Our Skin & Body Care adjusted operating margin expanding 380 basis points to 7.9%, primarily resulting from lower A&CP and improved gross margin. Our fragrance adjusted operating margin remained strong at 16.5% though declined 170 basis points, partially driven by high cost of sales. 
Moving down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 1.9% compared to 17.7% in the prior year, reflecting a higher tax benefit in the current year. Altogether, our fiscal '16 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.37 reflected a very strong 21% growth. 
2016 was another strong year of cash generation, driven in part by significant progress in working capital improvement on our way to negative working capital. As a result, the operating cash flow totaled $501 million and free cash flow totaled $351 million, up from $325 million in the prior year, despite an increase of over $100 million in cash acquisition-related costs. This was our seventh consecutive year of generating more than $300 million free cash flow. We ended the year with $3.8 billion of net debt. 
Our efforts to drive shareholder value and return cash to shareholder continue through both our dividend and share repurchase activity. As announced on August 1, we raised our annual dividend by 10% to $0.275 per share. Since the start of fiscal 2016 we also repurchased 28.8 million shares for a total of $803.3 million, including $3.9 million repurchase over the month of May through July. 
Finally, as we discussed earlier, in order to position the [indiscernible] for sustainable growth, we are planning to divest all discontinued 6% to 8% of the combined portfolio net revenues. The timing of this portfolio [indiscernible] is still being determined, and we'll be coming back to you with further updates over the course of the fiscal year. 
Our results illustrate building a better business and are well on our way to becoming a strong leader in the global beauty industry. Thank you. We will now open the call for questions."

The top line performance is very much based on our innovation pipeline, the initiatives that we bring to the market, the strategy regarding our Power Brands as well as the support levels. And so in terms of support levels, we have continued to improve what we call the strategic spending within the A&P budget this year, again compared to last year. And we're looking increasingly to make sure that we are spending the money in the right pockets on each one of these brands to drive top line growth harder.

So before we aim to much in Q4, Q4 was encouraging, but we still have work to do from a fragrance point of view. And there's a number of things which we'll be focusing very hard on. First, in terms of core brands, both between Coty and P&G, is to nurture those much better with key pipeline initiatives and in-store execution. We will continue to focus harder and harder on that part of the business. In terms of the brands that we're parting ways with, there's a number of brands, basically, clearly with the merger we have too many brands in the portfolio. As a result, it will be better if we rationalize some of those out. And I'm sure they will be better managed by other players in the industry. And clearly, we'll be focusing, mostly, on our top brands, which is the brands like Gucci, Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, et cetera. So right now, we can clearly continue to manage these brands like they're our own. And we try to do the best we can on this portfolio.

So was just hoping you can give us more granularity of what the key buckets are that's in those expenses and why the level is so high."

So I think we will have, with the P&G merger, a much stronger organization in place than what we've had on either side before.

Ultimately, once we do execute the divestitures. But it's also more focus from an organizational setup point of view. We would have luxury competing heavily in the prestige channel on 2 or 3 categories, the same for Coty beauty in the mass channel in 2 or 3 categories and the same basically for Coty professional and the professional channel on 2 or 3 categories. So I think we're putting in place a much stronger, more focused organization which is also staffed with better talent. On the first 4 levels in the organization, we have selected every individually by looking at the P&G people, the Coty people, and a number of cases, external people. That staffing process is pretty much completed. So I think from an organizational setup and staffing point of view, we're much better shape. In terms of the key initiatives that we have in the fourth quarter, we had DAVIDOFF Horizon, which is a new fragrance, Rimmel's super nail gel polish. Marc Jacobs splash, OPI's Hello Kitty and the adidas for championship league addition. All did very well. Having said that, it's -- we're still not we are I want to be from a gross point of view. We have a new number of new initiatives going in the marketplace. We have Calvin Klein deep euphoria to relaunch the euphoria line. Marc Jacobs decadence to build on that decadence success.

We've launched Sally Hansen's color therapy language oil to the nail system to nourish in margin is the mail for healthy looking nails.

Having said that, is still think, like you said before, that we have room for further improvement. We need to make get more productivity out of our investments. We still have opportunity to improve our in-store execution, to improve how we digitally engage our consumers. So there's a number of buckets where we have further opportunity.

This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement, and then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions. 2016 was a good year",533,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everybody, to Coty's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Conference Call. This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement, and then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions. 
2016 was a good year both in terms of financial results and creating a much stronger foundation and capability to position Coty for future growth. In terms of financial results, our strategy of investing in and fueling growth of our Power Brands, while driving strong profit and margin expansion, is continuing to yield results. For the full year, Power Brands net revenues grew like-for-like, outperforming the overall business. Our adjusted operating profits grew low single digits, and when excluding currency impact, it grew high single digits. Adjusted EPS grew over 20% for the year. 
In terms of strengthening the foundation of the business, we made a number of strategic moves, all of which significantly enhance Coty's sales growth potential going forward. We closed on the Brazilian acquisition in February 2016, which showed strong revenue and profit momentum in its first full quarter results. Integration with Coty's Brazilian business is expected to be completed by September 2016, prior to the expected closing of the P&G Beauty Business transaction. 
In October 2015, we acquired the digital marketing platform Beamly, which has contributed to a step change in our capabilities to digitally engage with our consumers. We also made substantial progress on successfully integrating the Bourjois acquisition, which closed in April 2015. The Bourjois brand has not reached profitability levels consistent with Coty's Color Cosmetics segment, while net revenues showed strong like-for-like growth in the most recent quarter. 
Our preparation for the P&G Beauty Brands transaction is well advanced, with the closing of the transaction on track for October 2016. We believe the future organization, which is now largely staffed, is more focused, more experienced and, as a consequence, more competitive, ensuring greater potential for top line growth. As part of this, we are excited about the announcement of Camillo Pane as Chief Executive Officer and member of the Coty board effective the day after the closing of the transaction. Camillo has an excellent track record of accelerating growth, improving business performance and strengthening capabilities to create a best-in-class organization. 
We have also completed the cost and cash synergy analysis for the merger, confirming earlier announced targets of total potential cost savings of $780 million over 4 years post-transaction close. We continue to evaluate the impact of the intended portfolio and wholesale business rationalization. Finally, extensive work has also been done on business process and systems integration to prepare for a smooth transition following the close of the transaction in October 2016. 
Looking to fiscal 2017. Whilst it's premature to comment on the outlook for the combined business as the transaction has not yet closed, we continue our work on building a healthier and better Coty stand-alone business. We are targeting for the Coty stand-alone business like-for-like net revenue momentum to improve and return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year, with solid improvement in the constant-currency adjusted operating margin and strong operating cash flow conversion. 
I will now hand over the call to Patrice."

Total net revenues declined 1% like-for-like in the fourth quarter and full year, while constant-currency revenues increased 8% and 5%, respectively. 
During the year, our adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to 60.4%. This improvement in gross margin reflected a lower level of discounted pricing activity and our continuous effort in driving supply chain efficiencies. 
We have made significant progress in reducing our cost structure over the course of the year. We are now approximatively 85% on the way through our Global Efficiency Program, having recognized approximatively $230 million in savings through the end of the fiscal 2016. We remain on track to recognize the targeted $270 million in savings for fiscal '17. 
Our fiscal '16 adjusted operating income grew 3% to $622.9 million with a very strong 19% growth in the Q4 adjusted operating income. As a reminder, we have refined our adjusted metrics to exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which totaled $79.5 million in fiscal '16. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew a strong 9% in fiscal '16 and 24% in the quarter, illustrating our continued execution on streamlining costs. As a result of these efforts, the adjusted operating margin for the year increased 60 basis points to 14.3% from 13.7% in the prior year. 
During the year, we continued to execute on our strategy of reducing nonstrategic spend. Total A&CP spending at constant currency was in line with the prior year, with a significant increase in working media spending, offset by reduction in nonstrategic A&CP spending. 
By segment, our fiscal '16 Color Cosmetic adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis point to 14.9%, supported by lower promotional and discounting activity and the improved gross margin. 
Our Skin & Body Care adjusted operating margin expanded 380 basis point to 7.9%, primarily resulting from lower A&CP and improved gross margin. Our Fragrance adjusted operating margin remained strong at 16.5%, though it declined 170 basis point, partially driven by high cost of sales. 
Moving down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 1.9% compared to 17.7% in the prior year, reflecting a higher tax benefit in the current year. Altogether, our fiscal '16 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.37 reflected a very strong 21% growth. 
2016 was another strong year of cash generation, driven in part by significant progress in working capital improvement on our way to negative working capital. As a result, the operating cash flow totaled $501 million, and free cash flow totaled $351 million, up from $325 million in the prior year, despite an increase of over $100 million in cash acquisition-related costs. This was our seventh consecutive year of generating more than $300 million free cash flow. We ended the year with $3.8 billion of net debt. 
Our efforts to drive shareholder value and return cash to shareholder continue through both our dividend and share repurchase activity. As announced on August 1, we raised our annual dividend by 10% to $0.275 per share since the start of fiscal '16, and we also repurchased 28.8 million shares for a total of $803.3 million, including 3.9 million repurchased over the month of May through July. 
Finally, as we discussed earlier, in order to position the new Coty for sustainable growth, we are planning to divest all discontinued 6% to 8% of the combined portfolio net revenues. The timing of this portfolio rationalization is still being determined, and we'll be coming back to you with further updates over the course of the fiscal year. 
Our results illustrate that we are building a better business and are well on our way to becoming a strong leader in the global beauty industry.

So clearly, we have an efficiency program which will continue basically to improve our margin structure over time. We also have programs to improve our net working capital performance, which we've done a very good job of this year, to improve the cash flow. We also very strictly control the other cash flow elements, like CapEx, et cetera, within. So there are very separate programs in order to improve the margin structure and the cash flow generation from those basically to drive the top line. The top line performance is very much based on our innovation pipeline, the initiatives that we bring to the market, the strategy regarding our Power Brands as well as the support levels. And so in terms of support levels, we have continued to improve what we call the strategic spending within the A&P budget this year, again, compared to last year. And we're looking increasingly to make sure that we are spending the money in the right pockets on each one of these brands to drive top line growth harder. So it's really much -- it's very much focused on level of support, productivity of support, pipeline initiatives and supporting our Power Brands in terms of top lines and in terms of efficiency programs and cash conversion programs in order to enhance margins and cash flow generation."

So before we anchor too much on Q4, Q4 was encouraging, but we still have work to do from a Fragrance point of view. And there's a number of things which we'll be focusing very hard on. First, in terms of the core brands, both between Coty and P&G, is to nurture those much better with key pipeline initiatives and in-store execution. We will continue to focus harder and harder on that part of the business. In terms of the brands that we're parting ways with, there's a number of brands -- basically, clearly, with the merger, we have too many brands in the portfolio. As a result, it would be better that we rationalize some of those out, and I am sure they will be better managed by other players in the industry. And clearly, we'll be focusing mostly on our top brands, which are the brands like Gucci, Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, et cetera. So right now, clearly, we continue to manage these brands like they're our own, and we try to do the best we can on this portfolio. But like Patrice said, in the course of fiscal 2017, we would hope to part ways with these brands and to have a tighter, more focused portfolio, which we can drive harder from a growth point of view."

Having said that, the Brazilian business is very good. It's showing basically double-digit growth rates in reals, so which is very good. I think the other thing which is exciting about Hypermarcas, you might remember that we bought this business at an exchange rate which was in the range of like BRL 3.80-something, BRL 3.84, BRL 3.85. The current exchange rate is more like in the BRL 3.20s. So also, from a purchase price point of view, we've done very well.

In the U.S., it gained 18% market share of the total nail category in a span of less than 18 months, so which clearly means there is -- you can have very substantial year-on-year variations. So you are not going to see ever a very smooth cadence from a performance point of view. In my mind, there will be always some variation in there.

So I think we will have, with the P&G merger, a much stronger organization in place than what we've had on either side before. So not only do we have a better structure, which I think will be more competitive in the marketplace, simply because it's more focused, it's more focused from a portfolio point of view ultimately once we do execute the divestitures, but it's also more focused from an organizational setup point of view. We would have Coty Luxury competing heavily in the prestige channel on 2 or 3 categories, the same for Coty Beauty in the mass channel on 2 or 3 categories and the same basically for Coty Professional in the professional channel on 2 or 3 categories. So I think we're leaving -- we are putting in place a much stronger, more focused organization which is also staffed with better talent. On the first 4 levels in the organization, we have selected every individually by looking at the P&G people, the Coty people and, in a number of cases, external people. That staffing process is pretty much completed. So I think, from an organizational setup and staffing point of view, we're in much better shape. In terms of the key initiatives that we had in the fourth quarter, we had Davidoff Horizon, which is a new fragrance; Rimmel Super Gel polish; Marc Jacobs Splash; OPI's Hello Kitty; and the adidas UEFA Championship League (sic) [UEFA Champions League] edition. All did very well. Having said that, it's -- we are still not where I want to be from a growth point of view. We have a new number of new initiatives going in the marketplace. We have Calvin Klein Deep Euphoria to relaunch the Euphoria line, Marc Jacobs Divine Decadence to build on the Decadence success, Chloé's Eau de Parfum to further enhance Chloé's image and top line growth. We've launched Sally Hansen's Color Therapy line, which adds argan oil to the nail system to nourish and moisturize the nail for healthier-looking nails. We're Launching Rimmel, basically, Scandaleyes Reloaded, which is an extended-wear mascara, which is very easy to remove. So we're launching a number of new initiatives. Having said that, I still think, like I said before, that we have room for further improvement. We need to make -- get more productivity out of our investments. We still have opportunity to improve our in-store execution, to improve how we digitally engage our consumers. So there's a number of buckets where we have further opportunity. So we're putting in place a much better organization, much better structured, much better staffed, more focused. So we're positioning ourselves well for growth. So I'm very hopeful that with that and an intense focus on a number of areas where we can improve, that we are ultimately going to deliver from a growth point of view."

This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement, and then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions. 2016 was a good year",533,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everybody, to Coty's fourth quarter and full year conference call. This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement, and then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions. 
2016 was a good year both in terms of financial results and creating a much stronger foundation and capability to position Coty for future growth. In terms of financial results, our strategy of investing in and fueling growth of our Power Brands, while driving strong profit and margin expansion, is continuing to yield results. For the full year, Power Brands net revenues grew like-for-like, outperforming the overall business. Our adjusted operating profits grew low single digits, and when excluding currency impact, it grew high single digits. Adjusted EPS grew over 20% for the year. 
In terms of strengthening the foundation of the business, we made a number of strategic moves, all of which significantly enhance Coty's sales growth potential going forward. We closed on the Brazilian acquisition in February 2016, which showed strong revenue and profit momentum in its first full quarter results. Integration with Coty's Brazilian business is expected to be completed by September 2016, prior to the expected closing of the P&G Beauty Business transaction. 
In October 2015, we acquired the digital marketing platform Beamly, which has contributed to a step change in our capabilities to digitally engage with our consumers. We also made substantial progress on successfully integrating the Bourjois acquisition, which closed in April 2015. The Bourjois brand has now reached profitability levels consistent with Coty's Color Cosmetics segment, while net revenues showed strong like-for-like growth in the most recent quarter. 
Our preparation for the P&G Beauty Brands transaction is well advanced, with the closing of the transaction on track for October 2016. We believe the future organization, which is now largely staffed, is more focused, more experienced and, as a consequence, more competitive, ensuring greater potential for top line growth. As part of this, we are excited about the announcement of Camillo Pane as Chief Executive Officer and member of the Coty board effective the day after the closing of the transaction. Camillo has an excellent track record of accelerating growth, improving business performance and strengthening capabilities to create a best-in-class organization. 
We have also completed the cost and cash synergy analysis for the merger, confirming earlier announced targets of total potential cost savings of $780 million over 4 years post-transaction close. We continue to evaluate the impact of the intended portfolio and wholesale business rationalization. Finally, extensive work has also been done on business process and systems integration to prepare for a smooth transition following the close of the transaction in October 2016. 
Looking to fiscal 2017. Whilst it's premature to comment on the outlook for the combined business as the transaction has not yet closed, we continue our work on building a healthier and better Coty stand-alone business. We are targeting for the Coty stand-alone business like-for-like net revenue momentum to improve and return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year, with solid improvement in the constant-currency adjusted operating margin and strong operating cash flow conversion. 
I will now hand over the call to Patrice."

Total net revenues declined 1% like-for-like in the fourth quarter and full year, while constant-currency revenues increased 8% and 5%, respectively. 
During the year, our adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to 60.4%. This improvement in gross margin reflected a lower level of discounted pricing activity and our continuous effort in driving supply chain efficiencies. 
We have made significant progress in reducing our cost structure over the course of the year. We are now approximately 85% on the way through our Global Efficiency Program, having recognized approximately $230 million in savings through the end of the fiscal 2016. We remain on track to recognize the targeted $270 million in savings for fiscal '17. 
Our fiscal '16 adjusted operating income grew 3% to $622.9 million with a very strong 19% growth in the Q4 adjusted operating income. As a reminder, we have refined our adjusted metrics to exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which totaled $79.5 million in fiscal '16. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew a strong 9% in fiscal '16 and 24% in the quarter, illustrating our continued execution on streamlining costs. As a result of these efforts, the adjusted operating margin for the year increased 60 basis points to 14.3% from 13.7% in the prior year. 
During the year, we continued to execute on our strategy of reducing nonstrategic spend. Total A&CP spending at constant currency was in line with the prior year, with a significant increase in working media spending offset by a reduction in nonstrategic A&CP spending. 
By segment, our fiscal '16 Color Cosmetic adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis point to 14.9%, supported by lower promotional and discounting activity and the improved gross margin. 
Our Skin & Body Care adjusted operating margin expanded 380 basis point to 7.9%, primarily resulting from lower A&CP and improved gross margin. Our Fragrance adjusted operating margin remained strong at 16.5%, though it declined 170 basis point, partially driven by high cost of sales. 
Moving down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 1.9% compared to 17.7% in the prior year, reflecting a higher tax benefit in the current year. Altogether, our fiscal '16 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.37 reflected a very strong 21% growth. 
2016 was another strong year of cash generation, driven in part by significant progress in working capital improvement on our way to negative working capital. As a result, the operating cash flow totaled $501 million, and free cash flow totaled $351 million, up from $325 million in the prior year, despite an increase of over $100 million in cash acquisition-related costs. This was our seventh consecutive year of generating more than $300 million free cash flow. We ended the year with $3.8 billion of net debt. 
Our efforts to drive shareholder value and return cash to shareholder continue through both our dividend and share repurchase activity. As announced on August 1, we raised our annual dividend by 10% to $0.275 per share. Since the start of fiscal '16, we also repurchased 28.8 million shares for a total of $803.3 million, including 3.9 million repurchased over the month of May through July. 
Finally, as we discussed earlier, in order to position the new Coty for sustainable growth, we are planning to divest or discontinue 6% to 8% of the combined portfolio net revenues. The timing of this portfolio rationalization is still being determined, and we'll be coming back to you with further updates over the course of the fiscal year. 
Our results illustrate that we are building a better business and are well on our way to becoming a strong leader in the global beauty industry.

So there are very separate programs in order to improve the margin structure and the cash flow generation from those basically to drive the top line. The top line performance is very much based on our innovation pipeline, the initiatives that we bring to the market, the strategy regarding our Power Brands as well as the support levels. And so in terms of support levels, we have continued to improve what we call the strategic spending within the A&P budget this year, again, compared to last year. And we're looking increasingly to make sure that we are spending the money in the right pockets on each one of these brands to drive top line growth harder.

So before we hang too much on Q4, Q4 was encouraging, but we still have work to do from a Fragrance point of view. And there's a number of things which we'll be focusing very hard on. First, in terms of the core brands, both between Coty and P&G, is to nurture those much better with key pipeline initiatives and in-store execution. We will continue to focus harder and harder on that part of the business. In terms of the brands that we're parting ways with, there's a number of brands -- basically, clearly, with the merger, we have too many brands in the portfolio. As a result, it would be better that we rationalize some of those out, and I am sure they will be better managed by other players in the industry. And clearly, we'll be focusing mostly on our top brands, which are the brands like Gucci, Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, et cetera. So right now, clearly, we continue to manage these brands like they're our own, and we try to do the best we can on this portfolio. But like Patrice said, in the course of fiscal 2017, we would hope to part ways with these brands and to have a tighter, more focused portfolio, which we can drive harder from a growth point of view."

It's not like -- so I would not necessarily take that as the exact run rate. What I can tell you is that the business is doing very, very well. The Brazilian market is kind of not so hot. Having said that, the Brazilian business is very good. It's showing basically double-digit growth rates in reals, so which is very good. I think the other thing which is exciting about Hypermarcas, you might remember that we bought this business at an exchange rate which was more in the range of like BRL 3.80-something, BRL 3.84, BRL 3.85. The current exchange rate is more like in the BRL 3.20s. So also, from a purchase price point of view, we've done very well.

In the U.S., it gained 18% market share of the total nail category in a span of less than 18 months, so which clearly means there is -- you can have very substantial year-on-year variations. So you are not going to see ever a very smooth cadence from a performance point of view. In my mind, there will be always some variation in there. But we'd like to take this out as much as possible, but there will be some variations there. In terms of what we said, for fiscal '17, we expect growth basically in the second half.

So I think we will have, with the P&G merger, a much stronger organization in place than what we've had on either side before. So not only do we have a better structure, which I think will be more competitive in the marketplace, simply because it's more focused, it's more focused from a portfolio point of view ultimately once we do execute the divestitures, but it's also more focused from an organizational setup point of view. We would have Coty Luxury competing heavily in the prestige channel on 2 or 3 categories, the same for Coty Beauty in the mass channel on 2 or 3 categories, and the same basically for Coty Professional in the professional channel on 2 or 3 categories. So I think we're leaving -- we are putting in place a much stronger, more focused organization, which is also staffed with better talent. On the first 4 levels in the organization, we have selected every individually by looking at the P&G people, the Coty people and, in a number of cases, external people. That staffing process is pretty much completed. So I think, from an organizational setup and staffing point of view, we're in much better shape. In terms of the key initiatives that we had in the fourth quarter, we had Davidoff Horizon, which is a new fragrance; Rimmel Super Gel nail polish; Marc Jacobs Splash; OPI's Hello Kitty; and the adidas UEFA Championship League (sic) [UEFA Champions League] edition. All did very well. Having said that, it's -- we are still not where I want to be from a growth point of view. We have a number of new initiatives going in the marketplace. We have Calvin Klein Deep Euphoria to relaunch the Euphoria line, Marc Jacobs Divine Decadence to build on the Decadence success, Chloé's Eau de Parfum to further enhance Chloé's image and top line growth. We've launched Sally Hansen's Color Therapy line, which adds argan oil to the nail system to nourish and moisturize the nail for healthier-looking nails. We're launching Rimmel, basically, Scandaleyes Reloaded, which is an extended-wear mascara, which is very easy to remove. So we're launching a number of new initiatives. Having said that, I still think, like I said before, that we have room for further improvement. We need to make -- get more productivity out of our investments. We still have opportunity to improve our in-store execution, to improve how we digitally engage our consumers. So there's a number of buckets where we have further opportunity. So we're putting in place a much better organization, much better structured, much better staffed, more focused. So we're positioning ourselves well for growth. So I'm very hopeful that with that and an intense focus on a number of areas where we can improve, that we are ultimately going to deliver from a growth point of view."

This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement, and then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions. 2016 was a good year",533,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everybody, to Coty's fourth quarter and full year conference call. This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement, and then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions. 
2016 was a good year both in terms of financial results and creating a much stronger foundation and capability to position Coty for future growth. In terms of financial results, our strategy of investing in and fueling growth of our Power Brands, while driving strong profit and margin expansion, is continuing to yield results. For the full year, Power Brands net revenues grew like-for-like, outperforming the overall business. Our adjusted operating profits grew low single digits, and when excluding currency impact, it grew high single digits. Adjusted EPS grew over 20% for the year. 
In terms of strengthening the foundation of the business, we made a number of strategic moves, all of which significantly enhance Coty's sales growth potential going forward. We closed on the Brazilian acquisition in February 2016, which showed strong revenue and profit momentum in its first full quarter results. Integration with Coty's Brazilian business is expected to be completed by September 2016, prior to the expected closing of the P&G Beauty Business transaction. 
In October 2015, we acquired the digital marketing platform Beamly, which has contributed to a step change in our capabilities to digitally engage with our consumers. We also made substantial progress on successfully integrating the Bourjois acquisition, which closed in April 2015. The Bourjois brand has now reached profitability levels consistent with Coty's Color Cosmetics segment, while net revenues showed strong like-for-like growth in the most recent quarter. 
Our preparation for the P&G Beauty Brands transaction is well advanced, with the closing of the transaction on track for October 2016. We believe the future organization, which is now largely staffed, is more focused, more experienced and, as a consequence, more competitive, ensuring greater potential for top line growth. As part of this, we are excited about the announcement of Camillo Pane as Chief Executive Officer and member of the Coty board effective the day after the closing of the transaction. Camillo has an excellent track record of accelerating growth, improving business performance and strengthening capabilities to create a best-in-class organization. 
We have also completed the cost and cash synergy analysis for the merger, confirming earlier announced targets of total potential cost savings of $780 million over 4 years post-transaction close. We continue to evaluate the impact of the intended portfolio and wholesale business rationalization. Finally, extensive work has also been done on business process and systems integration to prepare for a smooth transition following the close of the transaction in October 2016. 
Looking to fiscal 2017. Whilst it's premature to comment on the outlook for the combined business as the transaction has not yet closed, we continue our work on building a healthier and better Coty stand-alone business. We are targeting for the Coty stand-alone business like-for-like net revenue momentum to improve and return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year, with solid improvement in the constant-currency adjusted operating margin and strong operating cash flow conversion. 
I will now hand over the call to Patrice."

Total net revenues declined 1% like-for-like in the fourth quarter and full year, while constant-currency revenues increased 8% and 5%, respectively.

Total net revenues declined 1% like-for-like in the fourth quarter and full year, while constant-currency revenues increased 8% and 5%, respectively. 
During the year, our adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to 60.4%. This improvement in gross margin reflected a lower level of discounted pricing activity and our continuous effort in driving supply chain efficiencies. 
We have made significant progress in reducing our cost structure over the course of the year. We are now approximately 85% on the way through our Global Efficiency Program, having recognized approximately $230 million in savings through the end of the fiscal 2016. We remain on track to recognize the targeted $270 million in savings for fiscal '17. 
Our fiscal '16 adjusted operating income grew 3% to $622.9 million with a very strong 19% growth in the Q4 adjusted operating income. As a reminder, we have refined our adjusted metrics to exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which totaled $79.5 million in fiscal '16. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew a strong 9% in fiscal '16 and 24% in the quarter, illustrating our continued execution on streamlining costs. As a result of these efforts, the adjusted operating margin for the year increased 60 basis points to 14.3% from 13.7% in the prior year. 
During the year, we continued to execute on our strategy of reducing nonstrategic spend. Total A&CP spending at constant currency was in line with the prior year, with a significant increase in working media spending offset by a reduction in nonstrategic A&CP spending. 
By segment, our fiscal '16 Color Cosmetic adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis point to 14.9%, supported by lower promotional and discounting activity and the improved gross margin. 
Our Skin & Body Care adjusted operating margin expanded 380 basis point to 7.9%, primarily resulting from lower A&CP and improved gross margin. Our Fragrance adjusted operating margin remained strong at 16.5%, though it declined 170 basis point, partially driven by high cost of sales. 
Moving down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 1.9% compared to 17.7% in the prior year, reflecting a higher tax benefit in the current year. Altogether, our fiscal '16 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.37 reflected a very strong 21% growth. 
2016 was another strong year of cash generation, driven in part by significant progress in working capital improvement on our way to negative working capital. As a result, the operating cash flow totaled $501 million, and free cash flow totaled $351 million, up from $325 million in the prior year, despite an increase of over $100 million in cash acquisition-related costs. This was our seventh consecutive year of generating more than $300 million free cash flow. We ended the year with $3.8 billion of net debt. 
Our efforts to drive shareholder value and return cash to shareholder continue through both our dividend and share repurchase activity. As announced on August 1, we raised our annual dividend by 10% to $0.275 per share. Since the start of fiscal '16, we also repurchased 28.8 million shares for a total of $803.3 million, including 3.9 million repurchased over the month of May through July. 
Finally, as we discussed earlier, in order to position the new Coty for sustainable growth, we are planning to divest or discontinue 6% to 8% of the combined portfolio net revenues. The timing of this portfolio rationalization is still being determined, and we'll be coming back to you with further updates over the course of the fiscal year. 
Our results illustrate that we are building a better business and are well on our way to becoming a strong leader in the global beauty industry.

So there are very separate programs in order to improve the margin structure and the cash flow generation from those basically to drive the top line. The top line performance is very much based on our innovation pipeline, the initiatives that we bring to the market, the strategy regarding our Power Brands as well as the support levels. And so in terms of support levels, we have continued to improve what we call the strategic spending within the A&P budget this year, again, compared to last year.

If you look at the full year, the picture is -- clearly is a bit different. There, we have a good -- positive contribution from price/mix, with volume being negative. So before we hang too much on Q4, Q4 was encouraging, but we still have work to do from a Fragrance point of view. And there's a number of things which we'll be focusing very hard on. First, in terms of the core brands, both between Coty and P&G, is to nurture those much better with key pipeline initiatives and in-store execution. We will continue to focus harder and harder on that part of the business. In terms of the brands that we're parting ways with, there's a number of brands -- basically, clearly, with the merger, we have too many brands in the portfolio. As a result, it would be better that we rationalize some of those out, and I am sure they will be better managed by other players in the industry. And clearly, we'll be focusing mostly on our top brands, which are the brands like Gucci, Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, et cetera. So right now, clearly, we continue to manage these brands like they're our own, and we try to do the best we can on this portfolio. But like Patrice said, in the course of fiscal 2017, we would hope to part ways with these brands and to have a tighter, more focused portfolio, which we can drive harder from a growth point of view."

It's not like -- so I would not necessarily take that as the exact run rate. What I can tell you is that the business is doing very, very well. The Brazilian market is kind of not so hot. Having said that, the Brazilian business is very good. It's showing basically double-digit growth rates in reals, so which is very good. I think the other thing which is exciting about Hypermarcas, you might remember that we bought this business at an exchange rate which was more in the range of like BRL 3.80-something, BRL 3.84, BRL 3.85. The current exchange rate is more like in the BRL 3.20s. So also, from a purchase price point of view, we've done very well. So we are very happy with the transaction as is, and we're very happy with the progress in terms of integration on Hypermarcas.

In the U.S., it gained 18% market share of the total nail category in a span of less than 18 months, so which clearly means there is -- you can have very substantial year-on-year variations. So you are not going to see ever a very smooth cadence from a performance point of view. In my mind, there will be always some variation in there. But we'd like to take this out as much as possible, but there will be some variations there. In terms of what we said, for fiscal '17, we expect growth basically in the second half.

We're launching Rimmel, basically, Scandaleyes Reloaded, which is an extended-wear mascara, which is very easy to remove. So we're launching a number of new initiatives. Having said that, I still think, like I said before, that we have room for further improvement. We need to make -- get more productivity out of our investments. We still have opportunity to improve our in-store execution, to improve how we digitally engage our consumers. So there's a number of buckets where we have further opportunity. So we're putting in place a much better organization, much better structured, much better staffed, more focused. So we're positioning ourselves well for growth. So I'm very hopeful that with that and an intense focus on a number of areas where we can improve, that we are ultimately going to deliver from a growth point of view."

This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement and recent developments, and Camilo will offer his initial thoughts on the state of the business. T",566,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everybody, to Coty's First Quarter Conference Call. 
This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement and recent developments, and Camilo will offer his initial thoughts on the state of the business. Then we'll be pleased to take your questions. 
The last several months have been truly transformational for Coty. On October 1, we completed the merger of the P&G Specialty Beauty Business into Coty with a $1 billion lower cash payment than anticipated at the announcement of the transaction. 
I would like to thank the teams involved from Coty and P&G for all their hard work over the last 15 months in creating the platform for Coty to become a global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. I'm confident that we now have largely the right team, organizational structure and culture to make the vision of this merger a reality. 
Our new CEO, Camillo Pane, the executive team and the divisional, regional and country management teams are now in place and are working on exiting transitional service arrangements with P&G while increasingly focusing on rebuilding business momentum. 
As expected, the extensive work over the last 15 months on closing the transaction and merging the 2 businesses has come at a cost. As discussed prior to the closure, the resources, which normally work in the business, have also been working on closing the transaction and the setup and future of the combined company. The resulting distraction, as well as the recent change in management team in our headquarters, regions and countries had contributed to a decline in Coty's stand-alone revenues and profits in Q1. 
Reported and constant currency revenues declined moderately, and adjusted operating income declined by a mid-teens percentage compared to the same period last year. While we are anticipating similar revenue trends in Q2, we are committed not only to real improvement in the trends in the second half, excluding divestitures, but also to achieving further improvement for the combined company in the following fiscal years. This combined company 2017 outlook replaces all prior fiscal 2017 outlooks. 
Importantly, we continue to target the total 4-year synergies and working capital benefits of $750 million and $500 million, respectively, with no change to the operating costs to realize both. We also remain committed to our previously communicated adjusted EPS target of at least $1.53 for fiscal 2020 despite the property impact of the current decline in revenues. 
Additionally, we firmly -- we remain firmly committed to using Coty's expected strong postmerger cash flow to build Coty into a much stronger global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. In this respect, we are very happy with our recent acquisition of the Hypermarcas beauty business in Brazil and our pending acquisition of ghd, which we expect will continue to strengthen Coty's global portfolio, its growth exposure and its profit and cash generation. 
As departing interim CEO and remaining Chairman, I believe the future of the new Coty under our new CEO, Camillo Pane, is a great one. It certainly will be a journey to realize the ambitions we have set for the company. And while there may be challenges as we integrate and rebuild the business, we are firmly committed to realizing the ambitions we have and delivering value for all our shareholders. 
I will now turn it over to Patrice to discuss the Q1 results in more detail."

Q1 net revenues declined 3% as reported and declined 2% at constant currency. Excluding the 6% contribution from the Brazil acquisition, net revenues declined 8%. Our adjusted gross margin declined 150 basis",535,"Thank you, Bart, and good morning, everyone. 
Q1 net revenues declined 3% as reported and declined 2% at constant currency. Excluding the 6% contribution from the Brazil acquisition, net revenues declined 8%. Our adjusted gross margin declined 150 basis points to 58.8%, driven by the contribution of the lower gross margin Brazil acquisition, as the gross margin of the remaining Coty business remained consistent year-over-year. 
The Q1 adjusted operating income declined 14% to $106.4 million, resulting in a 15.4% adjusted operating margin. This decline was driven by 2 primary factors: First, revenue declined translated to lower adjusted gross and operating profit; second, Q1 fixed cost increased on an absolute and percentage basis as we ramped up staffing and other investment in anticipation of the close of the P&G Beauty transaction. 
By segment. Two of the segments, Skin & Body Care and Fragrance, showed solid profitability performance despite a broader top line weakness. The Q1 Skin & Body Care adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis points to 9%, fueled by a mix-driven improvement in gross margin. The Fragrance adjusted operating margin reached a solid 21.5% margin, a decline versus prior. The Color Cosmetic adjusted operating margin declined 460 basis point to 11.3%, as we ramped up A&P investment despite the lower revenues. Finally, the Brazil acquisition reached an adjusted operating margin of 8.6%, largely reflecting the fact that Q1 is typically the lowest quarter seasonally for the Brazil business.
Moving down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.1% compared to negative 38.4% in the prior year, reflecting the $113.3 million tax benefit in the prior year period. All together, this drove an adjusted diluted EPS of $0.23. 
During the quarter and prior to the close of the merger, we repurchased 1.4 million shares. As well, we returned additional cash to shareholders with the distribution of an annual dividend of $0.275 per share.
Turning to the capital structure. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in net debt. In October, we took the opportunity to successfully borrow an incremental $1.1 billion in term loans and used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In addition, we refinanced approximately $1.6 billion in term loans to reduce annual interest expense by almost $10 million per year. We also benefited from only $1.9 billion in assumed debt in the merger, which was $1 billion less than the assumed debt amount when we first announced the merger in July 2015.
As far as the merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business is concerned, we are confident about the potential of this merger to strengthen Coty's margin, earnings and cash generation profile. I'm happy to confirm the 4-year synergies and working capital benefits of $750 million and $500 million, respectively, with no change to the operating cost to realize both. We also remain committed to our previously communicated adjusted EPS target of at least $1.53 for fiscal 2020. 
We remain confident in the long-term cash flow profile of the company, as well as the strength of our balance sheet, which will allow us to fulfill our long-term ambition. 
I will now turn it over to Camilo to offer his preliminary views on the business."

It's my great privilege to take over the reins of leadership at such a transformational moment.

It's my great privilege to take over the reins of leadership at such a transformational moment. With this merger, we have brought together a powerful portfolio of beauty brands and some of the world's most talented people in beauty and consumer goods. 
Being in the CEO role for a little over a month now, I've been focused on 3 key priorities: First, I'm visiting many of the Coty key countries, meeting with the significant customers and reviewing the business with the country management teams; second, I'm now reviewing in-depth the innovation pipeline for the next 1, 2 years; third, I continue to support the internal work in accelerating Coty's capabilities in digital communication, e-commerce and in-store.
While I will offer a more comprehensive assessment of our business on the next earnings call in February, I did want to take this opportunity to offer some initial thoughts. 
The substantial changes within Coty over the last years, from carving out the Beauty Business from P&G to introducing a new organizational structure and changing the management teams in a number of [indiscernible] countries, have clearly impacted the organization. In the short term, this means some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter as everyone settles into their roles and the organization learns to run as one company. 
However, I have a high level of confidence in the long-term outlook and fundamentals of the business. Within the combined Coty portfolio, I see a lot of positives in professional beauty and luxury. The salon hair business continues to perform well. And while still early, we are seeing early indication that the OPI nail brand is a very good fit for distribution. And I believe this will result in much better mid- to long-term growth momentum for OPI. 
Speaking of the Luxury Division, this business is anchored by a number of leading brands, including Gucci, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss and philosophy. And I'm encouraged by the pipeline of upcoming launches in the combined portfolio, including, of course, the launch of Tiffany.
Turning to Consumer Beauty. It's clear that this is a division that is facing a number of challenges. These challenges include the positioning of some of the brands, the strength of the pipeline, the in-store execution, as well as the competitive pressure in the market. We have begun our work to address these issues, and I will have more information to provide on the next call as to the steps we are taking to regain momentum in this business.
I'm very excited and encouraged by the progress we are making to communicate and engage with today's consumers, who are increasingly living in a digital world. Our digital capabilities were significantly enhanced by last year acquisition of the digital marketing platform, Beamly. Beamly is already helping us improve the social engagement of our brands through campaign optimization, social listening and deeper brand targeting. We have significantly increased the proportion of our media spending aimed at digital, and I'm pleased with the results I have seen.
While a key focus in the near term will be on integrating the P&G Specialty Beauty Business and improving our growth momentum, we believe there is space for selective M&A where it can be managed without unduly disrupting our integration and growth focus, where it clearly benefits our future growth trajectory and delivers shareholder value.
With respect to our recent transactions, we continue to be encouraged by the in-market performance of the Brazil acquisition, with sell-through growing strong double-digit in a market which is growing high single-digit. 
We also announced on October 17 the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire ghd, a premium brand in high-end hair styling appliances. We believe ghd's strong historical growth, driven by geographical expansion and channel diversification beyond salons, including a sizable e-commerce business, will only be enhanced by Bella's [ph] substantial distribution capabilities and complementary portfolio brands. 
The acquisition, which is expected to close prior to the end of this calendar year, is the first step in our strategy to gradually shift the market growth exposure of our combined portfolio closer to 3 -- to the 3%, 4% global beauty industry growth rate. 
I'm very energized by the opportunities ahead for the new Coty and look forward to working with my new leadership team to drive Coty to profitable growth and to be a new global leader and challenger in the Beauty industry. 
Thank you. We'll now open the call for questions."

Sort of in the near term, if the second quarter is going to be a continuation of the underlying sales growth we just saw now, I'm not sure kind of what lightswitch flicks as we go into back half and revenue growth accelerates, all that much. So is it just the timing of new product launches? Or do you expect some underlying improvement in the market? If you could help us have confidence that this really negative trend isn't going to persist through the entire year. And then second question, I know you said in your prepared comments that, that $1.53 for 2020 is still the target, but it sounds like today is a downward revision to the growth outlook for fiscal '17. So what's better in your forecast that helps you make up for the shortfall so you can still hit that $1.53?"

So clearly, what is impacting in Q2 are the same factors which are impacting in Q1. We should not forget that -- so clearly, fiscal '17 is clearly a year of transition, and the transition is largely taking place in the first 6 months and only gradually comes out in the back half. What do I mean by transition? Clearly, we have a complete new organizational structure, which is different from either the Coty or the P&G structure, and we have many new people. And so the combination of the 2 means that a lot of people have new jobs in different locations at some point in time. So that has clearly created a substantial level of distraction. People are not necessarily fully focused on the business for a period of time because they're in transition, or alternatively, they're also helping out on the integration of the business. And so those 2 factors basically have caused distraction and have caused us to lose momentum, basically, in the business, which we believe we're in the process of addressing. In addition to that, we believe that those factors will abate in the second half. In addition to that, we believe we have a good pipeline -- or a better pipeline on some of our brands in the second half, which make us believe that the trend will improve in the second half as well. So those are the 2 key factors, some factors abating, and at the same time, pipeline improving, which should improve the momentum in the second 6 months. In terms of the earnings per share, we believe basically that beyond the cost synergies of the business, there's also an improvement that we can have on the underlying business. And therefore, we believe the $1.53 by fiscal 2020 is a doable and reachable number."

What I can tell you is that Max Factor is not being relaunched in a major way in the United States. There's a lot of activity on Cover Girl.

So we believe that professional is in good shape and will show good momentum in the second half. The professional business has gone pretty well over the more recent periods and will continue in our -- solid momentum. And the top of it is going to have OPI folded into that, so which we also believe is going to be very positive on OPI. Because as you may remember, Coty did not have a professional division, and it had an OPI professional brand. And it was very difficult for any of that business because it had a skeleton infrastructure nonurgent do so. Now we have a full-fledged infrastructure, and we believe that will be very healthy on the OPI business. So we believe professional. On, the P&G and on the Coty side, will show very nice trends. On the fragrance side, we believe that, on the main brands, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, et cetera, we have very nice initiatives in order to steadily improve the momentum on that business relative to where we are today. I also would like to offer to you that in the first quarter, for sure, and potentially in the second quarter, there has been some rationalization of wholesale inventories taking place, which clearly also is going to gradually abate. So the number one challenge remains basically on the Consumer Beauty business, and this will take longer. We might see some improvement, but there is lot of things, which need to be tackled. And we already mentioned we have several large brands. And Camillo already alluded to this. Clearly, we have challenges on Cover Girl, Max Factor and Sally Hansen, all of which need to be addressed, and we're in the process of doing that. So net-net, I think professional should see good momentum and continued good momentum. I think, on luxury, we should see improving momentum. Consumer Beauty will be the biggest challenge, and I think there will take a longer. We might see some improved results in the second half, but it will take longer to address that."

So any kind of thoughts on your ability to add value going forward and what the past kind of how that informs that ability?"

So just to give you some very clear examples of that. So first of all, there is the geographical benefit. In a number of countries, both -- either party, both parties were relatively marginal players. And combined, they are basically critical mass players. Countries like Mexico, et cetera, are classic examples of this. So we will have a real infrastructure to build from. That clearly is only going to really materialize post the access of transitional service arrangements, implementing all the restructuring programs, et cetera. But there is a real benefit that we can build off that. We will have the benefit of moving, as part of that, from distributors into whole flash operational entities, which there is a clear benefit for sure on the top line but also on the bottom line from doing that moving out of these distributors. There is a benefit of OPI brands being managed by the professional division, which there is a clear benefit of that because Coty did have a skeleton -- -- only had a skeleton infrastructure to manage that. And I believe that is a very good news for OPI on a global basis for it to be managed by the professional division. There are benefits in terms of cross-fertilization on the R&D side. P&G has certain skill sets in terms of fragrances, which Coty doesn't have. And Coty has certain skill sets in the R&D, particularly in the packaging area, which P&G doesn't have. So there is a clear synergistic benefit between the 2. Clearly, there is best practice benchmarking in terms of cost of goods and manufacturing and operating costs, which is starting to happen as we speak. So there are clear, basically, benefits in those areas as well. So in addition to that, there are clear all the financial benefits from our procurement point of view, which I already alluded to. So there are synergistic benefits, in particular, I would say, in R&D and manufacturing and basically go-to-market and in terms of the scale and emerging markets."

This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement and recent developments, and Camillo will offer his initial thoughts on the state of the business. Then we'll be pleased to take your questions. 
The last several months have been truly transformational for Coty. On October 1, we completed the merger of the P&G Specialty Beauty Business into Coty with a $1 billion lower cash payment than anticipated at the announcement of the transaction. 
I would like to thank the teams involved from Coty and P&G for all their hard work over the last 15 months in creating the platform for Coty to become a global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. I'm confident that we now have largely the right team, organizational structure and culture to make the vision of this merger a reality. 
Our new CEO, Camillo Pane, the executive team and the divisional, regional and country management teams are now in place and are working on exiting transitional service arrangements with P&G while increasingly focusing on rebuilding business momentum. 
As expected, the extensive work over the last 15 months on closing the transaction and merging the 2 businesses has come at a cost. As discussed prior to the closure, the resources, which normally work in the business, have also been working on closing the transaction and the setup and future of the combined company. The resulting distraction, as well as the recent change in management team in our headquarters, regions and countries had contributed to a decline in Coty's stand-alone revenues and profits in Q1. 
Reported and constant currency revenues declined moderately, and adjusted operating income declined by a mid-teens percentage compared to the same period last year. While we are anticipating similar revenue trends in Q2, we are committed not only to real improvement in the trends in the second half, excluding divestitures, but also to achieving further improvement for the combined company in the following fiscal years. This combined company 2017 outlook replaces all prior fiscal 2017 outlooks. 
Importantly, we continue to target the total 4-year synergies and working capital benefits of $750 million and $500 million, respectively, with no change to the operating costs to realize both. We also remain committed to our previously communicated adjusted EPS target of at least $1.53 for fiscal 2020 despite the property impact of the current decline in revenues. 
Additionally, we firmly -- we remain firmly committed to using Coty's expected strong post-merger cash flow to build Coty into a much stronger global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. In this respect, we are very happy with our recent acquisition of the Hypermarcas beauty business in Brazil and our pending acquisition of ghd, which we expect will continue to strengthen Coty's global portfolio, its growth exposure and its profit and cash generation. 
As departing interim CEO and remaining Chairman, I believe the future of the new Coty under our new CEO, Camillo Pane, is a great one. It certainly will be a journey to realize the ambitions we have set for the company. And while there may be challenges as we integrate and rebuild the business, we are firmly committed to realizing the ambitions we have and delivering value for all our shareholders. 
I will now turn it over to Patrice to discuss the Q1 results in more detail."

Q1 net revenues declined 3% as reported and declined 2% at constant currency. Excluding the 6% contribution from the Brazil acquisition, net revenues declined 8%. Our adjusted gross margin declined 150 basis",535,"Thank you, Bart, and good morning, everyone. 
Q1 net revenues declined 3% as reported and declined 2% at constant currency. Excluding the 6% contribution from the Brazil acquisition, net revenues declined 8%. Our adjusted gross margin declined 150 basis points to 58.8%, driven by the contribution of the lower gross margin Brazil acquisition, as the gross margin of the remaining Coty business remained consistent year-over-year. 
The Q1 adjusted operating income declined 14% to $106.4 million, resulting in a 15.4% adjusted operating margin. This decline was driven by 2 primary factors: First, revenue declined translated to lower adjusted gross and operating profit; second, Q1 fixed cost increased on an absolute and percentage basis as we ramped up staffing and other investment in anticipation of the close of the P&G Beauty transaction. 
By segment. Two of the segments, Skin & Body Care and Fragrance, showed solid profitability performance despite a broader top line weakness. The Q1 Skin & Body Care adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis points to 9%, fueled by a mix-driven improvement in gross margin. The Fragrance adjusted operating margin reached a solid 21.5% margin, a decline versus prior. The Color Cosmetic adjusted operating margin declined 460 basis point to 11.3%, as we ramped up A&P investment despite the lower revenues. Finally, the Brazil acquisition reached an adjusted operating margin of 8.6%, largely reflecting the fact that Q1 is typically the lowest quarter seasonally for the Brazil business.
Moving down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.1% compared to negative 38.4% in the prior year, reflecting the $113.3 million tax benefit in the prior year period. All together, this drove an adjusted diluted EPS of $0.23. 
During the quarter and prior to the close of the merger, we repurchased 1.4 million shares. As well, we returned additional cash to shareholders with the distribution of an annual dividend of $0.275 per share.
Turning to the capital structure. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in net debt. In October, we took the opportunity to successfully borrow an incremental $1.1 billion in term loans and used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In addition, we refinanced approximately $1.6 billion in term loans to reduce annual interest expense by almost $10 million per year. We also benefited from only $1.9 billion in assumed debt in the merger, which was $1 billion less than the assumed debt amount when we first announced the merger in July 2015.
As far as the merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business is concerned, we are confident about the potential of this merger to strengthen Coty's margin, earnings and cash generation profile. I'm happy to confirm the 4-year synergies and working capital benefits of $750 million and $500 million, respectively, with no change to the operating cost to realize both. We also remain committed to our previously communicated adjusted EPS target of at least $1.53 for fiscal 2020. 
We remain confident in the long-term cash flow profile of the company, as well as the strength of our balance sheet, which will allow us to fulfill our long-term ambition. 
I will now turn it over to Camillo to offer his preliminary views on the business."

It's my great privilege to take over the reins of leadership at such a transformational moment. With this merger, we have brought together a powerful portfolio of beauty brands and some of the world's most talented people in beauty and consumer goods. 
Being in the CEO role for a little over a month now, I've been focused on 3 key priorities: First, I'm visiting many of the Coty key countries, meeting with the significant customers and reviewing the business with the country management teams; second, I'm now reviewing in-depth the innovation pipeline for the next 1, 2 years; third, I continue to support the internal work in accelerating Coty's capabilities in digital communication, e-commerce and in-store.
While I will offer a more comprehensive assessment of our business on the next earnings call in February, I did want to take this opportunity to offer some initial thoughts. 
The substantial changes within Coty over the last years, from carving out the Beauty Business from P&G to introducing a new organizational structure and changing the management teams in a number of categories and countries, have clearly impacted the organization. In the short term, this means some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter as everyone settles into their roles and the organization learns to run as one company. 
However, I have a high level of confidence in the long-term outlook and fundamentals of the business. Within the combined Coty portfolio, I see a lot of positives in professional beauty and luxury. The salon hair business continues to perform well. And while still early, we are seeing early indication that the OPI nail brand is a very good fit for distribution. And I believe this will result in much better mid- to long-term growth momentum for OPI. 
Speaking of the Luxury Division, this business is anchored by a number of leading brands, including Gucci, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss and philosophy. And I'm encouraged by the pipeline of upcoming launches in the combined portfolio, including, of course, the launch of Tiffany.
Turning to Consumer Beauty. It's clear that this is a division that is facing a number of challenges. These challenges include the positioning of some of the brands, the strength of the pipeline, the in-store execution, as well as the competitive pressure in the market. We have begun our work to address these issues, and I will have more information to provide on the next call as to the steps we are taking to regain momentum in this business.
I'm very excited and encouraged by the progress we are making to communicate and engage with today's consumers, who are increasingly living in a digital world. Our digital capabilities were significantly enhanced by last year acquisition of the digital marketing platform, Beamly. Beamly is already helping us improve the social engagement of our brands through campaign optimization, social listening and deeper brand targeting. We have significantly increased the proportion of our media spending aimed at digital, and I'm pleased with the results I have seen.
While a key focus in the near term will be on integrating the P&G Specialty Beauty Business and improving our growth momentum, we believe there is space for selective M&A where it can be managed without unduly disrupting our integration and growth focus, where it clearly benefits our future growth trajectory and delivers shareholder value.
With respect to our recent transactions, we continue to be encouraged by the in-market performance of the Brazil acquisition, with sell-through growing strong double-digit in a market which is growing high single-digit. 
We also announced on October 17 the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire ghd, a premium brand in high-end hair styling appliances. We believe ghd's strong historical growth, driven by geographical expansion and channel diversification beyond salons, including a sizable e-commerce business, will only be enhanced by Wella's substantial distribution capabilities and complementary portfolio brands. 
The acquisition, which is expected to close prior to the end of this calendar year, is the first step in our strategy to gradually shift the market growth exposure of our combined portfolio closer to 3 -- to the 3%, 4% global beauty industry growth rate. 
I'm very energized by the opportunities ahead for the new Coty and look forward to working with my new leadership team to drive Coty to profitable growth and to be a new global leader and challenger in the Beauty industry. 
Thank you. We'll now open the call for questions."

Sort of in the near term, if the second quarter is going to be a continuation of the underlying sales growth we just saw now, I'm not sure kind of what light switch flicks as we go into back half and revenue growth accelerates, all that much. So is it just the timing of new product launches? Or do you expect some underlying improvement in the market? If you could help us have confidence that this really negative trend isn't going to persist through the entire year. And then second question, I know you said in your prepared comments that, that $1.53 for 2020 is still the target, but it sounds like today is a downward revision to the growth outlook for fiscal '17. So what's better in your forecast that helps you make up for the shortfall so you can still hit that $1.53?"

So clearly, what is impacting in Q2 are the same factors which are impacting in Q1. We should not forget that -- so clearly, fiscal '17 is clearly a year of transition, and the transition is largely taking place in the first 6 months and only gradually comes out in the back half. What do I mean by transition? Clearly, we have a complete new organizational structure, which is different from either the Coty or the P&G structure, and we have many new people. And so the combination of the 2 means that a lot of people have new jobs in different locations at some point in time. So that has clearly created a substantial level of distraction. People are not necessarily fully focused on the business for a period of time because they're in transition, or alternatively, they're also helping out on the integration of the business. And so those 2 factors basically have caused distraction and have caused us to lose momentum, basically, in the business, which we believe we're in the process of addressing. In addition to that, we believe that those factors will abate in the second half. In addition to that, we believe we have a good pipeline -- or a better pipeline on some of our brands in the second half, which make us believe that the trend will improve in the second half as well. So those are the 2 key factors, some factors abating, and at the same time, pipeline improving, which should improve the momentum in the second 6 months. In terms of the earnings per share, we believe basically that beyond the cost synergies of the business, there's also an improvement that we can have on the underlying business. And therefore, we believe the $1.53 by fiscal 2020 is a doable and reachable number."

So we believe that professional is in good shape and will show good momentum in the second half. The professional business has done pretty well over the more recent periods and will continue, in our minds, show solid momentum. And the top of it, it's going to have OPI folded into that, so which we also believe is going to be very positive on OPI. Because as you may remember, Coty did not have a professional division and it had an OPI professional brand, and it was very difficult for [indiscernible] of that business because it had a skeleton infrastructure in order to do so. Now we have a full-fledged infrastructure, and we believe that we'll be very healthy on the OPI business. So we believe professional on the P&G and on the Coty side will show very nice trends. On the Fragrance side, we believe that, on our main brands, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, et cetera, we have some very nice initiatives in order to steadily improve the momentum on that business relative to where we are today. I also would like to offer to you that in the first quarter, for sure, and potentially in the second quarter, there has been some rationalization of wholesale inventories taking place, which clearly also is going to gradually abate. So the #1 challenge remains basically on the Consumer Beauty business, and this will take longer. We might see some improvement, but there is a lot of things which need to be tackled. And we already mentioned we have several large brands. And Camillo already alluded to this. We -- clearly, we have challenges on Cover Girl, Max Factor and Sally Hansen, all of which need to be addressed, and we're in the process of doing that. So net-net, I think professional should see good momentum, and continued good momentum. I think on luxury, we should see improving momentum. Consumer Beauty will be the biggest challenge, and I think that will take longer. We might see some improved results in the second half, but it will take longer to address that."

In a number of countries, both -- either party or both parties were relatively marginal players. And combined, they are basically critical mass players. Countries like Mexico, et cetera, are classic examples of this. So we will have a real infrastructure to build from. That clearly is only going to really materialize post the exit of transitional service arrangements, implementing all the restructuring programs, et cetera. But there is a real benefit that we can build off that. We will have the benefit of moving, as part of that, from distributors into full fledged operational entities, which there is a clear benefit for sure on the top line but also on the bottom line from doing that, moving out of these distributors. There is a benefit of OPI brand being managed by the professional division, which there is a clear benefit of that because Coty did have a skeleton -- -- only had a skeleton infrastructure to manage that. And I believe that is a very good news for OPI on a global basis for it to be managed by the professional division. There are benefit in terms of the cross-fertilization on the R&D side. P&G has certain skill sets in terms of fragrances which Coty doesn't have, and Coty has certain skill sets in the R&D, particularly in the packaging area, which P&G doesn't have. So there is a clear synergistic benefit between the 2. Clearly, there is the best practice benchmarking in terms of cost of goods and manufacturing and operating cost, which is starting to happen as we speak. So there are clear, basically, benefits in this area as well. So in addition to that, there are clearly all the financial benefits from our procurement point of view, which I already alluded to.

This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement and recent developments, and Camillo will offer his initial thoughts on the state of the business. Then we'll be pleased to take your questions. 
The last several months have been truly transformational for Coty. On October 1, we completed the merger of the P&G Specialty Beauty Business into Coty with a $1 billion lower cash payment than anticipated at the announcement of the transaction. 
I would like to thank the teams involved from Coty and P&G for all their hard work over the last 15 months in creating the platform for Coty to become a global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. I'm confident that we now have largely the right team, organizational structure and culture to make the vision of this merger a reality. 
Our new CEO, Camillo Pane, the executive team and the divisional, regional and country management teams are now in place and are working on exiting/transitional service arrangements with P&G while increasingly focusing on rebuilding business momentum. 
As expected, the extensive work over the last 15 months on closing the transaction and merging the 2 businesses has come at a cost. As discussed prior to the closure, the resources, which normally work in the business, have also been working on closing the transaction and the setup and future of the combined company. The resulting distraction, as well as the recent change in management team in our headquarters, regions and countries has contributed to a decline in Coty's stand-alone revenues and profits in Q1. 
Reported and constant currency revenues declined moderately, and adjusted operating income declined by a mid-teens percentage compared to the same period last year. While we are anticipating similar revenue trends in Q2, we are committed not only to real improvement in the trends in the second half, excluding divestitures, but also to achieving further improvement for the combined company in the following fiscal years. This combined company 2017 outlook replaces all prior fiscal 2017 outlooks. 
Importantly, we continue to target the total 4-year synergies and working capital benefits of $750 million and $500 million, respectively, with no change to the operating costs to realize both. We also remain committed to our previously communicated adjusted EPS target of at least $1.53 for fiscal 2020 despite the property impact of the current decline in revenues. 
Additionally, we firmly -- we remain firmly committed to using Coty's expected strong post-merger cash flow to build Coty into a much stronger global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. In this respect, we are very happy with our recent acquisition of the Hypermarcas beauty business in Brazil and our pending acquisition of ghd, which we expect will continue to strengthen Coty's global portfolio, its growth exposure and its profit and cash generation. 
As departing interim CEO and remaining Chairman, I believe the future of the new Coty under our new CEO, Camillo Pane, is a great one. It certainly will be a journey to realize the ambitions we have set for the company. And while there may be challenges as we integrate and rebuild the business, we are firmly committed to realizing the ambitions we have and delivering value for all our shareholders. 
I will now turn it over to Patrice to discuss the Q1 results in more detail."

Q1 net revenues declined 3% as reported and declined 2% at constant currency. Excluding the 6% contribution from the Brazil acquisition, net revenues declined 8%. Our adjusted gross margin declined 150 basis",537,"Thank you, Bart, and good morning, everyone. 
Q1 net revenues declined 3% as reported and declined 2% at constant currency. Excluding the 6% contribution from the Brazil acquisition, net revenues declined 8%. Our adjusted gross margin declined 150 basis points to 58.8%, driven by the contribution of the lower gross margin Brazil acquisition, as the gross margin of the remaining Coty business remained consistent year-over-year. 
The Q1 adjusted operating income declined 14% to $106.4 million, resulting in a 15.4% adjusted operating margin. This decline was driven by 2 primary factors: First, the revenue decline translated to lower adjusted gross and operating profit; second, Q1 fixed cost increased on an absolute and percentage basis as we ramped up staffing and other investment in anticipation of the close of the P&G Beauty transaction. 
By segment. Two of the segments, Skin & Body Care and Fragrance, showed solid profitability performance despite a broader top line weakness. The Q1 Skin & Body Care adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis points to 9%, fueled by a mix-driven improvement in gross margin. The Fragrance adjusted operating margin reached a solid 21.5% margin, a decline versus prior year. The Color Cosmetic adjusted operating margin declined 460 basis point to 11.3%, as we ramped up A&P investment despite the lower revenues. Finally, the Brazil acquisition reached an adjusted operating margin of 8.6%, largely reflecting the fact that Q1 is typically the lowest quarter seasonally for the Brazil business.
Moving down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.1% compared to negative 38.4% in the prior year, reflecting the $113.3 million tax benefit in the prior year period. All together, this drove an adjusted diluted EPS of $0.23. 
During the quarter and prior to the close of the merger, we repurchased 1.4 million shares. As well, we returned additional cash to shareholders with the distribution of an annual dividend of $0.275 per share.
Turning to the capital structure. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in net debt. In October, we took the opportunity to successfully borrow an incremental $1.1 billion in term loans and used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In addition, we refinanced approximately $1.6 billion in term loans to reduce annual interest expense by almost $10 million per year. We also benefited from only $1.9 billion in assumed debt in the merger, which was $1 billion less than the assumed debt amount when we first announced the merger in July 2015.
As far as the merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business is concerned, we are confident about the potential of this merger to strengthen Coty's margin, earnings and cash generation profile. I'm happy to confirm the 4-year synergies and working capital benefits of $750 million and $500 million, respectively, with no change to the operating cost to realize both. We also remain committed to our previously communicated adjusted EPS target of at least $1.53 for fiscal 2020. 
We remain confident in the long-term cash flow profile of the company, as well as the strength of our balance sheet, which will allow us to fulfill our long-term ambition. 
I will now turn it over to Camillo to offer his preliminary views on the business."

It's my great privilege to take over the reins of leadership at such a transformational moment.

It's my great privilege to take over the reins of leadership at such a transformational moment. With this merger, we have brought together a powerful portfolio of beauty brands and some of the world's most talented people in beauty and consumer goods. 
Being in the CEO role for a little over a month now, I've been focused on 3 key priorities: First, I'm visiting many of the Coty key countries, meeting with the significant customers and reviewing the business with the country management teams; second, I'm now reviewing in-depth the innovation pipeline for the next 1, 2 years; third, I continue to support the internal work in accelerating Coty's capabilities in digital communication, e-commerce and in-store.
While I will offer a more comprehensive assessment of our business on the next earnings call in February, I did want to take this opportunity to offer some initial thoughts. 
The substantial changes within Coty over the last years, from carving out the Beauty Business from P&G to introducing a new organizational structure and changing the management teams in a number of categories and countries, have clearly impacted the organization. In the short term, this means some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter as everyone settles into their roles and the organization learns to run as one company. 
However, I have a high level of confidence in the long-term outlook and fundamentals of the business. Within the combined Coty portfolio, I see a lot of positives in professional beauty and luxury. The salon hair business continues to perform well. And while still early, we are seeing early indication that the OPI nail brand is a very good fit for this division. And I believe this will result in much better mid- to long-term growth momentum for OPI. 
Speaking of the Luxury Division, this business is anchored by a number of leading brands, including Gucci, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss and Philosophy. And I'm encouraged by the pipeline of upcoming launches in the combined portfolio, including, of course, the launch of Tiffany.
Turning to Consumer Beauty. It's clear that this is a division that is facing a number of challenges. These challenges include the positioning of some of the brands, the strength of the pipeline, the in-store execution, as well as the competitive pressure in the market. We have begun our work to address these issues, and I will have more information to provide on the next call as to the steps we are taking to regain momentum in this business.
I'm very excited and encouraged by the progress we are making to communicate and engage with today's consumers, who are increasingly living in a digital world. Our digital capabilities were significantly enhanced by last year's acquisition of the digital marketing platform, Beamly. Beamly is already helping us improve the social engagement of our brands through campaign optimization, social listening and deeper brand targeting. We have significantly increased the proportion of our media spending aimed at digital, and I'm pleased with the results I have seen.
While a key focus in the near term will be on integrating the P&G Specialty Beauty Business and improving our growth momentum, we believe there is space for selective M&A where it can be managed without unduly disrupting our integration and growth focus, where it clearly benefits our future growth trajectory and delivers shareholder value.
With respect to our recent transactions, we continue to be encouraged by the in-market performance of the Brazil acquisition, with sell-through growing strong double-digit in a market which is growing high single-digit. 
We also announced on October 17 the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire ghd, a premium brand in high-end hair styling appliances. We believe ghd's strong historical growth, driven by geographical expansion and channel diversification beyond salons, including a sizable e-commerce business, will only be enhanced by Wella's substantial distribution capabilities and complementary portfolio brands. 
The acquisition, which is expected to close prior to the end of this calendar year, is the first step in our strategy to gradually shift the market growth exposure of our combined portfolio closer to 3 -- to the 3%, 4% global beauty industry growth rate. 
I'm very energized by the opportunities ahead for the new Coty and look forward to working with my new leadership team to drive Coty to profitable growth and to be a new global leader and challenger in the Beauty industry. 
Thank you. We'll now open the call for questions."

So is it just the timing of new product launches? Or do you expect some underlying improvement in the market? If you could help us have confidence that this really negative trend isn't going to persist through the entire year. And then second question, I know you said in your prepared comments that, that $1.53 for 2020 is still the target, but it sounds like today is a downward revision to the growth outlook for fiscal '17. So what's better in your forecast that helps you make up for the shortfall so you can still hit that $1.53?"

So clearly, what is impacting in Q2 are the same factors which are impacting in Q1. We should not forget that -- so clearly, fiscal '17 is clearly a year of transition, and the transition is largely taking place in the first 6 months and only gradually comes out in the back half. What do I mean by transition? Clearly, we have a complete new organizational structure, which is different from either the Coty or the P&G structure, and we have many new people. And so the combination of the 2 means that a lot of people have new jobs in different locations at some point in time. So that has clearly created a substantial level of distraction. People are not necessarily fully focused on the business for a period of time because they're in transition, or alternatively, they're also helping out on the integration of the business. And so those 2 factors basically have caused distraction and have caused us to lose momentum, basically, in the business, which we believe we're in the process of addressing. In addition to that, we believe that those factors will abate in the second half. In addition to that, we believe we have a good pipeline -- or a better pipeline on some of our brands in the second half, which makes us believe that the trend will improve in the second half as well. So those are the 2 key factors, some factors abating, and at the same time, pipeline improving, which should improve the momentum in the second 6 months. In terms of the earnings per share, we believe basically that beyond the cost synergies of the business, there's also an improvement that we can have on the underlying business. And therefore, we believe the $1.53 by fiscal 2020 is a doable and reachable number."

So there has  been a material level of neglect from this businesses, which we are trying to understand, and we are formulating plans to reactivate all of these brands. Having said that,  I don't have to tell you that brands like Cover Girl, Wella, Max Factor, they're fantastic brands. It's a great portfolio of brands, and there's an inherent strength basically in these brands, and we just need to extract that. And so we're in the process of doing that."

So we believe that professional is in good shape and will show good momentum in the second half. The professional business has done pretty well over the more recent periods and will continue, in our minds, to show solid momentum. And the top of it, it's going to have OPI folded into that, so -- which we also believe is going to be very positive on OPI. Because as you may remember, Coty did not have a professional division and it had an OPI professional brand, and it was very difficult for -- to manage that business because it had a skeleton infrastructure in order to do so. Now we have a full-fledged infrastructure, and we believe that we'll be very healthy on the OPI business. So we believe professional on the P&G and on the Coty side will show very nice trends. On the Fragrance side, we believe that, on our main brands, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, et cetera, we have some very nice initiatives in order to steadily improve the momentum on that business relative to where we are today. I also would like to offer to you that in the first quarter, for sure, and potentially in the second quarter, there has been some rationalization of wholesale inventories taking place, which clearly also is going to gradually abate. So the #1 challenge remains basically on the Consumer Beauty business, and this will take longer. We might see some improvement, but there is a lot of things which need to be tackled. And we already mentioned we have several large brands. And Camillo already alluded to this. We -- clearly, we have challenges on Cover Girl, Max Factor and Sally Hansen, all of which need to be addressed, and we're in the process of doing that. So net-net, I think professional should see good momentum, and continued good momentum. I think on luxury, we should see improving momentum. Consumer Beauty will be the biggest challenge, and I think that will take longer. We might see some improved results in the second half, but it will take longer to address that."

We have, in our minds, a much better trend in OPI now that it's being managed by the new Coty Professional Business. So we have a number of factors which we believe will materially improve the trend. We also don't have the distraction. The distraction in the first half clearly has led not just to reduction in wholesale, but also in retail trade inventories in a number of places, so which will also go away. So it is a combination of certain factors not being there; on the other side, having much stronger innovation pipeline behind the business. Our feeling about the Coty business is clearly much stronger than about the P&G business simply because the P&G business is a new business.

So just to give you some very clear examples of that. So first of all, there is the geographical benefit. In a number of countries, both -- either party or both parties were relatively marginal players. And combined, they are basically critical mass players. Countries like Mexico, et cetera, are classic examples of this. So we will have a real infrastructure to build from. That clearly is only going to really materialize post the exit of transitional service arrangements, implementing all the restructuring programs, et cetera. But there is a real benefit that we can build off that. We will have the benefit of moving, as part of that, from distributors into full-fledged operational entities, which there is a clear benefit for sure on the top line but also on the bottom line from doing that, moving out of these distributors. There is a benefit of OPI brands being managed by the professional division, which there is a clear benefit of that because Coty did have a skeleton -- -- only had a skeleton infrastructure to manage that. And I believe that is a very good news for OPI on a global basis for it to be managed by the professional division. There are benefit in terms of the cross-fertilization on the R&D side. P&G had certain skill sets in terms of fragrances which Coty doesn't have, and Coty has certain skill sets in the R&D, particularly in the packaging area, which P&G doesn't have. So there is a clear synergistic benefit between the 2. Clearly, there is the best practice benchmarking in terms of cost of goods and manufacturing and operating cost, which is starting to happen as we speak. So there are clear, basically, benefits in this area as well. So in addition to that, there are clearly all the financial benefits from our procurement point of view, which I already alluded to. So there are synergistic benefits, in particular, I would say, in R&D and manufacturing and basically go-to-market and in terms of scale in emerging markets."

This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement and recent developments, and Camillo will offer his initial thoughts on the state of the business. Then we'll be pleased to take your questions. 
The last several months have been truly transformational for Coty. On October 1, we completed the merger of the P&G Specialty Beauty Business into Coty with a $1 billion lower cash payment than anticipated at the announcement of the transaction. 
I would like to thank the teams involved from Coty and P&G for all their hard work over the last 15 months in creating the platform for Coty to become a global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. I'm confident that we now have largely the right team, organizational structure and culture to make the vision of this merger a reality. 
Our new CEO, Camillo Pane, the executive team and the divisional, regional and country management teams are now in place and are working on exiting/transitional service arrangements with P&G while increasingly focusing on rebuilding business momentum. 
As expected, the extensive work over the last 15 months on closing the transaction and merging the 2 businesses has come at a cost. As discussed prior to the closure, the resources, which normally work in the business, have also been working on closing the transaction and the setup and future of the combined company. The resulting distraction, as well as the recent change in management team in our headquarters, regions and countries has contributed to a decline in Coty's stand-alone revenues and profits in Q1. 
Reported and constant currency revenues declined moderately, and adjusted operating income declined by a mid-teens percentage compared to the same period last year. While we are anticipating similar revenue trends in Q2, we are committed not only to real improvement in the trends in the second half, excluding divestitures, but also to achieving further improvement for the combined company in the following fiscal years. This combined company 2017 outlook replaces all prior fiscal 2017 outlooks. 
Importantly, we continue to target the total 4-year synergies and working capital benefits of $750 million and $500 million, respectively, with no change to the operating costs to realize both. We also remain committed to our previously communicated adjusted EPS target of at least $1.53 for fiscal 2020 despite the property impact of the current decline in revenues. 
Additionally, we firmly -- we remain firmly committed to using Coty's expected strong post-merger cash flow to build Coty into a much stronger global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. In this respect, we are very happy with our recent acquisition of the Hypermarcas beauty business in Brazil and our pending acquisition of ghd, which we expect will continue to strengthen Coty's global portfolio, its growth exposure and its profit and cash generation. 
As departing interim CEO and remaining Chairman, I believe the future of the new Coty under our new CEO, Camillo Pane, is a great one. It certainly will be a journey to realize the ambitions we have set for the company. And while there may be challenges as we integrate and rebuild the business, we are firmly committed to realizing the ambitions we have and delivering value for all our shareholders. 
I will now turn it over to Patrice to discuss the Q1 results in more detail."

Q1 net revenues declined 3% as reported and declined 2% at constant currency. Excluding the 6% contribution from the Brazil acquisition, net revenues declined 8%. Our adjusted gross margin declined 150 basis",537,"Thank you, Bart, and good morning, everyone. 
Q1 net revenues declined 3% as reported and declined 2% at constant currency. Excluding the 6% contribution from the Brazil acquisition, net revenues declined 8%. Our adjusted gross margin declined 150 basis points to 58.8%, driven by the contribution of the lower gross margin Brazil acquisition, as the gross margin of the remaining Coty business remained consistent year-over-year. 
The Q1 adjusted operating income declined 14% to $106.4 million, resulting in a 15.4% adjusted operating margin. This decline was driven by 2 primary factors: First, the revenue decline translated to lower adjusted gross and operating profit; second, Q1 fixed cost increased on an absolute and percentage basis as we ramped up staffing and other investment in anticipation of the close of the P&G Beauty transaction. 
By segment. Two of the segments, Skin & Body Care and Fragrance, showed solid profitability performance despite a broader top line weakness. The Q1 Skin & Body Care adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis points to 9%, fueled by a mix-driven improvement in gross margin. The Fragrance adjusted operating margin reached a solid 21.5% margin, a decline versus prior year. The Color Cosmetic adjusted operating margin declined 460 basis point to 11.3%, as we ramped up A&P investment despite the lower revenues. Finally, the Brazil acquisition reached an adjusted operating margin of 8.6%, largely reflecting the fact that Q1 is typically the lowest quarter seasonally for the Brazil business.
Moving down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.1% compared to negative 38.4% in the prior year, reflecting the $113.3 million tax benefit in the prior year period. All together, this drove an adjusted diluted EPS of $0.23. 
During the quarter and prior to the close of the merger, we repurchased 1.4 million shares. As well, we returned additional cash to shareholders with the distribution of an annual dividend of $0.275 per share.
Turning to the capital structure. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in net debt. In October, we took the opportunity to successfully borrow an incremental $1.1 billion in term loans and used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In addition, we refinanced approximately $1.6 billion in term loans to reduce annual interest expense by almost $10 million per year. We also benefited from only $1.9 billion in assumed debt in the merger, which was $1 billion less than the assumed debt amount when we first announced the merger in July 2015.
As far as the merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business is concerned, we are confident about the potential of this merger to strengthen Coty's margin, earnings and cash generation profile. I'm happy to confirm the 4-year synergies and working capital benefits of $750 million and $500 million, respectively, with no change to the operating cost to realize both. We also remain committed to our previously communicated adjusted EPS target of at least $1.53 for fiscal 2020. 
We remain confident in the long-term cash flow profile of the company, as well as the strength of our balance sheet, which will allow us to fulfill our long-term ambition. 
I will now turn it over to Camillo to offer his preliminary views on the business."

It's my great privilege to take over the reins of leadership at such a transformational moment. With this merger, we have brought together a powerful portfolio of beauty brands and some of the world's most talented people in beauty and consumer goods. 
Being in the CEO role for a little over a month now, I've been focused on 3 key priorities: First, I'm visiting many of the Coty key countries, meeting with the significant customers and reviewing the business with the country management teams; second, I'm now reviewing in-depth the innovation pipeline for the next 1, 2 years; third, I continue to support the internal work in accelerating Coty's capabilities in digital communication, e-commerce and in-store.
While I will offer a more comprehensive assessment of our business on the next earnings call in February, I did want to take this opportunity to offer some initial thoughts. 
The substantial changes within Coty over the last years, from carving out the Beauty Business from P&G to introducing a new organizational structure and changing the management teams in a number of categories and countries, have clearly impacted the organization. In the short term, this means some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter as everyone settles into their roles and the organization learns to run as one company. 
However, I have a high level of confidence in the long-term outlook and fundamentals of the business. Within the combined Coty portfolio, I see a lot of positives in professional beauty and luxury. The salon hair business continues to perform well. And while still early, we are seeing early indication that the OPI nail brand is a very good fit for this division. And I believe this will result in much better mid- to long-term growth momentum for OPI. 
Speaking of the Luxury Division, this business is anchored by a number of leading brands, including Gucci, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss and Philosophy. And I'm encouraged by the pipeline of upcoming launches in the combined portfolio, including, of course, the launch of Tiffany.
Turning to Consumer Beauty. It's clear that this is a division that is facing a number of challenges. These challenges include the positioning of some of the brands, the strength of the pipeline, the in-store execution, as well as the competitive pressure in the market. We have begun our work to address these issues, and I will have more information to provide on the next call as to the steps we are taking to regain momentum in this business.
I'm very excited and encouraged by the progress we are making to communicate and engage with today's consumers, who are increasingly living in a digital world. Our digital capabilities were significantly enhanced by last year's acquisition of the digital marketing platform, Beamly. Beamly is already helping us improve the social engagement of our brands through campaign optimization, social listening and deeper brand targeting. We have significantly increased the proportion of our media spending aimed at digital, and I'm pleased with the results I have seen.
While a key focus in the near term will be on integrating the P&G Specialty Beauty Business and improving our growth momentum, we believe there is space for selective M&A where it can be managed without unduly disrupting our integration and growth focus, where it clearly benefits our future growth trajectory and delivers shareholder value.
With respect to our recent transactions, we continue to be encouraged by the in-market performance of the Brazil acquisition, with sell-through growing strong double-digit in a market which is growing high single-digit. 
We also announced on October 17 the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire ghd, a premium brand in high-end hair styling appliances. We believe ghd's strong historical growth, driven by geographical expansion and channel diversification beyond salons, including a sizable e-commerce business, will only be enhanced by Wella's substantial distribution capabilities and complementary portfolio brands. 
The acquisition, which is expected to close prior to the end of this calendar year, is the first step in our strategy to gradually shift the market growth exposure of our combined portfolio closer to 3 -- to the 3%, 4% global beauty industry growth rate. 
I'm very energized by the opportunities ahead for the new Coty and look forward to working with my new leadership team to drive Coty to profitable growth and to be a new global leader and challenger in the Beauty industry. 
Thank you. We'll now open the call for questions."

Sort of in the near term, if the second quarter is going to be a continuation of the underlying sales growth we just saw now, I'm not sure kind of what light switch flicks as we go into back half and revenue growth accelerates, all that much. So is it just the timing of new product launches? Or do you expect some underlying improvement in the market? If you could help us have confidence that this really negative trend isn't going to persist through the entire year. And then second question, I know you said in your prepared comments that, that $1.53 for 2020 is still the target, but it sounds like today is a downward revision to the growth outlook for fiscal '17. So what's better in your forecast that helps you make up for the shortfall so you can still hit that $1.53?"

So clearly, what is impacting in Q2 are the same factors which are impacting in Q1. We should not forget that -- so clearly, fiscal '17 is clearly a year of transition, and the transition is largely taking place in the first 6 months and only gradually comes out in the back half. What do I mean by transition? Clearly, we have a complete new organizational structure, which is different from either the Coty or the P&G structure, and we have many new people. And so the combination of the 2 means that a lot of people have new jobs in different locations at some point in time. So that has clearly created a substantial level of distraction. People are not necessarily fully focused on the business for a period of time because they're in transition, or alternatively, they're also helping out on the integration of the business. And so those 2 factors basically have caused distraction and have caused us to lose momentum, basically, in the business, which we believe we're in the process of addressing. In addition to that, we believe that those factors will abate in the second half. In addition to that, we believe we have a good pipeline -- or a better pipeline on some of our brands in the second half, which makes us believe that the trend will improve in the second half as well. So those are the 2 key factors, some factors abating, and at the same time, pipeline improving, which should improve the momentum in the second 6 months. In terms of the earnings per share, we believe basically that beyond the cost synergies of the business, there's also an improvement that we can have on the underlying business. And therefore, we believe the $1.53 by fiscal 2020 is a doable and reachable number."

And when we come back in February, hopefully, we'll have a better picture on this business, and we can answer all of your questions a little bit better than we can now. What I can tell you is that Max Factor is not being relaunched in a major way in the United States. There's a lot of activity on Cover Girl. But as Camillo already has alluded to, there's a lot of work that needs to be done on the Color Cosmetics brands, in particular, on those 2 brands that you just mentioned.

And between announcement and closure, there were 15 months. So arguably, this business has been in limbo for 2 to 3 years. And clearly, this is not very beneficial to any business, as you can imagine, because the focus comes off. So there is a certain level of neglect that has happened, in particular, because not the entire organization has come with the P&G business.

So we believe that professional is in good shape and will show good momentum in the second half. The professional business has done pretty well over the more recent periods and will continue, in our minds, to show solid momentum. And the top of it, it's going to have OPI folded into that, so -- which we also believe is going to be very positive on OPI. Because as you may remember, Coty did not have a professional division and it had an OPI professional brand, and it was very difficult for -- to manage that business because it had a skeleton infrastructure in order to do so. Now we have a full-fledged infrastructure, and we believe that we'll be very healthy on the OPI business. So we believe professional on the P&G and on the Coty side will show very nice trends. On the Fragrance side, we believe that, on our main brands, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, et cetera, we have some very nice initiatives in order to steadily improve the momentum on that business relative to where we are today. I also would like to offer to you that in the first quarter, for sure, and potentially in the second quarter, there has been some rationalization of wholesale inventories taking place, which clearly also is going to gradually abate. So the #1 challenge remains basically on the Consumer Beauty business, and this will take longer. We might see some improvement, but there is a lot of things which need to be tackled. And we already mentioned we have several large brands. And Camillo already alluded to this. We -- clearly, we have challenges on Cover Girl, Max Factor and Sally Hansen, all of which need to be addressed, and we're in the process of doing that. So net-net, I think professional should see good momentum, and continued good momentum. I think on luxury, we should see improving momentum. Consumer Beauty will be the biggest challenge, and I think that will take longer. We might see some improved results in the second half, but it will take longer to address that."

So on the Coty side of the business, we do have, basically, some very nice initiatives, and we are much more comfortable to make statements about real improvement in terms of the business trends. For instance, we have CK, all -- we have a clear, basically breakthrough, mascara on Rimmel. We have, in our minds, a much better trend in OPI now that it's being managed by the new Coty Professional Business. So we have a number of factors which we believe will materially improve the trend. We also don't have the distraction. The distraction in the first half clearly has led not just to reduction in wholesale, but also in retail trade inventories in a number of places, so which will also go away. So it is a combination of certain factors not being there; on the other side, having much stronger innovation pipeline behind the business. Our feeling about the Coty business is clearly much stronger than about the P&G business simply because the P&G business is a new business.

In a number of countries, both -- either party or both parties were relatively marginal players. And combined, they are basically critical mass players. Countries like Mexico, et cetera, are classic examples of this. So we will have a real infrastructure to build from. That clearly is only going to really materialize post the exit of transitional service arrangements, implementing all the restructuring programs, et cetera. But there is a real benefit that we can build off that. We will have the benefit of moving, as part of that, from distributors into full-fledged operational entities, which there is a clear benefit for sure on the top line but also on the bottom line from doing that, moving out of these distributors. There is a benefit of OPI brands being managed by the professional division, which there is a clear benefit of that because Coty did have a skeleton -- -- only had a skeleton infrastructure to manage that. And I believe that is a very good news for OPI on a global basis for it to be managed by the professional division. There are benefit in terms of the cross-fertilization on the R&D side. P&G had certain skill sets in terms of fragrances which Coty doesn't have, and Coty has certain skill sets in the R&D, particularly in the packaging area, which P&G doesn't have. So there is a clear synergistic benefit between the 2. Clearly, there is the best practice benchmarking in terms of cost of goods and manufacturing and operating cost, which is starting to happen as we speak. So there are clear, basically, benefits in this area as well. So in addition to that, there are clearly all the financial benefits from our procurement point of view, which I already alluded to.
