Before John you to the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and just reiterate the strategy we're pursuing, and that is to be the premier integrated communications company in the world. And obviousl",1157,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everybody. Before John you to the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and just reiterate the strategy we're pursuing, and that is to be the premier integrated communications company in the world. And obviously, that's a strategy that we are pursuing in every single market segment, and it's from our largest multinational customers to the most price-sensitive consumer. 
And when you look at 2015, it was an eventful year where you put together a lot of the pieces that were required to fulfill this objective. Primarily, we closed on the DIRECTV acquisition. And we secured a very deep spectrum footprint in the government auction, and that's giving us the network capacity for our TV Everywhere plans. And we acquired 2 Mexican wireless companies with extensive spectrum holdings and distribution. And this gives us access to one of the very best emerging market economies in the world. 
Now we financed the DIRECTV spectrum purchases at very attractive rates. And we did all of this, put it together and exited 2015 with a very strong balance sheet. And our dividend coverage has returned to a level that's very consistent with our historic norm. 
As you look at our strategy, the core is getting the basic connectivity element right. Because if you want to be an integrated solution provider, it requires, more than anything else, world-class, high-speed, secured connectivity. And they can't be just wireless connectivity or broadband to the home or business, but all connectivity: Wireless, broadband, satellite, VPN, and it all has to be integrated. 
So for example, TV Everywhere. DIRECTV is really accelerating our introduction next generation TV. And the DIRECTV content agreements, combined with our networks is proving to be a very powerful combination. So we can now deliver the best entertainment packages over traditional linear TV or streamed over the Internet to essentially any mobile device. 
A couple of weeks ago, we launched the nationwide solution that combines any of our TV entertainment packages with unlimited mobile data. So our customers can now stream their video without incurring over its charges. And this is only our first move. You're going to see the offers and the customer experience continue to get better and better as we move through 2016. 
We also launched a number of integrated solutions for businesses. And I think the best example of this is our Network on Demand service, which lets customer bandwidth up or down literally on demand. And our NetBond service is also having a lot of success appear, and I think this is a beautiful little example of an integrated solution. It gives a company the capability to secure access -- to secure access information from a mobile device over VPN into virtually any major cloud provider, and that includes Amazon, Microsoft, IBM or salesforce.com. 
The common threads to all of this is providing our customers with a seamless, integrated experience. And again, the core to making all of this happen is the network. And our LTE network now covers 355 million people and businesses in North America. And we expect to hit the 385 million mark by the end of this year. We're continuing to build out our GigaPower footprint. And we can now deliver speeds up to 1 gig to over 1 million customer locations in 20 markets. And we've announced plans to enter additional 36 markets. 
We also continue to extend our fiber network to more businesses. So we're really feeling good about our networks. We believe we do have the most comprehensive capabilities now in the industry. But to compete today's market, the solutions do have to be global solutions. Because at the end of the day, our customers are global. And that global focus is why we're the leader in serving multinational business. 
In fact, we connect 3.5 million businesses. That includes nearly all the Fortune 1000. We do it in almost 200 countries and territories. We've extended our wireless network into Mexico now. And as you're going to see in a few minutes, our growth in Mexico is exceeding all of our expectations. 
And also, in 2015, we built on our global leadership position in the Internet of Things. And our IoT solutions are not U.S. solutions. They are global solutions. We invested very early in this space and it is paying off. We now have over 26 million devices connected to our network. We're also a leader in connected cars. We added 1 million of them in the fourth quarter. And recently, we completed a deal with Ford that we believe is going to connect to at least 10 million cars over the next 5 years. 
And finally, we're investing aggressively in the network architecture that is going to give us a competitive advantage in cost. We're driving the industry to software defined networks. And I have seen few opportunities over my career to drive down the cost to deliver service like this. 
We're also on track to deliver at least $2.5 billion in annual DIRECTV synergies by 2018. And we continue to invest in Spectrum. We began last year by investing $18 billion in the auction to significantly deepen our Spectrum footprint. And as a result, we now have 40 megahertz of Spectrum to dip over the next few years to support TV Everywhere. 
But just as important is the impact of such deep spectrum footprint we'll have on our cost to build an operator networks. So as we look out over the next few years, we're convinced that software defined networks, combined with the DIRECTV synergies and our deep Spectrum position, are going to give us an industry-leading cost structure. 
And our objective is really straightforward. We want to move the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit. Today, we think we're a company with no obvious peer. We have a nationwide TV and wireless footprint. Our IP broadband footprint reaches nearly 60 million customer locations. We have end-to-end capabilities and enterprise world-class distribution and a globally respected brand. And we're always transforming the moves we're taking place. We're executing pretty well in 2015. 
If you look at Slide 5, you see adjusted EPS growth was solid. Our cash flows were way up. margins continued to expand and consolidated revenue growth was on track. We ended 2015 with 137 million mobility subscribers, 45 million video subscribers, 13 million IP broadband customers and an LTE network that's covering 355 million people. And we're seeing nice growth across all of our key product categories. 
In the fourth quarter, we had really solid net adds in wireless, satellite video and IP broadband. So to wrap it up, strategy's working. We have a critical capabilities we need to execute the strategy. And I'm going to hand it over to John now and then I'll come back later to give a full year outlook for what we see in 2016. So with that, John?"

It's a great to have you on the call. Let start by taking a look at a quarter and our financial summary on Slide 6. We finished the year strong. We had double-digit growth in consolidated revenues, adjusted earnings",2488,"Thanks, Randall, and hello, everyone. It's a great to have you on the call. Let start by taking a look at a quarter and our financial summary on Slide 6. 
We finished the year strong. We had double-digit growth in consolidated revenues, adjusted earnings and free cash flow. At the same time, we continue to see margin expansion in every segment of our domestic business. 
In the fourth quarter, reported EPS was $0.65 and adjusted EPS was $0.63. That's up more than 12% over last year's fourth quarter. This includes adjustments for merger integration-related cost and the annual mark to market of our benefit plans. This strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations and some deferral of recognition of video revenue. 
Consolidated revenues grew to $42.1 billion, that's up more than 22% year-over-year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. That growth comes even with lower equipment sales as customers chose to hold onto their smartphones for a longer period of time. 
During the quarter, the company aligned DirectTVs revenue recognition for new customer promotional offers to AT&T's practices. The company will now recognize revenues from customers reflecting the amounts billed over time. Recognition of the expenses will not change. The fourth quarter impacted of this change resulted in the lower book to revenues by about $300 million and had a corresponding impact on income, margin and a $0.03 impact on EPS as well. 
Cash flows continue to be a great story. Free cash flow was more than $3 billion in the quarter and nearly $16 billion for the full year. That brought our free cash flow dividend coverage to about 64% for the year. Let's take a closer look at our operational highlights, starting with business solutions on Slide 7. 
The biggest news here in our Business Solutions segment was our dramatic margin improvement. EBITDA margins improved 360 basis points year-over-year, as cost efficiencies far outpaced equipment revenue declines. Equipment sales were down year-over-year as we sold fewer handsets and less wireline CPE to business customers. The higher margin service revenues were essentially flat on a constant-currency basis with growing strategic services and wireless services largely offsetting legacy wireline declines. 
We continue to see stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues now comprise nearly 60% of Wireline business revenues. Growth in our most advanced data products is keeping pace with the client in legacy data services. Strategic services revenues grew by more than 10% year-over-year. And when you adjust for foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 12%. 
We served a total connectivity needs of our customers, and more and more of that means mobility. Mobility in cloud solutions are changing the way business gets done and AT&T is delivering this to customers. We're connecting people, cars, homes, cities, devices, machines and businesses to the Internet and each other. And we establish ourselves as the world leader in IoT. 
We signed more than 300 new Internet of Things business agreements in 2015 alone. A recently announced new connected car agreement with Ford and BMW build on our industry leadership in that category. And our new smart cities and connected health initiatives demonstrate how connected devices can help cut costs, grow revenues, boost efficiency and satisfy customers needs. 
Let's now move to our Entertainment group results on Slide 8. This is our first full quarter reporting with DIRECTV, and the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expected to receive from combining these operations. Reported revenues for the quarter more than doubled year-over-year, mostly due to the DTV acquisition. But our U-verse revenues also showed solid growth. We also saw exceptional margin expansion, which points directly to the benefits of the acquisition. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%, that's up more than 800 basis points year-over-year. We've shifted our marketing focus to driving satellite net adds. And you can see that in our subscriber results. 
Satellite net adds were 214,000, with our total video net adds for the quarter down just slightly. We've been really pleased with our growing flow share with DIRECTV. Year-over-year growth ads have been up every month since the deal was closed, thanks in large part to our wider distribution. And we're seeing an increasing satellite customers in our wireline footprint bundling broadband with their video service. 
Sales of satellite IP broadband to new customers were up 60% from the end of the third quarter this year. That helped drive an increase of more than 190,000 total IP broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter. It's still early, but we see a lot more opportunity to use video to drive sales and lower churn for all of our services. 
Our new Unlimited wireless data for combined wireless and TV customers has been very popular since we introduced it 2 weeks ago. We've already had more than 0.5 million wireless subscribers signed up for the unlimited data plan and TV net adds are going strong as well. And expect to launch a variety of new video entertainment packages this year. 
These offers definitely add some sizzle to our bundling offers. But the real impact is to build a strong relationship with our customer base. Our goal is a TV Everywhere experience with broad viewer choice, both inside and outside the home, that is simple and easy for our customers to use. 
AT&T is already a leading provider of online video. Our DIRECTV app already allows live video streaming of more than 100 different networks. And by the end of the first quarter, we expect to have nearly all the top 25 cable networks. We've already seen about a 50% [ph] increase in the number of customers using the DTV app since the second quarter of the year. We are driving an OTT capability with our video services, one that provides great choices and a price and is more is also win-win for the content providers that are integrated offerings. Now let's move to our U.S. mobility results on Slide 9. 
As a reminder, AT&T domestic mobility applications are now divided between the business solutions and consumer wireless segment. For comparison purposes, where providing supplemental information for our total U.S. wireless operations here. 
During the fourth quarter, total net adds came in strong with 2.2 million new subscribers and with gains in every customer category. That's the third consecutive quarter where net adds have exceeded 2 million. Almost 1 million of those net adds were branded, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, driving positive phone additions in the quarter. We're putting a lot more focus on branded customers and with good reason. 
Cricket has energized the prepaid space for us. We added more prepaid subscribers than any other carrier in 2015. In fact, we added more subscribers than the rest of the industry combined, and Cricket churn is coming in at industry-leading levels. This helped drive an increase of 213,000 branded phone subscribers in the quarter. Compare that with our postpaid pressure about 250,000 phones, the vast majority of which were higher churning feature phones with average ARPUs at about $35. All the while, 3/4 of our Cricket gross adds in the fourth quarter were on rate plans that were $50 or higher. 
This points the overall strength of our business in our ability to operate an efficient smart business in a competitive, mature market. We also continue to grow high-value smartphone base, adding about 1 million branded smartphone subs during the quarter. At the same time, we had another strong churn quarter. total churn was down year-over-year, once again, thanks to our great networks, our quality offers and our top-notch customer service. Postpaid churn came in at 1.18% for the quarter, an improvement from a year-ago quarter. And full year postpaid churn was 1.09%, one of our best years ever. That's an impressive performance at a time when we focus on higher-value subscribers in a heavily competitive market. 
And any datapoint about the Cricket churn. We have seen increasing churn throughout the year even as he shut down the legacy CDMA network and move subscribers to our 4G LTE network. Fourth quarter Cricket churn was the best yet, coming in at 3.8% or 170 point improvement over last year's fourth quarter and about half when you look at the comparable leap fourth quarter from 2 years ago. 
Cricket has become a powerful part of our wireless story, and we are were very pleased with how it's performing and we're expected to do even more in the '16. Wireless margins and ARPU are on Slide 10. 
Our relentless efforts to drive efficiency and move our smartphone customer base to no subsidy model once again drove record wireless EBITDA margins. You can see this clearly in our operating expenses. Our equipment revenues were down more than $700 million, mostly due to lower upgrade volumes. Total cash operating cost were down $1.8 billion, thanks to our sharp focus on cost management and efficiency. That helps increase EBITDA by nearly $900 million in the quarter and drive our best ever fourth quarter EBITDA service margin of 43.2%. 
We also had our best ever full year service EBITDA margin coming in at 46.7%. By the way, if you exclude regulatory insurance fees and service revenues that some of our competitors do, our fall your number is about 50%. Total wireless revenue was impacted with lower smartphone sales. Service revenues continue to stabilize. Revenues also impacted by increasing number of Bring Your Own Device subscribers. 
We had about 700,000 in the quarter. That includes those who purchased new smartphones through vendor leasing programs or vendor installment programs. BYOD sales are lowest costs subscribers and we're happy to have them. They value our quality network coverage and reliability, as well as our spring selection of great plans. 
Phone only plus Next ARPU continue to grow at a steady pace, up 4.6%, even with a growing number of BYOD subs. A number of smartphone customers are no device subsidy plans continues to expand. More than 2/3 of smartphone subscribers or nearly 70% are on no subsidy plans, with about 46% of that smartphone base on AT&T Next plans. 
Now, let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 11. The wireless in Mexico is really getting after these days. First, we blew through our year-end 4G LTE deployment target by reaching 44 million POPs. That puts us well on our way to our next benchmark reaching 75 million POPs by the end of year and it brings our North America LTE coverage to 355 million people, which is more than any other carrier. 
We also launched our rebranding the AT&T name in several areas beginning in markets where we deployed LTE. That includes Guadalajara and Monterrey, with Mexico City slated for April. And we continue to expand our distribution network. We've added 1,000 new store locations since we acquired these properties earlier in the year. All of this helped drives strong subscriber growth for the quarter, where nearly 600,000 total net adds with gains in both prepaid and postpaid. 
Mexico financials continues reflect our operational investment and strong subscriber growth. We expect comparable results in the first half of the year and the investment cycle to continue through 2016. In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continue to show solid growth on a local currency basis with foreign exchange rates continue to pressure our results. Revenues, ARPUs and merchants are all pressured by FX and are being hampered by challenging economies across Latin America. 
Subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds. But even with all this, we generated modest positive cash flow from these operations in the quarter. All in all, we feel very confident that we will be able to create value with this business and with these assets. We're more integrated with the day-to-day operations and we have solid local management teams that are adding stability in a very challenging economic environment. 
Now let's move to consolidated margins on Slide 12. Consolidated margins reflect the overall strength of our business. Adjusted consolidating income margin came in at 16.8% in the quarter. This was a 230 basis point improvement over the year-ago fourth quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin was 160 basis points higher than 1 year ago. Strong fourth quarter results helped drive 130 basis point improvement in the full year adjusted operating income margin. That's a tremendous accomplishment for a company with $146 billion in revenue. 
There were several reasons for this improvement. Strong margin expansion in our entertainment group and business solutions. And our focus you on efficiencies in wireless strong consumer mobility margin gains as well. We'll continue our focus on cost reductions. Savings through greater efficiencies, productivity gains and expense savings. 
Project Agile continues to build momentum, as do our digital first initiatives. We're seeing cycle time reduction and lower call volumes. Software defined networking will radically reshape, not only our cost, but also the flexibility of our network deployment. Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We're confidently continue to expand margins and to cut cost to offset pressure while we're in the investment cycle in Mexico. Cash flows were outstanding in 2015. Let's take a look on Slide 13. We proved our ability to generate cash in 2015 and our ability to have strong free cash flow even with strong capital investment. In the fourth quarter, cash from operations were more than $9 billion, and we generated more than $35 billion operating cash flow in 2015. Capital investment totaled $6.8 billion for the quarter. This includes about $700 million that we spent in Mexico, where we received equipment and are putting into service in the normal course. But we had financing terms for our vendors that don't require us to pay for it until the end of 2016 or a little bit later. 
For the year, we made capital investments of nearly $21 billion. Free cash flow is $3.1 billion. For the full year, it was nearly $16 billion, coming in higher than our increased guidance. We also continued to cap the securitization market to manage working capital with next. We received about $900 million in the fourth quarter. When you combine this with the foregone payments from prior securitizations, that impact is about $100 million of pressure on cash flow. So cash flow in itself is very strong from operations. 
In terms of uses of cash, totaled $2.9 million for the quarter and about $10 billion for the year, which gives us a payout ratio of 64%. That that adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.31. We ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. We're proud of our ability to generate cash. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our business, reduce debt and return substantial value in our shareholders. Now I will turn it back to Randall to provide our 2016 outlook."

And we expect our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to be in the 7s with a goal of growing free cash flow this year.

That's the first point I want to make to you. Second point, what we'll see is we will see the merger synergy savings starting to show up in margins in '16 and specifically, most of the $1.5 billion worth of run rate savings we expect to get to by the end of the year we'll start seeing coming through the entertainment group. As we go through the year, we'll see what happens with other competing interest.

All of those companies are a little bit defensive right now, as you might guess. Also, anybody the big exporters, people who are exporting will have exposure to foreign currencies, particularly the strong dollar. We're seeing weakness there. But I will tell you, we are kind of netted out. Our revenues kind of held their own on the business side because we are taking share. And NetBond and Network on Demand, we're having a lot of success in the marketplace. And so we're taking share and holding our own. But we are seeing some softness in those areas. The consumer continues to spend money. In fact, the decent holiday season has really aggressive competition. But the consumer continued to spend money. I might have anticipated. In fact, I did anticipate a little more robust Christmas season because you're seeing energy prices at those we haven't seen in a long time. And you didn't see the step up in consumer spending that you might have expected in third and fourth quarter. But the consumer did continue to spend. As we look at 2016, we built this plan around a 2% GDP growth rate that you asked roughly. And there's a lot of science that goes into that, but you can basically turn around and look at the last few years, you see it's been 2%. It's not really hard to forecast it these days. We've been fairly tight in terms of hitting our estimates for the last few years. What I am concerned about, I'll be honest with you, is as you look at 2015, there are a lot of things that went the consumer's way and went the economies way, not the least of which are energy prices. But even over the last few years, there's been some benefit from 10 million people being put back to work. And so as we get to end of 2015, those benefits that we've seen over the last couple of quarters, you look forward, are you going to see those in the future probably not. And so I made a comment last week that got picked up that we're assuming 2% if you ask me kind of handicap is our more downside refs cited that, probably downside. But it's probably within a tight range of 2% is what our estimate is right now, Phil."

And so we're just getting the installation and workforce up. We just had the latest union contract, gave us the rights we needed to push this out across our entire footprint. And so you're going to see us continue to get better and better there as well. As you pointed out, the satellite ads were strong in the fourth quarter, but U-verse churn offset that. So we're slightly negative in total. You'll see that relationship get better. And we're doing some things to shire up the U-verse space because we are focused on the satellite product. And so as a result, you'll see a U-verse churn up. We're doing some things to shore that up. It will improve not the least of which we do some pricing to ensure that we can have began to mitigate the U-verse churn. The other thing we did, and it's early, but I think we're going to see some not inconsequential impacts from this, is the unlimited offer for all of our TV customers. U-verse customers can now step in to an unlimited data offer. And this is, we think, a hugely retentive offer. It's a great value for our customers this type of offer or put in front of them. So we think you'll see the U-verse churn get better. You'll see the subscriber numbers continue to improve as we move through 2016 and the sales channel improves, the provisioning channel improves.

Secondly, with regards to about depreciation, we total the community when we first gave our guidance that we were taking that into consideration, assuming that we get past. But we would meet that guidance team and it didn't get passed, it has gotten passed. The one point I would make to everyone is that it's now 15 years our bonus depreciation has been in place. And so getting the bonus depreciation for 5 years is really important. But the creation of benefits from bonus depreciation is now being largely offset by the reversal of prior year's benefits that have been taken by taxpayers. So it's much more of a balancing item there. With regard to that pressure and cash flow do not come from our pension. We have a pension contribution we'll make this year in about $200 million. But that's already in the plan. That's the only thing that required pension plans very well-funded. And then we do expect total tax payments to be up this year from a year-over-year basis. But as you know, from our prior year filings, our tax payments were modest last year. So we would expect those up.

But everybody knows we're partnered with Peter Chernin probably best content talent on the planet. And heavily leveraging the full-screen acquisition that we did out of other media. Full-screen is obviously moving into a subscription model. We're really early to see how that progresses. But we're using that platform to do a lot of work for developing what I will call mobile centric content design for the mobile device. And very optimistic about what the opportunities are there. In terms of other or broader content ownership, there are a number of areas where we have what I'll call proprietary content. We own a number of regional sports networks. Some of those we acquired through the DIRECTV acquisition. Others, we've acquired over the course of the last year. We also have a lot of what I will call exclusive content, content that is produced by us, everything from the Dan Patrick Show to a particular network we have on DIRECTV and some series like Kingdom and so forth. And Simon, you should expect us to continue to engage at that level. And as we have success, you'll see us invest more we have success. But right now, I think our doing full-scale integration of DIRECTV and bringing it into the mobility channel."

Like we said, we're expecting 10 million automobiles to roll off the floor between now and 2020 with our connectivity and just from Ford. You bring up an interesting point, and that is there is a massive used car fleet out there that is not connected. And there's actually technologies that are now available. I have a sports car, an old sports car that I have now connected to the Internet. it's actually a fairly elegant solution. And so there's some capabilities that we are putting into the market, in fact, we are selling into the market today to connect the used car fleet with that that's on the U.S. roads. And we think that's important because the average age of a car on the road today is 11 years. So if you really want to grow this business, you need to tap into the used car fleet. And so that's a priority for us, and you'll see us pursue that. On Mexico, and as it relates to the video opportunity, though we're fairly convicted that mobile and video are going to be a category that's very, very relevant in the U.S. And we're early on here in the U.S. But based on early success, we continue to get more and more convicted. There's going to be an important category. Bringing the 2 together is going to be very important. And if it's going to be important in the U.S, we think it will be important in other markets, and Mexico will be no different. As you know, we have a minority share position in the satellite company in Mexico. And hopefully, we'll be able to do some partnering there. But we do think the video combination with mobile is going to be important in all geographies and all markets."

With regard to our wireline footprint, we had about 50 million IP broadband enabled customer locations from a consumer side. And we've got about 15 million IP broadband customers today. These are round numbers that add profile getting the details but with that, you can see that's where our penetration right now 25%. The key change series the fact that we now have an actual video product in DIRECTV and satellite product  and such that we didn't have that before. So many of our, if you will, broadband capable locations didn't have a video offering, now they do. And so, as we improve this single truck roll capability, this sales channel capability, all of that we expect to grow that share. And you can expect -- we would expect that it would be a significant improvement over where we're at today. With regard to the expansion that we're doing now, with regard to fiber, we are seeing very good results. And the ability to always have video available with the satellite product is going to prove, I think,  can be very beneficial for us. So we will expand on that 60 million footprint over the next 4 years. And we will also get to some of our overlap, but we will get to 14 million fiber enabled and, quite frankly, there's a likelihood that we may get to more than that when we're finished. So that's the way to think about that footprint issue. With regard to the capital send, you're right, we don't go into great detail on the capital spends. Because in our wireline and wireless footprint and for an integrated carrier, these spends become overlapping, whether you're taking high-speed to a sell side your shipping wireless traffic or wireline traffic on to an IP backbone. But from a general perspective in 2015, we spent probably about half of our capital in the wireless area, the other half in the wireline area. And if you will, the 2 really the shared services area. I will tell the pickup in the fourth quarter and part of it was due to Mexico and a part was due to the set-up box in the sales opportunities in DirectTV. So I'll give you that way to think about it. And I think that will be kind of a consistent story as we go through the carriers. We are investing at a rampant greed all of our business is. The one thing about our wireless business is when you got the tower network that we have today, the infrastructure that's been there and you have the Spectrum holdings that we have today, you can do great things with quality service that a network team can, do great service and continue to meet all the needs, and you can be pretty effective with your capital spend. It's not a situation where there is an investment. It's that much of this investment has been made over the last 3 years Spectrum purchases through the VIP project, putting extensive fiber into the ground and back all capabilities. And we're going to continue that, quite frankly, with giga power, as we put more fiber near other cell sites that we can get even better back also to be an integrated process but we need this to say a proud of the performance and continue to invest there."

There's opportunity really continue taking expense out of the business. I would tell you, if you look at just this quarter's results, it ought to give you some degree of comfort in terms of what's possible even at a company of our size and our scale. Whether it's business Solutions segment or Mobility segment, our Entertainment Group segment, Consolidated, I mean, it was a sweep in terms of taking margin top. And we weren't taking them up 5 or 10 basis points, the margins really moved up considerably. So we feel really good about the path were on and the momentum we have on the cost side of taking costs out of the business. On the capital spending side, this is a unique opportunity. We're at a place where a lot of things are converging in terms of maturity that's going to create some incredible opportunities as we go forward. These item -- these ubiquitous high-speed mobile networks, I mean, there here and there ubiquitous. They're low latency combine that with cloud, combined that with data analytics capabilities under available to the masses right, I mean, the world of big data is here and is available to everybody. And then sensors. The Sensor technology the ability to actually put in service sensors adversely, I mean, the cost is nominal to put these sensors in place. Millions upon millions of the sensors, all of these, these 4 elements coming together at one time is a massive opportunity. And people are not thinking about how to take advantage of ubiquitous mobility, high speed low latency networks with cloud, with data analytics, with the Sensor technology are going to miss. And we think we're at a place right now where we have a unique position on bringing all these together and creating growth. We're going to invest in the cycle. We're going to invest in video and making sure we can deliver video to our customers. We think that's going to be a huge opportunity and expanding our footprinting to Mexico. I mean, all of these converging we think growth platforms the next 4 or 5 years. That it's unique. So we're to be prudent downward bias an incremental basis capital. If we continue to emphasize that, we'll be more and more efficient with our capital spend. John pointed out the implication to spectrum. Don't miss this. You deploy these 2 by 10 megahertz blocks of Spectrum. The efficiencies it brings to building and operating global networks is significant. And we think were in a very unique position in that regard, too. So I said in my opening comments and I'll say it again, our attention is to deliver over these networks the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit to deliver. That's our objective and that's the path were headed down. So we feel good about being able to achieve that. So Tim, thanks for the question. And I also thank everybody for your participation on the call. We're up and running with the DIRECTV apposition at Mexico. Those are going well.

Before John dash into the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and just reiterate the strategy we're pursuing, and that is to be the premier integrated communications company in the world. And",1160,"Okay. Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everybody. Before John dash into the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and just reiterate the strategy we're pursuing, and that is to be the premier integrated communications company in the world. And obviously, that's a strategy that we are pursuing in every single market segment, and it's from our largest multinational customers to the most price-sensitive consumer. 
And when you look at 2015, it was an eventful year, where you put together a lot of the pieces that were required to fulfill this objective. Primarily, we closed on the DIRECTV acquisition. And we secured a very deep spectrum footprint in the government auction, and that's giving us the network capacity for our TV Everywhere plans. And we acquired 2 Mexican wireless companies with extensive spectrum holdings and distribution. And this gives us access to one of the very best emerging market economies in the world. 
Now we financed the DIRECTV and spectrum purchases at very attractive rates. And we did all of this, put it together and exited 2015 with a very strong balance sheet. And our dividend coverage has returned to a level that's very consistent with our historic norm. 
As you look at our strategy, the core is getting the basic connectivity element right. Because if you want to be an integrated solution provider, it requires, more than anything else, world-class, high-speed, secured connectivity. And they can't be just wireless connectivity or broadband to the home or business, but all connectivity: Wireless, broadband, satellite, VPN, and it all has to be integrated. 
So for example, TV Everywhere. DIRECTV is really accelerating our introduction of next-generation TV. And the DIRECTV content agreements, combined with our networks, is proving to be a very powerful combination. So we can now deliver the best entertainment packages over traditional linear TV or streamed over the Internet to essentially any mobile device.
A couple of weeks ago, we launched the nationwide solution that combines any of our TV entertainment packages with unlimited mobile data. So our customers can now stream their video without incurring overage charges. And this is only our first move. You're going to see the offers and the customer experience continue to get better and better as we move through 2016. 
We also launched a number of integrated solutions for businesses. And I think the best example of this is our Network on Demand service, which lets customer dial their bandwidth up or down literally on demand. And our NetBond service is also having a lot of success, and I think this is a beautiful example of an integrated solution. It gives a company the capability to secure access -- to securely access information from a mobile device over VPN into virtually any major cloud provider, and that includes Amazon, Microsoft, IBM or salesforce.com. 
The common threat to all of this is providing our customers with a seamless integrated experience. And again, the core to making all this happen is the network. And our LTE network now covers 355 million people and businesses in North America, and we expect to hit the 385 million mark by the end of this year. We're continuing to build out our GigaPower footprint, and we can now deliver speed up to 1 gig to over 1 million customer locations in 20 markets. And we've announced plans to enter an additional 36 markets.
We also continue to extend our fiber network to more businesses. So we're really feeling good about our networks. And we believe we do have the most comprehensive capabilities now in the industry. But to compete in today's market, the solutions do have to be global solutions because at the end of the day our customers are global. And that global focus is why we're the leader in serving multinational business.
In fact, we connect 3.5 million businesses. That includes nearly all the Fortune 1000, and we do it in almost 200 countries and territories. We've extended our wireless network into Mexico now. And as you're going to see in a few minutes, our growth in Mexico was exceeding all of our expectations. 
And also, in 2015, we built on our global leadership position in the Internet of Things. And our IoT solutions are not U.S. solutions. They are global solutions. We invested very early in this space, and it is paying off. We now have over 26 million devices connected to our network. We're also a leader in connected cars. We added 1 million of them in the fourth quarter. And recently, we completed a deal with Ford that we believe is going to connect at least 10 million cars over the next 5 years. 
And finally, we're investing aggressively in the network architecture that is going to give us a competitive advantage in cost. We're driving the industry to software-defined networks. And I have seen few opportunities over my career to drive down the cost to deliver service like this. 
We're also on track to deliver at least $2.5 billion in annual DIRECTV synergies by 2018, and we continue to invest in spectrum. We began last year by investing $18 billion in the auction to significantly deepen our spectrum footprint. And as a result, we now have 40 megahertz of FILOS spectrum to deploy over the next few years to support TV Everywhere. 
But just as important is the impact of such deep spectrum footprint we'll have on our cost to build an operator networks. So as we look out over the next few years, we're convinced that software-defined networks, combined with the DIRECTV synergies and our deep spectrum position, are going to give us an industry-leading cost structure. 
And our objective is really straightforward. We want to move the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit. Today, we think we're a company with no obvious peer. We have a nationwide TV and wireless footprint. Our IP broadband footprint reaches nearly 60 million customer locations. We have end-to-end capabilities and enterprise world-class distribution and a globally respected brand. And while all these transformative moves were taking place, we executed pretty well in 2015. 
If you look at Slide 5, as you see, adjusted EPS growth was solid. Our cash flows were way up. Margins continued to expand, and consolidated revenue growth was on track. We ended 2015 with 137 million mobility subscribers, 45 million video subscribers, 13 million IP broadband customers and an LTE network that's covering 355 million people. And we're seeing nice growth across all of our key product categories. 
In the fourth quarter, we had really solid net adds in wireless, satellite video and IP broadband. So to wrap it up, strategy's working. We have the critical capabilities we need to execute the strategy.
And I'm going to hand it over to John now, and then I'll come back later to give a full year outlook for what we see in 2016. So with that, John?"

It's great to have you on the call. Let start by taking a look at a quarter and our financial summary on Slide 6. We finished the year strong. We had double-digit growth in consolidated revenues, adjusted earnings a",2512,"Thanks, Randall, and hello, everyone. It's great to have you on the call. Let start by taking a look at a quarter and our financial summary on Slide 6. 
We finished the year strong. We had double-digit growth in consolidated revenues, adjusted earnings and free cash flow. At the same time, we continue to see margin expansion in every segment of our domestic business.
In the fourth quarter, reported EPS was $0.65 and adjusted EPS was $0.63. That's up more than 12% over last year's fourth quarter. This include adjustments for merger and integration-related costs and the annual mark to market of our benefit plans. This strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations and some deferral of recognition of video revenue. 
Consolidated revenues grew to $42.1 billion. That's up more than 22% year-over-year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. That growth comes even with lower equipment sales as customers chose to hold onto their smartphones for a longer period of time. 
During the quarter, the company aligned DIRECTV's revenue recognition for new customer promotional offers to AT&T's practices. The company will now recognize revenues from customers reflecting the amounts billed over time. Recognition of the expenses will not change. The fourth quarter impact of this change resulted in the lower book to revenues by about $300 million and had a corresponding impact on income, margin and a $0.03 impact on EPS as well. 
Cash flows continue to be a great story. Free cash flow was more than $3 billion in the quarter and nearly $16 billion for the full year. That brought our free cash flow dividend coverage to about 64% for the year.
Let's take a closer look at our operational highlights, starting with business solutions on Slide 7. The biggest news here in our Business Solutions segment was our dramatic margin improvement. EBITDA margins improved 360 basis points year-over-year as cost efficiencies far outpaced equipment revenue declines.
Equipment sales were down year-over-year as we sold fewer handsets and less wireline CPE to our business customers, but higher margin service revenues were essentially flat on a constant-currency basis with growing strategic services and wireless services largely offsetting legacy wireline declines.
We continue to see stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues. Growth in our most advanced data products is keeping pace with the clients in legacy data services. Strategic services revenues grew by more than 10% year-over-year. And when you adjust for foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 12%. 
We served the total connectivity needs of our customers, and more and more of that means mobility. Mobility in cloud solutions are changing the way business gets done, and AT&T is delivering this to customers. We're connecting people, cars, homes, cities, devices, machines and businesses to the Internet and each other. We've established ourselves as the world leader in IoT. 
We signed more than 300 new Internet of Things business agreements in 2015 alone. A recently announced new connected car agreements with Ford and BMW build on our industry leadership in that category. And our new smart cities and connected health initiatives demonstrate how connected devices can help cut costs, grow revenues, boost efficiency and satisfy customers' needs.
Let's now move to our Entertainment group results on Slide 8. This is our first full quarter reporting with DIRECTV, and the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expected to receive from combining these operations. Reported revenues for the quarter more than doubled year-over-year, mostly due to the DTV acquisition. But our U-verse revenues also showed solid growth. We also saw exceptional margin expansion, which points directly to the benefits of the acquisition. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%. That's up more than 800 basis points year-over-year. We've shifted our marketing focus to driving satellite net adds, and you can see that in our subscriber results. Satellite net adds were 214,000, with our total video net adds for the quarter down just slightly.
We've been really pleased with our growing flow share with DIRECTV. Year-over-year gross adds have been up every month since the deal was closed, thanks in large part to our wider distribution. And we are seeing an increasing satellite customers in our wireline footprint, bundling broadband with their video service. 
Sales of satellite IP broadband to new customers were up 60% from the end of the third quarter this year. That helped drive an increase of more than 190,000 total IP broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter. It's still early, but we see a lot more opportunity to use video to drive sales and lower churn for all of our services. 
Our new unlimited wireless data for combined wireless and TV customers has been very popular since we introduced it 2 weeks ago. We've already had more than 0.5 million wireless subscribers sign up for the unlimited data plan and TV net adds are going strong as well. And we expect to launch a variety of new video entertainment packages this year. 
These offers definitely add some sizzle to our bundling offers. But the real impact is to build a strong relationship with our customer base. Our goal is a TV Everywhere experience with broad viewer choice, both inside and outside the home, that is simple and easy for our customers to use. 
AT&T is already a leading provider of online video. Our DIRECTV app already allows live video streaming of more than 100 different networks. And by the end of the first quarter, we expect to have nearly all of the top 25 cable networks. We've already seen about a 50% increase in the number of customers using the DTV app since the second quarter of the year. We are driving an OTT capability with our video services, one that provides great choices at a fair price, and it's importantly is also win-win for the content providers and our integrated offerings.
Now let's move to our U.S. Mobility results on Slide 9. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility  aberrations are now divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segment. For comparison purposes, we're providing supplemental information for our total U.S. wireless operations here.
During the fourth quarter, total net adds came in strong with 2.2 million new subscribers and with gains in every customer category. That's the third consecutive quarter where net adds have exceeded 2 million. Almost 1 million of those net adds were branded, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, driving positive phone additions in the quarter. We're putting a lot more focus on branded customers and with good reason.
Cricket has energized the prepaid space for us. We added more prepaid subscribers than any other carrier in 2015. In fact, we added more subscribers than the rest of the industry combined, and Cricket churn is coming in at industry-leading levels. This helped drive an increase of 213,000 branded phone subscribers in the quarter. Compare that with our postpaid pressure of about 250,000 phones, the vast majority of which were higher churning feature phones with average ARPUs at about $35. All the while, 3/4 of our Cricket gross adds in the fourth quarter were on rate plans that were $50 or higher. This points the overall strength of our business and our ability to operate an efficient smart business in the competitive, mature market.
We also continue to grow high-value smartphone base, adding about 1 million branded smartphone subs during the quarter. At the same time, we had another strong churn quarter. Total churn was down year-over-year once again. Thanks to our great networks, our quality offers and our top-notch customer service. Postpaid churn came in at 1.18% for the quarter, an improvement from the year-ago quarter. And full year postpaid churn was 1.09%, one of our best years ever. That's an impressive performance at a time when we focused on higher-value subscribers in a heavily competitive market. 
And I need to add a point about the Cricket churn. We have seen improving churn throughout the year, even as we shut down the legacy CDMA network and move subscribers to our 4G LTE network. Fourth quarter Cricket churn was the best yet, coming in at 3.8% or a 170 point improvement over last year's fourth quarter and about half when you look at the comparable leap fourth quarter from 2 years ago. 
Cricket has become a powerful part of our wireless story, and we are very pleased with how it's performing, and we expect it to do even more in '16. Wireless margins and ARPU are on Slide 10. 
Our relentless efforts to drive efficiency and move our smartphone customer base to no subsidy model once again drove record wireless EBITDA margins. You can see this clearly in our operating expenses. While equipment revenues were down more than $700 million mostly due to lower upgrade volumes, total cash operating costs were down $1.8 billion. Thanks to our sharp focus on cost management and efficiency. That helps increase EBITDA by nearly $900 million in the quarter and drive our best ever fourth quarter EBITDA service margin of 43.2%. 
We also had our best ever full year service EBITDA margin coming in at 46.7%. By the way, if you exclude regulatory and insurance fees and service revenues that some of our competitors do, our full year number is about 50%. Total wireless revenue was impacted by lower smartphone sales. Service revenues continue to stabilize. Corporate revenues also impacted by increasing number of Bring Your Own Device subscribers. 
We had about 700,000 in the quarter. That includes those who purchased new smartphones through vendor leasing programs or vendor installment programs. BYOD sales are lowest costs subscribers, and we're happy to have them. They value our quality network coverage and reliability as well as our spring selection of great plans. 
Phone-only plus Next ARPU continue to grow at a steady pace, up 4.6%, even with a growing number of BYOD subs. The number of smartphone customers on no device subsidy plans continues to expand. More than 2/3 of smartphone subscribers or nearly 70% are on no subsidy plans, with about 46% of that smartphone base on AT&T Next plans. 
Now, let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 11. The wireless theme in Mexico is really getting after these days. First, we blew through our year-end 4G LTE deployment target by reaching 44 million POPs. That puts us well on our way to our next benchmark of reaching 75 million POPs by the end of year, and it brings our North American LTE coverage to 355 million people, which is more than any other carrier. 
We also launched our rebranding the AT&T name in several areas, beginning in markets where we deployed LTE. That includes Guadalajara and Monterrey, with Mexico City slated for April. We continue to expand our distribution network. We've added 1,000 new store locations since we acquired these properties earlier in the year. All of this helped drives strong subscriber growth for the quarter, where nearly 600,000 total net adds with gains in both prepaid and postpaid. 
Mexico financials continue to reflect our operational investment and strong subscriber growth. We expect comparable results in the first half of the year and the investment cycle to continue through 2016. In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continue to show solid growth on a local currency basis, but foreign exchange rates continue to pressure our results. Revenues, ARPUs and margins are all pressured by FX and are being hampered by challenging economies across Latin America. 
Subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds. But even with all this, we generated modest positive cash flow from these operations in the quarter. All in all, we feel very confident that we will be able to create value with this business and with these assets. We're more integrated with the day-to-day operations, and we have solid local management teams that are adding stability in a very challenging economic environment. 
Now let's move to consolidated margins on Slide 12. Consolidated margins reflect the overall strength of our business. Adjusted consolidating income margin came in at 16.8% in the quarter. This was a 230 basis point improvement over the year-ago fourth quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin was 160 basis points higher than 1 year ago. Strong fourth quarter results helped drive 130 basis point improvement in the full year adjusted operating income margin. That's a tremendous accomplishment for a company with $146 billion in revenue. 
There were several reasons for this improvement. Strong margin expansion in our Entertainment group and Business Solutions and our focused sales approacha and efficiencies in wireless drove strong consumer mobility margin gains as well. We'll continue our laser focus on cost reductions. We have driven the savings through greater efficiencies, productivity gains and expense savings. 
Project Agile continues to build momentum as do our digital first initiatives. We're seeing cycle time reduction and lower call volumes. Software-defined networking will radically reshape not only our cost, but also the flexibility of our network deployment.
Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We confidently continue to expand [indiscernible] margins and to cut cost to offset pressure while we're in the investment cycle in Mexico.
Cash flows were outstanding in 2015. Let's take a look on Slide 13. We improved our ability to generate cash in 2015 and our ability to have strong free cash flow even with strong capital investment. In the fourth quarter, cash from operations were more than $9 billion, and we've generated more than $35 billion operating cash flow in 2015.
Capital investment totaled $6.8 billion for the quarter. This includes about $700 million that we spent in Mexico, where we received equipment and are putting it into service in the normal course. But we had financing terms for our vendors that don't require us to pay for it until the end of 2016 or a little bit later. 
For the year, we made capital investments of nearly $21 billion. Free cash flow was $3.1 billion. For the full year, it was nearly $16 billion, coming in higher than our increased guidance. We also continue to tap the securitization market to manage working capital with Next. We received about $900 million in the fourth quarter. When you combine this with the foregone payments from prior securitizations, the net impact is about $100 million of pressure on cash flow. So cash flow in and of itself was very strong from operations. 
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion for the quarter and about $10 billion for the year, which gave us a payout ratio of 64%. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.31. We ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. We're proud of our ability to generate cash. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our business, reduce debt and return substantial value in our shareholders.
Now I will turn it back to Randall to provide our 2016 outlook."

That's the first point I want to make to you. Second point, what we'll see is we will see the merger synergy savings starting to show up in margins in '16 and specifically, most of the $1.5 billion worth of run rate savings we expect to get to by the end of the year we'll start seeing coming through the Entertainment group. As we go through the year, we'll see what happens with other competing interest.

Also, anybody the big exporters, people who are exporting, who have exposure to foreign currencies, particularly the strong dollar, we're seeing weakness there. But I will tell you, we are kind of netted out. Our revenues kind of held their own on the business side because we are taking share. And NetBond and Network on Demand, we're having a lot of success in the marketplace. And so we're taking share and holding our own. But we are seeing some softness in those areas. The consumer continues to spend money. In fact, it's a decent holiday season in light of those really aggressive competition. But the consumer continued to spend money. I might have anticipated. In fact, I did anticipate a little more robust Christmas season because you're seeing energy prices at lows we haven't seen in a long time. And you didn't see the step up in consumer spending that you might have expected in third and fourth quarter. But the consumer did continue to spend. As we look at 2016, we've built this plan around a 2% GDP growth rate that you asked roughly. And there's a lot of science that goes into that, but you can basically turn around and look at the last few years, you see it's been 2%. It's not really hard to forecast at these days. We've been in a -- we've been fairly tight in terms of hitting our estimates for the last few years. What I am concerned about, I'll be honest with you, is as you look at 2015, there are a lot of things that went the consumers' way and they went the economies way, not the least of which are energy prices. But even over the last few years, there's been some benefit from 10 million people being put back to work. And so as we get to end of 2015, those benefits that we've seen over the last couple of quarters, you look forward, are you going to see those in the future, probably not. And so I made a comment last week that got picked up that we're assuming 2% if you ask me to kind of handicap is our more downside refs cited that, probably downside. But it's probably within a tight range of 2% is what our estimate is right now, Phil."

We're doing some things to shore that up. It will improve, not the least of which we do some pricing to ensure that we can help again to mitigate the U-verse churn. The other thing we did, and it's early, but I think we're going to see some not inconsequential impacts from this, is the unlimited offer for all of our TV customers. U-verse customers can now step in to an unlimited data offer. And this is, we think, a hugely retentive offer. It's a great value for our customers that this type of offer or put in front of them.

You obviously gave us some help thinking about the revenue, the EBITDA and the CapEx piece parts in that calculation. I think you had mentioned some deferred CapEx related to Mexico. I'm curious if that's factored into the guidance. If you can give us any help on how to think about cash taxes with deferred bonus depreciation or extended bonus depreciation and anything else that we need to think about, like pension, that would be very value added?"

We continue to work on the cash flow opportunities and doing for a number of years. So those are all in already. That's not nothing new here. Secondly, with regard to bonus depreciation, we told the community when we first gave our guidance that we were taking that into consideration, assuming that we get past, we would meet this guidance, even if they didn't get past, it has gotten past. The one point I would make to everyone is that it's now 15 years of bonus depreciation, and it's been in place. And so giving the bonus depreciation extended for 5 years and giving [indiscernible] is really important. But the creation of benefits from bonus depreciation is now being largely offset by the reversal of prior year's benefits that have been taken by taxpayers. So it's much more of a balancing item there. With regard to that, pressures on cash flow do not come from our pension. We have a pension contribution we'll make this year in about $200 million. But that's already been in the plan. That's the only thing that's required. Our pension plan's very well funded. And then we do expect total tax payments to be up this year from a year-over-year basis. But as you know, from our prior year filings, our tax payments were rather modest last year. And then so we would expect those to go up. But all in, we feel pretty comfortable about hitting our guidance and we're certainly working very, very hard to do better on that guidance."

Additionally, we're still going through the sales process of training our reps who've never sold broadband, where they sold satellite before, or who sold broadband but never sold satellite before.

I have a sports car, old sports car that I have now connected to the Internet. And it's actually a fairly elegant solution. And so there's some capabilities that we are putting into the market, in fact, we are selling into the market today to connect the used car fleet with that is out on the U.S. roads.

These are round numbers. [indiscernible] profile give you the details but with that, you can see that that's where our penetration right now has been at 25%. The key change here is the fact that we now have an actual video product in DIRECTV and a satellite productand such that we didn't have that before. So many of our, if you will, broadband capable locations didn't have a video offering, now they do. And so, as we improve this single truck roll capability, this sales channel capability, all of that we expect to grow that share. And you can -- we would expect that it would be a significant improvement over where we're at today. With regard to the expansion that we're doing now with regard to fiber, we are seeing very good results. And the ability to always have video available with the satellite product is going to prove, I think, to be very beneficial for us. So we will expand on that 60 million footprint over the next 4 years. And we will also get to some of it -- some of it will overlap, but we will get to 14 million fiber enabled and, quite frankly, there's a likelihood that we may get to more than that when we're finished. So that's the way to think about that footprint issue. With regard to the capital send, you're right, we don't go into great detail on the capital spends. Because in our wireline and wireless footprint, we're an integrated carrier, these spends become overlapping, whether you're taking high-speed backhaul to a sell side or whether you're shipping wireless traffic or wireline traffic onto an IP backbone. But from a general perspective, in 2015, we've spent probably about half of our capital in the wireless area, the other half in the wireline area. And if you will, the [indiscernible] really the shared services area. I will tell you the pickup in the fourth quarter in part was due to Mexico and in part was due to the set-up box and the sales opportunities in DIRECTV. So I'll give you that way to think about that. And I think that will be kind of a consistent story as we go through the carriers. We are investing at a rampant rate in all of our business. And one thing about our wireless business is when you got the tower network that we have today, the infrastructure that's been there and you have the spectrum holdings that we have today, you can do great things with quality of service, at least our network team can do great service and continue to meet all the needs. And you can be pretty effective with your capital spend. It's not a situation where there is an investment. It's that much of this investment has been made over the last 3 years with spectrum purchases through the VIP project, putting extensive fiber into the ground and backhaul capabilities. And we're going to continue that, quite frankly, with giga power, as we put more fiber near other cell sites that we can get even better, high-quality backhaul. So it's really integrated process but we -- needless to say, we continue to be very proud of the performance and continue to invest there."

So when you think about software defined networking, as you think about the merger synergies from DIRECTV, $2.5 billion run rate of synergies. You think about all that's going on in just the core business, you've got Project Agile John does where we'",616,"Yes. So when you think about software defined networking, as you think about the merger synergies from DIRECTV, $2.5 billion run rate of synergies. You think about all that's going on in just the core business, you've got Project Agile John does where we're really just streamlining a lot of various operations, moving a lot of the customer interaction at their request to digital. There's -- the opportunity is really impressive to continue taking expense out of the business. I would tell you, if you look at just this quarter's results, it ought to give you some degree of comfort in terms of what's possible even at a company of our size and our scale. Whether it's Business Solutions segment, our Mobility segment, our Entertainment Group segment, Consolidated -- I mean, it was a clean sweep in terms of taking margin top. And we weren't taking them up 5 or 10 basis points, the margins really moved up considerably. So we feel really good about the path we're on and the momentum we have on the cost side, of taking cost out of the business. On the capital spending side, this is a unique opportunity. We're at a place where a lot of things are converging in terms of maturity. That's going to create some incredible opportunities as we go forward. These item -- these ubiquitous high-speed mobile networks, I mean, they are here and they are ubiquitous. They're low latency. Combine that with cloud, combine that with data analytics capabilities that are available to the masses right, I mean, the world of big data is here and it's available to everybody. And then sensors. The sensor technology, the ability to actually put in service sensors at virtually no -- I mean, the cost is nominal to put these sensors in place. Millions upon millions of the sensors, all of this, these 4 elements coming together at one time is a massive opportunity. And people not thinking about how to take advantage of ubiquitous mobility, high-speed and low-latency networks with cloud, with data analytics, with this sensor technology are going to miss. And we think we're at a place right now where we have a unique position on bringing all this together and creating growth. We're going to invest through the cycle. We're going to invest in video and making sure we can deliver video to our customers. We think that's going to be a huge opportunity and expanding our footprint into Mexico. I mean, all of these are converging, we think, to give us a growth platforms for the next 4 or 5 years. That is unique. So we're trying to be prudent. Our downward bias on an incremental basis capital. We continue to emphasize that. We're being more and more efficient with our capital spend. John pointed out the implications of spectrum. Don't miss this. You deploy these 2 by 10 megahertz blocks of spectrum. The efficiencies it brings to building and operating mobile networks is significant. And we think we're in a very unique position in that regard, too. So I said in my opening comments and I'll say it again, our intention is to deliver over these networks the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit to deliver. That's our objective and that's the path we're headed down. So we feel good about being able to achieve that. So Tim, thanks for the question. And I also thank everybody for your participation on the call. We're up and running with the DIRECTV acquisition in Mexico. Those are going well. And we feel good about where we are as a business and looking forward to 2016. So thank you for your interest."

Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everybody. Before John just steps you through the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and just reiterate the strategy we're pursuing; that is to be the premier integrated communications company in the world. And obviously, that's a strategy that we are pursuing in every single market segment, and it's from our largest multinational customers to the most price-sensitive consumer. 
And when you look at 2015, it was an eventful year, where we put together a lot of the pieces that were required to fulfill this objective. Primarily, we closed on the DIRECTV acquisition. And we secured a very deep spectrum footprint in the government auction, and that's giving us the network capacity for our TV Everywhere plans. And we acquired 2 Mexican wireless companies with extensive spectrum holdings and distribution. And this gives us access to one of the very best emerging market economies in the world. 
Now, we financed the DIRECTV and spectrum purchases at very attractive rates. And we did all of this, put it together and exited 2015 with a very strong balance sheet. And our dividend coverage has returned to a level that's very consistent with our historic norm. 
As you look at our strategy, the core is getting the basic connectivity element right. Because if you want to be an integrated solution provider, it requires, more than anything else, world-class, high-speed, secure connectivity. And it can't be just wireless connectivity or broadband to the home or the business, but all connectivity: wireless, broadband, satellite, VPN, it all has to be integrated. 
So for example, TV Everywhere. DIRECTV is really accelerating our introduction of next-generation TV. And the DIRECTV content agreements, combined with our networks, is proving to be a very powerful combination. So we can now deliver the best entertainment packages over traditional linear TV or streamed over the Internet to essentially any mobile device.
A couple of weeks ago, we launched the nationwide solution that combines any of our TV entertainment packages with unlimited mobile data. So our customers can now stream their video without incurring overage charges. And this is only our first move. You're going to see the offers and the customer experience continue to get better and better as we move through 2016. 
We also launched a number of integrated solutions for businesses. And I think the best example of this is our Network on Demand service, which lets customer dial their bandwidth up or down literally on demand. And our NetBond service is also having a lot of success, and I think this is a beautiful example of an integrated solution. It gives a company the capability to secure access -- to securely access information from a mobile device over VPN into virtually any major cloud provider, and that includes Amazon, Microsoft, IBM or salesforce.com. 
The common threat to all of this is providing our customers with a seamless integrated experience. And again, the core to making all this happen is the network. And our LTE network now covers 355 million people and businesses in North America, and we expect to hit the 385 million mark by the end of this year. We're continuing to build out our GigaPower footprint, and we can now deliver speeds up to 1 gig to over 1 million customer locations in 20 markets. And we've announced plans to enter an additional 36 markets.
We also continue to extend our fiber network to more businesses. So we're really feeling good about our networks. And we believe we do have the most comprehensive capabilities now in the industry. But to compete in today's market, the solutions do have to be global solutions because at the end of the day, our customers are global. And that global focus is why we're the leader in serving multinational business.
In fact, we connect 3.5 million businesses. That includes nearly all the Fortune 1000, and we do it in almost 200 countries and territories. We've extended our wireless network into Mexico now. And as you're going to see in a few minutes, our growth in Mexico was exceeding all of our expectations. 
And also, in 2015, we built on our global leadership position in the Internet of Things. And our IoT solutions are not U.S. solutions. They are global solutions. We invested very early in this space, and it is paying off. We now have over 26 million devices connected to our network. We're also a leader in connected cars. We added 1 million of them in the fourth quarter. And recently, we completed a deal with Ford that we believe is going to connect at least 10 million cars over the next 5 years. 
And finally, we're investing aggressively in the network architecture that is going to give us a competitive advantage in cost. We're driving the industry to software-defined networks. And I have seen few opportunities over my career to drive down the cost to deliver service like this. 
We're also on track to deliver at least $2.5 billion in annual DIRECTV synergies by 2018, and we continue to invest in spectrum. We began last year by investing $18 billion in the auction to significantly deepen our spectrum footprint. And as a result, we now have 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum to deploy over the next few years to support TV Everywhere. 
But just as important is the impact that such a deep spectrum footprint will have on our cost to build and operate our networks. So as we look out over the next few years, we're convinced that software-defined networks, combined with the DIRECTV synergies and our deep spectrum position, are going to give us an industry-leading cost structure. 
And our objective is really straightforward. We want to move the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit. Today, we think we're a company with no obvious peer. We have a nationwide TV and wireless footprint. Our IP broadband footprint reaches nearly 60 million customer locations. We have end-to-end capabilities and enterprise world-class distribution and a globally respected brand. And while all these transformative moves were taking place, we executed pretty well in 2015. 
If you look at Slide 5, as you see, adjusted EPS growth was solid. Our cash flows were way up. Margins continued to expand, and consolidated revenue growth was on track. We ended 2015 with 137 million mobility subscribers, 45 million video subscribers, 13 million IP broadband customers and an LTE network that's covering 355 million people. And we're seeing nice growth across all of our key product categories. 
In the fourth quarter, we had really solid net adds in wireless, satellite video and IP broadband. So to wrap it up, strategy's working. We have the critical capability we need to execute the strategy.
And I'm going to hand it over to John now, and then I'll come back later to give a full year outlook for what we see in 2016. So with that, John?"

We had double-digit growth in consolidated revenues, adjusted earnin",2519,"Thanks, Randall, and hello, everyone. It's great to have you on the call. Let's start by taking a look at the quarter and our financial summary on Slide 6. 
We finished the year strong. We had double-digit growth in consolidated revenues, adjusted earnings and free cash flow. At the same time, we continue to see margin expansion in every segment of our domestic business.
In the fourth quarter, reported EPS was $0.65 and adjusted EPS was $0.63. That's up more than 12% over last year's fourth quarter. This include adjustments for merger- and integration-related costs and the annual mark to market of our benefit plans. This strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations and some deferral of recognition of video revenue. 
Consolidated revenues grew to $42.1 billion. That's up more than 22% year-over-year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. That growth comes even with lower equipment sales as customers chose to hold onto their smartphones for a longer period of time. 
During the quarter, the company aligned DIRECTV's revenue recognition for new customer promotional offers to AT&T's practices. The company will now recognize revenues from customers reflecting the amounts billed over time. Recognition of expenses will not change. The fourth quarter impact of this change resulted in the lower booked revenues by about $300 million and had a corresponding impact on income, margin and a $0.03 impact on EPS as well. 
Cash flows continue to be a great story. Free cash flow was more than $3 billion in the quarter and nearly $16 billion for the full year. That brought our free cash flow dividend coverage to about 64% for the year.
Let's take a closer look at our operational highlights, starting with Business Solutions on Slide 7. The biggest news here in our Business Solutions segment was our dramatic margin improvement. EBITDA margins improved 360 basis points year-over-year as cost efficiencies far outpaced equipment revenue declines.
Equipment sales were down year-over-year as we sold fewer handsets and less wireline CPE to our business customers, but higher margin service revenues were essentially flat on a constant-currency basis, with growing strategic services and wireless services largely offsetting legacy wireline declines.
We continue to see stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues. Growth in our most advanced data products is keeping pace with the clients in legacy data services. Strategic services revenues grew by more than 10% year-over-year. And when you adjust for foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 12%. 
We serve the total connectivity needs of our customers, and more and more, that means mobility. Mobility in cloud solutions are changing the way business gets done, and AT&T is delivering this to customers. We're connecting people, cars, homes, cities, devices, machines and businesses to the Internet and each other. 
We've established ourselves as the world leader in IoT. We signed more than 300 new Internet of Things business agreements in 2015 alone. A recently announced new connected car agreements with Ford and BMW build on our industry leadership in that category. And our new smart cities and connected health initiatives demonstrate how connected devices can help cut costs, grow revenues, boost efficiency and satisfy customers' needs.
Let's now move to our Entertainment group results on Slide 8. This is our first full quarter reporting with DIRECTV, and the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expected to receive from combining these operations. Reported revenues for the quarter more than doubled year-over-year, mostly due to the DTV acquisition. But our U-verse revenues also showed solid growth. We also saw exceptional margin expansion, which points directly to the benefits of the acquisition. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%. That's up more than 800 basis points year-over-year. We've shifted our marketing focus to driving satellite net adds, and you can see that in our subscriber results. Satellite net adds were 214,000, with our total video net adds for the quarter down just slightly.
We've been really pleased with our growing flow share with DIRECTV. Year-over-year gross adds have been up every month since the deal was closed, thanks in large part to our wider distribution. And we are seeing an increase in satellite customers in our wireline footprint, bundling broadband with their video service. 
Sales of satellite and IP broadband to new customers were up 60% from the end of the third quarter this year. That helped drive an increase of more than 190,000 total IP broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter. It's still early, but we see a lot more opportunity to use video to drive sales and lower churn for all of our services. 
Our new unlimited wireless data for combined wireless and TV customers has been very popular since we introduced it 2 weeks ago. We've already had more than 0.5 million wireless subscribers sign up for the unlimited data plan and TV net adds are going strong as well. And we expect to launch a variety of new video entertainment packages this year. 
These offers definitely add some sizzle to our bundling offers. But the real impact is to build a strong relationship with our customer base. Our goal is a TV Everywhere experience with broad viewer choice, both inside and outside the home that is simple and easy for our customers to use. 
AT&T is already a leading provider of online video. Our DIRECTV app already allows live video streaming of more than 100 different networks. And by the end of the first quarter, we expect to have nearly all of the top 25 cable networks. We have already seen about a 50% increase in the number of customers using the DTV app since the second quarter of the year. We are driving an OTT capability with our video services, one that provides great choices at a fair price, and this importantly is also a win-win for the content providers and our integrated offerings.
Now let's move to our U.S. Mobility results on Slide 9. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are now divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, we're providing supplemental information for our total U.S. Wireless operations here.
During the fourth quarter, total net adds came in strong, with 2.2 million new subscribers and with gains in every customer category. That's the third consecutive quarter where net adds have exceeded 2 million. Almost 1 million of those net adds were branded, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, driving positive phone additions in the quarter. We're putting a lot more focus on branded customers and with good reason.
Cricket has energized the prepaid space for us. We added more prepaid subscribers than any other carrier in 2015. In fact, we added more subscribers than the rest of the industry combined, and Cricket churn is coming in at industry-leading levels. This helped drive an increase of 213,000 branded phone subscribers in the quarter. Compare that with our postpaid pressure of about 250,000 phones, the vast majority of which were higher churning feature phones with average ARPUs at about $35. All the while, 3/4 of our Cricket gross adds in the fourth quarter were on rate plans that were $50 or higher. This points to the overall strength of our business and our ability to operate an efficient smart business in a competitive, mature market.
We also continue to grow our high-value smartphone base, adding about 1 million branded smartphone subs during the quarter. At the same time, we had another strong churn quarter. Total churn was down year-over-year once again thanks to our great networks, our quality offers and our top-notch customer service. Postpaid churn came in at 1.18% for the quarter, an improvement from the year-ago quarter. And full year postpaid churn was 1.09%, one of our best years ever. That's an impressive performance at a time when we focused on higher-value subscribers in a heavily competitive market. 
And I need to add a point about the Cricket churn. We have seen improving churn throughout the year, even as we shut down the legacy CDMA network and move subscribers to our 4G LTE network. Fourth quarter Cricket churn was the best yet, coming in at 3.8% or a 170 point improvement over last year's fourth quarter and about half when you look at the comparable leap fourth quarter from 2 years ago. 
Cricket has become a powerful part of our wireless story, and we are very pleased with how it's performing, and we expect it to do even more in '16. 
Wireless margins and ARPU are on Slide 10. Our relentless efforts to drive efficiency and move our smartphone customer base to a no subsidy model once again drove record wireless EBITDA margins. You can see this clearly in our operating expenses. While equipment revenues were down more than $700 million, mostly due to lower upgrade volumes, total cash operating costs were down $1.8 billion thanks to our sharp focus on cost management and efficiency. That helps increase EBITDA by nearly $900 million in the quarter and drive our best ever fourth quarter EBITDA service margin of 43.2%. 
We also had our best ever full year service EBITDA margin coming in at 46.7%. By the way, if you exclude regulatory and insurance fees and service revenues that some of our competitors do, our full year number is about 50%. Total wireless revenue was impacted by lower smartphone sales. Service revenues continue to stabilize. 
Corporate revenues also were impacted by increasing number of Bring Your Own Device subscribers. We had about 700,000 in the quarter. That includes those who purchased new smartphones through vendor leasing programs or vendor installment programs. BYOD sales are our lowest cost subscribers, and we're happy to have them. They value our quality network coverage and reliability, as well as our great selection of rate plans. 
Phone-only plus Next ARPU continue to grow at a steady pace, up 4.6%, even with a growing number of BYOD subs. The number of smartphone customers on no-device subsidy plans continues to expand. More than 2/3 of smartphone subscribers or nearly 70% are on no-subsidy plans, with about 46% of that smartphone base on AT&T Next plans. 
Now, let's look at our international operations. That information's on Slide 11. The wireless team in Mexico is really getting after it these days. First, we blew through our year-end 4G LTE deployment target by reaching 44 million POPs. That puts us well on our way to our next benchmark of reaching 75 million POPs by the end of year, and it brings our North American LTE coverage to 355 million people, which is more than any other carrier. 
We also launched our rebranding to the AT&T name in several areas, beginning in markets where we've deployed LTE. That includes Guadalajara and Monterrey, with Mexico City slated for April. And we continue to expand our distribution network. We've added 1,000 new store locations since we acquired these properties earlier in the year. All of this helped drive strong subscriber growth for the quarter, or nearly 600,000 total net adds with gains in both prepaid and postpaid. 
Mexico financials continue to reflect our operational investment and strong subscriber growth. We expect comparable results in the first half of the year and the investment cycle to continue through 2016. In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continue to show solid growth on a local currency basis, but foreign exchange rates continue to pressure our results. Revenues, ARPUs and margins are all pressured by FX and are being hampered by challenging economies across Latin America. 
Subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds. But even with all this, we generated modest positive cash flow from these operations in the quarter. All in all, we feel very confident that we will be able to create value with this business and with these assets. We're more integrated with the day-to-day operations, and we have solid local management teams that are adding stability in a very challenging economic environment. 
Now let's move to consolidated margins on Slide 12. Consolidated margins reflect the overall strength of our business. Adjusted consolidating income margin came in at 16.8% in the quarter. This was a 230 basis point improvement over the year-ago fourth quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin was 160 basis points higher than 1 year ago. Strong fourth quarter results helped drive 130 basis point improvement in the full year adjusted operating income margin. That's a tremendous accomplishment for a company with $146 billion in revenue. 
There were several reasons for this improvement. Strong margin expansion in our Entertainment group and Business Solutions and our focused sales approach and efficiencies in wireless drove strong consumer mobility margin gains as well. We'll continue our laser focus on cost reductions. We have driven the savings through greater efficiencies, productivity gains and expense savings. 
Project Agile continues to build momentum as do our digital first initiatives. We're seeing cycle time reduction and lower call volumes. Software-defined networking will radically reshape not only our cost, but also the flexibility of our network deployment.
Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We're confident we continue to expand [indiscernible] margins and to cut costs to offset pressure while we're in the investment cycle in Mexico.
Cash flows were outstanding in 2015. Let's take a look on Slide 13. We improved our ability to generate cash in 2015 and our ability to have strong free cash flow even with strong capital investment. In the fourth quarter, cash from operations were more than $9 billion, and we've generated more than $35 billion operating cash flow in 2015.
Capital investment totaled $6.8 billion for the quarter. This includes about $700 million that we spent in Mexico, where we received equipment and are putting it into service in the normal course. But we had financing terms for our vendors that don't require us to pay for it until the end of 2016 or a little bit later. 
For the year, we made capital investments of nearly $21 billion. Free cash flow was $3.1 billion. For the full year, it was nearly $16 billion, coming in higher than our increased guidance. We also continue to tap the securitization market to manage working capital with Next. We received about $900 million in the fourth quarter. When you combine this with the foregone payments from prior securitizations, the net impact is about $100 million of pressure on cash flow. So cash flow in and of itself was very strong from operations. 
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion for the quarter and about $10 billion for the year, which gave us a payout ratio of 64%. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.31. We ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. We're proud of our ability to generate cash. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our business, reduce debt and return substantial value in our shareholders.
Now I will turn it back to Randall to provide our 2016 outlook."

Last summer, we provided the long-term guidance after we closed the DIRECTV deal, and look, it really hasn't changed. We're tracking almost exactly on what we told you. And so when you look at 2016, what you can expect is double-digit consolidated revenue growth, adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single-digit range or better, stable consolidated margins, with a solid business plan to improve in each segment, even while we're investing in Mexico.
Capital spending will be in the $22 billion range with our focus on cost efficiencies and SDN creating a downward bias to that forecast. And we expect our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to be in the 70s with a goal of growing free cash flow this year. 
So that kind of wraps it up. And with that, John and Mike and I are glad to stand for questions. So Tony, we'll turn it back to you."

It looks flatter sequentially whether it was the impact of the revenue recognition change.

On the Entertainment margins, the first point I'd like to make is the $300 million revenue deferral did impact margins in this quarter and the margins would have been close to a couple hundred basis points higher, if we would have had that recognition. That's the first point I want to make to you. Second point, what we'll see is we will see the merger synergy savings starting to show up in margins in '16 and specifically, most of the $1.5 billion worth of run rate savings we expect to get to by the end of the year we'll start seeing coming through the Entertainment group. As we go through the year, we'll see what happens with other competing interest.

All of those companies are a little bit defensive right now, as you might guess. Also, anybody, the big exporters, people who are exporting, who have exposure to foreign currencies, particularly the strong dollar, we're seeing weakness there. But I will tell you, we are kind of netted out. Our revenues kind of held their own on the business side because we are taking share. And NetBond and Network on Demand were having a lot of success in the marketplace. And so we're taking share and holding our own. But we are seeing some softness in those areas. The consumer continues to spend money. In fact, it's a decent holiday season in light of those really aggressive competition. But the consumer continued to spend money. I might have anticipated, in fact, I did anticipate a little more robust Christmas season because you're seeing energy prices at lows we haven't seen in a long time. And you didn't see the step up in consumer spending that you might have expected in third and fourth quarter. But the consumer did continue to spend. As we look at 2016, we've built this plan around a 2% GDP growth rate in the U.S. roughly. And there's a lot of science that goes into that, but you can basically turn around and look at the last few years and see it's been 2%. It's not really hard to forecast it these days. We've been in a -- we've been fairly tight in terms of hitting our estimates for the last few years. What I am concerned about, I'll be honest with you, is as you look at 2015, there are a lot of things that went the consumers' way and that went the economies' way, not the least of which are energy prices. But even over the last few years, there's been some benefit from 10 million people being put back to work. And so as we get to end of 2015, those benefits that we've seen over the last couple of quarters, you look forward, are you going to see those in the future? Probably not. And so I made a comment last week that got picked up that we're assuming 2%. If you ask me to kind of handicap, is there more downside or upside to that, probably downside. But it's probably within a tight range of 2% is what our estimate is right now, Phil."

Also, keep in mind that we don't even have the installation workforce up to speed on provisioning this. And so we're just getting the installation and workforce up. We just had the latest union contract gave us the rights we needed to push this out across our entire footprint. And so you're going to see us continue to get better and better there as well. As you pointed out, the satellite adds were strong in the fourth quarter, but U-verse churn offset that. So we're slightly negative in total. You'll see that relationship get better. And we're doing some things to shore up the U-verse space because we are focused on the satellite product. And so as a result, you're seeing U-verse churn up. We're doing some things to shore that up. It will improve, not the least of which we did some things on pricing to ensure that we can help again to mitigate the U-verse churn. The other thing we did, and it's early, but I think we're going to see some not inconsequential impacts from this, is the unlimited offer for all of our TV customers. U-verse customers can now step in to an unlimited data offer. And this is a -- we think, a hugely retentive offer. It's a great value for our customers to have this type of offer put in front of them. So we think you'll see the U-verse churn get better. You'll see the subscriber numbers continue to improve as we move through 2016 and the sales channel improves, the provisioning channel improves.

We continue to work on the cash flow opportunities we've been doing for a number of years. So those are all in already. That's not nothing new here. Secondly, with regard to bonus depreciation, we had told the community when we first gave our guidance that we were taking that into consideration, assuming that it would get passed, but we would meet that -- we would meet this guidance, even if it didn't get passed. It has gotten passed. The one point I would make to everyone is that it's now 15 years our bonus depreciation has been in place. And so getting the bonus depreciation extended for 5 years and giving it to the attorney [ph] is really important. But the creation of benefits from bonus depreciation is now being largely offset by the reversal of prior year's benefits that have been taken by taxpayers. So it's much more of a balancing item there. With regard to that, pressures on cash flow do not come from our pension. We have a pension contribution we'll make this year and about $200 million. But that's already been in the plan. That's the only thing that's required. Our pension plan's very well-funded. And then we do expect total tax payments to be up this year from a year over -- on a year-over-year basis. But as you know, from our prior year-filings, our tax payments were rather modest last year. And so we would expect those to go up. But all in, we feel pretty comfortable about hitting our guidance and we're certainly working very, very hard to do better on that guidance."

And so we'll have to look at that. And obviously, we're going to have to look at the first net bid that the government has just issued the RFP on. So there're a lot of ways we'll evaluate the spectrum scenario. But it's reasonable to assume that we'll be active one place or the other."

We think there's great opportunities here. The timing of it, though, is going to give us reason for some carefulness there for this reason. For example, Randall mentioned the training of our technicians who do the installs, we're just going through the completion of that now. And that's really going to be more of a second half of the year, where we see how really effective that is. We have seen a lot more bundling of the satellite with broadband. But we need some more time to make sure that we understand the momentum of that and the progress of that. Additionally, we're still going through the sales process of training our reps who've never sold broadband, when they sold satellite before, or who sold broadband but never sold satellite before. And as Randall pointed out, they have to sell wireless so we have to increase all of their sales activities whether in the stores or in the call centers. So all of this is going to take some time for us to really get a track record. I will tell you we're optimistic and pleased with the initial results. But giving any guidance on the revenue synergies, from that perspective, it's a little premature."

We certainly don't mean to imply we're at that level in January; don't want to convey that. We're not. I don't expect that. But we expect it to grow throughout the year. We did have a very good first 5 months of getting costs aligned and addressing a lot of the administrative or headquarter, some of the easier costing see it start getting out. So we did well with that and we're making good progress on the content. And quite frankly, our shifting to a satellite base -- customer base is helping. But from a -- from your question perspective, I would think of it in that way, that we're going to hit and, hopefully, exceed the $1.5 billion run rate, which will be $125 million a month by the kind of December time frame, fourth quarter time frame. With regard to any capital required for those integration costs, that's already included in the $22 billion of capital guidance. And from the expectation of integration costs, well, we have some, we haven't given guidance. I would suggest to you this way. If you think about what makes up our integration savings, our merger savings, content negotiation, staffing, supply chain, the costs to do that are not necessarily significant. It's just a matter of getting it done and doing the business. So I wouldn't expect those types of merger integration costs to be significant. I will tell you, we're still going to have customer base amortization, trademark, trade names amortization, those kinds of normal merger integration.

But we're using that platform to do a lot of work for developing what I will call mobile-centric content, content designed for the mobile device. And very optimistic about what the opportunities are there. In terms of other or broader content ownership, there are a number of areas, where we have, what I'll call, proprietary content. We own a number of regional sports networks. Some of those we acquired through the DIRECTV acquisition. Others, we've acquired over the course of the last year. We also have a lot of what I will call exclusive content, content that is produced by us, everything from the Dan Patrick Show to a particular network we have on DIRECTV and some series like Kingdom and so forth. And, Simon, you should expect us to continue to engage at that level. And as we have success, you'll see us invest more in the areas where we have success.

Like we said, we're expecting 10 million automobiles to roll off the floor between now and 2020 with our connectivity and just from Ford. You bring up an interesting point, and that is there is a massive used car fleet out there that is not connected. And there's actually technologies that are now available. I have a sports car, old sports car that I have now connected to the Internet. And it's actually a fairly elegant solution. And so there're some capabilities that we are putting into the market, in fact, we are selling into the market today to connect the used car fleet that's out on the U.S. roads. And we think that's important because the average age of a car on the road today is 11 years. And so if you really want to grow this business, you need to tap into the used car fleet. And so that's a priority for us, and you'll see us pursue that. On Mexico, and as it relates to the video opportunity, look, we're fairly convicted that mobile and video are going to be a category that's very, very relevant in the U.S. And we're early on here in the U.S. But based on early success, we continue to get more and more convicted it is going to be an important category. Bringing the 2 together is going to be important. And if it's going to be important in the U.S, we think it will be important in other markets, and Mexico will be no different. As you know, we have a minority share position in the satellite company in Mexico. And hopefully, we'll be able to do some partnering there.

And we've got about 15 million IP broadband customers today. These are round numbers. The stat profile will give you the details. But with that, you can see that that's where our penetration right now has been at 25%. The key change here is the fact that we now have a national video product in DIRECTV and a satellite product and such that we didn't have that before. So many of our, if you will, broadband-capable locations didn't have a video offering; now they do. And so, as we improve this single truck roll capability, this sales channel capability, all of that, we expect to grow that share. And you can -- we would expect that it would be a significant improvement over where we're at today. With regard to the expansion that we're doing now with regard to fiber, we are seeing very good results. And the ability to always have video available with the satellite product is going to prove, I think, to be very beneficial for us. So we will expand on that 60 million footprint over the next 4 years. And we will also get to some of it -- some of it will overlap, but we will get to 14 million fiber enabled and, quite frankly, there's a likelihood that we may get to more than that when we're finished. So that's the way to think about that footprint issue. With regard to the capital send, you're right, we don't go into great detail on the capital spends. Because in our wireline and wireless footprint, we're an integrated carrier, the spends become overlapping, whether you're taking high-speed backhaul to a sell side or whether you're shipping wireless traffic or wireline traffic onto an IP backbone. But from a general perspective, in 2015, we've spent probably about half of our capital in the wireless area, the other half in the wireline area. And if you will, the pair or the 2 that really the shared services area. I will tell you the pickup in the fourth quarter in part was due to Mexico and in part was due to the set-top box and the sales opportunities in DIRECTV. So I'll give you that way to think about that. And I think that'll be kind of a consistent story as we go through the current years. We are investing at a rampant rate in all of our business. And one thing about our wireless business is when you've got the tower network that we have today, the infrastructure that's been there and you have the spectrum holdings that we have today, you can do great things with quality service, or at least our network team can do great service and continue to meet all the needs. And you can be pretty effective with your capital spend. It's not a situation where there isn't investment. It's that much of this investment has been made over the last 3 years for the spectrum purchases, through the VIP project, putting extensive fiber into the ground and backhaul capabilities. And we're going to continue that, quite frankly, with GigaPower, as we put more fiber near other cell sites that we can then get even better, high-quality backhaul. So it's a really integrated process but we -- needless to say, we continue to be very proud of the performance and continue to invest there."

So when you think about software-defined networking, as you think about the merger synergies from DIRECTV, $2.5 billion run rate of synergies. You think about all that's going on in just the core business, you call Project Agile, John does, where we're really just streamlining a lot of various operations, moving a lot of the customer interaction at their request to digital. There's -- the opportunity is really impressive to continue taking expense out of the business. I would tell you, if you look at just this quarter's results, it ought to give you some degree of comfort in terms of what's possible even in a company of our size and our scale. Whether it's Business Solutions segment, our Mobility segment, our Entertainment group segment, consolidated, I mean, it was a clean sweep in terms of taking margins up. And we weren't taking them up 5 or 10 basis points; the margins really moved up considerably. And so we feel really good about the path we're on and the momentum we have on the cost side, of taking cost out of the business. On the capital spending side, this is a unique opportunity. We're at a place where a lot of things are converging in terms of maturity. That's going to create some incredible opportunities as we go forward. These item -- these ubiquitous high-speed mobile networks, I mean, they are here and they are ubiquitous. They're low latency. Combine that with cloud, combine that with data analytics capabilities that are available to the masses right, I mean, the world of big data is here and it's available to everybody. And then sensors. The sensor technology, the ability to actually put in service sensors at virtually no -- I mean, the cost is nominal to put these sensors in place. Millions upon millions of these sensors, all of this, these 4 elements coming together at one time is a massive opportunity. And people not thinking about how to take advantage of ubiquitous mobility, high-speed and low-latency networks with cloud, with data analytics, with this sensor technology are going to miss it. And we think we're at a place right now where we have a unique position on bringing all this together and creating growth. We're going to invest through this cycle. We're going to invest in video and making sure we can deliver video to our customers. We think that's going to be a huge opportunity and expanding our footprint into Mexico. I mean, all of these we're converging, we think to give us a growth platform for the next 4 or 5 years that is unique. So we're trying to be prudent. Our downward bias on an incremental basis of capital, we continue to emphasize that. We're being more and more efficient with our capital spend. John pointed out the implications of spectrum. Don't miss this. You deploy these 2 by 10 megahertz blocks of spectrum. The efficiencies it brings to building and operating mobile networks is significant. And we think we're in a very unique position in that regard, too. So I said in my opening comments and I'll say it again, our intention is to deliver over these networks the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit to deliver. That's our objective and that's the path we're headed down. So we feel good about being able to achieve that. So Tim, thanks for the question. And I also thank everybody for your participation on the call. We're off and running with the DIRECTV acquisition in Mexico. Those are going well. And we feel good about where we are as a business and looking forward to 2016. So thank you for your interest."

Before John just steps you through the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and just reiterate the strategy we're pursuing; that is to be the premier integrated communications company in the w",1164,"Okay. Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everybody. Before John just steps you through the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and just reiterate the strategy we're pursuing; that is to be the premier integrated communications company in the world. And obviously, that's a strategy that we are pursuing in every single market segment, and it's from our largest multinational customers to the most price-sensitive consumer. 
And when you look at 2015, it was an eventful year, where we put together a lot of the pieces that were required to fulfill this objective. Primarily, we closed on the DIRECTV acquisition. And we secured a very deep spectrum footprint in the government auction, and that's giving us the network capacity for our TV Everywhere plans. And we acquired 2 Mexican wireless companies with extensive spectrum holdings and distribution. And this gives us access to one of the very best emerging market economies in the world. 
Now we financed the DIRECTV and spectrum purchases at very attractive rates. And we did all of this, put it together and exited 2015 with a very strong balance sheet. And our dividend coverage has returned to a level that's very consistent with our historic norm. 
As you look at our strategy, the core is getting the basic connectivity element right. Because if you want to be an integrated solution provider, it requires, more than anything else, world-class, high-speed, secure connectivity. And it can't be just wireless connectivity or broadband to the home or the business, but all connectivity: wireless, broadband, satellite, VPN, and it all has to be integrated. 
So for example, TV Everywhere. DIRECTV is really accelerating our introduction of next-generation TV. And the DIRECTV content agreements, combined with our networks, is proving to be a very powerful combination. So we can now deliver the best entertainment packages over traditional linear TV or streamed over the Internet to essentially any mobile device.
A couple of weeks ago, we launched the nationwide solution that combines any of our TV entertainment packages with unlimited mobile data so our customers can now stream their video without incurring overage charges. And this is only our first move. You're going to see the offers and the customer experience continue to get better and better as we move through 2016. 
We also launched a number of integrated solutions for businesses. And I think the best example of this is our Network on Demand service, which lets customer dial their bandwidth up or down literally on demand. And our NetBond service is also having a lot of success, and I think this is a beautiful example of an integrated solution. It gives a company the capability to secure access -- to securely access information from a mobile device over VPN into virtually any major cloud provider, and that includes Amazon, Microsoft, IBM or salesforce.com. 
The common thread to all of this is providing our customers with a seamless integrated experience. And again, the core to making all this happen is the network. And our LTE network now covers 355 million people and businesses in North America, and we expect to hit the 385 million mark by the end of this year. We're continuing to build out our GigaPower footprint, and we can now deliver speeds up to 1 gig to over 1 million customer locations in 20 markets. And we've announced plans to enter an additional 36 markets.
We also continue to expand our fiber network to more businesses. So we're really feeling good about our networks. And we believe we do have the most comprehensive capabilities now in the industry. But to compete in today's market, the solutions do have to be global solutions because, at the end of the day, our customers are global. And that global focus is why we're the leader in serving multinational business.
In fact, we connect 3.5 million businesses. That includes nearly all the Fortune 1000, and we do it in almost 200 countries and territories. We've extended our wireless network into Mexico now. And as you're going to see in a few minutes, our growth in Mexico was exceeding all of our expectations. 
And also, in 2015, we built on our global leadership position in the Internet of Things. And our IoT solutions are not U.S. solutions. They are global solutions. We invested very early in this space, and it is paying off. We now have over 26 million devices connected to our network. We're also a leader in connected cars. We added 1 million of them in the fourth quarter. And recently, we completed a deal with Ford that we believe is going to connect at least 10 million cars over the next 5 years. 
And finally, we're investing aggressively in the network architecture that is going to give us a competitive advantage in cost. We're driving the industry to software-defined networks. And I have seen few opportunities over my career to drive down the cost to deliver service like this. 
We're also on track to deliver at least $2.5 billion in annual DIRECTV synergies by 2018, and we continue to invest in spectrum. We began last year by investing $18 billion in the auction to significantly deepen our spectrum footprint. And as a result, we now have 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum to deploy over the next few years to support TV Everywhere. 
But just as important is the impact that such a deep spectrum footprint will have on our cost to build and operate our networks. So as we look out over the next few years, we're convinced that software-defined networks, combined with the DIRECTV synergies and our deep spectrum position, are going to give us an industry-leading cost structure. 
And our objective is really straightforward. We want to move the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit. Today, we think we're a company with no obvious peer. We have a nationwide TV and wireless footprint. Our IP broadband footprint reaches nearly 60 million customer locations. We have end-to-end capabilities and enterprise world-class distribution and a globally respected brand. And while all these transformative moves were taking place, we executed pretty well in 2015. 
If you look at Slide 5, as you see, adjusted EPS growth was solid. Our cash flows were way up. Margins continued to expand, and consolidated revenue growth was on track. We ended 2015 with 137 million mobility subscribers, 45 million video subscribers, 13 million IP broadband customers and an LTE network that's covering 355 million people. And we're seeing nice growth across all of our key product categories. 
In the fourth quarter, we had really solid net adds in wireless, satellite video and IP broadband. So to wrap it up, strategy's working. We have the critical capabilities we need to execute the strategy.
And I'm going to hand it over to John now, and then I'll come back later to give a full year outlook for what we see in 2016. So with that, John?"

Let's start by taking a look at the quarter and our financial summary on Slide 6. 
We finished the year strong. We had double-digit growth in consolidated revenues, adjusted earnings and free cash flow. At the same time, we continue to see margin expansion in every segment of our domestic business.
In the fourth quarter, reported EPS was $0.65 and adjusted EPS was $0.63. That's up more than 12% over last year's fourth quarter. This include adjustments for merger- and integration-related costs and the annual mark to market of our benefit plans. This strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations and some deferral of recognition of video revenue. 
Consolidated revenues grew to $42.1 billion. That's up more than 22% year-over-year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. That growth comes even with lower equipment sales as customers chose to hold onto their smartphones for a longer period of time. 
During the quarter, the company aligned DIRECTV's revenue recognition for new customer promotional offers to AT&T's practices. The company will now recognize revenues from customers reflecting the amounts billed over time. Recognition of expenses will not change. The fourth quarter impact of this change resulted in the lower booked revenues by about $300 million and had a corresponding impact on income, margin and a $0.03 impact on EPS as well. 
Cash flows continue to be a great story. Free cash flow was more than $3 billion in the quarter and nearly $16 billion for the full year. That brought our free cash flow dividend coverage to about 64% for the year.
Let's take a closer look at our operational highlights, starting with Business Solutions on Slide 7. The biggest news here in our Business Solutions segment was our dramatic margin improvement. EBITDA margins improved 360 basis points year-over-year as cost efficiencies far outpaced equipment revenue declines.
Equipment sales were down year-over-year as we sold fewer handsets and less wireline CPE to our business customers, but higher margin service revenues were essentially flat on a constant currency basis, with growing strategic services and wireless services largely offsetting legacy wireline declines.
We continue to see stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues. Growth in our most advanced data products is keeping pace with declines in legacy data services. Strategic services revenues grew by more than 10% year-over-year. And when you adjust for foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 12%. 
We serve the total connectivity needs of our customers, and more and more, that means mobility. Mobility and cloud solutions are changing the way business gets done, and AT&T is delivering this to customers. We're connecting people, cars, homes, cities, devices, machines and businesses to the Internet and each other. 
We've established ourselves as the world leader in IoT. We signed more than 300 new Internet of Things business agreements in 2015 alone. A recently announced new connected car agreements with Ford and BMW build on our industry leadership in that category. And our new smart cities and connected health initiatives demonstrate how connected devices can help cut costs, grow revenues, boost efficiency and satisfy customers' needs.
Let's now move to our entertainment group results on Slide 8. This is our first full quarter reporting with DIRECTV, and the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expected to receive from combining these operations. Reported revenues for the quarter more than doubled year-over-year, mostly due to the DTV acquisition. But our U-verse revenues also showed solid growth. We also saw exceptional margin expansion, which points directly to the benefits of the acquisition. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%. That's up more than 800 basis points year-over-year. We've shifted our marketing focus to driving satellite net adds, and you can see that in our subscriber results. Satellite net adds were 214,000, with our total video net adds for the quarter down just slightly.
We've been really pleased with our growing flow share with DIRECTV. Year-over-year gross adds have been up every month since the deal was closed, thanks in large part to our wider distribution. And we are seeing an increase in satellite customers in our wireline footprint, bundling broadband with their video service. 
Sales of satellite and IP broadband to new customers were up 60% from the end of the third quarter this year. That helped drive an increase of more than 190,000 total IP broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter. It's still early, but we see a lot more opportunity to use video to drive sales and lower churn for all of our services. 
Our new unlimited wireless data for combined wireless and TV customers has been very popular since we introduced it 2 weeks ago. We've already had more than 0.5 million wireless subscribers sign up for the unlimited data plan and TV net adds are going strong as well. And we expect to launch a variety of new video entertainment packages this year. 
These offers definitely add some sizzle to our bundling offers. But the real impact is to build a strong relationship with our customer base. Our goal is a TV Everywhere experience with broad viewer choice, both inside and outside the home that is simple and easy for our customers to use. 
AT&T is already a leading provider of online video. Our DIRECTV app already allows live video streaming of more than 100 different networks. And by the end of the first quarter, we expect to have nearly all of the top 25 cable networks. We have already seen about a 50% increase in the number of customers using the DTV app since the second quarter of the year. We are driving an OTT capability with our video services, one that provides great choices at a fair price, and this importantly is also a win-win for the content providers and our integrated offerings.
Now let's move to our U.S. mobility results on Slide 9. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are now divided between the Business Solutions and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, we're providing supplemental information for our total U.S. wireless operations here.
During the fourth quarter, total net adds came in strong with 2.2 million new subscribers and with gains in every customer category. That's the third consecutive quarter where net adds have exceeded 2 million. Almost 1 million of those net adds were branded, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, driving positive phone additions in the quarter. We're putting a lot more focus on branded customers and with good reason.
Cricket has energized the prepaid space for us. We added more prepaid subscribers than any other carrier in 2015. In fact, we added more subscribers than the rest of the industry combined, and Cricket churn is coming in at industry-leading levels. This helped drive an increase of 213,000 branded phone subscribers in the quarter. Compare that with our postpaid pressure of about 250,000 phones, the vast majority of which were higher churning feature phones with average ARPUs at about $35. All the while, 3/4 of our Cricket gross adds in the fourth quarter were on rate plans that were $50 or higher. This points to the overall strength of our business and our ability to operate an efficient, smart business in a competitive, mature market.
We also continue to grow our high-value smartphone base, adding about 1 million branded smartphone subs during the quarter. At the same time, we had another strong churn quarter. Total churn was down year-over-year once again, thanks to our great networks, our quality offers and our top-notch customer service. Postpaid churn came in at 1.18% for the quarter, an improvement from the year-ago quarter. And full year postpaid churn was 1.09%, one of our best years ever. That's an impressive performance at a time when we focused on higher-value subscribers in a heavily competitive market.
And I need to add a point about the Cricket churn. We have seen improving churn throughout the year even as we shut down the legacy CDMA network and move subscribers to our 4G LTE network. Fourth quarter Cricket churn was the best yet, coming in at 3.8% or a 170-point improvement over last year's fourth quarter and about half when you look at the comparable Leap fourth quarter from 2 years ago. 
Cricket has become a powerful part of our wireless story, and we are very pleased with how it's performing, and we expect it to do even more in '16. 
Wireless margins and ARPU are on Slide 10. Our relentless efforts to drive efficiency and move our smartphone customer base to a no subsidy model once again drove record wireless EBITDA margins. You can see this clearly in our operating expenses. While equipment revenues were down more than $700 million, mostly due to lower upgrade volumes, total cash operating costs were down $1.8 billion, thanks to our sharp focus on cost management and efficiency. That helps increase EBITDA by nearly $900 million in the quarter and drive our best ever fourth quarter EBITDA service margin of 43.2%. 
We also had our best ever full year service EBITDA margin coming in at 46.7%. By the way, if you exclude regulatory and insurance fees and service revenues that some of our competitors do, our full year number is about 50%. Total wireless revenue was impacted by lower smartphone sales. Service revenues continue to stabilize. 
Equipment revenues also were impacted by increasing number of Bring Your Own Device subscribers. We had about 700,000 in the quarter. That includes those who purchased new smartphones through vendor leasing programs or vendor installment programs. BYOD sales are our lowest-cost subscribers, and we're happy to have them. They value our quality network coverage and reliability, as well as our great selection of rate plans. 
Phone-only plus Next ARPU continue to grow at a steady pace, up 4.6%, even with a growing number of BYOD subs. The number of smartphone customers on no-device subsidy plans continues to expand. More than 2/3 of smartphone subscribers or nearly 70% are on no-subsidy plans, with about 46% of that smartphone base on AT&T Next plans. 
Now let's look at our international operations. That information's on Slide 11. The wireless team in Mexico is really getting after it these days. First, we blew through our year-end 4G LTE deployment target by reaching 44 million POPs. That puts us well on our way to our next benchmark of reaching 75 million POPs by the end of year, and it brings our North American LTE coverage to 355 million people, which is more than any other carrier. 
We also launched our rebranding to the AT&T name in several areas, beginning in markets where we've deployed LTE. That includes Guadalajara and Monterrey, with Mexico City slated for April. And we continue to expand our distribution network. We've added 1,000 new store locations since we acquired these properties earlier in the year. All of this helped drive strong subscriber growth for the quarter, or nearly 600,000 total net adds with gains in both prepaid and postpaid. 
Mexico financials continue to reflect our operational investment and strong subscriber growth. We expect comparable results in the first half of the year and the investment cycle to continue through 2016. In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continue to show solid growth on a local currency basis, but foreign exchange rates continue to pressure our results. Revenues, ARPUs and margins are all pressured by FX and are being hampered by challenging economies across Latin America. 
Subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds. But even with all this, we generated modest positive cash flow from these operations in the quarter. All in all, we feel very confident that we will be able to create value with this business and with these assets. We're more integrated with the day-to-day operations, and we have solid local management teams that are adding stability in a very challenging economic environment. 
Now let's move to the consolidated margins on Slide 12. Consolidated margins reflect the overall strength of our business. Adjusted consolidating income margin came in at 16.8% in the quarter. This was a 230 basis point improvement over the year-ago fourth quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 160 basis points higher than a year ago. Strong fourth quarter results helped drive 130 basis point improvement in the full year adjusted operating income margin. That's a tremendous accomplishment for a company with $146 billion in revenue. 
There were several reasons for this improvement. Strong margin expansion in our entertainment group and Business Solutions and our focused sales approach and efficiencies in wireless drove strong consumer mobility margin gains as well. We'll continue our laser focus on cost reductions. We have driven savings through greater efficiencies, productivity gains and expense savings. 
Project Agile continues to build momentum as do our digital first initiatives. We're seeing cycle time reduction and lower call volumes. Software-defined networking will radically reshape not only our cost, but also the flexibility of our network deployment.
Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We're confident we continue to expand domestic margins and to cut costs to offset pressure while we're in the investment cycle in Mexico.
Cash flows were outstanding in 2015. Let's take a look on Slide 13. We proved our ability to generate cash in 2015 and our ability to have strong free cash flow even with strong capital investment. In the fourth quarter, cash from operations were more than $9 billion, and we've generated more than $35 billion operating cash flow in 2015.
Capital investment totaled $6.8 billion for the quarter. This includes about $700 million that we spent in Mexico, where we received equipment and are putting it into service in the normal course. But we had financing terms for our vendors that don't require us to pay for it until the end of 2016 or a little bit later. 
For the year, we made capital investments of nearly $21 billion. Free cash flow was $3.1 billion. For the full year, it was nearly $16 billion, coming in higher than our increased guidance. We also continue to tap the securitization market to manage working capital with Next. We received about $900 million in the fourth quarter. When you combine this with the foregone payments from prior securitizations, the net impact is about $100 million of pressure on cash flow. So cash flow in and of itself was very strong from operations. 
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion for the quarter and about $10 billion for the year, which gave us a payout ratio of 64%. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.31. We ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. We're proud of our ability to generate cash. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our business, reduce debt and return substantial value in our shareholders.
Now I will turn it back to Randall to provide our 2016 outlook."

That's the first point I want to make to you. Second point, what we'll see is we will see the merger synergy savings starting to show up in margins in '16 and, specifically, most of the $1.5 billion worth of run rate savings we expect to get to by the end of the year we'll start seeing coming through the entertainment group. As we go through the year, we'll see what happens with other competing interest.

We are seeing some softness when you look at enterprise business on anybody that has anything that touches oil and gas industry. All of those companies are a little bit defensive right now, as you might guess. Also, anybody, the big exporters, people who are exporting, who have exposure to foreign currencies, particularly the strong dollar, we're seeing weakness there. But I will tell you, we are kind of netted out. Our revenues kind of held their own on the business side because we are taking share. And NetBond and Network on Demand were having a lot of success in the marketplace. And so we're taking share and holding our own. But we are seeing some softness in those areas. 
The consumer continues to spend money. In fact, it's a decent holiday season in light of those really aggressive competition. But the consumer continued to spend money. I might have anticipated, in fact, I did anticipate a little more robust Christmas season because you're seeing energy prices at lows we haven't seen in a long time. And you didn't see the step up in consumer spending that you might have expected in third and fourth quarter. But the consumer did continue to spend. 
As we look at 2016, we've built this plan around a 2% GDP growth rate in the U.S. roughly. And there's a lot of science that goes into that, but you can basically turn around and look at the last few years and see it's been 2%. It's not really hard to forecast it these days. We've been in a -- we've been fairly tight in terms of hitting our estimates for the last few years. 
What I am concerned about, I'll be honest with you, is as you look at 2015, there are a lot of things that went the consumers' way and that went the economies' way, not the least of which are energy prices. But even over the last few years, there's been some benefit from 10 million people being put back to work. And so as we get to end of 2015, those benefits that we've seen over the last couple of quarters, you look forward, are you going to see those in the future? Probably not. And so I made a comment last week that got picked up that we're assuming 2%. If you ask me to kind of handicap, is there more downside or upside to that, probably downside. But it's probably within a tight range of 2% is what our estimate is right now, Phil."

This is a new category. And so we're very, very new in this. And the performance continues to get better and better in the sales channel. Also, keep in mind that we don't even have the installation workforce up to speed on provisioning this. And so we're just getting the installation and workforce up. We just had the latest union contract gave us the rights we needed to push this out across our entire footprint. And so you're going to see us continue to get better and better there as well. 
As you pointed out, the satellite adds were strong in the fourth quarter, but U-verse churn offset that. So we're slightly negative in total. You'll see that relationship get better. And we're doing some things to shore up the U-verse base because we are focused on the satellite product. And so as a result, you're seeing U-verse churn up. We're doing some things to shore that up. It will improve, not the least of which we did some things on pricing to ensure that we can help begin to mitigate the U-verse churn. 
The other thing we did, and it's early, but I think we're going to see some not inconsequential impacts from this, is the unlimited offer for all of our TV customers. U-verse customers can now step in to an unlimited data offer. And this is a -- we think, a hugely retentive offer. It's a great value for our customers to have this type of offer put in front of them. So we think you'll see the U-verse churn get better. You'll see the subscriber numbers continue to improve as we move through 2016 and the sales channel improves, the provisioning channel improves. And then some of these offers I talked about, some unique offers that will be mobile-centric offers and some unique content available, we think those are going to continue to add momentum to this as well.

We continue to work on the cash flow opportunities we've been doing for a number of years. So those are all in already. That's not -- nothing new here. Secondly, with regard to bonus depreciation, we had told the community when we first gave our guidance that we were taking that into consideration, assuming that it would get passed, but we would meet that -- we would meet this guidance even if it didn't get passed. It has gotten passed. The one point I would make to everyone is that it's now 15 years our bonus depreciation has been in place. And so getting the bonus depreciation extended for 5 years and giving it to a turn [ph] is really important. But the creation of benefits from bonus depreciation is now being largely offset by the reversal of prior year's benefits that have been taken by taxpayers. So it's much more of a balancing item there. 
With regard to that, pressures on cash flow do not come from our pension. We have a pension contribution we'll make this year in about $200 million. But that's already been in the plan. That's the only thing that's required. Our pension plan's very well-funded. And then we do expect total tax payments to be up this year from a year over -- on a year-over-year basis. But as you know, from our prior year filings, our tax payments were rather modest last year. And so we would expect those to go up.

But we need some more time to make sure that we understand the momentum of that and the progress of that. 
Additionally, we're still going through the sales process of training our reps who never sold broadband, when they sold satellite before, or who sold broadband but never sold satellite before. And as Randall pointed out, they have to sell wireless so we have to increase all of their sales activities, whether in the stores or in the call centers. So all of this is going to take some time for us to really get a track record. I will tell you we're optimistic and pleased with the initial results.

With regard to any capital required for those integration costs, that's already included in the $22 billion of capital guidance. And from the expectation of integration costs, well, we have some, we haven't given guidance. I would suggest to you this way. If you think about what makes up our integration savings, our merger savings, content negotiation, staffing, supply chain, the costs to do that are not necessarily significant. It's just a matter of getting it done and doing the business. So I wouldn't expect those types of merger integration costs to be significant.

In terms of other or broader content ownership, there are a number of areas where we have, what I'll call, proprietary content. We own a number of regional sports networks. Some of those we acquired through the DIRECTV acquisition. Others, we've acquired over the course of the last year. We also have a lot of what I will call exclusive content, content that is produced by us, everything from the Dan Patrick Show to a particular network we have on DIRECTV and some series like Kingdom and so forth. And Simon, you should expect us to continue to engage at that level. And as we have success, you'll see us invest more in the areas where we have success. But right now, I think our plate is full doing full-scale integration of DIRECTV and bringing it into the mobility channel."

Like we said, we're expecting 10 million automobiles to roll off the floor between now and 2020 with our connectivity and just from Ford. You bring up an interesting point, and that is there is a massive used car fleet out there that is not connected. And there's actually technologies that are now available. I have a sports car, old sports car that I have now connected to the Internet. And it's actually a fairly elegant solution. And so there're some capabilities that we are putting into the market. In fact, we are selling into the market today to connect the used car fleet that is out on the U.S. roads. And we think that's important because the average age of a car on the road today is 11 years. And so if you really want to grow this business, you need to tap into the used car fleet. And so that's a priority for us, and you'll see us pursue that. 
On Mexico, and as it relates to the video opportunity, look, we're fairly convicted that mobile and video are going to be a category that's very, very relevant in the U.S. And we're early on here in the U.S. But based on early success, we continue to get more and more convicted that this is going to be an important category. Bringing the 2 together is going to be important. And if it's going to be important in the U.S., we think it will be important in other markets, and Mexico will be no different. As you know, we have a minority share position in the satellite company in Mexico. And hopefully, we'll be able to do some partnering there. But we do think the video combination with mobile is going to be important in all geographies and all markets."

With regard to our wireline footprint, we have about 60 million IP broadband-enabled customer locations from a consumer side. And we've got about 15 million IP broadband customers today. These are round numbers. The stat",587,"Mike, let me take a shot of this. With regard to our wireline footprint, we have about 60 million IP broadband-enabled customer locations from a consumer side. And we've got about 15 million IP broadband customers today. These are round numbers. The stat profile will give you the details. But with that, you can see that that's where our penetration right now has been at 25%. The key change here is the fact that we now have a national video product in DIRECTV and a satellite product and such that we didn't have that before. So many of our, if you will, broadband-capable locations didn't have a video offering, now they do. And so as we improve this single truck roll capability, this sales channel capability, all of that, we expect to grow that share. And you can -- we would expect that it would be a significant improvement over where we're at today. 
With regard to the expansion that we're doing now with regard to fiber, we are seeing very good results. And the ability to always have video available with the satellite product is going to prove, I think, to be very beneficial for us. So we will expand on that 60 million footprint over the next 4 years. And we will also get to some of it -- some of it will overlap, but we will get to 14 million fiber enabled and, quite frankly, there's a likelihood that we may get to more than that when we're finished. So that's the way to think about that footprint issue. 
With regard to the capital spend, you're right, we don't go into great detail on the capital spends. Because in our wireline and wireless footprint, we're an integrated carrier, the spends become overlapping, whether you're taking high-speed backhaul to a cell site or whether you're shipping wireless traffic or wireline traffic onto an IP backbone. But from a general perspective, in 2015, we spent probably about half of our capital in the wireless area, the other half in the wireline area. And if you will, the pair or the 2, the shared services area, I will tell you the pickup in the fourth quarter in part was due to Mexico and in part was due to the set-top box and the sales opportunities in DIRECTV. So I'll give you that way to think about that. And I think that'll be kind of a consistent story as we go through the current years. 
We are investing at a rampant rate in all of our businesses. And one thing about our wireless business is when you've got the tower network that we have today, the infrastructure that's been there and you have the spectrum holdings that we have today, you can do great things with quality service, or at least our network team can do great service and continue to meet all the needs. And you can be pretty effective with your capital spend. It's not a situation where there isn't investment. It's that much of this investment has been made over the last 3 years for the spectrum purchases, through the VIP project, putting extensive fiber into the ground and backhaul capabilities. And we're going to continue that, quite frankly, with GigaPower as we put more fiber near other cell sites that we can then get even better, high-quality backhaul. So it's a really integrated process but we -- needless to say, we continue to be very proud of the performance and continue to invest there."

So when you think about software-defined networking, as you think about the merger synergies from DIRECTV, $2.5 billion run rate of synergies. You think about all that's going on in just the core business, you call Project Agile, John does, where we're really just streamlining a lot of various operations, moving a lot of the customer interaction at their request to digital. There's -- the opportunity is really impressive to continue taking expense out of the business. I would tell you, if you look at just this quarter's results, it ought to give you some degree of comfort in terms of what's possible even in a company of our size and our scale. Whether it's Business Solutions segment, our Mobility segment, our entertainment group segment, consolidated, I mean, it was a clean sweep in terms of taking margins up. And we weren't taking them up 5 or 10 basis points, the margins really moved up considerably. And so we feel really good about the path we're on and the momentum we have on the cost side, of taking cost out of the business. 
On the capital spending side, this is a unique opportunity. We're at a place where a lot of things are converging in terms of maturity. That's going to create some incredible opportunities as we go forward. These item -- these ubiquitous high-speed mobile networks, I mean, they are here and they are ubiquitous. They're low latency. Combine that with cloud, combine that with data analytics capabilities that are available to the masses, right, I mean, the world of Big Data is here and it's available to everybody. And then sensors. The sensor technology, the ability to actually put in service sensors at virtually no -- I mean, the cost is nominal to put these sensors in place. Millions upon millions of these sensors, all of this, these 4 elements coming together at one time is a massive opportunity. And people not thinking about how to take advantage of ubiquitous mobility, high-speed and low-latency networks with cloud, with data analytics, with this sensor technology, are going to miss it. And we think we're at a place right now where we have a unique position on bringing all this together and creating growth. 
We're going to invest through this cycle. We're going to invest in video and making sure we can deliver video to our customers. We think that's going to be a huge opportunity and expanding our footprint into Mexico. I mean, all of these we're converging, we think to give us a growth platform for the next 4 or 5 years that is unique. So we're trying to be prudent. Our downward bias on an incremental basis of capital, we continue to emphasize that. We're being more and more efficient with our capital spend. 
John pointed out the implications of spectrum. Don't miss this. You deploy these 2x10 megahertz blocks of spectrum. The efficiencies it brings to building and operating mobile networks is significant. And we think we're in a very unique position in that regard, too. So I said in my opening comments and I'll say it again, our intention is to deliver over these networks the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit to deliver. That's our objective and that's the path we're headed down. So we feel good about being able to achieve that. So Tim, thanks for the question. 
And I also thank everybody for your participation on the call. We're off and running with the DIRECTV acquisition and Mexico. Those are going well. And we feel good about where we are as a business and looking forward to 2016. So thank you for your interest."

Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That's att.com/investor.relations. Let me to call your attention to the safe harbor statement. Before we begin, the Safe Harbor says that some of the comment today may be forward-looking and as such, subject to risks and uncertainties and results may differ materially. And addition information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website. 
Also want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum auction. So we cannot address any questions about spectrum today. 
Now before I hand the call over to John, let me quickly call your attention to slide 4. Slide 4 provides a consolidated financial summary. We had a very good first quarter at AT&T. First quarter consolidated revenues grew to $40.5 billion, largely due to the acquisition of DIRECTV, but we also saw growth in video and IP-based services on a comparable basis. This offset pressure from lower equipment sales, as well as foreign exchange. 
We continued our streak of double-digit adjusted EPS growth and after adjustments, and by the way, the adjustments included removing over $700 million of benefit from Spectrum swaps with other industry participants. And so with those adjustments, first quarter EPS was $0.72, up 10.8%. 
The strong growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. Margins also continue to do a great story. We saw consolidated margin growth with margin expansion in every domestic business segment. Operating cash flows were up more than $1 billion year-over-year with free cash flow of $3.2 billion, a 17% increase from a year ago. Capital investment is on plan, coming in at $4.7 billion. 
And so with that, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens."

Growth in strategic",2820,"Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thanks for being on the call. As Mike said, we turned in another solid financial performance. Revenues grew, margins expanded and we had our 4 straight quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Growth in strategic business services, IP broadband and video were big factors. And ad sales in our entertainment group is now more than a $1 billion in annualized revenues and growing. 
What makes our revenue results even more impressive is we did this with lower equipment sales and with more than $500 million of pressure in foreign exchange and with the ongoing pressure of exiting some of our marginal businesses. We're on track to reach a one rate of $1.5 billion in cost synergies from the DIRECTV deal. We're also taking cost out of the business and driving greater savings through efficiency initiatives, such as Project Agile, and transforming our network with software. This gives us the financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives such as our Mexico operations. 
At the same time, we are also executing on our commitments to transition and transform our business. We've been consistent on this for years. Transforming our smartphone base, transitioning from subsidies to equipment plans, moving our broadband base to IP and our legacy database to strategic services. We've done a lot of work, but we have a lot of more to do. Our video customers are shifting to satellite. We are moving our 2G customers on to our new LTE networks, and we are continuing to use bundling offers to take advantage of our integrated networks. All this makes us feel really good about our direction and the strong start to the year. 
We built a solid record of setting goals and achieving them. We're very confident that we will continue to do that and transform our business. Let's now take a look at our business operations starting with growth in our business solutions segment. Those details are on Slide 6. 
Solid wireless revenue gains drove overall growth in business and more than offset lower equipment sales and foreign exchange pressure. Total business solution revenues were up slightly with business wireless revenues up 2.3%, reflecting smartphone and tablet gains, as well as more customers on lower churn business plans. Margins also continue their growth trend. EBITDA margins were up more -- EBITDA was up more than $300 million as cost reductions added to our revenue gains. Margins grew to 38.7, up 180 basis points year-over-year, thanks to a focused performance by the entire team. 
Looking at our customer segments and business, all retail customer segments showed growth and our wholesale business is on plan even though revenues were pressured. Legacy data continues to migrate to our IP strategic business services. Total wireline data grew slightly in the quarter and is now about 60% of wireline business revenues. Driving that growth is strategic services. 
Revenue grew by nearly $250 million over last year's first quarter, that's up 9.3%. And if you adjusted for foreign exchange, growth has exceeded 10%. Strategic business services are now more than $11 billion in annualized revenues. 
We are also are seeing continued demand for highly secure mobile business solutions. Security continues to be the top of the mind for our business customers. Every enterprise must rethink its place in today's connected world. We are managing highly secure networks given our unique experience and our ability to provide business solutions sets us apart, and we intend to be very active in this space. 
Now let's move to our entertainment group results on Slide 7. As a reminder, our entertainment group provides video, broadband and phone services to residential customers. On a reported basis, entertainment group revenues showed strong growth due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. However, if you look at the results adjusted to include prior year DIRECTV on a comparative basis, revenue still grew by more than 3%, as IP, video and advertising revenue growth outpaced legacy service declines. 
Our high-speed Internet service grew by more than $250 million and now generates more than $7 billion in annualized revenue. And we are seeing solid growth with our ad sales, which are now more than $1 billion in annualized revenues and going strong. 
At the same time, we against our exceptional margin exception, which points directly to the profitable in the benefits of the merger. Our EBITDA margins nearly doubled year-over-year. 
Taking a look at our metrics, satellite net adds continue to be strong and as we added more than 300,000 in the quarter. Total entertainment group broad-based net adds were positive in the quarter, driven by a 186,000 IP broadband subscribers. We've done a great job transitioning our broadband base to IP, and that transition is nearly complete. About 95% of the eligible broadband subs now have IP broadband. Half of these customers choose higher speeds, which help drive the 16% revenue growth in IP broadband. 
We also made several strategic moves in the quarter as a premier integrated communications company. We announced our new DIRECTV streaming services in the first quarter. We are actively working the deals for these new services, and we are on our target for launch in the second half of the year. And Fullscreen's ad free subscription service launched today. Fullscreen is majority owned by Otter Media, a partnership between AT&T and The Turning Group. AT&T has signed on as of the premier launch sponsor for the new service and will collaborate with Fullscreen to market and promote to service with special offers for AT&T's more than 100 million video mobile and broadband customers. 
We are also seeing our broadband pay-TV go up. The attach rate of DTV sales with broadband in our wireline footprint have increased 50% since last summer. And in GigaPower areas, the attach rate improvement is even greater. 
Our new unlimited wireless with video offer started fast and continues at a solid pace. More than 3 million wireless subscribers signed up for this plan at the end of the first quarter with thousands more being added every day, due to some of our highest ARPU subscribers, who are even more valuable to us now that they have combined these services. Our entertainment group team is performing well on every level. Merger integration, cross-selling, special bundle offers, advertising and now streaming services. But the second half of the year is when our integration efforts really take hold. Single truck rolls, cross-selling a new product rollouts are just beginning to take off. We're on track with all our targets and we're very excited about what is to come. 
Now let's move to our U.S. mobility results on Slide 8. And as a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are now divided between the business solution and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations. We continue to see margin expansion and stabilizing service revenues in the quarter. Service revenues were stable year-over-year, thanks in part to having completed most of the transition to the Mobile Share Value we plans, as well as adding new customers while overall wireless revenues were down slightly due to lower equipment sales. We've changed the game with our equipment installment plans. We started the transition more than 2 years ago with Next and are substantially through that transition. Our strategy is working, and you can see it in our results. Our laser-focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove our best ever first quarter wireless EBITDA margins.
Wireless EBITDA increased more than $600 million when compared to the first -- to the year ago first quarter. And wireless service EBITDA margin came in at 49.5%, its best quarter ever. Phone-only ARPU, plus Next billing, continued its strong growth. This offer was up more than 5% year-over-year and also up sequentially. Nearly half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, more than 70% of postpaid smartphone subscribers are on a no-device-subsidy plan. 
During the quarter, we discontinued the availability of subsidized phones for most subscribers. This will drive continued growth in the no subsidy model. In fact, 90% of postpaid smartphone sales and upgrades were on AT&T Next or BYOD. Our branded percentage is even higher. 
Now let's look at wireless net adds. During the first quarter, AT&T posted a net increase of 2.3 million total net adds, our best first quarter ever. That includes 1.8 million domestic wireless subs. Net adds were driven by connected devices, branded phones and tablets. Branded domestic net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up more than 600,000, thanks to strength in prepaid that included 137,000 branded phone net adds. And when you include Mexico, we had nearly 1.2 million branded net adds in our wireless operations and more than 700,000 branded phone net adds. 
Cricket continues to be a great option for of value focused customers. We had 500,000 prepaid net adds in the quarter and nearly 1 million prepaid net adds when you include Mexico. Our ARPU for the new prepaid Cricket subs continues to run about $41. That compares to feature phones ARPU of about $35. Feature phones make up the bulk of our postpaid phone losses. And the Cricket momentum continues to grow. We expanded our Cricket distribution to Best Buy and errands locations. Crickets will be available in more than 12,000 outlets across the country. We also just introduced a new Cricket unlimited plan, including talk, text and data, for $65 a month with auto pay and no hidden fees. 
We had 1.6 million connected device net adds matching our best ever net add quarter. We now have nearly 28 million of these devices on our network, and we are laying the foundation for future growth. In the first quarter, we also continue to grow our high-value smartphone base. We added 1.1 million branded smartphones during the quarter. More than 95% of our postpaid phone sales in the quarter were smartphones and nearly 90% of our postpaid phone base has smartphones. Total churn was essentially stable year-over-year. 
On a related note, we are moving forward with our previously announced shutdown of our legacy 2G network. We plan on decommissioning it by the end of the year. We have taken steps to migrate our 2G customer base and expect most to take this transition. We expect to continue to see manageable pressure in the last half of the year from subscribers, mostly connected devices choosing not to make this migration. 
While this might have a slight impact on revenues, we also see the cost benefits from shutting down the network, and the Spectrum will be redeployed to help meet the growing data demand of our customer base. 
Now let's look at our international operation. That information is on Slide 10. We continue the hard work and heavy lifting to make our Mexico wireless operations world-class. That includes deploying a 4G LTE network, integrating operations and support services and rebranding to the AT&T name. The team is doing a great job with all of this. Even more impressive, they're adding customers at the same time. 
We added more than 500,000 wireless subscribers in the first quarter and nearly 1.1 million in the last 6 months. That brings our total subscriber count to 9.2 million. 
Rebranding is also gaining steam. We've launched nationwide advertising. Rebranding in Mexico City is nearly complete. Our LTE deployment now reaches 51 million people. In just a year, we're more than halfway to reaching our commitment to deploy LTE to 100 million POPs by the end of 2018. 
And we're also on target to reach 75 million POPs by the end of this year. First quarter revenue reflects seasonally low equipment sales, as well as the impact to foreign exchange as we successfully continue to execute our strategy. In Latin America, our video operations continue to show solid revenue growth on a local currency basis. But foreign exchange rate significantly impacted our published results. 
Revenues are being handled by a challenging economy, subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds. But foreign exchange also impacted lower company expenses. We didn't see sequential profitability trends in the quarter and continue to expect self-sustaining cash flow for the year. 
Now let's move to consolidated margins on Slide 11.
Consolidated margins reflect overall strength of our business. EBITDA margins were slightly up and adjusted consolidated operating margin came in at 19.9% in the quarter. That was 110 basis point improvement over the year ago first quarter. 
Strong margin expansion in our domestic segments more than offset nearly 90 basis points of margin pressure from our growth initiatives in Mexico. Our drive to have the best industry cost structure also is continuing on track. Efficiency initiatives and our software transformation are driving productivity gains and expense savings. On a comparable basis, our expenses were down more than $300 million year-over-year, driven by excess cost efficiencies, automation efforts and service delivery, IT rationalization and software savings. We also continue to see lower call volumes and improvements in cycle times for our efforts to improve the sales experience. 
During the quarter, we also eliminate subsidized phones for most of our postpaid customers. This should sustain further margin improvement even though most of our smartphone base is already off the subsidy model. 
Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We're confident we can continue to expand domestic margins and cut costs to offset pressure while in the investment cycle in Mexico. And we expect Mexico to improve its profitability late in the year. 
Cash flows were another strong story. Let's take a look at the results on Slide 12. Along with solid earnings and margins, we also continue to deliver strong cash flow growth. In the first quarter, cash from operations was nearly $8 billion, up 17% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $3.2 billion, also a 17% increase from the year ago first quarter. The strong free cash flow growth comes even with more than $1 billion of pressure from timing of fourth quarter payables. With these first quarter results, we're on track to meet guidance and on plan to grow free cash flow for the year. 
We continue to find ample demand in the great rates in the securitization market to help us drive next receivables. We received about $1.5 billion in the first quarter from amount as last year's first quarter. Capital investments totaled $4.7 billion for the quarter. Wireless CapEx is down slightly from the fourth quarter. When we accelerated purchases of equipment, it captures significant savings. On average, wireless CapEx was about $2.2 billion for the last 2 quarters. But not captured in those costs are our investments in shared infrastructure. For example, running fiber to the cell site, but also using that fiber connection for our business wireline services. Shared infrastructure is about half of our non-wireless spending and is one of the benefits from our integrated network carrier strategy
With our industry best cell density and balanced Spectrum portfolio, we're adding wireless capacity far more effectively and efficiently than anyone in the industry. Our virtualization and software-defined network are already delivering material CapEx savings. We will be adding 2.5x more capacity at 75% of the capital cost compared to just a few years ago. 
In our other uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio declined to 2.27x. And during the quarter, we successfully exchanged $16 billion of DIRECTV debt and issued $6 billion of debt at very reasonable rates. We ended the quarter with $10 billion in cash and short-term investments, giving us the flexibility and financial strength to manage the overall needs of our business. 
Before we get to your questions, let me close with a quick recap of the quarter on Slide 13. The first quarter demonstrated our ability to deliver strong, consistent results as we execute the strategy we've laid out for you. Our approach has been methodical. Our results have been consistent. We again grew revenues, expanded margins and delivered double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Our DIRECTV integration continues to go smoothly and we're on track to deliver a run rate $1.5 billion or more in cost synergies by the end of this year. We're also providing the first one for what it means to be the premier integrated commit communications carrier in the world with our integrated offers and streaming plans. 
Our business solutions segment continued to outperform the market through strategic service revenue gains and margin expansion. Wireless again had record margins, growing phone-only plus next ARPU and had strong growth with its Cricket prepaid platform. 
And Mexico wireless is fast becoming an emerging growth story as we quickly build that business and expand our North American 4G LTE network. We're convinced our strategy is working and our momentum is strong. I'm proud of what we've accomplished this quarter and even more excited about what lies ahead. With that, let's get to your questions."

So we're really optimistic about being competitive. With that being said, we are still viewing the Cricket and the prepaid platform as a very viable, profitable long-term strategy. We believe it gives us an entrée into the market that is significant and as you can see, generating great results. We are seeing continued improvement in service revenues. You saw it, as you can see in the first quarter, and in ARPUs. So we're very positive about that. We believe there's real opportunity to continue that. But we'll continue to worry about performing first and predicting it afterwards. But we are optimistic. We like what we see.

We're getting those from new contract negotiations, as well, quite frankly, is the fact that our base has shifted more to DTV and we get that to the existing contracts. Two, we got a lot of it from kind of a headquarters advertising with the traditional things you find with headquarter companies merging together. Those savings and professional fees and contractors and consulting fee savings, we're getting that. And then we're seeing some savings, and we expect to see more as we go through, not only on the expense side, but on the cash flow side from aligning vendor contracts, best price of both companies contracts and best payment terms. So those are what's underway. We've been at this almost 9 months now or a little over 9 months and it's going relatively well. We're encouraged not only that we're going to meet the $1.5 billion run rate, but that we had the opportunity to exceed it. So that piece, David. I think the first thing on the 3 million unlimited, those are the customers that are buying video from us. Many of those customers, most of those customers were already buying video products from us. So you can imagine when they buy the video, when they buy wireless, often buy the broadband. These are some very high ARPU customers and customers that are very valuable long-term to us. And so giving them this opportunity to use our services anytime anyplace where there's little work is very positive for them and creates, not only satisfaction for them, but also high value for us. It also has added some video customers. We have been able to use those as an opportunity to add video customers further -- for the wireless customers who want to get those opportunity. Secondly, when we're still in the learning stage of it, but we are still finding that 80% of our video traffic or some number like that is on WiFi or gets offloaded very quickly. So while the impact is convenience for the customers, so far, it looks like it's going to be manageable exercise for us. We are continuing to evaluate it, and we're going to continue to learn. But the common place where people use this video still allows us to have WiFi supplement for it. And that is providing us some measure of opportunity for success. But the real issue is when customers are paying us for all those services, it makes real sense. We can really be comfortable with offering the unlimited. And so far, it's working well."

I'm not going to make any comments with regard to that. Our overall Spectrum plan, though, as you all know, we started VIPs some years ago and put in a lot of fiber in the ground and put LTE nationwide. It was our effort to have a network and particularly, a wireless network that had extremely strong backhaul capability and will be built in a manage such that we could upgrade the technology rather easily as new technologies came along. With regard to having that network, it is a very dense network with macro towers. And as such, we're now in a position that with our 40 megahertz with WCS and AWS-3 spectrum, we're now in a position of taking that spectrum and rolling it out and putting it to use over top of this very high-quality dense fiber, which network that we've already built. That allows us to deal with the capacity needs of our business for a long period of time and continue to then position us as appropriate to do software upgrades as we move onto the next group of technologies. So we feel very -- in a very good position and feel like the overall strategies that we start with some years ago with Project VIP and getting the 300 million LTE POPs out there and getting a fiber rich backbone of their to support the backhaul where the right decisions that are really paying off with those, as well as of the decisions we made to buy the WCS and buy the AWS 3 spectrum. They're really, the value for us in a very significant way. With regard to the Latin America, as we mentioned in our comments, we've mentioned before, tough environment by the team down there, we have been impressed with. We're operating very well. Brazil, it's a challenging environment, and both economically and politically. But the team is performing quite well and in the overall profitability is impressing us for management team to be able to operate in that that environment and previous the results there are. We're focused not on customer got, but on profitable growth and quality. And quite frankly, we are reasonably encouraged by the change on some of the exchange rate. If you look at where the Brazil real is today, a little closer to 3.5. If you look at where the Argentine peso is 14.5. And even the most -- even some improvements, quite frankly, and in Mexico, in the peso coming down. We're starting to see some light. It's very early. And so we'll continue to work very hard to improve operating results and we'll flexibility with it. But we are impressed with the teams there. We're going to keep working hard to make it the best business we can."

But what I also think is, if you will, the BYOD aspect of our business. We've seen significant increases in those numbers since we started the equipment install plan, the next program. So I think there were a lot of phones that were very -- still very operable, very good shape that we're in, part frankly, that were idle in the drawer, so to speak. And I think we've seen the reuse of those funds extensively. We've seen our BYOD numbers grow from 90, 80, to 90,000 a quarter some years ago to 400,000 or more in a quarter. So I think your point on that is best exemplified our best described by that. That's being said, I think when consumers get the choice and understand that they are making spending decisions with their money, they're going to be very efficient. Last, I think that our -- it's a fluid market and there's, quite frankly, developing a lot of quality, lower-cost handsets. We're seeing that really in our prepaid business extensively, where there's a lot of good quality smartphones that are much lower per unit cost. All of those things are impacting the marketplace. And are impacting our group and revenues, but there impacting our covenant rate expenses. And as both of those goes up, we certainly are striving to get have the opportunity to have the customer continue to reinvest some of those savings in our services. And we'll strive to continue to do that. And we'll see how that plays out. In the first quarter, we did have good, good solid performance in our wireless service revenues. We are actually encouraged by that."

I think -- but you were looking at the cash flow statement and you were looking at that change and accounts payable's is about a $1.8 billion impact last year for the first quarter, about a $4 billion impact this year. And you're looking at the right numbers. The reason of that increase was twofold. We have the opportunity to invest a lot of CapEx, a lot of equipment and a lot of the inventory. In the fourth quarter, had very good prices and rate and satisfying contractual commitment, and those things turn around and get paid for in the first quarter. With that being said, we think that's the timing item, but we don't think we have a permanent impact in for the year. It will just rumors out as we go through. So that's it.  We bought out some inventory, enhance of that with other items, and we made to investments in equipment. And so that's the aspect of it. That's why we are encouraged of our free cash flow, not only mean guidance, but actually growing year-over-year. Secondly, the 3 million subs are mostly existing sobs. And initial times where that many of them brought, not only their device handsets, but their tablets with them and there was some positive impact for those who did bring those tablet. We are encouraged by that. We're optimistic about that, but we're going to be very patient and careful about that to see how that plays out. We didn't know get some new video customers out of this. And I won't suggest it was a significant amount of the $3 million, but we did some good ones and we're also encourage from that and we're learning from that to find out how we might be able to make that a more -- grow that addition of video customers even more through these types of offerings. So positive on both ends to your questions."

With regard to the 2G commission, one item I want to make sure straightforward with is as the volume of data traffic or volume of traffic on the wireless network has gone down from 2G devices, we have been, if you will, taking parts of that spectrum and repurposing it as we go. So in some markets, we may only have a 2 by 5 slice of spectrum left to repurpose. So we've been doing that if you will, so to speak ratably or as we go as we've been able to free up spectrum. So there is more spectrum to free up. I don't have this specific numbers of out of my disposal here, Simon. But I would tell you, even with that, there still is a lot of costs that are left just to operate even a piece of the 2G network. And so we're anxious to capture that savings and use it to continue a strong EBITDA story for our wireless business and a story that's coming from good quality network operations and efficiency."

With regard to U-verse and DIRECTV, it's really the focus. It hasn't been so much about cannibalization asset is that the sales channel has been focused seeing on selling DTV's satellite service. The reason is it's because it's a lower cost structure. We can get, if you will, the content synergies savings by adding the customer there. And so that's really what's going on. It's not so much of a cannibalization or a  concerted effort, if you will, to shift its more of getting the new customers on DTV.

We're not going to give specific guidance on customer accounts in Mexico, but we are excited about the progress we made. And certainly, when you got 2 quarters in a row growing customers at this level, you want to keep that momentum going. I think the more important aspect on Mexico is this. One, we do expect that the end of this year will have 75 million of the population covered with LTE. That will probably total North American footprint to well over 3 90. So we'll be at essentially 400 million possibly by the end of this year. But certainly by 2018, on a North American footprint. That growth in LTE POPs then gives you the opportunity to expand your sales in other markets. Including in that is launching additional markets with an effective market strategy, where we not only have the network, but we also have customer care, customer service, the AT&T brand and acceptable distribution. And we will continue to grow that effective marketplace. We've got, if you will, markets launched of about 42 in Mexico today, and we expect it to be up 160 by the end of the year. So you can see that getting the LTE to 75 million POPs and getting the customer care service and getting the distribution at the same level is going to provide us a much greater opportunity than we have today and will give us some time to establish ourselves in those markets that we've just joined. So you can understand why we're optimistic about it and that we believe that the team is on the right track in doing that. It's a long-term investment for us. We believe highly in the market, and we think it's a natural addition to our North American operations, not only for wireless, but also for our business opportunities.

Of course, I need to call your attention to the safe harbor statement before we begin. The Safe Harbor says that some of the comments today may be forward-looking and as such, subject to risks and uncertainties. And results may differ materially.

Also I want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction, so we cannot address any questions about spectrum today. 
Now before I hand the call over to John, let me quickly call your attention to Slide 4. Slide 4 provides a consolidated financial summary. We had a very good first quarter at AT&T. First quarter consolidated revenues grew to $40.5 billion, largely due to the acquisition of DIRECTV, but we also saw growth in video and IP-based services on a comparable basis. This offset pressure from lower equipment sales as well as foreign exchange. 
We continued our streak of double-digit adjusted EPS growth and after adjustments -- and by the way, the adjustments included removing over $700 million of benefit from spectrum swaps with other industry participants. And so with those adjustments, first quarter EPS was $0.72, up 10.8%. The strong growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. 
Margins also continue to be a great story. We saw a consolidated margin growth, with margin expansion in every domestic business segment. Operating cash flows were up more than $1 billion year-over-year, with free cash flow of $3.2 billion, a 17% increase from a year ago. Capital investment is on plan, coming in at $4.7 billion. 
And so with that, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens."

Growth in strategic",2811,"Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thanks for being on the call. As Mike said, we turned in another solid financial performance. Revenues grew, margins expanded and we had our 4 straight quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Growth in strategic business services, IP broadband and video were big factors. And ad sales in our entertainment group is now more than a $1 billion in annualized revenues and growing. 
What makes our revenue results even more impressive is we did this with lower equipment sales and with more than $500 million of pressure in foreign exchange and with the ongoing pressure of exiting some of our marginal businesses. We're on track to reach a run rate of $1.5 billion in cost synergies from the DIRECTV deal. We're also taking cost out of the business and driving greater savings through efficiency initiatives, such as Project Agile, and transforming our network with software. This gives us the financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives, such as our Mexico operations. 
At the same time, we are also executing on our commitments to transition and transform our business. We've been consistent on this for years. Transforming our smartphone base, transitioning from subsidies to equipment plans, moving our broadband base to IP and our legacy database to strategic services. We've done a lot of work, but we have a lot of more to do. Our video customers are shifting to satellite. We are moving our 2G customers onto our new LTE networks, and we are continuing to use bundling offers to take advantage of our integrated networks. All this makes us feel really good about our direction and the strong start to the year. We built a solid record of setting goals and achieving them. We're very confident that we will continue to do that and transform our business. 
Let's now take a look at our business operations, starting with growth in our Business Solutions segment. Those details are on Slide 6. Solid wireless revenue gains drove overall growth in business and more than offset lower equipment sales and foreign exchange pressure. Total Business Solution revenues were up slightly, with business wireless revenues up 2.3%, reflecting smartphone and tablet gains as well as more customers on lower churn business plans. 
Margins also continue their growth trend. EBITDA margins were up more -- EBITDA was up more than $300 million as cost reductions added to our revenue gains. Margins grew to 38.7%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, thanks to a focused performance by the entire team. 
Looking at our customer segments in business, all retail customer segments showed growth, and our wholesale business is on plan even though revenues were pressured. Legacy data continues to migrate to our IP strategic business services. Total wireline data grew slightly in the quarter and is now about 60% of wireline business revenues. Driving that growth is strategic services. 
Revenue grew by nearly $250 million over last year's first quarter, that's up 9.3%. And if you adjust it for foreign exchange, growth was exceeded 10%. Strategic business services are now more than $11 billion in annualized revenues. 
We also are seeing continued demand for highly secure mobile business solutions. Security continues to be the top of the mind for our business customers. Every enterprise must rethink its place in today's connected world. We are managing highly secure networks given our unique experience, and our ability to provide business solutions sets us apart, and we intend to be very active in this space. 
Now let's move to our Entertainment Group results on Slide 7. As a reminder, our Entertainment Group provides video, broadband and phone services to residential customers. On a reported basis, Entertainment Group revenues showed strong growth due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. However, if you look at the results adjusted to include prior year DIRECTV on a comparative basis, revenue still grew by more than 3% as IP, video and advertising revenue growth outpaced legacy service declines. 
Our high-speed Internet service grew by more than $250 million and now generates more than $7 billion in annualized revenue. And we are seeing solid growth with our ad sales, which are now more than $1 billion in annualized revenues and going strong. At the same time, we again saw exceptional margin expansion, which points directly to the profitability benefits of the merger. Our EBITDA margins nearly doubled year-over-year. 
Taking a look at our metrics, satellite net adds continue to be strong as we added more than 300,000 in the quarter. Total Entertainment Group broadband net adds were positive in the quarter, driven by a 186,000 IP broadband subscribers. We've done a great job transitioning our broadband base to IP, and that transition is nearly complete. About 95% of the eligible broadband subs now have IP broadband. Half of these customers choose higher speeds, which help drive the 16% revenue growth in IP broadband. 
We also made several strategic moves in the quarter as a premier integrated communications company. We announced our new DIRECTV streaming services in the first quarter. We are actively working the content deals for these new services, and we are on target for launch in the second half of the year. And Fullscreen's ad free subscription service launched today. Fullscreen is majority owned by Otter Media, a partnership between AT&T and the Chernin Group. AT&T has signed on as the premier launch sponsor for the new service and will collaborate with Fullscreen to market and promote the service with special offers for AT&T's more than 100 million video, mobile and broadband customers. 
We are also seeing our broadband [indiscernible] DTV go up. The attach rate of DTV sales with broadband in our wireline footprint have increased 50% since last summer. And in GigaPower areas, the attach rate improvement is even greater. 
Our new unlimited wireless with video offer started fast and continues at a solid pace. More than 3 million wireless subscribers signed up for this plan at the end of the first quarter, with thousands more being added every day, due to some of our highest ARPU subscribers, who are even more valuable to us now that they have combined these services. 
Our Entertainment Group team is performing well on every level. Merger integration, cross-selling, special bundle offers, advertising and now streaming services. But the second half of the year is when our integration efforts really take hold. Single-truck rolls, cross-selling and new product rollouts are just beginning to take off. We're on track with all our targets, and we're very excited about what is to come. 
Now let's move to our U.S. mobility results on Slide 8. And as a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are now divided between the business solution and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing supplemental information for its total U.S. Wireless operations. We continue to see margin expansion and stabilizing service revenues in the quarter. Service revenues were stable year-over-year, thanks in part to having completed most of the transition to the Mobile Share Value plans as well as adding new customers, while overall wireless revenues were down slightly due to lower equipment sales. 
We've changed the game with our equipment installment plans. We started the transition more than 2 years ago with Next and are substantially through that transition. Our strategy is working, and you can see it in our results. Our laser focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove our best-ever first quarter wireless EBITDA margins.
Wireless EBITDA increased more than $600 million when compared to the first -- to the year ago first quarter. And wireless service EBITDA margin came in at 49.5%, its best quarter ever. Phone-only ARPU, plus Next billing, continued its strong growth. This ARPU was up more than 5% year-over-year and also up sequentially. Nearly half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next. More than 70% of postpaid smartphone subscribers are on a no-device-subsidy plan. 
During the quarter, we discontinued the availability of subsidized phones for most subscribers. This will drive continued growth in the no-subsidy model. In fact, 90% of postpaid smartphone sales and upgrades were on AT&T Next or BYOD. Our branded percentage is even higher. 
Now let's look at wireless net adds. During the first quarter, AT&T posted a net increase of 2.3 million total net adds, our best first quarter ever. That includes 1.8 million domestic wireless subs. Net adds were driven by connected devices, branded phones and tablets. Branded domestic net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up more than 600,000, thanks to the strength in prepaid that included 137,000 branded phone net adds. And when you include Mexico, we had nearly 1.2 million branded net adds in our wireless operations and more than 700,000 branded phone net adds. 
Cricket continues to be a great option for our value-focused customers. We had 500,000 prepaid net adds in the quarter and nearly 1 million prepaid net adds when you include Mexico. Our ARPU for the new prepaid Cricket subs continues to run about $41. That compares to feature phones ARPU of about $35. Feature phones make up the bulk of our postpaid phone losses. And the Cricket momentum continues to grow. We expanded our Cricket distribution to Best Buy and Aaron's locations. Crickets will be available in more than 12,000 outlets across the country. 
We also just introduced a new Cricket unlimited plan, including talk, text and data, for $65 a month with Auto Pay and no hidden fees. We had 1.6 million connected device net adds, matching our best-ever net add quarter. We now have nearly 28 million of these devices on our network, and we are laying the foundation for future growth. 
In the first quarter, we also continue to grow our high-value smartphone base. We added 1.1 million branded smartphones during the quarter. More than 95% of our postpaid phone sales in the quarter were smartphones, and nearly 90% of our postpaid phone base has smartphones. Total churn was essentially stable year-over-year. 
On a related note, we are moving forward with our previously announced shutdown of our legacy 2G network. We plan on decommissioning it by the end of the year. We have taken steps to migrate our 2G customer base and expect most to take this transition. We expect to continue to see manageable pressure in the last half of the year from subscribers, mostly connected devices, choosing not to make this migration. While this might have a slight impact on revenues, we also see the cost benefits from shutting down the network, and the spectrum will be redeployed to help meet the growing data demand of our customer base. 
Now let's look at our international operation. That information is on Slide 10. We continue the hard work and heavy lifting to make our Mexico wireless operations world-class. That includes deploying a 4G LTE network, integrating operations and support services and rebranding to the AT&T name. The team is doing a great job with all of this. Even more impressive, they're adding customers at the same time. We added more than 500,000 wireless subscribers in the first quarter and nearly 1.1 million in the last 6 months. That brings our total subscriber count to 9.2 million. 
Rebranding is also gaining steam. We've launched nationwide advertising. Rebranding in Mexico City is nearly complete. Our LTE deployment now reaches 51 million people. In just a year, we're more than halfway to reaching our commitment to deploy LTE to 100 million POPs by the end of 2018. And we're also on target to reach 75 million POPs by the end of this year. 
First quarter revenue reflects seasonally low equipment sales as well as the impact of foreign exchange as we successfully continue to execute our strategy. In Latin America, our video operations continue to show solid revenue growth on a local currency basis. But foreign exchange rate significantly impacted our published results. 
Revenues are being handled by a challenging economy. Subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds. But foreign exchange also impacted lower company expenses. We didn't see sequential profitability trends in the quarter and continue to expect self-sustaining cash flow for the year. 
Now let's move to consolidated margins on Slide 11.
Consolidated margins reflect the overall strength of our business. EBITDA margins were slightly up, and adjusted consolidated operating income margin came in at 19.9% in the quarter. That was 110 basis point improvement over the year ago first quarter. 
Strong margin expansion in our domestic segments more than offset nearly 90 basis points of margin pressure from our growth initiatives in Mexico. Our drive to have the industry-best cost structure also is continuing on track. Efficiency initiatives and our software transformation are driving productivity gains and expense savings. On a comparable basis, our expenses were down more than $300 million year-over-year, driven by excess cost efficiencies, automation efforts in service delivery, IT rationalization and software savings. We also continue to see lower call volumes and improvements in cycle times for our efforts to improve the sales experience. 
During the quarter, we also eliminate subsidized phones for most of our postpaid customers. This should sustain further margin improvement, even though most of our smartphone base is already off the subsidy model. 
Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We're confident we can continue to expand domestic margins and cut costs to offset pressure while in the investment cycle in Mexico. And we expect Mexico to improve its profitability late in the year. 
Cash flows were another strong story. Let's take a look at the results on Slide 12. Along with solid earnings and margins, we also continue to deliver strong cash flow growth. In the first quarter, cash from operations was nearly $8 billion, up 17% year-over-year; and free cash flow was $3.2 billion, also a 17% increase from the year ago first quarter. The strong free cash flow growth comes even with more than $1 billion of pressure from timing of fourth quarter payables. With these first quarter results, we're on track to meet guidance and on plan to grow free cash flow for the year. 
We continue to find ample demand and great rates in the securitization market to help us manage our Next receivables. We received about $1.5 billion in the first quarter from amount as last year's first quarter. Capital investments totaled $4.7 billion for the quarter. Wireless CapEx is down slightly from the fourth quarter. When we accelerated purchases of equipment, it captures significant savings. On average, wireless CapEx was about $2.2 billion for the last 2 quarters. 
But not captured in those costs are our investments in shared infrastructure. For example, running fiber to the cell site, but also using that fiber connection for our business wireline services. Shared infrastructure is about half of our nonwireless spending and is one of the benefits from our integrated network carrier strategy.
With our industry-best cell density and balanced spectrum portfolio, we're adding wireless capacity far more effectively and efficiently than anyone in the industry. Our virtualization and software-defined networks are already delivering material CapEx savings. We'll be adding 2.5x more capacity at 75% of the capital cost compared to just a few years ago. 
In our other uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio declined to 2.27x. And during the quarter, we successfully exchanged $16 billion of DIRECTV debt and issued $6 billion of debt at very reasonable rates. We ended the quarter with $10 billion in cash and short-term investments, giving us the flexibility and financial strength to manage the overall needs of our business. 
Before we get to your questions, let me close with a quick recap of the quarter on Slide 13. The first quarter demonstrated our ability to deliver strong, consistent results as we execute the strategy we've laid out for you. Our approach has been methodical. Our results have been consistent. We again grew revenues, expanded margins and delivered double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Our DIRECTV integration continues to go smoothly, and we're on track to deliver a run rate, $1.5 billion or more in cost synergies by the end of this year. We are also providing the first glimpse of what it means to be the premier integrated communications carrier in the world with our integrated offers and streaming plans. 
Our Business Solutions segment continued to outperform the market with strategic service revenue gains and margin expansion. Wireless again had record margins, growing phone-only, plus Next ARPU, and had strong growth with its Cricket prepaid platform. 
And Mexico wireless is fast becoming an emerging growth story as we quickly build that business and expand our North American 4G LTE network. 
We're convinced our strategy is working and our momentum is strong. I'm proud of what we've accomplished this quarter and even more excited about what lies ahead. 
With that, let's get to your questions."

One, our strategies with regard to the overall business but including our phone market is really on this integrated carrier strategy. So as we roll out these products that we can combine our video and our mobility and our broadband, and as we see these values added to the customers, we're optimistic we're going to be able to continue to improve our business. One other point I'll make to you too is, with these kinds of margins and these kinds of expansions in margins, it gives us the flexibility and, quite frankly, it grows the universe of customers that are long-term value-creating customers for us with these new margin standards that the team has set. So we're really optimistic about being competitive. With that being said, we are still viewing the Cricket and the prepaid platform as a very viable, profitable long-term strategy. We believe it gives us an entrée into the market that is significant and, as you can see, generating great results. We are seeing continued improvement in service revenues, you saw it, as you can see in the first quarter, and in ARPUs. So we're very positive about that. We believe there's real opportunity to continue that. But we'll continue to worry about performing first and predicting it afterwards. But we are optimistic. We like what we see. We like what happened when we combined the video and wireless offerings. And a number of customers, for example, that not only added their phones, but added their tablets to the program, that was very encouraging. So we're really optimistic."

We're getting those from new content -- contract negotiations as well, quite frankly, as the fact that our base has shifted more to DTV and we get that from the existing contracts. Two, we got a lot of it from our kind of the headquarters, advertising, the traditional things you find with headquarter companies merging together. Those savings and professional fees and contractors and consulting fee savings, we're getting that. And then we're seeing some savings, and we expect to see more as we go through, not only on the expense side, but on the cash flow side from aligning vendor contracts, best price of both companies' contracts and best payment terms. So those are what's underway. We've been at this almost 9 months now or a little over 9 months, and it's going relatively well. We're encouraged, not only that we're going to meet the $1.5 billion run rate, but that we had the opportunity to exceed it. So that piece, David. I think the first thing on the 3 million unlimited, those are the customers that are buying video from us. Many of those customers, most of those customers were already a buying video product from us. So you can imagine when they buy the video, when they buy wireless, often buy the broadband. These are some very high ARPU customers and customers that are very valuable long term to us. And so giving them this opportunity to use our services anytime, anyplace, where they live and work, is very positive for them and creates, not only satisfaction for them, but also high value for us. It also has added some video customers. We have been able to use this as an opportunity to add video customers further, for the wireless customers who want to get this opportunity. Secondly, when -- we're still in the learning stage of it, but we are still finding that 80% of our video traffic or some number like that is on WiFi or gets offloaded very quickly. So while the impact is convenience for the customers, so far, it looks like it's going to be a manageable exercise for us. We are continuing to evaluate it, and we're going to continue to learn. But the common place where people use this video still allows us to have WiFi supplement for it, and that is providing us some measure of opportunity for success. But the real issue is when customers are paying us for all those services, it makes real sense. We can really be comfortable with offering the unlimited. And so far, it's working well."

As you've seen, we've got software-defined networks, which are really driving the opportunity to, if you will, reduce capital cost and reduce cash operating expenses from the ability to eliminate truck rolls and other installation costs. When you roll those up, it's pretty easy to take those public numbers we've given and get to a number that of $4 billion, $5 billion, $6 billion up to whatever totals you want to get to. That kind of opportunity is very exciting for us. We're striving and working very hard. If that is to occur, we will have a very strong opportunity over time to grow cash flows."

I'm not going to make any comments with regard to that. Our overall spectrum plan, though, as you all know, we started VIPs some years ago and put in a lot of fiber in the ground and put LTE nationwide. It was our effort to have a network and particularly, a wireless network that had extremely strong backhaul capability and will be built in a manner such that we could upgrade the technology rather easily as new technologies came along. With regard to having on that network, it is a very dense network with macro towers. And as such, we're now in a position that, with our 40 megahertz, the WCS and AWS-3 spectrum, we're now in a position of taking that spectrum and rolling it out and putting it to use over top of this very high-quality, dense, fiber-rich network that we've already built. That allows us to deal with the capacity needs of our business for a long period of time and continue to then position us as appropriate to do software upgrades as we move on to the next group of technologies. So we feel very -- in a very good position and feel like the overall strategies that we start with some years ago with Project VIP and getting the 300 million LTE POPs out there and getting a fiber-rich backbone out there to support the backhaul were the right decisions that are really paying off with us, as well as the decisions we made to buy the WCS and buy the AWS-3 spectrums. They're really coming into value for us in a very significant way. With regard to Latin America, as we mentioned in our comments, as we've mentioned before, tough environment, but the team down there, we have been impressed with. They're operating very well. Brazil is a challenging environment, both economically and politically. But the team is performing quite well, and the overall profitability is impressing us for the management team to be able to operate in that environment and produce the results there. We're focused not on customer count, but on profitable growth and quality. And quite frankly, we are reasonably encouraged by the change in some of the exchange rates. If you look at where the Brazil real is today, it's a little closer to BRL 3.5. If you look at where the Argentine peso, it's ARS 14.5. And even the most -- even some improvements, quite frankly, in Mexico, in the peso coming down, we're starting to see some light. It's very early, and so we'll continue to work very hard to improve operating results. And we'll keep flexibility with it. But we are impressed with the teams in there. We're going to keep working hard to make it the best business we can."

But I also think is, if you will, the BYOD aspect of our business, we've seen significant increases in those numbers since we started the equipment installment plan of the Next program. And so I think there were a lot of phones that were very -- still very operable, very good shape that we're in, quite frankly, that were idle in the drawer, so to speak. And I think we've seen the reuse of those phones extensively. We've seen our BYOD numbers grow from 90 -- 80,000 to 90,000 a quarter some years ago to 400,000 or more in a quarter. So I think your point on that is best exemplified or best described by that. With that being said, I think when consumers get to choice and understand that they are making spending decisions with their money, they're going to be very efficient. Last, I think there are -- it's a fluid market, and there's, quite frankly, developing a lot of quality, lower-cost handsets. We're seeing that really in our prepaid business extensively, where there's a lot of good quality smartphones that are much lower per unit cost. All of those things are impacting the marketplace and are -- they're impacting our equipment revenues, but they're impacting our equipment expenses. And as both of those goes down, we certainly are striving to get -- have the opportunity to have the customer continue to reinvest some of those savings in our services. And we'll strive to continue to do that, and we'll see how that plays out. In the first quarter, we did have good, good solid performance in our wireless service revenues. We are extremely encouraged by that."

I think, Brett, you are looking at the cash flow statement and you're looking at that change, and accounts payable is about a $1.8 billion impact last year for the first quarter, about a $4 billion impact this year. And you're looking at the right numbers. The reason that increased was twofold. We have the opportunity to invest a lot of CapEx, a lot of equipment and a lot of the inventory. And the fourth quarter had very good prices and rates and satisfying contractual commitment, and those things turn around and get paid for in the first quarter. With that being said, we think that's a timing item, but we don't think it'll have a permanent impact for the year. It'll just reverse out as we go through. So that's it.  We bought up some inventory in handsets and other items, and we made some investments in equipment. And so that's that aspect of it. And that's why we're encouraged about free cash flow, not only meeting guidance, but actually growing year-over-year. Secondly, the 3 million subs are mostly existing subs. And initial times  where that -- many of them brought, not only their device, their handsets, but their tablets with them, and there was some positive impact for those who did bring those tablets. We are encouraged by that. We're optimistic about that, but we're going to be very patient and careful about that to see how that plays out. We did, though, get some new video customers out of this. And I won't suggest it was a significant amount of the 3 million, but we did get some new ones, and we're also very encouraged about that and we're learning from that to find out how we might be able to make that a more -- grow that addition of video customers even more through these types of offerings. So positive on both, to answer your questions."

And included in our CapEx plans for this year and in our longer-term, multiyear plans includes fully funding all that activity. So we're optimistic about that. With regard to the 2G commissioning, one item I want to make sure straightforward is, as the volume of data traffic or volume of traffic on the wireless network has gone down from 2G devices, we have been, if you will, taking parts of that spectrum and repurposing it as we go. So in some markets, we may only have a 2 by 5 slice of spectrum left to repurpose. So we've been doing that, if you will, so to speak, ratably or as we go as we've been able to free up spectrum. So there is more spectrum to free up. I don't have the specific numbers at my disposal here, Simon. But I will tell you, even with that, there still is a lot of costs that are left just to operate even a piece of the 2G network.

But if you will, that freight off has -- the team has worked hard to get people to upgrading the speeds and to take advantage of our better-quality products and services. So I think of that as a success. With regard to U-verse and DIRECTV, it's really the focus. It hasn't been so much about cannibalization as it is, that the sales channel has been focusing on selling DTV's satellite service. And the reason is it's because it's a lower cost structure. We can get, if you will, the content synergies savings by adding the customer there, and so that's really what's going on. It's not so much of a cannibalization or a concerted effort, if you will, to shift, it's more of getting the new customers on DTV. And then in some cases, certainly when we have same-desk opportunities, one of the ways we can do this is getting on to the lower cost structure. So that's really the focus. We still get good Net Promoter Scores and good quality scores on both the DTV and the U-verse platform. And we're still pleased to support both.

We're not going to give specific guidance on customer counts in Mexico, but we are excited about the progress we made. And certainly, when you got 2 quarters in a row of growing customers at this level, you want to keep that momentum going. I think the more important aspect on Mexico is this, one, we do expect that at the end of this year, we'll have 75 million of the population covered with LTE. That will probably bring our total North American footprint to well over 390 million. So we'll be at essentially 400 million possibly by the end of this year, but certainly by 2018, on a North American footprint. That growth in LTE POPs then gives you the opportunity to expand your sales in other markets. Including in that is launching additional markets with an effective market strategy, where we not only have the network, but we also have customer care, customer service, the AT&T brand and acceptable distribution. And we will continue to grow that effective marketplace. We've got, if you will, markets launched of about 42 in Mexico today, and we expect it to be up to 160 by the end of the year. So you can see that getting the LTE to 75 million POPs and getting the customer care service and the distribution at that same level is going to provide us a much greater opportunity than we have today and will give us some time to establish ourselves in those markets that we've just joined. So you can understand why we're optimistic about it, and that we believe that the team is on the right track in doing that. It's a long-term investment for us. We believe highly in the market, and we think it's a natural addition to our North American operations, not only for wireless, but also for our business opportunities. Thank you, Amy.

Of course, I need to call your attention to the safe harbor statement before we begin. The Safe Harbor says that some of the comments today may be forward-looking and as such, subject to risks and uncertainties. And results may differ materially.

Also I want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction, so we cannot address any questions about spectrum today. 
Now before I hand the call over to John, let me quickly call your attention to Slide 4. Slide 4 provides a consolidated financial summary. We had a very good first quarter at AT&T. First quarter consolidated revenues grew to $40.5 billion, largely due to the acquisition of DIRECTV, but we also saw growth in video and IP-based services on a comparable basis. This offset pressure from lower equipment sales as well as foreign exchange. 
We continued our streak of double-digit adjusted EPS growth and after adjustments -- and by the way, the adjustments included removing over $700 million of benefit from spectrum swaps with other industry participants. And so with those adjustments, first quarter EPS was $0.72, up 10.8%. The strong growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. 
Margins also continue to be a great story. We saw a consolidated margin growth, with margin expansion in every domestic business segment. Operating cash flows were up more than $1 billion year-over-year, with free cash flow of $3.2 billion, a 17% increase from a year ago. Capital investment is on plan, coming in at $4.7 billion. 
And so with that, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens."

Revenues grew, margins expanded and we had our fourth straight quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Growth in strategic business services, IP broadband and video were big factors. And ad sales in our entertainment group is now more than $1 billion in annualized revenues and growing. 
What makes our revenue results even more impressive is we did this with lower equipment sales and with more than $500 million of pressure in foreign exchange and with the ongoing pressure of exiting some of our marginal businesses. We're on track to reach a run rate of $1.5 billion in cost synergies from the DIRECTV deal. We're also taking cost out of the business and driving greater savings through efficiency initiatives, such as Project Agile, and transforming our network with software. This gives us the financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives, such as our Mexico operations. 
At the same time, we are also executing on our commitments to transition and transform our business. We've been consistent on this for years. Transforming our smartphone base, transitioning from subsidies to equipment plans, moving our broadband base to IP and our legacy database to strategic services. We've done a lot of work, but we have a lot of more to do. Our video customers are shifting to satellite. We are moving our 2G customers onto our new LTE networks, and we are continuing to use bundling offers to take advantage of our integrated networks. All this makes us feel really good about our direction and the strong start to the year. We built a solid record of setting goals and achieving them. We're very confident that we will continue to do that and transform our business. 
Let's now take a look at our business operations, starting with growth in our Business Solutions segment. Those details are on Slide 6. Solid wireless revenue gains drove overall growth in business and more than offset lower equipment sales and foreign exchange pressure. Total Business Solution revenues were up slightly, with business wireless revenues up 2.3%, reflecting smartphone and tablet gains as well as more customers on lower churn business plans. 
Margins also continued their growth trend. EBITDA margins were up more -- EBITDA was up more than $300 million as cost reductions added to our revenue gains. Margins grew to 38.7%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, thanks to a focused performance by the entire team. 
Looking at our customer segments in business, all retail customer segments showed growth, and our wholesale business is on plan even though revenues were pressured. Legacy data continues to migrate to our IP strategic business services. Total wireline data grew slightly in the quarter and is now about 60% of wireline business revenues. Driving that growth is strategic services. 
Revenue grew by nearly $250 million over last year's first quarter, that's up 9.3%. And if you adjusted for foreign exchange, growth would have exceeded 10%. Strategic business services are now more than $11 billion in annualized revenues. 
We also are seeing continued demand for highly secure mobile business solutions. Security continues to be the top of the mind for our business customers. Every enterprise must rethink its place in today's connected world. We are managing highly secure networks given our unique experience, and our ability to provide business solutions sets us apart, and we intend to be very active in this space. 
Now let's move to our Entertainment Group results on Slide 7. As a reminder, our Entertainment Group provides video, broadband and phone services to residential customers. On a reported basis, Entertainment Group revenues showed strong growth due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. However, if you look at the results adjusted to include prior year DIRECTV on a comparative basis, revenue still grew by more than 3% as IP, video and advertising revenue growth outpaced legacy service declines. 
Our high-speed Internet service grew by more than $250 million and now generates more than $7 billion in annualized revenue. And we are seeing solid growth with our ad sales, which are now more than $1 billion in annualized revenues and going strong. At the same time, we again saw exceptional margin expansion, which points directly to the profitability benefits of the merger. Our EBITDA margins nearly doubled year-over-year. 
Taking a look at our metrics, satellite net adds continue to be strong as we added more than 300,000 in the quarter. Total Entertainment Group broadband net adds were positive in the quarter, driven by a 186,000 IP broadband subscribers. We've done a great job transitioning our broadband base to IP, and that transition is nearly complete. About 95% of the eligible broadband subs now have IP broadband. Half of these customers choose higher speeds, which help drive the 16% revenue growth in IP broadband. 
We also made several strategic moves in the quarter as a premier integrated communications company. We announced our new DIRECTV streaming services in the first quarter. We are actively working the content deals for these new services, and we are on target for launch in the second half of the year. And Fullscreen's ad free subscription service launched today. Fullscreen is majority owned by Otter Media, a partnership between AT&T and the Chernin Group. AT&T has signed on as the premier launch sponsor for the new service and will collaborate with Fullscreen to market and promote the service with special offers for AT&T's more than 100 million video, mobile and broadband customers. 
We are also seeing our broadband attach [audio gap] DTV go up. The attach rate of DTV sales with broadband in our wireline footprint has increased 50% since last summer. And in GigaPower areas, the attach rate improvement is even greater. 
Our new unlimited wireless with video offer started fast and continues at a solid pace. More than 3 million wireless subscribers signed up for this plan at the end of the first quarter, with thousands more being added every day. These are some of our highest ARPU subscribers, who are even more valuable to us now that they have combined these services. 
Our Entertainment Group team is performing well on every level. Merger integration, cross-selling, special bundle offers, advertising and now streaming services. But the second half of the year is when our integration efforts really take hold. Single-truck rolls, cross-selling and new product rollouts are just beginning to take off. We're on track with all our targets, and we're very excited about what is to come. 
Now let's move to our U.S. mobility results on Slide 8. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are now divided between the business solution and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing supplemental information for its total U.S. Wireless operations. We continue to see margin expansion and stabilizing service revenues in the quarter. Service revenues were stable year-over-year, thanks in part to having completed most of the transition to the Mobile Share Value plans as well as adding new customers, while overall wireless revenues were down slightly due to lower equipment sales. 
We've changed the game with our equipment installment plans. We started the transition more than 2 years ago with Next and are substantially through that transition. Our strategy is working, and you can see it in our results. Our laser focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove our best-ever first quarter wireless EBITDA margins.
Wireless EBITDA increased more than $600 million when compared to the first -- to the year ago first quarter. And wireless service EBITDA margin came in at 49.5%, its best quarter ever. Phone-only ARPU, plus Next billing, continued its strong growth. This ARPU was up more than 5% year-over-year and also up sequentially. Nearly half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next. More than 70% of postpaid smartphone subscribers are on a no-device-subsidy plan. 
During the quarter, we discontinued the availability of subsidized phones for most subscribers. This will drive continued growth in the no-subsidy model. In fact, 90% of postpaid smartphone sales and upgrades were on AT&T Next or BYOD. Our branded percentage is even higher. 
Now let's look at wireless net adds. During the first quarter, AT&T posted a net increase of 2.3 million total net adds, our best first quarter ever. That includes 1.8 million domestic wireless subs. Net adds were driven by connected devices, branded phones and tablets. Branded domestic net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up more than 600,000, thanks to strength in prepaid that included 137,000 branded phone net adds. And when you include Mexico, we had nearly 1.2 million branded net adds in our wireless operations and more than 700,000 branded phone net adds. 
Cricket continues to be a great option for our value-focused customers. We had 500,000 prepaid net adds in the quarter and nearly 1 million prepaid net adds when you include Mexico. Our ARPU for the new prepaid Cricket subs continues to run about $41. That compares to feature phones ARPU of about $35. Feature phones make up the bulk of our postpaid phone losses. And the Cricket momentum continues to grow. We expanded our Cricket distribution to Best Buy and Aaron's locations. Crickets will be available in more than 12,000 outlets across the country. 
We also just introduced a new Cricket unlimited plan, including talk, text and data, for $65 a month with Auto Pay and no hidden fees. We had 1.6 million connected device net adds, matching our best-ever net add quarter. We now have nearly 28 million of these devices on our network, and we are laying the foundation for future growth. 
In the first quarter, we also continued to grow our high-value smartphone base. We added 1.1 million branded smartphones during the quarter. More than 95% of our postpaid phone sales in the quarter were smartphones, and nearly 90% of our postpaid phone base has smartphones. Total churn was essentially stable year-over-year. 
On a related note, we are moving forward with our previously announced shutdown of our legacy 2G network. We plan on decommissioning it by the end of the year. We have taken steps to migrate our 2G customer base and expect most to take this transition. We expect to continue to see manageable pressure in the last half of the year from subscribers, mostly connected devices, choosing not to make this migration. While this might have a slight impact on revenues, we also see the cost benefits from shutting down the network, and the spectrum will be redeployed to help meet the growing data demand of our customer base. 
Now let's look at our international operation. That information is on Slide 10. We continued the hard work and heavy lifting to make our Mexico wireless operations world-class. That includes deploying a 4G LTE network, integrating operations and support services and rebranding to the AT&T name. The team is doing a great job with all of this. Even more impressive, they're adding customers at the same time. We added more than 500,000 wireless subscribers in the first quarter and nearly 1.1 million in just the last 6 months. That brings our total subscriber count to 9.2 million. 
Rebranding is also gaining steam. We've launched nationwide advertising. Rebranding in Mexico City is nearly complete. Our LTE deployment now reaches 51 million people. In just a year, we're more than halfway to reaching our commitment to deploy LTE to 100 million POPs by the end of 2018. And we're also on target to reach 75 million POPs by the end of this year. 
First quarter revenue reflects seasonally low equipment sales as well as the impact of foreign exchange as we successfully continue to execute our strategy. In Latin America, our video operations continue to show solid revenue growth on a local currency basis. But foreign exchange rate significantly impacted our published results. 
Revenues are being hampered by a challenging economy. Subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds. But foreign exchange also impacted lower company expenses. We did see sequential profitability trends in the quarter and continue to expect self-sustaining cash flow for the year. 
Now let's move to consolidated margins on Slide 11.
Consolidated margins reflect the overall strength of our business. EBITDA margins were slightly up, and adjusted consolidated operating income margin came in at 19.9% in the quarter. That was 110 basis point improvement over the year ago first quarter. 
Strong margin expansion in our domestic segments more than offset nearly 90 basis points of margin pressure from our growth initiatives in Mexico. Our drive to have the industry-best cost structure also is continuing on track. Efficiency initiatives and our software transformation are driving productivity gains and expense savings. On a comparable basis, our expenses were down more than $300 million year-over-year, driven by excess cost efficiencies, automation efforts in service delivery, IT rationalization and software savings. We also continue to see lower call volumes and improvements in cycle times for our efforts to improve the sales experience. 
During the quarter, we also eliminated subsidized phones for most of our postpaid customers. This should sustain further margin improvement, even though most of our smartphone base is already off the subsidy model. 
Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We're confident we can continue to expand domestic margins and cut costs to offset pressure while in the investment cycle in Mexico. And we expect Mexico to improve its profitability late in the year. 
Cash flows were another strong story. Let's take a look at the results on Slide 12. Along with solid earnings and margins, we also continue to deliver strong cash flow growth. In the first quarter, cash from operations was nearly $8 billion, up 17% year-over-year; and free cash flow was $3.2 billion, also a 17% increase from the year ago first quarter. The strong free cash flow growth comes even with more than $1 billion of pressure from timing of fourth quarter payables. With these first quarter results, we're on track to meet guidance and on plan to grow free cash flow for the year. 
We continue to find ample demand and great rates in the securitization market to help us manage our Next receivables. We received about $1.5 billion in the first quarter [indiscernible] amount as last year's first quarter. Capital investments totaled $4.7 billion for the quarter. Wireless CapEx is down slightly from the fourth quarter. When we accelerate purchases of equipment, it captures significant savings. On average, wireless CapEx was about $2.2 billion for the last 2 quarters. 
But not captured in those costs are our investments in shared infrastructure. For example, running fiber to the cell site, but also using that fiber connection for our business wireline services. Shared infrastructure is about half of our nonwireless spending and is one of the benefits from our integrated network carrier strategy.
With our industry-best cell density and balanced spectrum portfolio, we're adding wireless capacity far more effectively and efficiently than anyone in the industry. Our virtualization and software-defined networks are already delivering material CapEx savings. We'll be adding 2.5x more capacity at 75% of the capital cost compared to just a few years ago. 
In our other uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio declined to 2.27x. And during the quarter, we successfully exchanged $16 billion of DIRECTV debt and issued $6 billion of debt at very reasonable rates. We ended the quarter with $10 billion in cash and short-term investments, giving us the flexibility and financial strength to manage the overall needs of our business. 
Before we get to your questions, let me close with a quick recap of the quarter on Slide 13. The first quarter demonstrated our ability to deliver strong, consistent results as we execute the strategy we've laid out for you. Our approach has been methodical. Our results have been consistent. We again grew revenues, expanded margins and delivered double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Our DIRECTV integration continues to go smoothly, and we're on track to deliver a run rate, $1.5 billion or more in cost synergies by the end of this year. We are also providing the first glimpse of what it means to be the premier integrated communications carrier in the world with our integrated offers and streaming plans. 
Our Business Solutions segment continued to outperform the market with strategic service revenue gains and margin expansion. Wireless again had record margins, growing phone-only, plus Next ARPU, and had strong growth with its Cricket prepaid platform. 
And Mexico wireless is fast becoming an emerging growth story as we quickly build that business and expand our North American 4G LTE network. 
We're convinced our strategy is working and our momentum is strong. I'm proud of what we've accomplished this quarter and even more excited about what lies ahead. 
With that, let's get to your questions."

One, our strategies with regard to the overall business but including our phone market is really on this integrated carrier strategy. So as we roll out these products that we can combine our video and our mobility and our broadband, and as we see these values added to the customers, we're optimistic we're going to be able to continue to improve our business. One other point I'll make to you too is, with these kinds of margins and these kinds of expansions in margins, it gives us the flexibility and, quite frankly, it grows the universe of customers that are long-term value-creating customers for us with these new margin standards that the team has set. So we're really optimistic about being competitive. With that being said, we are still viewing the Cricket and the prepaid platform as a very viable, profitable long-term strategy. We believe it gives us an entrée into the market that is significant and, as you can see, generating great results. We are seeing continued improvement in service revenues, you saw it, as you can see in the first quarter, and in ARPUs. So we're very positive about that. We believe there's real opportunity to continue that. But we'll continue to worry about performing first and predicting it afterwards. But we are optimistic. We like what we see. We like what happened when we combined the video and wireless offerings. And a number of customers, for example, that not only added their phones, but added their tablets to the program, that was very encouraging. So we're really optimistic."

We're getting those from new content -- contract negotiations as well, quite frankly, as the fact that our base has shifted more to DTV and we get that from the existing contracts. Two, we got a lot of it from our kind of the headquarters, advertising, the traditional things you find with headquarter companies merging together. Those savings and professional fees and contractors and consulting fee savings, we're getting that. And then we're seeing some savings, and we expect to see more as we go through, not only on the expense side, but on the cash flow side, from aligning vendor contracts, best price of both companies' contracts and best payment terms. So those are what's underway. We've been at this almost 9 months now or a little over 9 months, and it's going relatively well. We're encouraged, not only that we're going to meet the $1.5 billion run rate, but that we had the opportunity to exceed it. So that piece, David. I think the first thing on the 3 million unlimited, those are the customers that are buying video from us. Many of those customers, most of those customers were already buying a video product from us. So you can imagine when they buy the video, when they buy wireless, they often buy the broadband. These are some very high ARPU customers and customers that are very valuable long term to us. And so giving them this opportunity to use our services anytime, anyplace, where they live and work, is very positive for them and creates, not only satisfaction for them, but also high value for us. It also has added some video customers. We have been able to use this as an opportunity to add video customers further, for the wireless customers who want to get this opportunity. Secondly, when -- we're still in the learning stage of it, but we are still finding that 80% of our video traffic or some number like that is on WiFi or gets offloaded very quickly. So while the impact is convenience for the customers, so far, it looks like it's going to be a manageable exercise for us. We are continuing to evaluate it, and we're going to continue to learn. But the common place where people use this video still allows us to have WiFi supplement for it, and that is providing us some measure of opportunity for success. But the real issue is when customers are paying us for all those services, it makes real sense. We can really be comfortable with offering the unlimited. And so far, it's working well."

So we believe that we're very excited about that opportunity, and it gives us a way to compete in different places, even those places where we don't have the broadband product in place. So we're excited about that. Right now, the people who buy our DIRECTV and U-verse video products are the high-end customers, who generally want a subscription video product in their home with 3 or 4 televisions connected and that variation. So it is  a slightly different marketplace or a different customer base with regard to DIRECTV Now. Likewise, we're excited about the opportunity to do it on mobility and provide the DTV mobility to those customers who use mobile devices as their broadband alternative. Well, that being said, we're really excited about growing the market. And at this time, we are excited about the ability to package a collection of content that is very similar to and very attractive to the customers that we would be targeting with this."

When you roll those up, it's pretty easy to take those public numbers we've given and get to a number that of $4 billion, $5 billion, $6 billion up to whatever totals you want to get to.

Our overall spectrum plan, though, as you all know, we started VIPs some years ago and put in a lot of fiber in the ground and put LTE nationwide. It was our effort to have a network and particularly, a wireless network that had extremely strong backhaul capability and will be built in a manner such that we could upgrade the technology rather easily as new technologies came along. With regard to having on that network, it is a very dense network with macro towers. And as such, we're now in a position that, with our 40 megahertz, the WCS and AWS-3 spectrum, we're now in a position of taking that spectrum and rolling it out and putting it to use over top of this very high-quality, dense, fiber-rich network that we've already built. That allows us to deal with the capacity needs of our business for a long period of time and continue to then position us as appropriate to do software upgrades as we move on to the next group of technologies. So we feel very -- in a very good position and feel like the overall strategies that we started with some years ago with Project VIP and getting the 300 million LTE POPs out there and getting a fiber-rich backbone out there to support the backhaul were the right decisions that are really paying off with us, as well as the decisions we made to buy the WCS and buy the AWS-3 spectrums. They're really coming into value for us in a very significant way. With regard to Latin America, as we mentioned in our comments, as we've mentioned before, tough environment, but the team down there, we have been impressed with. They're operating very well. Brazil is a challenging environment, both economically and politically. But the team is performing quite well, and the overall profitability is impressing us for a management team to be able to operate in that environment and produce the results there. We're focused not on customer count but on profitable growth and quality. And quite frankly, we are reasonably encouraged by the change in some of the exchange rates. If you look at where the Brazil real is today, it's a little closer to BRL 3.5. If you look at where the Argentine peso, it's ARS 14.5. And even the most -- even some improvements, quite frankly, in Mexico, in the peso coming down, we're starting to see some light. It's very early, and so we'll continue to work very hard to improve operating results. And we'll keep flexibility with it. But we are impressed with the teams that are there. We're going to keep working hard to make it the best business we can."

But I also think is, if you will, the BYOD aspect of our business, we've seen significant increases in those numbers since we started the equipment installment plan of the Next program. And so I think there were a lot of phones that were very -- still very operable, very good shape that were in, quite frankly, that were idle in the drawer, so to speak. And I think we've seen the reuse of those phones extensively. We've seen our BYOD numbers grow from 90 -- 80,000 to 90,000 a quarter some years ago to 400,000 or more in a quarter. So I think your point on that is best exemplified or best described by that. With that being said, I think when consumers get the choice and understand that they are making spending decisions with their money, they're going to be very efficient. Last, I think there are -- it's a fluid market, and there's, quite frankly, developing a lot of quality, lower-cost handsets. We're seeing that really in our prepaid business extensively, where there's a lot of good quality smartphones that are much lower per unit cost. All of those things are impacting the marketplace and are -- they're impacting our equipment revenues, but they're impacting our equipment expenses. And as both of those goes down, we certainly are striving to get -- have the opportunity to have the customer continue to reinvest some of those savings in our services. And we'll strive to continue to do that, and we'll see how that plays out. In the first quarter, we did have good, good solid performance in our wireless service revenues.

I think, Brett, you are looking at the cash flow statement and you're looking at that change, and accounts payable is about a $1.8 billion impact last year for the first quarter, about a $4 billion impact this year. And you're looking at the right numbers. The reason that increased was twofold. We had the opportunity to invest a lot of CapEx, a lot of equipment and a lot of the inventory in the fourth quarter at very good prices and rates and satisfying contractual commitments, and those things turn around and get paid for in the first quarter. With that being said, we think that's a timing item, but we don't think it'll have a permanent impact for the year. It'll just reverse out as we go through. So that's it.  We bought up some inventory in handsets and other items, and we made some investments in equipment. And so that's that aspect of it. And that's why we're encouraged about free cash flow, not only meeting guidance, but actually growing year-over-year. Secondly, the 3 million subs are mostly existing subs. And initial signs  where that -- many of them brought, not only their device, their handsets, but their tablets with them, and there was some positive impact for those who did bring those tablets. We are encouraged by that. We're optimistic about that, but we're going to be very patient and careful about that to see how that plays out. We did, though, get some new video customers out of this. And I won't suggest it was a significant amount of the 3 million, but we did get some new ones, and we're also very encouraged about that and we're learning from that to find out how we might be able to make that a more -- grow that addition of video customers even more through these types of offerings.

And included in our CapEx plans for this year and in our longer-term, multiyear plans includes fully funding all that activity. So we're optimistic about that. With regard to the 2G commissioning, one item I want to make sure I'm straightforward with is, as the volume of data traffic or volume of traffic on the wireless network has gone down from 2G devices, we have been, if you will, taking parts of that spectrum and repurposing it as we go. So in some markets, we may only have a 2 by 5 slice of spectrum left to repurpose. So we've been doing that, if you will, so to speak, ratably or as we go, as we've been able to free up spectrum. So there is more spectrum to free up. I don't have the specific numbers at my disposal here, Simon. But I will tell you, even with that, there still is a lot of costs that are left just to operate even a piece of the 2G network.

But if you will, that tradeoff has -- the team has worked hard to get people to upgrading the speeds and to take advantage of our better-quality products and services. So I think of that as a success. With regard to U-verse and DIRECTV, it's really the focus. It hasn't been so much about cannibalization as it is that the sales channel has been focusing on selling DTV's satellite service. And the reason is it's because it's a lower cost structure. We can get, if you will, the content synergy savings by adding the customer there, and so that's really what's going on. It's not so much of a cannibalization or a concerted effort, if you will, to shift, it's more of getting the new customers on DTV. And then in some cases, certainly when we have same-desk opportunities, one of the ways we can do this is getting on to the lower cost structure. So that's really the focus. We still get good Net Promoter Scores and good quality scores on both the DTV and the U-verse platform. And we're still pleased to support both.

We're not going to give specific guidance on customer counts in Mexico, but we are excited about the progress we made. And certainly, when you got 2 quarters in a row of growing customers at this level, you want to keep that momentum going. I think the more important aspect on Mexico is that, one, we do expect that at the end of this year, we'll have 75 million of the population covered with LTE. That will probably bring our total North American footprint to well over 390 million. So we'll be at essentially 400 million possibly by the end of this year, but certainly by 2018, on the North American footprint. That growth in LTE POPs then gives you the opportunity to expand your sales in other markets. Including in that is launching additional markets with an effective market strategy, where we not only have the network, but we also have customer care, customer service, the AT&T brand and acceptable distribution. And we will continue to grow that effective marketplace. We've got, if you will, markets launched of about 42 in Mexico today, and we expect it to be up to 160 by the end of the year. So you can see that getting the LTE to 75 million POPs and getting the customer care service and the distribution at that same level is going to provide us a much greater opportunity than we have today and will give us some time to establish ourselves in those markets that we've just joined. So you can understand why we're optimistic about it, and that we believe that the team is on the right track in doing that. It's a long-term investment for us. We believe highly in the market, and we think it's a natural addition to our North American operations, not only for wireless, but also for our business opportunities. Thank you, Amy.

Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That's att.com/investor.relations. 
Of course, I need to call your attention to the safe harbor statement before we begin. The Safe Harbor says that some of the comments today may be forward-looking and as such, subject to risks and uncertainties. And results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website. 
Also I want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction, so we cannot address any questions about spectrum today. 
Now before I hand the call over to John, let me quickly call your attention to Slide 4. Slide 4 provides a consolidated financial summary. We had a very good first quarter at AT&T. First quarter consolidated revenues grew to $40.5 billion, largely due to the acquisition of DIRECTV, but we also saw growth in video and IP-based services on a comparable basis. This offset pressure from lower equipment sales as well as foreign exchange. 
We continued our streak of double-digit adjusted EPS growth and after adjustments -- and by the way, the adjustments included removing over $700 million of benefit from spectrum swaps with other industry participants. And so with those adjustments, first quarter EPS was $0.72, up 10.8%. The strong growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. 
Margins also continue to be a great story. We saw a consolidated margin growth, with margin expansion in every domestic business segment. Operating cash flows were up more than $1 billion year-over-year, with free cash flow of $3.2 billion, a 17% increase from a year ago. Capital investment is on plan, coming in at $4.7 billion. 
And so with that, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens."

Revenues grew, margins expanded and we had our fourth straight quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Growth in strategic business services, IP broadband and video were big factors. And ad sales in our entertainment group is now more than $1 billion in annualized revenues and growing. 
What makes our revenue results even more impressive is we did this with lower equipment sales and with more than $500 million of pressure in foreign exchange and with the ongoing pressure of exiting some of our marginal businesses. We're on track to reach a run rate of $1.5 billion in cost synergies from the DIRECTV deal. We're also taking cost out of the business and driving greater savings through efficiency initiatives, such as Project Agile, and transforming our network with software. This gives us the financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives, such as our Mexico operations. 
At the same time, we are also executing on our commitments to transition and transform our business. We've been consistent on this for years. Transforming our smartphone base, transitioning from subsidies to equipment plans, moving our broadband base to IP and our legacy database to strategic services. We've done a lot of work, but we have a lot of more to do. Our video customers are shifting to satellite. We are moving our 2G customers onto our new LTE networks, and we are continuing to use bundling offers to take advantage of our integrated networks. All this makes us feel really good about our direction and the strong start to the year. We built a solid record of setting goals and achieving them. We're very confident that we will continue to do that and transform our business. 
Let's now take a look at our business operations, starting with growth in our Business Solutions segment. Those details are on Slide 6. Solid wireless revenue gains drove overall growth in business and more than offset lower equipment sales and foreign exchange pressure. Total Business Solution revenues were up slightly, with business wireless revenues up 2.3%, reflecting smartphone and tablet gains as well as more customers on lower churn business plans. 
Margins also continued their growth trend. EBITDA margins were up more -- EBITDA was up more than $300 million as cost reductions added to our revenue gains. Margins grew to 38.7%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, thanks to a focused performance by the entire team. 
Looking at our customer segments in business, all retail customer segments showed growth, and our wholesale business is on plan even though revenues were pressured. Legacy data continues to migrate to our IP strategic business services. Total wireline data grew slightly in the quarter and is now about 60% of wireline business revenues. Driving that growth is strategic services. 
Revenue grew by nearly $250 million over last year's first quarter, that's up 9.3%. And if you adjusted for foreign exchange, growth would have exceeded 10%. Strategic business services are now more than $11 billion in annualized revenues. 
We also are seeing continued demand for highly secure mobile business solutions. Security continues to be the top of the mind for our business customers. Every enterprise must rethink its place in today's connected world. We are managing highly secure networks given our unique experience, and our ability to provide business solutions sets us apart, and we intend to be very active in this space. 
Now let's move to our Entertainment Group results on Slide 7. As a reminder, our Entertainment Group provides video, broadband and phone services to residential customers. On a reported basis, Entertainment Group revenues showed strong growth due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. However, if you look at the results adjusted to include prior year DIRECTV on a comparative basis, revenue still grew by more than 3% as IP, video and advertising revenue growth outpaced legacy service declines. 
Our high-speed Internet service grew by more than $250 million and now generates more than $7 billion in annualized revenue. And we are seeing solid growth with our ad sales, which are now more than $1 billion in annualized revenues and going strong. At the same time, we again saw exceptional margin expansion, which points directly to the profitability benefits of the merger. Our EBITDA margins nearly doubled year-over-year. 
Taking a look at our metrics, satellite net adds continue to be strong as we added more than 300,000 in the quarter. Total Entertainment Group broadband net adds were positive in the quarter, driven by a 186,000 IP broadband subscribers. We've done a great job transitioning our broadband base to IP, and that transition is nearly complete. About 95% of the eligible broadband subs now have IP broadband. Half of these customers choose higher speeds, which help drive the 16% revenue growth in IP broadband. 
We also made several strategic moves in the quarter as a premier integrated communications company. We announced our new DIRECTV streaming services in the first quarter. We are actively working the content deals for these new services, and we are on target for launch in the second half of the year. And Fullscreen's ad free subscription service launched today. Fullscreen is majority owned by Otter Media, a partnership between AT&T and the Chernin Group. AT&T has signed on as the premier launch sponsor for the new service and will collaborate with Fullscreen to market and promote the service with special offers for AT&T's more than 100 million video, mobile and broadband customers. 
We are also seeing our broadband attach [audio gap] DTV go up. The attach rate of DTV sales with broadband in our wireline footprint has increased 50% since last summer. And in GigaPower areas, the attach rate improvement is even greater. 
Our new unlimited wireless with video offer started fast and continues at a solid pace. More than 3 million wireless subscribers signed up for this plan at the end of the first quarter, with thousands more being added every day. These are some of our highest ARPU subscribers, who are even more valuable to us now that they have combined these services. 
Our Entertainment Group team is performing well on every level. Merger integration, cross-selling, special bundle offers, advertising and now streaming services. But the second half of the year is when our integration efforts really take hold. Single-truck rolls, cross-selling and new product rollouts are just beginning to take off. We're on track with all our targets, and we're very excited about what is to come. 
Now let's move to our U.S. mobility results on Slide 8. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are now divided between the business solution and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing supplemental information for its total U.S. Wireless operations. We continue to see margin expansion and stabilizing service revenues in the quarter. Service revenues were stable year-over-year, thanks in part to having completed most of the transition to the Mobile Share Value plans as well as adding new customers, while overall wireless revenues were down slightly due to lower equipment sales. 
We've changed the game with our equipment installment plans. We started the transition more than 2 years ago with Next and are substantially through that transition. Our strategy is working, and you can see it in our results. Our laser focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove our best-ever first quarter wireless EBITDA margins.
Wireless EBITDA increased more than $600 million when compared to the first -- to the year ago first quarter. And wireless service EBITDA margin came in at 49.5%, its best quarter ever. Phone-only ARPU, plus Next billing, continued its strong growth. This ARPU was up more than 5% year-over-year and also up sequentially. Nearly half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next. More than 70% of postpaid smartphone subscribers are on a no-device-subsidy plan. 
During the quarter, we discontinued the availability of subsidized phones for most subscribers. This will drive continued growth in the no-subsidy model. In fact, 90% of postpaid smartphone sales and upgrades were on AT&T Next or BYOD. Our branded percentage is even higher. 
Now let's look at wireless net adds. During the first quarter, AT&T posted a net increase of 2.3 million total net adds, our best first quarter ever. That includes 1.8 million domestic wireless subs. Net adds were driven by connected devices, branded phones and tablets. Branded domestic net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up more than 600,000, thanks to strength in prepaid that included 137,000 branded phone net adds. And when you include Mexico, we had nearly 1.2 million branded net adds in our wireless operations and more than 700,000 branded phone net adds. 
Cricket continues to be a great option for our value-focused customers. We had 500,000 prepaid net adds in the quarter and nearly 1 million prepaid net adds when you include Mexico. Our ARPU for the new prepaid Cricket subs continues to run about $41. That compares to feature phones ARPU of about $35. Feature phones make up the bulk of our postpaid phone losses. And the Cricket momentum continues to grow. We expanded our Cricket distribution to Best Buy and Aaron's locations. Crickets will be available in more than 12,000 outlets across the country. 
We also just introduced a new Cricket unlimited plan, including talk, text and data, for $65 a month with Auto Pay and no hidden fees. We had 1.6 million connected device net adds, matching our best-ever net add quarter. We now have nearly 28 million of these devices on our network, and we are laying the foundation for future growth. 
In the first quarter, we also continued to grow our high-value smartphone base. We added 1.1 million branded smartphones during the quarter. More than 95% of our postpaid phone sales in the quarter were smartphones, and nearly 90% of our postpaid phone base has smartphones. Total churn was essentially stable year-over-year. 
On a related note, we are moving forward with our previously announced shutdown of our legacy 2G network. We plan on decommissioning it by the end of the year. We have taken steps to migrate our 2G customer base and expect most to take this transition. We expect to continue to see manageable pressure in the last half of the year from subscribers, mostly connected devices, choosing not to make this migration. While this might have a slight impact on revenues, we also see the cost benefits from shutting down the network, and the spectrum will be redeployed to help meet the growing data demand of our customer base. 
Now let's look at our international operation. That information is on Slide 10. We continued the hard work and heavy lifting to make our Mexico wireless operations world-class. That includes deploying a 4G LTE network, integrating operations and support services and rebranding to the AT&T name. The team is doing a great job with all of this. Even more impressive, they're adding customers at the same time. We added more than 500,000 wireless subscribers in the first quarter and nearly 1.1 million in just the last 6 months. That brings our total subscriber count to 9.2 million. 
Rebranding is also gaining steam. We've launched nationwide advertising. Rebranding in Mexico City is nearly complete. Our LTE deployment now reaches 51 million people. In just a year, we're more than halfway to reaching our commitment to deploy LTE to 100 million POPs by the end of 2018. And we're also on target to reach 75 million POPs by the end of this year. 
First quarter revenue reflects seasonally low equipment sales as well as the impact of foreign exchange as we successfully continue to execute our strategy. In Latin America, our video operations continue to show solid revenue growth on a local currency basis. But foreign exchange rate significantly impacted our published results. 
Revenues are being hampered by a challenging economy. Subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds. But foreign exchange also impacted lower company expenses. We did see sequential profitability trends in the quarter and continue to expect self-sustaining cash flow for the year. 
Now let's move to consolidated margins on Slide 11.
Consolidated margins reflect the overall strength of our business. EBITDA margins were slightly up, and adjusted consolidated operating income margin came in at 19.9% in the quarter. That was 110 basis point improvement over the year ago first quarter. 
Strong margin expansion in our domestic segments more than offset nearly 90 basis points of margin pressure from our growth initiatives in Mexico. Our drive to have the industry-best cost structure also is continuing on track. Efficiency initiatives and our software transformation are driving productivity gains and expense savings. On a comparable basis, our expenses were down more than $300 million year-over-year, driven by excess cost efficiencies, automation efforts in service delivery, IT rationalization and software savings. We also continue to see lower call volumes and improvements in cycle times for our efforts to improve the sales experience. 
During the quarter, we also eliminated subsidized phones for most of our postpaid customers. This should sustain further margin improvement, even though most of our smartphone base is already off the subsidy model. 
Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We're confident we can continue to expand domestic margins and cut costs to offset pressure while in the investment cycle in Mexico. And we expect Mexico to improve its profitability late in the year. 
Cash flows were another strong story. Let's take a look at the results on Slide 12. Along with solid earnings and margins, we also continue to deliver strong cash flow growth. In the first quarter, cash from operations was nearly $8 billion, up 17% year-over-year; and free cash flow was $3.2 billion, also a 17% increase from the year ago first quarter. The strong free cash flow growth comes even with more than $1 billion of pressure from timing of fourth quarter payables. With these first quarter results, we're on track to meet guidance and on plan to grow free cash flow for the year. 
We continue to find ample demand and great rates in the securitization market to help us manage our Next receivables. We received about $1.5 billion in the first quarter [indiscernible] amount as last year's first quarter. Capital investments totaled $4.7 billion for the quarter. Wireless CapEx is down slightly from the fourth quarter. When we accelerate purchases of equipment, it captures significant savings. On average, wireless CapEx was about $2.2 billion for the last 2 quarters. 
But not captured in those costs are our investments in shared infrastructure. For example, running fiber to the cell site, but also using that fiber connection for our business wireline services. Shared infrastructure is about half of our nonwireless spending and is one of the benefits from our integrated network carrier strategy.
With our industry-best cell density and balanced spectrum portfolio, we're adding wireless capacity far more effectively and efficiently than anyone in the industry. Our virtualization and software-defined networks are already delivering material CapEx savings. We'll be adding 2.5x more capacity at 75% of the capital cost compared to just a few years ago. 
In our other uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio declined to 2.27x. And during the quarter, we successfully exchanged $16 billion of DIRECTV debt and issued $6 billion of debt at very reasonable rates. We ended the quarter with $10 billion in cash and short-term investments, giving us the flexibility and financial strength to manage the overall needs of our business. 
Before we get to your questions, let me close with a quick recap of the quarter on Slide 13. The first quarter demonstrated our ability to deliver strong, consistent results as we execute the strategy we've laid out for you. Our approach has been methodical. Our results have been consistent. We again grew revenues, expanded margins and delivered double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Our DIRECTV integration continues to go smoothly, and we're on track to deliver a run rate, $1.5 billion or more in cost synergies by the end of this year. We are also providing the first glimpse of what it means to be the premier integrated communications carrier in the world with our integrated offers and streaming plans. 
Our Business Solutions segment continued to outperform the market with strategic service revenue gains and margin expansion. Wireless again had record margins, growing phone-only, plus Next ARPU, and had strong growth with its Cricket prepaid platform. 
And Mexico wireless is fast becoming an emerging growth story as we quickly build that business and expand our North American 4G LTE network. 
We're convinced our strategy is working and our momentum is strong. I'm proud of what we've accomplished this quarter and even more excited about what lies ahead. 
With that, let's get to your questions."

One, our strategies with regard to the overall business but including our phone market is really on this integrated carrier strategy. So as we roll out these products that we can combine our video and our mobility and our broadband, and as we see these values added to the customers, we're optimistic we're going to be able to continue to improve our business. One other point I'll make to you too is, with these kinds of margins and these kinds of expansions in margins, it gives us the flexibility and, quite frankly, it grows the universe of customers that are long-term value-creating customers for us with these new margin standards that the team has set. So we're really optimistic about being competitive. With that being said, we are still viewing the Cricket and the prepaid platform as a very viable, profitable long-term strategy. We believe it gives us an entrée into the market that is significant and, as you can see, generating great results. We are seeing continued improvement in service revenues, you saw it, as you can see in the first quarter, and in ARPUs. So we're very positive about that. We believe there's real opportunity to continue that. But we'll continue to worry about performing first and predicting it afterwards. But we are optimistic. We like what we see. We like what happened when we combined the video and wireless offerings. And a number of customers, for example, that not only added their phones, but added their tablets to the program, that was very encouraging. So we're really optimistic."

In the second half of the year, we'll have the integration efforts really completed and fully ramped.

We're getting those from new content -- contract negotiations as well, quite frankly, as the fact that our base has shifted more to DTV and we get that from the existing contracts. Two, we got a lot of it from our kind of the headquarters, advertising, the traditional things you find with headquarter companies merging together. Those savings and professional fees and contractors and consulting fee savings, we're getting that. And then we're seeing some savings, and we expect to see more as we go through, not only on the expense side, but on the cash flow side, from aligning vendor contracts, best price of both companies' contracts and best payment terms. So those are what's underway. We've been at this almost 9 months now or a little over 9 months, and it's going relatively well. We're encouraged, not only that we're going to meet the $1.5 billion run rate, but that we had the opportunity to exceed it. So that piece, David. I think the first thing on the 3 million unlimited, those are the customers that are buying video from us. Many of those customers, most of those customers were already buying a video product from us. So you can imagine when they buy the video, when they buy wireless, they often buy the broadband. These are some very high ARPU customers and customers that are very valuable long term to us. And so giving them this opportunity to use our services anytime, anyplace, where they live and work, is very positive for them and creates, not only satisfaction for them, but also high value for us. It also has added some video customers. We have been able to use this as an opportunity to add video customers further, for the wireless customers who want to get this opportunity. Secondly, when -- we're still in the learning stage of it, but we are still finding that 80% of our video traffic or some number like that is on WiFi or gets offloaded very quickly. So while the impact is convenience for the customers, so far, it looks like it's going to be a manageable exercise for us. We are continuing to evaluate it, and we're going to continue to learn. But the common place where people use this video still allows us to have WiFi supplement for it, and that is providing us some measure of opportunity for success.

So the AT&T now and the AT&T mobile are really -- specifically, the DTV Now, excuse me, and the DTV Mobile. The DTV Now is really expected to look and appear to have a channel choices very similar to what we have on the traditional subscription DTV product today. The attractiveness for us is that, yes, there's a market of 20 million households that don't have it today. There's a collection of, if you will, cord-nevers, young people have never had their own subscription that they might be able to get this. And quite frankly, the cost efficiency of being able to deliver without having the cost of installation of a satellite dish or possibly a set-top box, whatever the cost that may be eliminated out of this, are really attractive and make it something that not only could grow the customer base, but also be a very reasonable profitability for us. So we believe that we're very excited about that opportunity, and it gives us a way to compete in different places, even those places where we don't have the broadband product in place. So we're excited about that. Right now, the people who buy our DIRECTV and U-verse video products are the high-end customers, who generally want a subscription video product in their home with 3 or 4 televisions connected and that variation. So it is  a slightly different marketplace or a different customer base with regard to DIRECTV Now. Likewise, we're excited about the opportunity to do it on mobility and provide the DTV mobility to those customers who use mobile devices as their broadband alternative. Well, that being said, we're really excited about growing the market. And at this time, we are excited about the ability to package a collection of content that is very similar to and very attractive to the customers that we would be targeting with this."

Our overall spectrum plan, though, as you all know, we started VIPs some years ago and put in a lot of fiber in the ground and put LTE nationwide. It was our effort to have a network and particularly, a wireless network that had extremely strong backhaul capability and will be built in a manner such that we could upgrade the technology rather easily as new technologies came along. With regard to having on that network, it is a very dense network with macro towers. And as such, we're now in a position that, with our 40 megahertz, the WCS and AWS-3 spectrum, we're now in a position of taking that spectrum and rolling it out and putting it to use over top of this very high-quality, dense, fiber-rich network that we've already built. That allows us to deal with the capacity needs of our business for a long period of time and continue to then position us as appropriate to do software upgrades as we move on to the next group of technologies. So we feel very -- in a very good position and feel like the overall strategies that we started with some years ago with Project VIP and getting the 300 million LTE POPs out there and getting a fiber-rich backbone out there to support the backhaul were the right decisions that are really paying off with us, as well as the decisions we made to buy the WCS and buy the AWS-3 spectrums. They're really coming into value for us in a very significant way. With regard to Latin America, as we mentioned in our comments, as we've mentioned before, tough environment, but the team down there, we have been impressed with. They're operating very well. Brazil is a challenging environment, both economically and politically. But the team is performing quite well, and the overall profitability is impressing us for a management team to be able to operate in that environment and produce the results there. We're focused not on customer count but on profitable growth and quality. And quite frankly, we are reasonably encouraged by the change in some of the exchange rates. If you look at where the Brazil real is today, it's a little closer to BRL 3.5. If you look at where the Argentine peso, it's ARS 14.5. And even the most -- even some improvements, quite frankly, in Mexico, in the peso coming down, we're starting to see some light. It's very early, and so we'll continue to work very hard to improve operating results. And we'll keep flexibility with it. But we are impressed with the teams that are there. We're going to keep working hard to make it the best business we can."

But I also think is, if you will, the BYOD aspect of our business, we've seen significant increases in those numbers since we started the equipment installment plan of the Next program. And so I think there were a lot of phones that were very -- still very operable, very good shape that were in, quite frankly, that were idle in the drawer, so to speak. And I think we've seen the reuse of those phones extensively. We've seen our BYOD numbers grow from 90 -- 80,000 to 90,000 a quarter some years ago to 400,000 or more in a quarter. So I think your point on that is best exemplified or best described by that. With that being said, I think when consumers get the choice and understand that they are making spending decisions with their money, they're going to be very efficient. Last, I think there are -- it's a fluid market, and there's, quite frankly, developing a lot of quality, lower-cost handsets. We're seeing that really in our prepaid business extensively, where there's a lot of good quality smartphones that are much lower per unit cost. All of those things are impacting the marketplace and are -- they're impacting our equipment revenues, but they're impacting our equipment expenses. And as both of those goes down, we certainly are striving to get -- have the opportunity to have the customer continue to reinvest some of those savings in our services. And we'll strive to continue to do that, and we'll see how that plays out. In the first quarter, we did have good, good solid performance in our wireless service revenues.

I think, Brett, you are looking at the cash flow statement and you're looking at that change, and accounts payable is about a $1.8 billion impact last year for the first quarter, about a $4 billion impact this year. And you're looking at the right numbers. The reason that increased was twofold. We had the opportunity to invest a lot of CapEx, a lot of equipment and a lot of the inventory in the fourth quarter at very good prices and rates and satisfying contractual commitments, and those things turn around and get paid for in the first quarter. With that being said, we think that's a timing item, but we don't think it'll have a permanent impact for the year. It'll just reverse out as we go through. So that's it.  We bought up some inventory in handsets and other items, and we made some investments in equipment. And so that's that aspect of it. And that's why we're encouraged about free cash flow, not only meeting guidance, but actually growing year-over-year. Secondly, the 3 million subs are mostly existing subs. And initial signs  where that -- many of them brought, not only their device, their handsets, but their tablets with them, and there was some positive impact for those who did bring those tablets. We are encouraged by that. We're optimistic about that, but we're going to be very patient and careful about that to see how that plays out. We did, though, get some new video customers out of this. And I won't suggest it was a significant amount of the 3 million, but we did get some new ones, and we're also very encouraged about that and we're learning from that to find out how we might be able to make that a more -- grow that addition of video customers even more through these types of offerings.

And included in our CapEx plans for this year and in our longer-term, multiyear plans includes fully funding all that activity. So we're optimistic about that. With regard to the 2G commissioning, one item I want to make sure I'm straightforward with is, as the volume of data traffic or volume of traffic on the wireless network has gone down from 2G devices, we have been, if you will, taking parts of that spectrum and repurposing it as we go. So in some markets, we may only have a 2 by 5 slice of spectrum left to repurpose. So we've been doing that, if you will, so to speak, ratably or as we go, as we've been able to free up spectrum. So there is more spectrum to free up. I don't have the specific numbers at my disposal here, Simon. But I will tell you, even with that, there still is a lot of costs that are left just to operate even a piece of the 2G network.

But if you will, that tradeoff has -- the team has worked hard to get people to upgrading the speeds and to take advantage of our better-quality products and services. So I think of that as a success. With regard to U-verse and DIRECTV, it's really the focus. It hasn't been so much about cannibalization as it is that the sales channel has been focusing on selling DTV's satellite service. And the reason is it's because it's a lower cost structure. We can get, if you will, the content synergy savings by adding the customer there, and so that's really what's going on. It's not so much of a cannibalization or a concerted effort, if you will, to shift, it's more of getting the new customers on DTV. And then in some cases, certainly when we have same-desk opportunities, one of the ways we can do this is getting on to the lower cost structure. So that's really the focus. We still get good Net Promoter Scores and good quality scores on both the DTV and the U-verse platform. And we're still pleased to support both.

We're not going to give specific guidance on customer counts in Mexico, but we are excited about the progress we made. And certainly, when you got 2 quarters in a row of growing customers at this level, you want to keep that momentum going. I think the more important aspect on Mexico is that, one, we do expect that at the end of this year, we'll have 75 million of the population covered with LTE. That will probably bring our total North American footprint to well over 390 million. So we'll be at essentially 400 million possibly by the end of this year, but certainly by 2018, on the North American footprint. That growth in LTE POPs then gives you the opportunity to expand your sales in other markets. Including in that is launching additional markets with an effective market strategy, where we not only have the network, but we also have customer care, customer service, the AT&T brand and acceptable distribution. And we will continue to grow that effective marketplace. We've got, if you will, markets launched of about 42 in Mexico today, and we expect it to be up to 160 by the end of the year. So you can see that getting the LTE to 75 million POPs and getting the customer care service and the distribution at that same level is going to provide us a much greater opportunity than we have today and will give us some time to establish ourselves in those markets that we've just joined. So you can understand why we're optimistic about it, and that we believe that the team is on the right track in doing that. It's a long-term investment for us. We believe highly in the market, and we think it's a natural addition to our North American operations, not only for wireless, but also for our business opportunities. Thank you, Amy.

It's been 1 year since we closed on our deal to acquire DIRECTV and it's been a heck of a year. We are hitting the mark with our synergy targets. The cost synergies are ahead of plan. And we're about ready to take the wraps off some exciting news streaming opportunities that will expand our customer base and extend our video position. We've added nearly 1 million U.S. satellite subscribers since we closed the deal. We were excited a year ago when DTV first came on board and added enthusiasm has only grown. We'll talk more about that in just a few minutes. But now, let me begin by discussing our second quarter results starting with our financial summary on Slide 5.
Second quarter consolidated revenues grew to $40.5 billion, largely due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. But we also saw growth in satellite, video, advertising and IP services on a comparable basis. This offset pressure from lower year-over-year wireless equipment sales and foreign exchange. 
Adjusted earnings growth continued. After adjustments, second quarter EPS was $0.72 a share, up year-over-year and up about 7% year-to-date. This quarter's growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations and we had more than $0.01 of pressure from compensation-related programs tied to our stock price. Most of this is from a success based compensation plan we have for our bargain for employees. 
We're pleased for our employees, all our employees, and that they have an opportunity to share in the success that they have helped create for our shareholders. Margins also continue to be a solid story, thanks to our focus on profitability and our best ever wireless EBITDA margins. We once again saw adjusted margin expansion on a consolidated basis and in every domestic business segment. This solid performance helped drive strong cash flows. 
Operating cash flow was $10.3 billion with free cash flow reaching $4.8 billion, up 8.4% year-over-year. Our dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 61% and year-to-date, it's 73%. Capital investment came in at $5.6 billion for the quarter and $10.3 billion year-to-date.
We also continue to find ample demand and great rates in the securitization market to help us manage our next receivable. We received about $1.1 billion in the second quarter or about the same as last year's second quarter. Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with business solutions. Those details are on Slide 6.
Total business solution revenues were down slightly due to the sale of certain hosting operations and foreign exchange pressure. Solid wireless and strategic business service revenue gains helped to offset lower wireless equipment sales and declines in legacy services. 
Business wireless revenues were up 2% with service revenue growth outpacing equipment declines. Margins also continued to expand, thanks to business efficiencies and wireless revenue growth offsetting lower wireline revenues. 
Looking at the customer segments. Small business operations continue to grow, thanks to gains on wireless. Enterprise revenues were flat. However, if you adjust for the sale of our divested business in FX, that segment also continued to grow in the quarter. Strategic business services continues to grow at a healthy clip, up more than $200 million year-over-year. That's up 8.4% on a reported basis. And when you adjust for FX, growth was 9%. 
Strategic business services are now 36% of business wireline revenues. The growth of strategic business services and mobility is changing the revenue mix and business solutions. Those 2 areas now make up more than 70% of business solutions revenues. And if you look at total debt and wireless, that's more than 80% of business revenues. So our transformation to next generation products and services is well on its way in our business segment.
Now let's move to our entertainment group results on Slide 7. On a comparative basis, we grew revenues in our entertainment group, thanks to gains in satellite subscribers, broadband revenue and advertising. This more than offset losses in legacy services while also overcoming the pressure from the record-breaking Mayweather-Pacquiao pay-per-view event in the year ago second quarter. We continue to see solid gains in broadband and advertising revenues. 
Broadband revenue was up nearly 7% in the quarter with IEP broadband revenues up 15%. Advertising sales also continued its strong growth, up double digits year-to-date and is now more than a $1.4 billion annualized revenue stream. We're well positioned in this space, and we're looking to play a leading role in taking our ad offerings across all streams. 
At the same time, we again saw continued margin expansion, which points directly to the benefits of the DIRECTV acquisition. Our margins, on a comparable basis, were up 90 basis points and were up even more if you adjust it for the prior-year pay-per-view event. 
Our second quarter customer video metrics were impacted by the usual seasonal pressures, but improved nicely over last year. Our satellite net adds continued to be robust as we added 342,000 satellite subscribers in the quarter. More than 80% of our domestic video business is now on DIRECTV platform. Broadband net subscriber results also were impacted by seasonality as we added 54,000 IP broadband subscribers in the quarter. When you include business subscribers, the company added 74,000 IP broadband subscribers. As we expected, this growth was below recent quarters with second quarter seasonality, but we expect IP broadband net adds to bounce back in the second half of the year. Now let's move to our U.S. mobility results on Slide 8.
As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations. Increasing profitability and a growing subscriber base continues to be the story in our wireless operations. 
For the second straight quarter, we turned in a record EBITDA margin of 41.4%. Service margins were also a record, reaching nearly 50% in the quarter, both were up 130 basis points year-over-year. A sharp focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove the margin expansion. Equipment revenues were down due to a year-over-year increase in BYOD subs and a lower upgrade rate. Service revenues increased sequentially, but were down year-over-year.
At the same time, phone-only ARPU, plus Next billing, was up 2.5% with average monthly billings growing to $70. This growth comes even as we see an increasing number of subscribers holding onto their devices longer after completing their scheduled Next payments. 
About half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 75% of postpaid smartphone subscribers are on a no device subsidy plan. Postpaid churn came in strong with its second lowest ever quarter at 0.97%. Postpaid phone-only churn was even lower and smartphone churn was still lower. And even with the pressures from reseller, our total churn was very low at 1.35%. 
Branded phone add increased in the quarter. Branded domestic phone net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up 185,000, thanks to strength in our Cricket brand. We also continue to expand our valuable smartphone base, adding nearly 800,000 domestic branded smartphones in the quarter. And if you look at the chart on the lower left-hand corner of the slide, you can see that our overall phone base has more subscribers today than we did 1 year ago, thanks to strength in postpaid and prepaid smartphones.
And our postpaid smartphone base by itself is up 1 million in the same time as feature phones transitioned to smartphones. We had another solid quarter adding subscribers. Including our Mexico operations, we added 2.1 million new subscribers. That includes 1.4 million domestic wireless subs with connected devices, branded phones and tablets overcoming losses in reseller, largely due to disconnects from our 2G network. Prepaid net adds in the quarterly impacted by 2 event. 
First, we aligned our return policy across our prepaid platform. This favorable impact was generally offset by the negative impact resulting from a network outage caused by a vendor's equipment. As noted in our reseller numbers, we're starting to see some churn pressure associated with the planned shutdown of our 2G network at the end of this year. That will increase as we move closer to the shutdown. We'll manage through the process and the cost savings from 1 less network to support will be meaningful, so with the additional Spectrum available to the redeploy. Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 9.
Let's start with Mexico. We continue to make significant progress in building our customer base and deploying our 4G/LTE network. We added 742,000 wireless subscribers in the second quarter as we near the 10 million subscriber mark in the country. 
Our LTE deployment also was on track. We now serve 65 million people in Mexico with our most advanced network and expect to reach 75 million by the end of this year. That brings our total North American LTE deployment to 380 million POPs. Our rebranding to AT&T also continues to make progress. We now reach 61 cities with the AT&T brand, including our largest market, Mexico City. Second quarter revenue was up 13% sequentially, driven by equipment sales and wholesale revenues.
Revenue growth was impacted by lower ARPUs as the competitive environment is -- has intensified. In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continue to show revenue growth, up 8% sequentially. Revenues are being hampered by challenging economics. However, we did see subscriber growth adding 87,000 video customers in the quarter in part due to the Copa America soccer tournament. But as you might expect, the earthquake in Ecuador did pressure our overall subscriber growth in Latin America. But even with these economic conditions, we continue to be a profitable and generate positive cash flow from these operations for the quarter. Now that we're midway through the year, let's take a look at how we are doing relative to the guidance we set out in January, that's on Slide 10.
We are on track to meet or exceed each of the metrics we have laid out for you. Consolidated revenues are growing at a double-digit pace, thanks to our acquisition of DIRECTV. This comes even with pressure from lower equipment sales and foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS is up about 7% year-to-date, above guidance, but in line with where we expect it to be at this time. 
Consolidated margins are stable as margin expansion in our domestic operations is offsetting investment pressure from Mexico. We are focused on growing our valuable subscriber base across our business, including Mexico, where growth has been strong. We are willing to make additional investments to gain quality customers. 
Capital investment is trending to the low end of our guidance at its current pace and we are ahead of plans with free cash flow. Dividend coverage for the first half of the year was 73%. We continue to feel confident that we will meet or beat our free cash flow guidance for the year. Now I'd like to spend the remainder of our time providing a strategic update on our business. That begins on Slide 12.
As Mike mentioned, we have often updated you on our company's strategy and direction. But today, we like to take a longer look at how we have uniquely positioned AT&T to lead in the rapidly evolving world of communications and video entertainment. Our goal is to be the world's premier integrated communications company for both consumers and businesses, and we plan to do this in the most cost efficient way possible. This strategy did not happen overnight. It has been part of every business decision we've made for many years. No one else has our portfolio of assets, no one else has our cost structure opportunity, and no one else can offer the integrated solutions that we can. 
Behind all this is a solid financial foundation that gives us the strength and flexibility to invest in our business while returning value to shareholders. This includes our strong liquidity position, our market based compensation and benefit plans, and thoughtful debt management. 
For example, we successfully negotiated workforce contracts that are market based, but also encourage employees to keep our owner's interest in mind while rewarding them when we succeed for shareholders. We also have a world-class Board of Directors, who provide great insight, while at the same time, challenge us. This makes us stronger and helps us navigate through these transformative times. We are uniquely positioned in this industry. All of this will be critical as mobile broadband, high-speed connectivity and entertainment come together. Let's first talk about the connectivity building blocks that we have assembled on Slide 13.
Since the introduction of the first smartphone, we've seen unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic. Even more incredibly, we expect that to continue to grow at a very strong pace. Amidst this demand, we undertook several strategic initiatives to improve the capacity of our network for today and the years to come. Here is what we've accomplished.
First, we retch up our investment cycle with Project VIP. This was crucial to getting the high-quality, high capacity network we have today. Our 4G LTE network deployment was accelerated. Fiber backhaul deployed and cell sites built. We now have almost 70,000 cell sites, thousands more than our largest competitor. And a move into the Mexico wireless market further expands our LTE reach. 
We also drove fiber deeper in our wireline network. We added more than 1 million business locations to our fiber network. And we expanded our IP broadband footprint to more than 60 million customer locations. The next phase of driving fiber into our network is our GigaPower deployment. 
Over the next few years, we expect to reach at least 12.5 million customer locations with our gigabit broadband service. We now have more than 2.2 million fiber to the home customer locations, and we expect to reach 2.6 million or more by the end of the year. Our already dense wireless network and expanding fiber footprint puts us in an excellent position as we move to more small cells and 5G.
We have already found pens, trials are already underway and testing is ongoing. When 5G is ready to roll, we will be ready as well. At the same time we launched VIP, we move to expand our Spectrum portfolio. We have about 150 megahertz of spectrum in our portfolio today, including 40 megahertz of relatively untapped AWS and WCS spectrum. We have the best, most balanced Spectrum portfolio in the industry. Adding Spectrum is the most effective way to add capacity. This year, we expect to add 35,000 LTE carriers compared to the 18,000 deployed last year. We also continue to make smaller Spectrum deals to round out our coverage and redeploy Spectrum once dedicated to 2G and 3G.
Last week's move by the SEC to make high-frequency radio frequency available for 5G wireless service is another step forward to provide even more spectrum. And while we are not going to elaborate, AT&T has applied to be a participant in the broadcast spectrum auction and has also submitted a bid in the first debt process that is currently underway. 
Our network transformation as now pivoting to software-defined networking or SDN. With SDN, we are virtualizing network functions that's used to require dedicated fixed equipment and software as the end gives us flexible, dynamic and smart network capability. We ended last year with about 5% of our network functions virtualized and expect to reach 30% by the end of this year. We are on path to achieve 75% network virtualization by 2020. SDN also provides cost savings, which supports our drive to an industry-leading cost structure. Let's discuss that on Slide 14.
Having an industry-leading cost structure helps us expand margins and grow free cash flow. And have a line of sight to continue margin improvement, as well as reaching our goal of $20 billion in free cash flow. This is what we need to do to reach those goals.
Step one is achieving the cost synergies from our DIRECTV acquisition. We are on track to achieve 1.5 billion plus run rate synergies with DTV by the end of this year. That puts us well on our way take our projected $2.5 billion plus run rate savings by the end of 2018. 
Step 2 is our work to drive efficiencies with Project Agile. This work includes our efforts to serve customers digitally, automating service delivery, streamlining operations and other cost efficiency initiatives. Our goal is to generate a $3 billion run rate in cost savings, and we are moving past the midway point of making that happen. We're also nothing shy about exiting nonstrategic businesses that don't fit our margin expansion profile. That includes global hubbing, and more recently, certain hosting operations. Obviously, that reduces revenue, but increases overall profitability.
Finally, we must continue to believe the industry in our move to software-defined networking. We are virtualizing functions that previously require dedicated solutions, dedicated hardware, dedicated software, dedicated team. This virtualization manifests itself into real, sustained cost savings throughout the network and the business. That savings both our capital expenditures and our cash operating expenses. It also gives customers greater control of their network services, more agility and simplicity in the way they do business with us, as well as better value on ours and our customer's hardware investment.
Now let's look at something that really separates us from the rest of our industry, our integrated solutions approach. That's on Slide 15. 
While it starts with connectivity and cannot be sustained without an effective cost structure, you must have assets to create products customers want, delivered where and how they want them to be successful. We've talked about these assets, so let's bring this point home. 
We are in every major market in the U.S, with reach around the world. We have a 4G LTE footprint that covers 380 million people in North America. We have more fiber connecting more buildings and more business customer locations than anyone else. That's in footprint and out, which helps us compete today, what also positions us very well for 5G. And we're also the biggest CD provided in the world, and we're about to introduce an over-the-top product that we believe will be a game changer.
DIRECTV now is scheduled for launch later this year, and we expect the millions of people who don't know subscribe to video service and prefers streaming option, will be impressed. At the same time, no one can match what we offer business customers. We have the ability to serve all of these customers, for Fortune 1000 customers to the localized shop in the quarter. And no matter how big or how small the business is, almost every conversation with business customers begins with mobility and security, and that is where we excel.
When you take our extensive fiber network, then later on SDN, security and mobility and new software enabled services, you have the premier integrated business services company. We believe we have a significant competitive advantage to use our connectivity and cost structure to offer integrated solutions to our customers. Whether you are in the C suite of a major company, the master suite of your own home and anywhere in between, AT&T delivers. We have a robust, dynamic and attractive set of products architected on a network that is flexible and able to quickly add up to the future. That's table sector if you want to be the rates premier integrated communications company, and that is exactly what we expect to be.
Now before we get to your question, allow me to quickly summarize, and that's on Slide 16. We are very confident in our unique strategy. We have the assets we need and we are executing on our plan. Our DIRECTV cost synergies are hitting the target. Project Agile is on track. And we are ahead on the move to software-defined network. All this drive us towards an industry-leading cost structure. But we're most excited about what lies ahead. 
We have a dedicated and skilled group of people working for us from, the crew staffing on our work centers to the leaders in the boardroom, we have a team of professionals focused on making AT&T the words premier integrated company. Our different shade a position opens the door for some game-changing opportunities, and we're ready to walk through it. We're confident we can exit good in our strategy and continue to build value for our shareholders. With that, let's go to your questions."

As we look to the second half, could you talk about the major variables that would kind of maybe swing you back down towards more the base case expectation for the year versus the -- or better part of the guidance of that you are discussing? And then, second, I was wondering if we could just touch on this issue of kind of the economics of postpaid sublosses versus prepaid some gains. I guess you had about 319,000 prepaid gains versus 180,000 postpaid losses. Can you talk about the routes of economics of those 2 things? And are we looking at a net economic positive or negative trade-off when we look at that?"

The economics so forth. The postpaid subs were losing a lot of all feature phones. They are averaging about somewhere around $35, maybe a little bit less than ARPU, and have costs associated, the postpaid do with retaining them. On the prepaid side, we're probably closer to a $41, $42 depending upon the specifics average ARPU, and much less, they are very, very small subscriber acquisition cost, software costs, maintenance costs. By the very nature are being prepaid. So from that standpoint, the economics are better and it is being shown in our margins. When you look at our margins, total EBITDA margins or service margins, you can see the growth and you can see that level. That's a part of what's driving it. So the economics are, and we're running the business on a branded business. We think of branded customers and then try to make distinctions on classification, really make distinctions on economics. And I think it's showing up in our profitability. 
Now with regard to the variables of the second half, there's a lot of things that happened in saying other some seasonality in the fourth quarter in our wireless business, in our video business, we'll have the NFL ticket come out. and will have the launching of the DTV now and to be over-the-top offers. And so we'll have a whole host of things going on. Our just adjust to you, we're very confident where we're at and continue to do well. And I wouldn't suggest to you that there's anything that's necessarily unique or different about to the second half of the year. Just we're careful with our guidance and want to make sure that we meet or exceed it. So we feel good about where we are at after 6 months."

And then you add it maybe a 1%, I'll say, illustrative reduction in capital intensity and some costs, some cash operating expense savings, you can see that those 3 items there can get you well over $5 billion. In addition, we expect to grow our EBITDA and grow our profitability of the business. And so when you put those things together, it looks to be an achievable, realistic path from last year's $59 billion to a $20 billion number as a goal in the near future. And so that's what we're looking at. That's how we build it up. We're not giving a production date on their that, but we feel good about the opportunities to significantly grow free cash flow. With regard to our CapEx. Just want to be very straightforward, and it sounds that we are at 10.3 and on an annualized basis, that would come below the $22 billion. We'll continue, as I've said before, to invest as appropriate, not towards a targeted $22 billion number, but rather towards what business cases make sense and when it makes sense for us to be in the market investing. Sometimes that cost this quarter still be much heavier in CapEx like we had in the fourth quarter last year. And other times, like in the first 6 months this year, we spend it on lower rate. We're just being very careful with every dollar. But right now, the performance we've had for the first 6 months is a trend to the low end of our guidance."

It looks like obviously, feature phones have come the dramatically over the past 8 quarters or so. As that sort of a purchase of a lower level, does that provide a tailwind to get postpaid phone additions back to positive territory? Obviously, we've got B2B cross-selling, DTV Now products rolling out, our over-the-top products sold rolling out. I assumed that could also help. And then just, secondly, on the video adds for the year. The anticipation that, is it the DIRECTV continues to ramp up, been doing a great job. Is it that? Or is it U-verse of becoming less of a headwind on the back half of their to get to positive video number?"

We do think the 2G losses, as we go through the year, we'll see those. But getting past this year, you'll see the opportunity to have a more positive impact because we're through that process. 
Secondly, our feature phones, which include some 2G devices, but our feature phones are going down. And as they go down and as, if you will, legacy products, so to speak, impact on our results is lessened. Certainly, we have a brighter opportunity, how more -- a better opportunity to grow out of this customer base. And then third, on the bundling as we really get into the second half of the year and are able to do single truck and so, which maybe bundling a video and satellite and broadband. But also, that whole activity of bundling, as of the longer -- the more time our teams get to do it, the better will get at it. And so from that perspective, we do think that will provide us an opportunity to grow more wireless. So all 3 of those things help. And yes, we're optimistic about it. But I will tell you also, it's really about the branded net adds and the economic net adds. It's not about any one category of net adds. It's getting those customers are the most profitable highest quality. With regard to the video side, on a seasonality basis, we usually do see less. Now we see more pressure in the second quarter, the first half from the U-verse side. And quite frankly, so is DTV in the past. So going forward, I would hope that we would see -- we'd expect to see some improvement on both sides. When you think about DIRECTV, things like the NFL ticket, Sunday and some of the other offers, as we see these trends of bundling improving and attachment rates improving, we feel really good about the opportunity to improve our trends and get to our goal of positive video net adds for the year."

But once again, I would suggest to you, the team has done a really good job of doing the bundling between wireless and the video products alone and getting 5 million of these customers to sign-up to this bundled approach with regard to video and wireless, it's just the best proof I can offer you that we've already done, they've already accomplished that this works and that we have a real opportunity to exceed our merge integration synergies because we will have an opportunity to add revenues to those will most of those synergies there really focused on costs."

Very good for us historically from any measurement or straight ARPU prior to the equipment installment days or in the most recent years with the equipment installment. So on a monthly basis, from our customers, we're doing very, very well with revenue base. Secondly, it is a competitive environment. And it will -- and it has been for years. It will remain in that. We believe that we're doing well with that. And we think its proven out and our margins, in our profitability, in our cash flows. I would tell you, just one side is inside item that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. We have about 500,000 BYOD devices. We had customers walk in with 500,000 phones and said, can we connect them to your network? .""  Those are all net adds. They don't show up in equipment revenue. And depending upon what but should they show up, they show up in service revenues. But they are really profitable, they're low cost. We love -- that doesn't necessarily show up. And you're committed look at the financials, but it is clearly showing up in our profitability and our margins. So I would ask you to focus on those items, as well as our service revenues. Specifically with regard to our service revenues, you've seen our additional piece of our customer base shift of all share value, I think we went from a 64% up to 75%. We did have some additional customers shift off of the -- shift to the no subsidy plans, which impacted service revenues. And we continue to do normal promotions through some of the incentives credits, free services, normal promotional activity. All of those things are impacting service revenues as expected. With regard to recent activities in the marketplace, we'll see how those play out. We'll just focus on getting the best quality customers and providing really great service. Some of the changes we've seen give us reason for optimism. Many of the changes we've seen give us reason to really be careful and watch how the market develops and be ready to prepare and lead, quite frankly, in a market with a performance that we've got."

On the CapEx budget, we've been -- we've done well kind of in all aspects of it. A couple of things. One, we've been able to -- because of our software-defined network, we're starting to see a little bit of those savings. If you think about our buying capacity in the overall economic conditions, we've been able to get some volume pricing and some purchasing power benefits. Certainly, we're getting more efficient with what we do. I will tell you, though, that one of the things I think people miss out on is that because of the Spectrum that we've invested in over the last 2, say, 5 years or so, we've got a lot of effective capital deployment that doesn't involve a lot of dollars. It involves deploying Spectrum. And that's a really efficient way to deploy capacity. And so on a per unit capacity, our dollars can be really efficient because of the spectrum portfolio that we have that we're putting in use. I think that's a real big benefit. From a customer base perspective, we're very pleased with the subscriber base we have, whether it's the business subscriber base that we have, what we saw in the small business side and the growth there, whether we see it in the enterprise side. When you look at the consumer side, the prepaid business is growing well. And quite frankly, the margin improvement from Cricket is helping drive the margin improvement in the overall business of wireless. So that's great. And then, of course, some of the premier customers, the video space, are using our U-verse and our DTV services. So we feel great about our customer base. With regard to that, we're willing to invest dollars to retain and attract additional quality customers, whether here in the United States or in Mexico and Latin America. We focus on that, but we'll be careful with it. I would suggest to you the characteristics, the titles we give those prepaid, postpaid, over-the-top versus monthly subscription, are less important as the economics of a profitability of those offers. And that's what we're really focused on."

It's been 1 year since we closed on our deal to acquire DIRECTV, and it's been a heck of a year. We are hitting the mark with our synergy targets. The cost synergies are ahead of plan. And we're about ready to take the wraps off some exciting news streaming opportunities that will expand our customer base and extend our video position. We've added nearly 1 million U.S. satellite subscribers since we closed the deal. We were excited a year ago when DTV first came on board, and that enthusiasm has only grown. We'll talk more about that in just a few minutes. But now let me begin by discussing our second quarter results starting with our financial summary on Slide 5.
Second quarter consolidated revenues grew to $40.5 billion, largely due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. But we also saw growth in satellite, video, advertising and IP services on a comparable basis. This offset pressure from lower year-over-year wireless equipment sales and foreign exchange. 
Adjusted earnings growth continued. After adjustments, second quarter EPS was $0.72 a share, up year-over-year and up about 7% year-to-date. This quarter's growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations, and we had more than $0.01 of pressure from compensation-related programs tied to our stock price. Most of this is from a success based compensation plan we have for our bargained-for employees. 
We're pleased for our employees, all our employees, and that they have an opportunity to share in the success that they have helped create for our shareholders. Margins also continue to be a solid story, thanks to our focus on profitability and our best-ever wireless EBITDA margins. We once again saw adjusted margin expansion on a consolidated basis and in every domestic business segment. This solid performance helped drive strong cash flows. 
Operating cash flow was $10.3 billion, with free cash flow reaching $4.8 billion, up 8.4% year-over-year. Our dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 61% and year-to-date, it's 73%. Capital investment came in at $5.6 billion for the quarter and $10.3 billion year-to-date.
We also continue to find ample demand and great rates in the securitization market to help us manage our next receivable. We received about $1.1 billion in the second quarter or about the same as last year's second quarter. Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with business solutions. Those details are on Slide 6.
Total business solution revenues were down slightly due to the sale of certain hosting operations and foreign exchange pressure. Solid wireless and strategic business service revenue gains helped to offset lower wireless equipment sales and declines in legacy services. 
Business wireless revenues were up 2% with service revenue growth outpacing equipment declines. Margins also continued to expand, thanks to business efficiencies and wireless revenue growth offsetting lower wireline revenues. 
Looking at the customer segments. Small business operations continue to grow, thanks to gains on wireless. Enterprise revenues were flat. However, if you adjust for the sale of our divested business in FX, that segment also continued to grow in the quarter. Strategic business services continues to grow at a healthy clip, up more than $200 million year-over-year. That's up 8.4% on a reported basis. And when you adjust for FX, growth was 9%. 
Strategic business services are now 36% of business wireline revenues. The growth of strategic business services and mobility is changing the revenue mix in business solutions. Those 2 areas now make up more than 70% of business solutions revenues. And if you look at total debt in wireless, that's more than 80% of business revenues. So our transformation to next generation products and services is well on its way in our business segment.
Now let's move to our Entertainment Group results on Slide 7. On a comparative basis, we grew revenues in our Entertainment Group, thanks to gains in satellite subscribers, broadband revenue and advertising. This more than offset losses in legacy services while also overcoming the pressure from the record-breaking Mayweather-Pacquiao pay-per-view event in the year ago second quarter. We continue to see solid gains in broadband and advertising revenues. 
Broadband revenue was up nearly 7% in the quarter with IP broadband revenues up 15%. Advertising sales also continued its strong growth, up double digits year-to-date and is now more than a $1.4 billion annualized revenue stream. We're well positioned in this space, and we're looking to play a leading role in taking our ad offerings across all screens. 
At the same time, we again saw continued margin expansion, which points directly to the benefits of the DIRECTV acquisition. Our margins, on a comparable basis, were up 90 basis points and were up even more if you adjust it for the prior year pay-per-view event. 
Our second quarter customer video metrics were impacted by the usual seasonal pressures, but improved nicely over last year. Our satellite net adds continued to be robust as we added 342,000 satellite subscribers in the quarter. More than 80% of our domestic video business is now on DIRECTV platform. Broadband net subscriber results also were impacted by seasonality as we added 54,000 IP broadband subscribers in the quarter. When you include business subscribers, the company added 74,000 IP broadband subscribers. As we expected, this growth was below recent quarters with second quarter seasonality, but we expect IP broadband net adds to bounce back in the second half of the year. Now let's move to our U.S. mobility results on Slide 8.
As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are divided between the business solutions and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations. Increasing profitability and a growing subscriber base continues to be the story in our wireless operations. 
For the second straight quarter, we turned in a record EBITDA margin of 41.4%. Service margins were also a record, reaching nearly 50% in the quarter, both were up 130 basis points year-over-year. A sharp focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove the margin expansion. Equipment revenues were down due to a year-over-year increase in BYOD subs and a lower upgrade rate. Service revenues increased sequentially, but were down year-over-year.
At the same time, phone-only ARPU, plus Next billing, was up 2.5% with average monthly billings growing to $70. This growth comes even as we see an increasing number of subscribers holding onto their devices longer after completing their scheduled Next payments. 
About half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 75% of postpaid smartphone subscribers are on a no-device-subsidy plan. Postpaid churn came in strong with its second-lowest-ever quarter at 0.97%. Postpaid phone-only churn was even lower and smartphone churn was still lower. And even with the pressures from reseller, our total churn was very low at 1.35%. 
Branded phone add increased in the quarter. Branded domestic phone net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up 185,000, thanks to strength in our Cricket brand. We also continue to expand our valuable smartphone base, adding nearly 800,000 domestic branded smartphones in the quarter. And if you look at the chart on the lower left-hand corner of the slide, you can see that our overall phone base has more subscribers today than we did 1 year ago, thanks to strength in postpaid and prepaid smartphones.
And our postpaid smartphone base by itself is up 1 million in the same time as feature phones transitioned to smartphones. We had another solid quarter adding subscribers. Including our Mexico operations, we added 2.1 million new subscribers that includes 1.4 million domestic wireless subs with connected devices, branded phones and tablets overcoming losses in reseller, largely due to disconnects from our 2G network. Prepaid net adds in the quarter were impacted by 2 events. 
First, we aligned our churn policy across our prepaid platform. This favorable impact was generally offset by the negative impact resulting from a network outage caused by a vendor's equipment. As noted in our reseller numbers, we're starting to see some churn pressure associated with the planned shutdown of our 2G network at the end of this year. That will increase as we move closer to the shutdown. We'll manage through the process and the cost savings from 1 less network to support will be meaningful, so will the additional Spectrum available to redeploy. Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 9.
Let's start with Mexico. We continue to make significant progress in building our customer base and deploying our 4G LTE network. We added 742,000 wireless subscribers in the second quarter as we near the 10 million subscriber mark in the country. 
Our LTE deployment also was on track. We now serve 65 million people in Mexico with our most advanced network and expect to reach 75 million by the end of this year. That brings our total North American LTE deployment to 380 million POPs. Our rebranding to AT&T also continues to make progress. We now reach 61 cities with the AT&T brand, including our largest market, Mexico City. Second quarter revenue was up 13% sequentially, driven by equipment sales and wholesale revenues.
Revenue growth was impacted by lower ARPUs as the competitive environment is -- has intensified. In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continue to show revenue growth, up 8% sequentially. Revenues are being hampered by challenging economics. However, we did see subscriber growth adding 87,000 video customers in the quarter in part due to the COPA America soccer tournament. But as you might expect, the earthquake in Ecuador did pressure our overall subscriber growth in Latin America. But even with these economic conditions, we continue to be a profitable and generate positive cash flow from these operations for the quarter. Now that we're midway through the year, let's take a look at how we are doing relative to the guidance we set out in January, that's on Slide 10.
We're on track to meet or exceed each of the metrics we have laid out for you. Consolidated revenues are growing at a double-digit pace, thanks to our acquisition of DIRECTV. This comes even with pressure from lower equipment sales and foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS is up about 7% year-to-date, above guidance, but in line with where we expect it to be at this time. 
Consolidated margins are stable as margin expansion in our domestic operations is offsetting investment pressure from Mexico. We are focused on growing our valuable subscriber base across our business, including Mexico, where growth has been strong. We are willing to make additional investments to gain quality customers. 
Capital investment is trending to the low end of our guidance at its current pace, and we are ahead of plans with free cash flow. Dividend coverage for the first half of the year was 73%. We continue to feel confident that we will meet or beat our free cash flow guidance for the year. Now I'd like to spend the remainder of our time providing a strategic update on our business. That begins on Slide 12.
As Mike mentioned, we have often updated you on our company's strategy and direction. But today, we like to take a longer look at how we have uniquely positioned AT&T to lead in the rapidly evolving world of communications and video entertainment. Our goal is to be the world's premier integrated communications company for both consumers and businesses, and we plan to do this in the most cost-efficient way possible. This strategy did not happen overnight. It has been part of every business decision we've made for many years. No one else has our portfolio of assets, no one else has our cost-structure opportunity, and no one else can offer the integrated solutions that we can. 
Behind all this is a solid financial foundation that gives us the strength and flexibility to invest in our business while returning value to shareholders. This includes our strong liquidity position, our market-based compensation and benefit plans and thoughtful debt management. 
For example, we successfully negotiated workforce contracts that are market based, but also encourage employees to keep our owner's interest in mind while rewarding them when we succeed for shareholders. We also have a world-class Board of Directors, who provide great insight, while at the same time, challenge us. This makes us stronger and helps us navigate through these transformative times. We are uniquely positioned in this industry. All of this will be critical as mobile broadband, high-speed connectivity and entertainment come together. Let's first talk about the connectivity building blocks that we have assembled on Slide 13.
Since the introduction of the first smartphone, we've seen unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic. Even more incredibly, we expect that to continue to grow at a very strong pace. To meet this demand, we undertook several strategic initiatives to improve the capacity of our network for today and the years to come. Here is what we've accomplished.
First, we ratchet up our investment cycle with Project VIP. This was crucial to getting the high-quality, high-capacity network we have today. Our 4G LTE network deployment was accelerated. Fiber backhaul deployed and cell sites built. We now have almost 70,000 cell sites, thousands more than our largest competitor. And a move into the Mexico wireless market further expands our LTE reach. 
We also drove fiber deeper in our wireline network. We added more than 1 million business locations to our fiber network. And we expanded our IP broadband footprint to more than 60 million customer locations. The next phase of driving fiber into our network is our GigaPower deployment. 
Over the next few years, we expect to reach at least 12.5 million customer locations with our gigabit broadband service. We now have more than 2.2 million Fiber to the Home customer locations, and we expect to reach 2.6 million or more by the end of the year. Our already dense wireless network and expanding fiber footprint puts us in an excellent position as we move to more small cells and 5G.
We've already filed patents, trials are already underway and testing is ongoing. When 5G is ready to roll, we will be ready as well. At the same time, we launched VIP, we move to expand our Spectrum portfolio. We have about 150 megahertz of spectrum in our portfolio today, including 40 megahertz of relatively untapped AWS and WCS spectrum. We have the best, most balanced Spectrum portfolio in the industry. Adding Spectrum is the most effective way to add capacity. This year, we expect to add 35,000 LTE carriers compared to the 18,000 deployed last year. We also continue to make smaller Spectrum deals to round out our coverage and redeploy Spectrum once dedicated to 2G and 3G.
Last week's move by the SEC to make high-frequency radio Spectrum available for 5G wireless service is another step forward to provide even more spectrum. And while we are not going to elaborate, AT&T has applied to be a participant in the broadcast Spectrum Auction and has also submitted a bid in the FirstNet process that is currently underway. 
Our network transformation is now pivoting to software-defined networking or SDN. With SDN, we are virtualizing network functions that used to require dedicated fixed equipment and software as the end gives us flexible, dynamic and smart network capability. We ended last year with about 5% of our network functions virtualized and expect to reach 30% by the end of this year. We are on path to achieve 75% network virtualization by 2020. SDN also provide cost savings, which supports our drive to an industry-leading cost structure. Let's discuss that on Slide 14.
Having an industry-leading cost structure, helps us expand margins and grow free cash flow. And I have a line of sight to continue margin improvement, as well as reaching our goal of $20 billion in free cash flow. This is what we need to do to reach those goals.
Step one is achieving the cost synergies from our DIRECTV acquisition. We are on track to achieve $1.5 billion plus run rate synergies with DTV by the end of this year. That puts us well on our way to hit our projected $2.5 billion plus run rate savings by the end of 2018. 
Step two is our work to drive efficiencies with Project Agile. This work includes our efforts to serve customers digitally, automating service delivery, streamlining operations and other cost-efficiency initiatives. Our goal is to generate a $3 billion run rate in cost savings, and we are moving past the midway point of making that happen. We're also have not been shy about exiting nonstrategic businesses that don't fit our margin expansion profile. That includes global hubbing, and more recently, certain hosting operations. Obviously, that reduces revenue, but increases overall profitability.
Finally, we must continue to lead the industry in our move to software-defined networking. We are virtualizing functions that previously require dedicated solutions, dedicated hardware, dedicated software, dedicated team. This virtualization manifests itself into real, sustained cost savings throughout the network and the business. That savings in both our capital expenditures and our cash operating expenses. It also gives customers greater control of their network services, more agility and simplicity in the way they do business with us as well as better value on ours and our customers' hardware investment.
Now let's look at something that really separates us from the rest of our industry, our integrated solutions approach. That's on Slide 15. 
While it starts with connectivity and cannot be sustained without an effective cost structure, you must have assets to create products customers want, delivered where and how they want them to be successful. We've talked about these assets, so let's bring this point home. 
We are in every major market in the U.S., with reach around the world. We have a 4G LTE footprint that covers 380 million people in North America. We have more fiber connecting more buildings and more business customer locations than anyone else. That's in footprint and out, which helps us compete today, but also positions us very well for 5G. And we're also the biggest TV provider in the world, and we're about to introduce an over-the-top product that we believe will be a game changer.
DIRECTV now is scheduled for launch later this year, and we expect the millions of people, who don't now subscribe to video service and prefers a streaming option, will be impressed. At the same time, no one can match what we offer business customers. We have the ability to serve all business customers from Fortune 1000 companies to the local ice cream shop on the corner. And no matter how big or how small the business is, almost every conversation with business customers begins with mobility and security, and that is where we excel.
When you take our extensive fiber network, then later on SDN, security and mobility and new software-enabled services, you have the premier integrated business services company. We believe we have a significant competitive advantage to use our connectivity and cost structure to offer integrated solutions to our customers. Whether you are in the C-suite of a major company or the master suite of your own home and anywhere in between, AT&T delivers. We have a robust, dynamic and attractive set of products architected on a network that is flexible and able to quickly adapt to the future. That's table stakes if you want to be the world's premier integrated communications company, and that is exactly what we expect to be.
Now before we get to your question, allow me to quickly summarize, and that's on Slide 16. We are very confident in our unique strategy. We have the assets we need and we are executing on our plan. Our DIRECTV cost synergies are hitting the target. Project Agile is on track. And we are ahead on the move to software-defined network. All this drive us towards an industry-leading cost structure. But we're most excited about what lies ahead. 
We have a dedicated and skilled group of people working for us from the crew staffing our work centers to the leaders in the boardroom, we have a team of professionals focused on making AT&T the world's premier integrated communications company. Our differentiated position opens the door for some game-changing opportunities, and we're ready to walk through it. We're confident we can execute on our strategy and continue to build value for our shareholders. With that, let's go to your questions."

As we look to the second half, could you talk about the major variables that would kind of maybe swing you back down towards more the base-case expectation for the year versus the -- or better part of the guidance that you were discussing? And then, second, I was wondering if we could just touch on this issue of kind of the economics of postpaid sub losses versus prepaid sub gains. I guess you had about 319,000 prepaid gains versus 180,000 postpaid losses. Can you talk about the relative economics of those 2 things?

On the economics so forth -- the postpaid subs were losing a lot of all feature phones. They are averaging about somewhere around $35, maybe a little bit less than ARPU, and have costs associated that postpaid do with retaining them. On the prepaid side, we're probably closer to a $41, $42, depending upon the specifics average ARPU, and much less, they're very, very small subscriber acquisition cost, software costs, maintenance costs, being -- by the very nature being prepaid. So from that standpoint, the economics are better, and it is being shown in our margins. When you look at our margins, total EBITDA margins or service margins, you can see the growth and you can see that level. That's a part of what's driving it. So the economics are -- and we're running the business on a branded basis. We think of branded customers and then try not to make distinctions on classification, really make distinctions on economics. And I think it's showing up in our profitability. Now with regard to the variables of the second half, there's a lot of things that happen. There's some seasonality in the fourth quarter in our wireless business, in our video business, we'll have the NFL Ticket come out. and we'll have the launching of the DTV Now and to the over -- of the over-the-top offers. And so we'll have a whole host of things going on. I will just suggest to you, we're very confident where we're at and continue to do well. And I wouldn't suggest to you that there's anything necessarily unique or different about to the second half of the year. Just we're careful with our guidance and want to make sure that we meet or exceed it. So we feel very good about where we're at after 6 months."

If you think about the technology development, that's on track. If you think about the assets we need to provide that, those have been acquired. Those are attractive. If you think about the contracts we need to get the stacking rights and digital rights, those are going well.

You've got another $1 billion in synergies, another $1.5 billion in Project Agile. Is the rest come from virtualization over that period? If you could give us a little more detail on that, and I would imagine you will be paying some more taxes over time as well. So how does that all sort of fit together to bridge us to that $20 billion number? And then, as you talk about in the -- some previous slides, you're a little bit -- you've underspent the $22 billion BOE on CapEx a little bit here in the first half. Does that mean there's -- we have a sort of downward biased to CapEx at this point?"

Couple of things. One, if you think about the free cash flow, if you think about the $59 billion that we started with last year and you add in the kind of the $2.5 billion opportunity with DIRECTV, you add in the remainder of the $3 billion opportunity from Agile. And then you add in maybe a 1%, I'll say is illustrative reduction in capital intensity and some costs, some cash operating expense savings, you can see that those 3 items there can get you well over $5 billion. In addition, we expect to grow our EBITDA and grow our profitability of the business. And so when you put those things together, it looks to be an achievable, realistic path from last year's $59 billion to a $20 billion number as a goal in the near future. And so that's what we are looking at. That's how we build it up. We're not giving a prediction date on that, but we feel good about the opportunities to significantly grow free cash flow. With regard to our CapEx, I just want to be very straightforward, and it sounds that we are at $10.3 billion and on an annualized basis, that would come below the $22 billion. We'll continue, as I've said before, to invest as appropriate, not towards a targeted $22 billion number, but rather towards what business cases make sense and when it makes sense for us to be in the market investing. Sometimes that causes quarters to be much heavier in CapEx like we had in the fourth quarter last year. And other times, like in the first 6 months this year, we spend it on lower rate. We're just being very careful with every dollar. But right now, the performance we've had for the first 6 months is a trend to on the low end of our guidance."

It looks like, obviously, feature phones have come down dramatically over the past 8 quarters or so. As that sort of approaches a lower level, does that provide a tailwind to get postpaid phone additions back to a positive territory? Obviously, you've got DTV cross selling, DTV Now products rolling out, over-the-top products rolling out. I presume that could also help. And then just, secondly, on the video adds for the year. The anticipation there, is it that DIRECTV continues to ramp, it's been doing a great job. Is it that? Or is it U-verse becoming less of a headwind on the back half of the year to get to a positive video number?"

We do think the 2G losses, as we go through the year, we'll see those. But getting past this year, you'll see the opportunity to have a more positive impact because we're through that process. 
Secondly, our feature phones, which include some 2G devices, but our feature phones are going down. And as they go down and that, if you will, legacy products, so to speak, impact on our results is lessened, certainly, we have a brighter opportunity, a more real -- a better opportunity to grow out of those customer base. And then third, on the bundling, as we really get into the second half of the year and are able to do single truck install, which may be bundling a video and satellite and broadband. But also, that whole activity of bundling, as the longer -- the more time our teams get to do it, the better we'll get at it. And so from that perspective, we do think that will provide us an opportunity to grow more wireless. So all 3 of those things help. And yes, we're optimistic about it. But I will tell you also, it's really about the branded net adds and the economic net adds. It's not about any one category of net adds. It's getting those customers that are the most profitable, highest quality. With regard to the video side, on a seasonality basis, we usually do see less. Now we see more pressure in the second quarter and then first half from the U-verse side. And quite frankly, so is DTV in the past. So going forward, I would hope that we would see -- we'd expect to see some improvement on both sides. When you think about DIRECTV, things like the NFL Ticket, Sunday and some of the other offers, as we see these trends of bundling improving and attachment rates improving, we feel really good about the opportunity to improve our trends and get to our goal of positive video net adds for the year."

As we've said along, it shows some benefits to the second half of this year. But once again, I would suggest to you, the team has done a really good job of doing the bundling between wireless and the video products alone and getting 5 million of these customers to sign up for this bundled approach with regard to video and wireless. It's just the best proof I can offer you that we've already done, they've already accomplished that this works and that we have a real opportunity to exceed our merge integration synergies because we will have an opportunity to add revenues to those while most of those synergies were really focused on costs."

As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the ARPUs is right at $70 on a per customer basis when you take into account the total billings. Those are really impressive levels. Very good for us historically from any measurement or straight ARPU prior to the equipment installment days or in the most recent years with the equipment installment. So on a monthly basis, from our customers, we're doing very, very well with revenue base. Secondly, it is a competitive environment. And it will -- and it has been for years. It will remain in that. We believe that we are doing well with that. And we think it's proven out in our margins, in our profitability, in our cash flows. I would tell you, just one side inside item that we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have about 500,000 BYOD devices. We had customers walk in with 500,000 phones and said, ""can we connect them to your network?"" Those are all net adds. They don't show up in equipment revenue. And I think depending upon what package they show up, they'll show up in service revenues. But they are really profitable, they're low cost. We love them, and that doesn't necessarily show up. And you're immediate look at the financials, but it is clearly showing up in our profitability and our margins. So I would ask you to focus on those items as well as our service revenues. Specifically with regard to our service revenues, you've seen our additional piece of our customer base shift to Mobile Share Value, I think we went from about 64% up to 75%. We did have some additional customers shift off of the -- shift to the no-subsidy plans, which impacted service revenues. And we continue to do normal promotions through some of the incentives credits, free services, normal promotional activity. All of those things are impacting service revenues as expected. With regard to recent activities in the marketplace, we'll see how those play out. We'll just focus on getting the best-quality customers and providing really great service. Some of the changes we've seen give us reason for optimism. Many of the changes we've seen give us reason to be really careful and watch how the market develops and be ready to prepare and lead, quite frankly, in a market with the performance that we've got."

On the CapEx budget, we've been -- we've done well kind of in all aspects of it. A couple of things. One, we've been able to -- because of our software-defined network, we're starting to see a little bit of those savings. If you think about our buying capacity in the overall economic conditions, we've been able to get some volume pricing and some purchasing power benefits. Certainly, we're getting more efficient with what we do. I will tell you, though, that one of the things, I think, people miss out on is that because of the Spectrum that we've invested in over the last 2, say, 5 years or so, we've got a lot of effective capital deployment that doesn't involve a lot of dollars. It involves deploying Spectrum. And that's a really efficient way to deploy capacity. And so on a per unit capacity, our dollars can be really efficient because of the spectrum portfolio that we have that we're putting in use. I think that's a real big benefit. From a customer base perspective, we're very pleased with the subscriber base we have, whether it's the business subscriber base that we have, what we saw in the small business side and the growth there, whether we see it in the enterprise side. When you look at the consumer side, the prepaid business is growing well. And quite frankly, the margin improvement from Cricket is helping drive the margin improvement in the overall business of wireless. So that's great. And then, of course, some of the premier customers, the video space, are using our U-verse and our DTV services. So we feel great about our customer base. With regard to that, we're willing to invest dollars to retain and attract additional quality customers, whether here in the United States or in Mexico and Latin America. We'll be focus on that, but we'll be careful with it. I would suggest to you the characteristics, the titles we give those prepaid, postpaid, over-the-top versus monthly subscription, are less important as the economics of the profitability of those offers. And that's what we'll be focused on."

So we think that, if you will, headed in the wrong direction, we'll continue to present our case on that. On title 2, we always expected the final resolution to be enhanced in the Supreme Court. And we'll work with -- through the process and file the Supreme Court process closely and then make our decisions going from that on. I would suggest to you those are really kind of my comments on all of those matters. With regard to, Simon, the home media gateway, I'd suggest to you, this aspect that we continue -- and I'm not going to be able to give you a detailed answer. I'm not going to try to on a home media gateway. But what I will tell you is that we continue to believe that as we go through the process, we can get cost synergies in DTV by standardizing the interfaces whether they get the video over the satellite, whether they get over the broadband or whether they get over the IP television. And we continue to work on those activities to standardize the graphic user interface, the set-top boxes and what many would consider a gateway, our home gateway for media. Those activities continue beyond and will continue to work for that. It's a natural efficiency. And it's also a really good quality service for the customers."

It's been 1 year since we closed on our deal to acquire DIRECTV, and it's been a heck of a year. We are hitting the mark with our synergy targets. Our cost synergies are ahead of plan. And we're about ready to take the wraps off some exciting news streaming opportunities that will expand our customer base and extend our video position. We've added nearly 1 million U.S. satellite subscribers since we closed the deal. We were excited a year ago when DTV first came on board, and that enthusiasm has only grown. We'll talk more about that in just a few minutes. But now let me begin by discussing our second quarter results starting with our financial summary on Slide 5.
Second quarter consolidated revenues grew to $40.5 billion, largely due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. But we also saw growth in satellite, video, advertising and IP services on a comparable basis. This offset pressure from lower year-over-year wireless equipment sales and foreign exchange. 
Adjusted earnings growth continued. After adjustments, second quarter EPS was $0.72 a share, up year-over-year and up about 7% year-to-date. This quarter's growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations, and we had more than $0.01 of pressure from compensation-related programs tied to our stock price. Most of this is from a success based compensation plan we have for our bargained-for employees. 
We're pleased for our employees, all our employees, in that they have an opportunity to share in the success that they have helped create for our shareholders. Margins also continue to be a solid story, thanks to our focus on profitability and our best-ever wireless EBITDA margin. We once again saw adjusted margin expansion on a consolidated basis and in every domestic business segment. This solid performance helped drive strong cash flows. 
Operating cash flow was $10.3 billion, with free cash flow reaching $4.8 billion, up 8.4% year-over-year. Our dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 61% and year-to-date, it's 73%. Capital investment came in at $5.6 billion for the quarter and $10.3 billion year-to-date.
We also continue to find ample demand and great rates in the securitization market to help us manage our next receivable. We received about $1.1 billion in the second quarter or about the same as last year's second quarter. Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with business solutions. Those details are on Slide 6.
Total business solution revenues were down slightly due to the sale of certain hosting operations and foreign exchange pressure. Solid wireless and strategic business service revenue gains helped to offset lower wireless equipment sales and declines in legacy services. 
Business wireless revenues were up 2% with service revenue growth outpacing equipment declines. Margins also continued to expand, thanks to business efficiencies and wireless revenue growth offsetting lower wireline revenues. 
Looking at the customer segments. Small business operations continue to grow, thanks to gains in wireless. Enterprise revenues were flat. However, if you adjust for the sale of our divested business in FX, that segment also continued to grow in the quarter. Strategic business services continues to grow at a healthy clip, up more than $200 million year-over-year. That's up 8.4% on a reported basis. And when you adjust for FX, growth was 9%. 
Strategic business services are now 36% of business wireline revenues. The growth of strategic business services and mobility is changing the revenue mix in business solutions. Those 2 areas now make up more than 70% of business solutions revenues. And if you look at total debt in wireless, that's more than 80% of business revenues. So our transformation to next generation products and services is well on its way in our business segment.
Now let's move to our Entertainment Group results on Slide 7. On a comparative basis, we grew revenues in our Entertainment Group, thanks to gains in satellite subscribers, broadband revenue and advertising. This more than offset losses in legacy services while also overcoming the pressure from the record-breaking Mayweather-Pacquiao pay-per-view event in the year ago second quarter. We continue to see solid gains in broadband and advertising revenues. 
Broadband revenue was up nearly 7% in the quarter with IP broadband revenues up 15%. Advertising sales also continued its strong growth, up double digits year-to-date and is now more than a $1.4 billion annualized revenue stream. We're well positioned in this space, and we're looking to play a leading role in taking our ad offerings across all screens. 
At the same time, we again saw continued margin expansion, which points directly to the benefits of the DIRECTV acquisition. Our margins, on a comparable basis, were up 90 basis points and were up even more if you adjusted for the prior year pay-per-view event. 
Our second quarter customer video metrics were impacted by the usual seasonal pressures, but improved nicely over last year. Our satellite net adds continued to be robust as we added 342,000 satellite subscribers in the quarter. More than 80% of our domestic video business is now on DIRECTV platform. Broadband net subscriber results also were impacted by seasonality as we added 54,000 IP broadband subscribers in the quarter. When you include business subscribers, the company added 74,000 IP broadband subscribers. As we expected, this growth was below recent quarters with second quarter seasonality, but we expect IP broadband net adds to bounce back in the second half of the year. Now let's move to our U.S. mobility results on Slide 8.
As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are divided between the business solutions and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations. Increasing profitability and a growing subscriber base continues to be the story in our wireless operations. 
For the second straight quarter, we turned in a record EBITDA margin of 41.4%. Service margins were also a record, reaching nearly 50% in the quarter, both were up 130 basis points year-over-year. A sharp focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove the margin expansion. Equipment revenues were down due to a year-over-year increase in BYOD subs and a lower upgrade rate. Service revenues increased sequentially, but were down year-over-year.
At the same time, phone-only ARPU, plus Next billing, was up 2.5% with average monthly billings growing to $70. This growth comes even as we see an increasing number of subscribers holding onto their devices longer after completing their scheduled Next payments. 
About half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 75% of postpaid smartphone subscribers are on a no-device-subsidy plan. Postpaid churn came in strong with its second-lowest-ever quarter at 0.97%. Postpaid phone-only churn was even lower and smartphone churn was still lower. And even with the pressures from reseller, our total churn was very low at 1.35%. 
Branded phone adds increased in the quarter. Branded domestic phone net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up 185,000, thanks to strength in our Cricket brand. We also continue to expand our valuable smartphone base, adding nearly 800,000 domestic branded smartphones in the quarter. And if you look at the chart on the lower left-hand corner of the slide, you can see that our overall phone base has more subscribers today than we did 1 year ago, thanks to strength in postpaid and prepaid smartphones.
And our postpaid smartphone base by itself is up 1 million in the same time as feature phones transitioned to smartphones. We had another solid quarter adding subscribers. Including our Mexico operations, we added 2.1 million new subscribers that includes 1.4 million domestic wireless subs with connected devices, branded phones and tablets overcoming losses in reseller, largely due to disconnects from our 2G network. Prepaid net adds in the quarter were impacted by 2 events. 
First, we aligned our churn policy across our prepaid platform. This favorable impact was generally offset by the negative impact resulting from a network outage caused by a vendor's equipment. As noted in our reseller numbers, we're starting to see some churn pressure associated with the planned shutdown of our 2G network at the end of this year. That will increase as we move closer to the shutdown. We'll manage through the process and the cost savings from 1 less network to support will be meaningful, so will the additional spectrum available to redeploy. Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 9.
Let's start with Mexico. We continue to make significant progress in building our customer base and deploying our 4G LTE network. We added 742,000 wireless subscribers in the second quarter as we near the 10 million subscriber mark in the country. 
Our LTE deployment also was on track. We now serve 65 million people in Mexico with our most advanced network and expect to reach 75 million by the end of this year. That brings our total North American LTE deployment to 380 million POPs. Our rebranding to AT&T also continues to make progress. We now reach 61 cities with the AT&T brand, including our largest market, Mexico City. Second quarter revenue was up 13% sequentially, driven by equipment sales and wholesale revenues.
Revenue growth was impacted by lower ARPUs as the competitive environment is -- has intensified. In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continue to show revenue growth, up 8% sequentially. Revenues are being hampered by challenging economics. However, we did see subscriber growth adding 87,000 video customers in the quarter in part due to the COPA America soccer tournament. But as you might expect, the earthquake in Ecuador did pressure our overall subscriber growth in Latin America. But even with these economic conditions, we continue to be a profitable and generate positive cash flow from these operations for the quarter. Now that we're midway through the year, let's take a look at how we are doing relative to the guidance we set out in January, that's on Slide 10.
We're on track to meet or exceed each of the metrics we have laid out for you. Consolidated revenues are growing at a double-digit pace, thanks to our acquisition of DIRECTV. This comes even with pressure from lower equipment sales and foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS is up about 7% year-to-date, above guidance, but in line with where we expected to be at this time. 
Consolidated margins are stable as margin expansion in our domestic operations is offsetting investment pressure from Mexico. We are focused on growing our valuable subscriber base across our business, including Mexico, where growth has been strong. We are willing to make additional investments to gain quality customers. 
Capital investment is trending to the low end of our guidance at its current pace, and we are ahead of plans with free cash flow. Dividend coverage for the first half of the year was 73%. We continue to feel confident that we will meet or beat our free cash flow guidance for the year. Now I'd like to spend the remainder of our time providing a strategic update on our business. That begins on Slide 12.
As Mike mentioned, we have often updated you on our company's strategy and direction. But today, we like to take a longer look at how we have uniquely positioned AT&T to lead in the rapidly evolving world of communications and video entertainment. Our goal is to be the world's premier integrated communications company for both consumers and businesses, and we plan to do this in the most cost-efficient way possible. This strategy did not happen overnight. It has been part of every business decision we've made for many years. No one else has our portfolio of assets, no one else has our cost-structure opportunity, and no one else can offer the integrated solutions that we can. 
Behind all this is a solid financial foundation that gives us the strength and flexibility to invest in our business while returning value to shareholders. This includes our strong liquidity position, our market-based compensation and benefit plans and thoughtful debt management. 
For example, we successfully negotiated workforce contracts that are market based, but also encourage employees to keep our owner's interest in mind while rewarding them when we succeed for shareholders. We also have a world-class Board of Directors, who provide great insight, while at the same time, challenge us. This makes us stronger and helps us navigate through these transformative times. We are uniquely positioned in this industry. All of this will be critical as mobile broadband, high-speed connectivity and entertainment come together. Let's first talk about the connectivity building blocks that we have assembled on Slide 13.
Since the introduction of the first smartphone, we've seen unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic. Even more incredibly, we expect that to continue to grow at a very strong pace. To meet this demand, we undertook several strategic initiatives to improve the capacity of our network for today and the years to come. Here is what we've accomplished.
First, we ratcheted up our investment cycle with Project VIP. This was crucial to getting the high-quality, high-capacity network we have today. Our 4G LTE network deployment was accelerated. Fiber backhauls deployed and cell sites built. We now have almost 70,000 cell sites, thousands more than our largest competitor. And a move into the Mexico wireless market further expands our LTE reach. 
We also drove fiber deeper in our wireline network. We added more than 1 million business locations to our fiber network. And we expanded our IP broadband footprint to more than 60 million customer locations. The next phase of driving fiber into our network is our GigaPower deployment. 
Over the next few years, we expect to reach at least 12.5 million customer locations with our gigabit broadband service. We now have more than 2.2 million Fiber to the Home customer locations, and we expect to reach 2.6 million or more by the end of the year. Our already dense wireless network and expanding fiber footprint puts us in an excellent position as we move to more small cells and 5G.
We've already filed patents, trials are already underway and testing is ongoing. When 5G is ready to roll, we will be ready as well. At the same time we launched VIP, we moved to expand our Spectrum portfolio. We have about 150 megahertz of spectrum in our portfolio today, including 40 megahertz of relatively untapped AWS and WCS spectrum. We have the best, most balanced spectrum portfolio in the industry. Adding spectrum is the most effective way to add capacity. This year, we expect to add 35,000 LTE carriers compared to the 18,000 deployed last year. We also continue to make smaller spectrum deals to round out our coverage and redeploy spectrum once dedicated to 2G and 3G.
Last week's move by the SEC to make high-frequency radio spectrum available for 5G wireless service is another step forward to provide even more spectrum. And while we are not going to elaborate, AT&T has applied to be a participant in the broadcast spectrum auction and has also submitted a bid in the FirstNet process that is currently underway. 
Our network transformation is now pivoting to software-defined networking or SDN. With SDN, we are virtualizing network functions that used to require dedicated fixed equipment and software. SDN gives us flexible, dynamic and smart network capability. We ended last year with about 5% of our network functions virtualized and expect to reach 30% by the end of this year. We are on path to achieve 75% network virtualization by 2020. SDN also provide cost savings, which supports our drive to an industry-leading cost structure. Let's discuss that on Slide 14.
Having an industry-leading cost structure, helps us expand margins and grow free cash flow. We now have a line of sight to continue margin improvement, as well as reaching our goal of $20 billion in free cash flow. This is what we need to do to reach those goals.
Step one is achieving the cost synergies from our DIRECTV acquisition. We are on track to achieve $1.5 billion plus run rate synergies with DTV by the end of this year. That puts us well on our way to hit our projected $2.5 billion plus run rate savings by the end of 2018. 
Step two is our work to drive efficiencies with Project Agile. This work includes our efforts to serve customers digitally, automating service delivery, streamlining operations and other cost-efficiency initiatives. Our goal is to generate a $3 billion run rate in cost savings, and we are moving past the midway point of making that happen. We're also have not been shy about exiting nonstrategic businesses that don't fit our margin expansion profile. That includes global hubbing, and more recently, certain hosting operations. Obviously, that reduces revenue, but increases overall profitability.
Finally, we must continue to lead the industry in our move to software-defined networking. We are virtualizing functions that previously required dedicated solutions, dedicated hardware, dedicated software, dedicated teams. This virtualization manifests itself into real, sustained cost savings throughout the network and the business. That savings in both our capital expenditures and our cash operating expenses. It also gives customers greater control of their network services, more agility and simplicity in the way they do business with us as well as better value on ours and our customers' hardware investment.
Now let's look at something that really separates us from the rest of our industry, our integrated solutions approach. That's on Slide 15. 
While it starts with connectivity and cannot be sustained without an effective cost structure, you must have assets to create products customers want, delivered where and how they want them to be successful. We've talked about these assets, so let's bring this point home. 
We are in every major market in the U.S., with reach around the world. We have a 4G LTE footprint that covers 380 million people in North America. We have more fiber connecting more buildings and more business customer locations than anyone else. That's in footprint and out, which helps us compete today, but also positions us very well for 5G. And we are also the biggest TV provider in the world, and we're about to introduce an over-the-top product that we believe will be a game changer.
DIRECTV Now is scheduled for launch later this year, and we expect the millions of people, who don't now subscribe to video service and prefer a streaming option, will be impressed. At the same time, no one can match what we offer business customers. We have the ability to serve all business customers from Fortune 1000 companies to the local ice cream shop on the corner. And no matter how big or how small the business is, almost every conversation with business customers begins with mobility and security, and that is where we excel.
When you take our extensive fiber network and then later on SDN, security and mobility and new software-enabled services, you have the premier integrated business services company. We believe we have a significant competitive advantage to use our connectivity and cost structure to offer integrated solutions to our customers. Whether you are in the C-suite of a major company or the master suite of your own home and anywhere in between, AT&T delivers. We have a robust, dynamic and attractive set of products architected on a network that is flexible and able to quickly adapt to the future. That's table stakes if you want to be the world's premier integrated communications company, and that is exactly what we expect to be.
Now before we get to your questions, allow me to quickly summarize, and that's on Slide 16. We are very confident in our unique strategy. We have the assets we need and we are executing on our plan. Our DIRECTV cost synergies are hitting the target. Project Agile is on track. And we are ahead in the move to software-defined networking. All this drive us towards an industry-leading cost structure. But we're most excited about what lies ahead. 
We have a dedicated and skilled group of people working for us from the crew staffing our work centers to the leaders in the boardroom, we have a team of professionals focused on making AT&T the world's premier integrated communications company. Our differentiated position opens the door for some game-changing opportunities, and we're ready to walk through it.

As we look to the second half, could you talk about the major variables that would kind of maybe swing you back down towards more the base-case expectation for the year versus the -- or better part of the guidance that you were discussing? And then, second, I was wondering if we could just touch on this issue of kind of the economics of postpaid sub losses versus prepaid sub gains. I guess you had about 319,000 prepaid gains versus 180,000 postpaid losses. Can you talk about the relative economics of those 2 things? And are we looking at a net economic positive or negative trade-off when we look at that?"

On the economics so forth -- the postpaid subs we're losing are a lot of all feature phones. They are averaging about somewhere around $35, maybe a little bit less, in ARPU and have costs associated that -- postpaid do, with retaining them. On the prepaid side, we're probably closer to a $41, $42, depending upon the specifics, average ARPU and much less, very, very small subscriber acquisition costs, upfront costs, maintenance costs, being -- by the very nature of being prepaid. So from that standpoint, the economics are better, and it is being shown in our margins. When you look at our margins, total EBITDA margins or service margins, you can see the growth and you can see that level. That's a part of what's driving it. So the economics are -- and we're running the business on a branded basis. We think of branded customers and then try not to make distinctions on classification, really make distinctions on economics. And I think it's showing up in our profitability. 
Now with regard to the variables of the second half, there's a lot of things that happen. There's some seasonality in the fourth quarter in our wireless business, in our video business, we'll have the NFL Ticket come out. and we'll have the launching of the DTV Now and some of the over-the-top offers. And so we'll have a whole host of things going on. I would just suggest to you, we're very confident where we're at and continue to do well. And I wouldn't suggest to you that there's anything necessarily unique or different about the second half of the year. Just we're careful with our guidance and want to make sure that we meet or exceed it. So we feel very good about where we're at through 6 months."

If you could give us a little more detail on that, and I would imagine you will be paying some more taxes over time as well. So how does that all sort of fit together to bridge us to that $20 billion number? 
And then, as you talk about in the -- some previous slides, you're a little bit -- you've underspent the $22 billion BOE on CapEx a little bit here in the first half. Does that mean there's -- we have a sort of downward biased to CapEx at this point?"

Couple of things. One, if you think about the free cash flow, if you think about the $15.9 billion that we started with last year and you add in the kind of the $2.5 billion opportunity with DIRECTV, you add in the remainder of the $3 billion opportunity from Agile. And then you add in maybe a 1%, I'll say is illustrative reduction in capital intensity and some costs, some cash operating expense savings, you can see that those 3 items there can get you well over $5 billion. In addition, we expect to grow our EBITDA and grow our profitability of the business. And so when you put those things together, it looks to be an achievable, real, realistic path from last year's $15.9 billion to a $20 billion number as a goal in the near future. And so that's what we are looking at. That's how we build it up. We're not giving a prediction date on that, but we feel good about the opportunities to significantly grow free cash flow. 
With regard to our CapEx, I just want to be very straightforward, and it sounds that we are at $10.3 billion and on an annualized basis, that would come below the $22 billion. We'll continue, as I've said before, to invest as appropriate, not towards a targeted $22 billion number, but rather towards what business cases make sense and when it makes sense for us to be in the market investing. Sometimes that causes quarters to be much heavier in CapEx like we had in the fourth quarter last year. And other times, like in the first 6 months this year, we spend at a lower rate. We're just being very careful with every dollar. But right now, the performance we've had for the first 6 months is a trend to on the low end of our guidance."

It looks like, obviously, feature phones have come down dramatically over the past 8 quarters or so. As that sort of approaches a lower level, does that provide a tailwind to get postpaid phone additions back to a positive territory? Obviously, you've got DTV cross selling, DTV Now products rolling out, over-the-top products rolling out. I presume that could also help. 
And then just, secondly, on the video adds for the year. The anticipation there, is it that DIRECTV continues to ramp, it's been doing a great job. Is it that? Or is it U-verse becoming less of a headwind on the back half of the year to get to a positive video number?"

We do think the 2G losses, as we go through the year, we'll see those. But getting past this year, you'll see the opportunity to have a more positive impact because we're through that process. 
Secondly, our feature phones, which include some 2G devices -- but our feature phones are going down. And as they go down and that, if you will, legacy products, so to speak, impact on our results is lessened, certainly, we have a brighter opportunity, a more real -- a better opportunity to grow out of those customer base. And then third, on the bundling, as we really get into the second half of the year and are able to do single truck install, which may be bundling a video and satellite and broadband. But also, that whole activity of bundling, as the longer -- the more time our teams get to do it, the better we'll get at it. And so from that perspective, we do think that will provide us an opportunity to grow more wireless. So all 3 of those things will help. And yes, we're optimistic about it. But I will tell you also, it's really about the branded net adds and the economic net adds. It's not about any one category of net adds. It's getting those customers that are the most profitable, highest quality. 
With regard to the video side, on a seasonality basis, we usually do see less. Now we see more pressure in the second quarter and then first half from the U-verse side. And quite frankly, so is DTV in the past. So going forward, I would hope that we would see -- we'd expect to see some improvement on both sides. When you think about DIRECTV, things like the NFL Ticket Sunday (sic) [ NFL SUNDAY TICKET ] and some of the other offers, as we see these trends of bundling improving and attachment rates improving, we feel really good about the opportunity to improve our trends and get to our goal of positive video net adds for the year."

As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the ARPU is right at $70 on a per customer basis when you take into account the total billings. Those are really impressive levels. Very good for us historically from any measurement, straight ARPU prior to the equipment installment days or in the most recent years with the equipment installment. So on a monthly basis, from our customers, we're doing very, very well with revenue base. Secondly, it is a competitive environment. And it will -- and it has been for years. It will remain in that. We believe that we are doing well with that. And we think it's proven out in our margins, in our profitability, in our cash flows. I would tell you, just one side inside item that we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had about 500,000 BYOD devices. We had customers walk in with 500,000 phones and said, ""Can we connect them to your network?"" Those are all net adds. They don't show up in equipment revenue. And depending upon what package they show up -- they'll show up in service revenues. But they are really profitable, they're low cost. We love them, and that doesn't necessarily show up. And you're immediate look at the financials, but it is clearly showing up in our profitability and our margins. So I would ask you to focus on those items as well as our service revenues. Specifically with regard to our service revenues, you've seen our additional piece of our customer base shift to Mobile Share Value, I think we went from about 64% up to 75%. We did have some additional customers shift off of the -- shift to the no-subsidy plans, which impacted service revenues. And we continue to do normal promotions through some of the incentives credits, free services, normal promotional activity. All of those things are impacting service revenues as expected. 
With regard to recent activities in the marketplace, we'll see how those play out. We'll just focus on getting the best-quality customers and providing really great service. Some of the changes we've seen give us reason for optimism. Many of the changes we've seen give us reason to be really careful and watch how the market develops and be ready to prepare and lead, quite frankly, in a market with the performance that we've got."

On the CapEx budget, we've been -- we've done well kind of in all aspects of it. A couple of things. One, we've been able to -- because of our software-defined network, we're starting to see a little bit of those savings. If you think about our buying capacity in the overall economic conditions, we've been able to get some volume pricing and some purchasing power benefits. Certainly, we're getting more efficient with what we do. I will tell you, though, that one of the things, I think, people miss out on is that because of the spectrum that we've invested in over the last, say, 5 years or so, we've got a lot of effective capital deployment that doesn't involve a lot of dollars. It involves deploying spectrum. And that's a really efficient way to deploy capacity. And so on a per unit of capacity, our dollars can be really efficient because of the spectrum portfolio that we have that we're putting in use. I think that's a real big benefit. From a customer base perspective, we're very pleased with the subscriber base we have, whether it's the business subscriber base that we have, what we saw in the small business side and the growth there, whether we see it in the enterprise side. When you look at the consumer side, the prepaid business is growing well. And quite frankly, the margin improvement from Cricket is helping drive the margin improvement in the overall business of wireless. So that's great. And then, of course, some of the premier customers, the video space, are using our U-verse and our DTV services. So we feel great about our customer base. With regard to that, we're willing to invest dollars to retain and attract additional quality customers, whether here in the United States or in Mexico and Latin America. We'll be focus on that, but we'll be careful with it. I would suggest to you the characteristics, the titles we give those prepaid, postpaid, over-the-top versus monthly subscription, are less important as the economics of the profitability of those offers. And that's what we'll be focused on."

So we can take the economics in going into some appropriate customer basis, whether there's an opportunity for real -- a better economics, better profitability. So we have that kind of business case process to it. Secondly, I would tell you that with regard to the SEC agreement, there is particulars within the agreement that allow us to build -- count so many greenfield builds, counts so many more upgrade in the existing IP broadband footprint to utilize, in some cases, multiple dwelling units. And then in many cases, require some level or a significant level, I should say, of new builds. So we have to coordinate all of that, take all of that into consideration. When you're done with that, you may still have some profitable builds that are at or above the 12.5 million commitment, and you may go ahead and build those. We'll see where that goes over time, and we'll see where that leads us. But the ability or the schedule to build is an economic activity, a business case activity with, of course, the opportunity to over build in some areas being probably more timely and less expensive. But that might be capped by some of the regulatory agreement that we have in place, and we're going to certainly be respectful of those. But overall, it's kind of a normal business case process and where we can serve our customers the best and get the best returns for them and us."

So we think that, if you will, headed in the wrong direction, we'll continue to present our case on that. On Title II, we always expected the final resolution to be in the hands of the Supreme Court. And we'll work with -- through the process and follow the Supreme Court process closely and then make our decisions going from that on. I would suggest to you those are really kind of my comments on all of those matters. 
With regard to, Simon, the home media gateway, I'd suggest to you, this aspect that we continue -- and I'm not going to be able to give you a detailed answer. I'm not going to try to on a home media gateway. But what I will tell you is that we continue to believe that as we go through the process, we can get cost synergies in DTV by standardizing the interfaces whether they get the video over the satellite, whether they get over the broadband or whether they get over the IP television. And we continue to work on those activities to standardize the graphic user interface, the set-top boxes and what many would consider a gateway, our home gateway for media. Those activities continue beyond and will continue to work for that. It's a natural efficiency. And it's also a really good quality service for the customers."

It's been 1 year since we closed on our deal to acquire DIRECTV, and it's been a heck of a year. We are hitting the mark with our synergy targets. Our cost synergies are ahead of plan. And we're about ready to take the wraps off some exciting news streaming opportunities that will expand our customer base and extend our video position. We've added nearly 1 million U.S. satellite subscribers since we closed the deal. We were excited a year ago when DTV first came on board, and that enthusiasm has only grown. We'll talk more about that in just a few minutes. But now let me begin by discussing our second quarter results starting with our financial summary on Slide 5.
Second quarter consolidated revenues grew to $40.5 billion, largely due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. But we also saw growth in satellite, video, advertising and IP services on a comparable basis. This offset pressure from lower year-over-year wireless equipment sales and foreign exchange. 
Adjusted earnings growth continued. After adjustments, second quarter EPS was $0.72 a share, up year-over-year and up about 7% year-to-date. This quarter's growth comes even with about $0.03 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations, and we had more than $0.01 of pressure from compensation-related programs tied to our stock price. Most of this is from a success based compensation plan we have for our bargained-for employees. 
We're pleased for our employees, all our employees, in that they have an opportunity to share in the success that they have helped create for our shareholders. Margins also continue to be a solid story, thanks to our focus on profitability and our best-ever wireless EBITDA margin. We once again saw adjusted margin expansion on a consolidated basis and in every domestic business segment. This solid performance helped drive strong cash flows. 
Operating cash flow was $10.3 billion, with free cash flow reaching $4.8 billion, up 8.4% year-over-year. Our dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 61% and year-to-date, it's 73%. Capital investment came in at $5.6 billion for the quarter and $10.3 billion year-to-date.
We also continue to find ample demand and great rates in the securitization market to help us manage our next receivable. We received about $1.1 billion in the second quarter or about the same as last year's second quarter. Let's now take a look at our operations, starting with business solutions. Those details are on Slide 6.
Total business solution revenues were down slightly due to the sale of certain hosting operations and foreign exchange pressure. Solid wireless and strategic business service revenue gains helped to offset lower wireless equipment sales and declines in legacy services. 
Business wireless revenues were up 2% with service revenue growth outpacing equipment declines. Margins also continued to expand, thanks to business efficiencies and wireless revenue growth offsetting lower wireline revenues. 
Looking at the customer segments. Small business operations continue to grow, thanks to gains in wireless. Enterprise revenues were flat. However, if you adjust for the sale of our divested business in FX, that segment also continued to grow in the quarter. Strategic business services continues to grow at a healthy clip, up more than $200 million year-over-year. That's up 8.4% on a reported basis. And when you adjust for FX, growth was 9%. 
Strategic business services are now 36% of business wireline revenues. The growth of strategic business services and mobility is changing the revenue mix in business solutions. Those 2 areas now make up more than 70% of business solutions revenues. And if you look at total debt in wireless, that's more than 80% of business revenues. So our transformation to next generation products and services is well on its way in our business segment.
Now let's move to our Entertainment Group results on Slide 7. On a comparative basis, we grew revenues in our Entertainment Group, thanks to gains in satellite subscribers, broadband revenue and advertising. This more than offset losses in legacy services while also overcoming the pressure from the record-breaking Mayweather-Pacquiao pay-per-view event in the year ago second quarter. We continue to see solid gains in broadband and advertising revenues. 
Broadband revenue was up nearly 7% in the quarter with IP broadband revenues up 15%. Advertising sales also continued its strong growth, up double digits year-to-date and is now more than a $1.4 billion annualized revenue stream. We're well positioned in this space, and we're looking to play a leading role in taking our ad offerings across all screens. 
At the same time, we again saw continued margin expansion, which points directly to the benefits of the DIRECTV acquisition. Our margins, on a comparable basis, were up 90 basis points and were up even more if you adjusted for the prior year pay-per-view event. 
Our second quarter customer video metrics were impacted by the usual seasonal pressures, but improved nicely over last year. Our satellite net adds continued to be robust as we added 342,000 satellite subscribers in the quarter. More than 80% of our domestic video business is now on DIRECTV platform. Broadband net subscriber results also were impacted by seasonality as we added 54,000 IP broadband subscribers in the quarter. When you include business subscribers, the company added 74,000 IP broadband subscribers. As we expected, this growth was below recent quarters with second quarter seasonality, but we expect IP broadband net adds to bounce back in the second half of the year. Now let's move to our U.S. mobility results on Slide 8.
As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are divided between the business solutions and consumer wireless segments. For comparison purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S. wireless operations. Increasing profitability and a growing subscriber base continues to be the story in our wireless operations. 
For the second straight quarter, we turned in a record EBITDA margin of 41.4%. Service margins were also a record, reaching nearly 50% in the quarter, both were up 130 basis points year-over-year. A sharp focus on cost efficiencies and fewer upgrades drove the margin expansion. Equipment revenues were down due to a year-over-year increase in BYOD subs and a lower upgrade rate. Service revenues increased sequentially, but were down year-over-year.
At the same time, phone-only ARPU, plus Next billing, was up 2.5% with average monthly billings growing to $70. This growth comes even as we see an increasing number of subscribers holding onto their devices longer after completing their scheduled Next payments. 
About half of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 75% of postpaid smartphone subscribers are on a no-device-subsidy plan. Postpaid churn came in strong with its second-lowest-ever quarter at 0.97%. Postpaid phone-only churn was even lower and smartphone churn was still lower. And even with the pressures from reseller, our total churn was very low at 1.35%. 
Branded phone adds increased in the quarter. Branded domestic phone net adds, both postpaid and prepaid, were up 185,000, thanks to strength in our Cricket brand. We also continue to expand our valuable smartphone base, adding nearly 800,000 domestic branded smartphones in the quarter. And if you look at the chart on the lower left-hand corner of the slide, you can see that our overall phone base has more subscribers today than we did 1 year ago, thanks to strength in postpaid and prepaid smartphones.
And our postpaid smartphone base by itself is up 1 million in the same time as feature phones transitioned to smartphones. We had another solid quarter adding subscribers. Including our Mexico operations, we added 2.1 million new subscribers that includes 1.4 million domestic wireless subs with connected devices, branded phones and tablets overcoming losses in reseller, largely due to disconnects from our 2G network. Prepaid net adds in the quarter were impacted by 2 events. 
First, we aligned our churn policy across our prepaid platform. This favorable impact was generally offset by the negative impact resulting from a network outage caused by a vendor's equipment. As noted in our reseller numbers, we're starting to see some churn pressure associated with the planned shutdown of our 2G network at the end of this year. That will increase as we move closer to the shutdown. We'll manage through the process and the cost savings from 1 less network to support will be meaningful, so will the additional spectrum available to redeploy. Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 9.
Let's start with Mexico. We continue to make significant progress in building our customer base and deploying our 4G LTE network. We added 742,000 wireless subscribers in the second quarter as we near the 10 million subscriber mark in the country. 
Our LTE deployment also was on track. We now serve 65 million people in Mexico with our most advanced network and expect to reach 75 million by the end of this year. That brings our total North American LTE deployment to 380 million POPs. Our rebranding to AT&T also continues to make progress. We now reach 61 cities with the AT&T brand, including our largest market, Mexico City. Second quarter revenue was up 13% sequentially, driven by equipment sales and wholesale revenues.
Revenue growth was impacted by lower ARPUs as the competitive environment is -- has intensified. In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continue to show revenue growth, up 8% sequentially. Revenues are being hampered by challenging economics. However, we did see subscriber growth adding 87,000 video customers in the quarter in part due to the COPA America soccer tournament. But as you might expect, the earthquake in Ecuador did pressure our overall subscriber growth in Latin America. But even with these economic conditions, we continue to be a profitable and generate positive cash flow from these operations for the quarter. Now that we're midway through the year, let's take a look at how we are doing relative to the guidance we set out in January, that's on Slide 10.
We're on track to meet or exceed each of the metrics we have laid out for you. Consolidated revenues are growing at a double-digit pace, thanks to our acquisition of DIRECTV. This comes even with pressure from lower equipment sales and foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS is up about 7% year-to-date, above guidance, but in line with where we expected to be at this time. 
Consolidated margins are stable as margin expansion in our domestic operations is offsetting investment pressure from Mexico. We are focused on growing our valuable subscriber base across our business, including Mexico, where growth has been strong. We are willing to make additional investments to gain quality customers. 
Capital investment is trending to the low end of our guidance at its current pace, and we are ahead of plans with free cash flow. Dividend coverage for the first half of the year was 73%. We continue to feel confident that we will meet or beat our free cash flow guidance for the year. Now I'd like to spend the remainder of our time providing a strategic update on our business. That begins on Slide 12.
As Mike mentioned, we have often updated you on our company's strategy and direction. But today, we like to take a longer look at how we have uniquely positioned AT&T to lead in the rapidly evolving world of communications and video entertainment. Our goal is to be the world's premier integrated communications company for both consumers and businesses, and we plan to do this in the most cost-efficient way possible. This strategy did not happen overnight. It has been part of every business decision we've made for many years. No one else has our portfolio of assets, no one else has our cost-structure opportunity, and no one else can offer the integrated solutions that we can. 
Behind all this is a solid financial foundation that gives us the strength and flexibility to invest in our business while returning value to shareholders. This includes our strong liquidity position, our market-based compensation and benefit plans and thoughtful debt management. 
For example, we successfully negotiated workforce contracts that are market based, but also encourage employees to keep our owner's interest in mind while rewarding them when we succeed for shareholders. We also have a world-class Board of Directors, who provide great insight, while at the same time, challenge us. This makes us stronger and helps us navigate through these transformative times. We are uniquely positioned in this industry. All of this will be critical as mobile broadband, high-speed connectivity and entertainment come together. Let's first talk about the connectivity building blocks that we have assembled on Slide 13.
Since the introduction of the first smartphone, we've seen unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic. Even more incredibly, we expect that to continue to grow at a very strong pace. To meet this demand, we undertook several strategic initiatives to improve the capacity of our network for today and the years to come. Here is what we've accomplished.
First, we ratcheted up our investment cycle with Project VIP. This was crucial to getting the high-quality, high-capacity network we have today. Our 4G LTE network deployment was accelerated. Fiber backhauls deployed and cell sites built. We now have almost 70,000 cell sites, thousands more than our largest competitor. And a move into the Mexico wireless market further expands our LTE reach. 
We also drove fiber deeper in our wireline network. We added more than 1 million business locations to our fiber network. And we expanded our IP broadband footprint to more than 60 million customer locations. The next phase of driving fiber into our network is our GigaPower deployment. 
Over the next few years, we expect to reach at least 12.5 million customer locations with our gigabit broadband service. We now have more than 2.2 million Fiber to the Home customer locations, and we expect to reach 2.6 million or more by the end of the year. Our already dense wireless network and expanding fiber footprint puts us in an excellent position as we move to more small cells and 5G.
We've already filed patents, trials are already underway and testing is ongoing. When 5G is ready to roll, we will be ready as well. At the same time we launched VIP, we moved to expand our Spectrum portfolio. We have about 150 megahertz of spectrum in our portfolio today, including 40 megahertz of relatively untapped AWS and WCS spectrum. We have the best, most balanced spectrum portfolio in the industry. Adding spectrum is the most effective way to add capacity. This year, we expect to add 35,000 LTE carriers compared to the 18,000 deployed last year. We also continue to make smaller spectrum deals to round out our coverage and redeploy spectrum once dedicated to 2G and 3G.
Last week's move by the SEC to make high-frequency radio spectrum available for 5G wireless service is another step forward to provide even more spectrum. And while we are not going to elaborate, AT&T has applied to be a participant in the broadcast spectrum auction and has also submitted a bid in the FirstNet process that is currently underway. 
Our network transformation is now pivoting to software-defined networking or SDN. With SDN, we are virtualizing network functions that used to require dedicated fixed equipment and software. SDN gives us flexible, dynamic and smart network capability. We ended last year with about 5% of our network functions virtualized and expect to reach 30% by the end of this year. We are on path to achieve 75% network virtualization by 2020. SDN also provide cost savings, which supports our drive to an industry-leading cost structure. Let's discuss that on Slide 14.
Having an industry-leading cost structure, helps us expand margins and grow free cash flow. We now have a line of sight to continue margin improvement, as well as reaching our goal of $20 billion in free cash flow. This is what we need to do to reach those goals.
Step one is achieving the cost synergies from our DIRECTV acquisition. We are on track to achieve $1.5 billion plus run rate synergies with DTV by the end of this year. That puts us well on our way to hit our projected $2.5 billion plus run rate savings by the end of 2018. 
Step two is our work to drive efficiencies with Project Agile. This work includes our efforts to serve customers digitally, automating service delivery, streamlining operations and other cost-efficiency initiatives. Our goal is to generate a $3 billion run rate in cost savings, and we are moving past the midway point of making that happen. We're also have not been shy about exiting nonstrategic businesses that don't fit our margin expansion profile. That includes global hubbing, and more recently, certain hosting operations. Obviously, that reduces revenue, but increases overall profitability.
Finally, we must continue to lead the industry in our move to software-defined networking. We are virtualizing functions that previously required dedicated solutions, dedicated hardware, dedicated software, dedicated teams. This virtualization manifests itself into real, sustained cost savings throughout the network and the business. That savings in both our capital expenditures and our cash operating expenses. It also gives customers greater control of their network services, more agility and simplicity in the way they do business with us as well as better value on ours and our customers' hardware investment.
Now let's look at something that really separates us from the rest of our industry, our integrated solutions approach. That's on Slide 15. 
While it starts with connectivity and cannot be sustained without an effective cost structure, you must have assets to create products customers want, delivered where and how they want them to be successful. We've talked about these assets, so let's bring this point home. 
We are in every major market in the U.S., with reach around the world. We have a 4G LTE footprint that covers 380 million people in North America. We have more fiber connecting more buildings and more business customer locations than anyone else. That's in footprint and out, which helps us compete today, but also positions us very well for 5G. And we are also the biggest TV provider in the world, and we're about to introduce an over-the-top product that we believe will be a game changer.
DIRECTV Now is scheduled for launch later this year, and we expect the millions of people, who don't now subscribe to video service and prefer a streaming option, will be impressed. At the same time, no one can match what we offer business customers. We have the ability to serve all business customers from Fortune 1000 companies to the local ice cream shop on the corner. And no matter how big or how small the business is, almost every conversation with business customers begins with mobility and security, and that is where we excel.
When you take our extensive fiber network and then later on SDN, security and mobility and new software-enabled services, you have the premier integrated business services company. We believe we have a significant competitive advantage to use our connectivity and cost structure to offer integrated solutions to our customers. Whether you are in the C-suite of a major company or the master suite of your own home and anywhere in between, AT&T delivers. We have a robust, dynamic and attractive set of products architected on a network that is flexible and able to quickly adapt to the future. That's table stakes if you want to be the world's premier integrated communications company, and that is exactly what we expect to be.
Now before we get to your questions, allow me to quickly summarize, and that's on Slide 16. We are very confident in our unique strategy. We have the assets we need and we are executing on our plan. Our DIRECTV cost synergies are hitting the target. Project Agile is on track. And we are ahead in the move to software-defined networking. All this drive us towards an industry-leading cost structure. But we're most excited about what lies ahead. 
We have a dedicated and skilled group of people working for us from the crew staffing our work centers to the leaders in the boardroom, we have a team of professionals focused on making AT&T the world's premier integrated communications company. Our differentiated position opens the door for some game-changing opportunities, and we're ready to walk through it. We're confident we can execute on our strategy and continue to build value for our shareholders. With that, let's go to your questions."

As we look to the second half, could you talk about the major variables that would kind of maybe swing you back down towards more the base-case expectation for the year versus the -- or better part of the guidance that you were discussing? And then, second, I was wondering if we could just touch on this issue of kind of the economics of postpaid sub losses versus prepaid sub gains. I guess you had about 319,000 prepaid gains versus 180,000 postpaid losses. Can you talk about the relative economics of those 2 things? And are we looking at a net economic positive or negative trade-off when we look at that?"

On the economics so forth -- the postpaid subs we're losing are a lot of all feature phones. They are averaging about somewhere around $35, maybe a little bit less, in ARPU and have costs associated that -- postpaid do, with retaining them. On the prepaid side, we're probably closer to a $41, $42, depending upon the specifics, average ARPU and much less, very, very small subscriber acquisition costs, upfront costs, maintenance costs, being -- by the very nature of being prepaid. So from that standpoint, the economics are better, and it is being shown in our margins. When you look at our margins, total EBITDA margins or service margins, you can see the growth and you can see that level. That's a part of what's driving it. So the economics are -- and we're running the business on a branded basis. We think of branded customers and then try not to make distinctions on classification, really make distinctions on economics. And I think it's showing up in our profitability. 
Now with regard to the variables of the second half, there's a lot of things that happen. There's some seasonality in the fourth quarter in our wireless business, in our video business, we'll have the NFL Ticket come out. and we'll have the launching of the DTV Now and some of the over-the-top offers. And so we'll have a whole host of things going on. I would just suggest to you, we're very confident where we're at and continue to do well. And I wouldn't suggest to you that there's anything necessarily unique or different about the second half of the year. Just we're careful with our guidance and want to make sure that we meet or exceed it. So we feel very good about where we're at through 6 months."

If you could give us a little more detail on that, and I would imagine you will be paying some more taxes over time as well. So how does that all sort of fit together to bridge us to that $20 billion number? 
And then, as you talk about in the -- some previous slides, you're a little bit -- you've underspent the $22 billion BOE on CapEx a little bit here in the first half. Does that mean there's -- we have a sort of downward biased to CapEx at this point?"

Couple of things. One, if you think about the free cash flow, if you think about the $15.9 billion that we started with last year and you add in the kind of the $2.5 billion opportunity with DIRECTV, you add in the remainder of the $3 billion opportunity from Agile. And then you add in maybe a 1%, I'll say is illustrative reduction in capital intensity and some costs, some cash operating expense savings, you can see that those 3 items there can get you well over $5 billion. In addition, we expect to grow our EBITDA and grow our profitability of the business. And so when you put those things together, it looks to be an achievable, real, realistic path from last year's $15.9 billion to a $20 billion number as a goal in the near future. And so that's what we are looking at. That's how we build it up. We're not giving a prediction date on that, but we feel good about the opportunities to significantly grow free cash flow. 
With regard to our CapEx, I just want to be very straightforward, and it sounds that we are at $10.3 billion and on an annualized basis, that would come below the $22 billion. We'll continue, as I've said before, to invest as appropriate, not towards a targeted $22 billion number, but rather towards what business cases make sense and when it makes sense for us to be in the market investing. Sometimes that causes quarters to be much heavier in CapEx like we had in the fourth quarter last year. And other times, like in the first 6 months this year, we spend at a lower rate. We're just being very careful with every dollar. But right now, the performance we've had for the first 6 months is a trend to on the low end of our guidance."

It looks like, obviously, feature phones have come down dramatically over the past 8 quarters or so. As that sort of approaches a lower level, does that provide a tailwind to get postpaid phone additions back to a positive territory? Obviously, you've got DTV cross selling, DTV Now products rolling out, over-the-top products rolling out. I presume that could also help. 
And then just, secondly, on the video adds for the year. The anticipation there, is it that DIRECTV continues to ramp, it's been doing a great job. Is it that? Or is it U-verse becoming less of a headwind on the back half of the year to get to a positive video number?"

We do think the 2G losses, as we go through the year, we'll see those. But getting past this year, you'll see the opportunity to have a more positive impact because we're through that process. 
Secondly, our feature phones, which include some 2G devices -- but our feature phones are going down. And as they go down and that, if you will, legacy products, so to speak, impact on our results is lessened, certainly, we have a brighter opportunity, a more real -- a better opportunity to grow out of those customer base. And then third, on the bundling, as we really get into the second half of the year and are able to do single truck install, which may be bundling a video and satellite and broadband. But also, that whole activity of bundling, as the longer -- the more time our teams get to do it, the better we'll get at it. And so from that perspective, we do think that will provide us an opportunity to grow more wireless. So all 3 of those things will help. And yes, we're optimistic about it. But I will tell you also, it's really about the branded net adds and the economic net adds. It's not about any one category of net adds. It's getting those customers that are the most profitable, highest quality. 
With regard to the video side, on a seasonality basis, we usually do see less. Now we see more pressure in the second quarter and then first half from the U-verse side. And quite frankly, so is DTV in the past. So going forward, I would hope that we would see -- we'd expect to see some improvement on both sides. When you think about DIRECTV, things like the NFL Ticket Sunday (sic) [ NFL SUNDAY TICKET ] and some of the other offers, as we see these trends of bundling improving and attachment rates improving, we feel really good about the opportunity to improve our trends and get to our goal of positive video net adds for the year."

As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the ARPU is right at $70 on a per customer basis when you take into account the total billings. Those are really impressive levels. Very good for us historically from any measurement, straight ARPU prior to the equipment installment days or in the most recent years with the equipment installment. So on a monthly basis, from our customers, we're doing very, very well with revenue base. Secondly, it is a competitive environment. And it will -- and it has been for years. It will remain in that. We believe that we are doing well with that. And we think it's proven out in our margins, in our profitability, in our cash flows. I would tell you, just one side inside item that we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had about 500,000 BYOD devices. We had customers walk in with 500,000 phones and said, ""Can we connect them to your network?"" Those are all net adds. They don't show up in equipment revenue. And depending upon what package they show up -- they'll show up in service revenues. But they are really profitable, they're low cost. We love them, and that doesn't necessarily show up. And you're immediate look at the financials, but it is clearly showing up in our profitability and our margins. So I would ask you to focus on those items as well as our service revenues. Specifically with regard to our service revenues, you've seen our additional piece of our customer base shift to Mobile Share Value, I think we went from about 64% up to 75%. We did have some additional customers shift off of the -- shift to the no-subsidy plans, which impacted service revenues. And we continue to do normal promotions through some of the incentives credits, free services, normal promotional activity. All of those things are impacting service revenues as expected. 
With regard to recent activities in the marketplace, we'll see how those play out. We'll just focus on getting the best-quality customers and providing really great service.

On the CapEx budget, we've been -- we've done well kind of in all aspects of it. A couple of things. One, we've been able to -- because of our software-defined network, we're starting to see a little bit of those savings. If you think about our buying capacity in the overall economic conditions, we've been able to get some volume pricing and some purchasing power benefits. Certainly, we're getting more efficient with what we do. I will tell you, though, that one of the things, I think, people miss out on is that because of the spectrum that we've invested in over the last, say, 5 years or so, we've got a lot of effective capital deployment that doesn't involve a lot of dollars. It involves deploying spectrum. And that's a really efficient way to deploy capacity. And so on a per unit of capacity, our dollars can be really efficient because of the spectrum portfolio that we have that we're putting in use. I think that's a real big benefit. From a customer base perspective, we're very pleased with the subscriber base we have, whether it's the business subscriber base that we have, what we saw in the small business side and the growth there, whether we see it in the enterprise side. When you look at the consumer side, the prepaid business is growing well. And quite frankly, the margin improvement from Cricket is helping drive the margin improvement in the overall business of wireless. So that's great. And then, of course, some of the premier customers, the video space, are using our U-verse and our DTV services. So we feel great about our customer base. With regard to that, we're willing to invest dollars to retain and attract additional quality customers, whether here in the United States or in Mexico and Latin America. We'll be focus on that, but we'll be careful with it. I would suggest to you the characteristics, the titles we give those prepaid, postpaid, over-the-top versus monthly subscription, are less important as the economics of the profitability of those offers. And that's what we'll be focused on."

And then in many cases, require some level or a significant level, I should say, of new builds. So we have to coordinate all of that, take all of that into consideration. When you're done with that, you may still have some profitable builds that are at or above the 12.5 million commitment, and you may go ahead and build those. We'll see where that goes over time, and we'll see where that leads us. But the ability or the schedule to build is an economic activity, a business case activity with, of course, the opportunity to over build in some areas being probably more timely and less expensive.

And we continue to work on those activities to standardize the graphic user interface, the set-top boxes and what many would consider a gateway, our home gateway for media.

And good morning, everybody.
What we're going to do is Jeff and I are going to provide some color on the business combination, and then we'll spend our time addressing whatever questions you might have.
Look, we're convinced that this combination, Time Warner and AT&T, is a perfect match for our 2 companies, vertically integrated. I mean we'll be able to bring a fresh approach to how the media and communication industry works for customers, for content creators, for distributors as well as advertisers. We'll be uniquely positioned to lead and even accelerate the next wave of innovation in terms of how people enjoy video entertainment. Time Warner is the global leader in media and entertainment with terrific brands. And their brands, we all know and love, from Game of Thrones to CNN and Superman, just to name a few. It is a vast content library, and we believe it's the best on the planet. And hands down, Time Warner has the best creative talent and journalists in the industry.
When you combine Time Warner's content with our scale and distribution, we have 100 million-plus mobile -- TV, mobile and broadband subscribers, you put that with our customer insights and the addressable advertising opportunities that flow from that, we think we build something here that's really special. And it creates significant, strategic as well as financial benefits. With content distribution and customer insights, we'll be able to deliver new subscription as well as advertising models and new content formats that traditional programmers have been hesitant to adopt, particularly for content that's designed for mobile consumption and sharing on social media. Owning content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will help pay for the costs of content creation. And this 2-sided business model, advertising and subscription based, helps pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers more choices in terms of how they get their content. And only AT&T will have the world's best premium content with the networks to deliver on every screen.
We expect to close this transaction by the end of 2017.
And I've been asked a lot, why now? It comes at a time when the media and communication industries are converging. And Jeff and I sat down back in August to talk about where we saw the industry headed and how a combination between our companies would really remove a lot of the friction in the industry; then help accelerate innovation in terms of content that's mobile, customized and social. The next wave of innovation in this business takes vertical integration of premium content and distribution, and I suspect the rest of the industry is going to innovate right with us. And by the time our Time Warner deal closes at the end of next year, we'll be nearly 2.5 years into integrating DIRECTV, and that work is going to be essentially behind us. Our Time Warner deal is more of a bolt-on acquisition. It's not a normal full-blown integration like you've seen in past deals.
The big part of the value of this transaction is Time Warner's outstanding leadership team; and the amazing creative talent, the journalists that they've put together. And that's why we plan to run Time Warner in the same way that it's run today.
If you would turn to Slide 6 in the deck. Let's talk about the capabilities this business is going to have. First, we'll be the leader in premium content. Time Warner has an amazing portfolio of content creation and aggregation and some iconic brands across programming and TV and film production. HBO is the #1 global leader in premium content subscriptions, producing hit shows like Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley and Veep for its HBO and Cinemax networks. Warner Bros. has the largest film and studio in the world; hit franchises like Harry Potter, Superman and The Voice; and box office hits like American Sniper. And it has the best and biggest entertainment library on the planet. Turner has top-rated basic cable network: TNT, TBS and Cartoon Network and Adult Swim; and Turner's premium sports right, including the NBA, March Madness, Major League Baseball. And that combined with our rights to the NFL SUNDAY TICKET is going to create a very strong sports programming portfolio. 
And Turner has great digital assets like Bleacher Report, cnn.com.
If you look at Slide 7. We'll have unmatched scale and distribution and customer relationships. 144 million mobile subscribers in the U.S. and Mexico, 45 million subscribers in the U.S. and throughout Latin America make us the world's largest pay TV provider. We have about 16 million U.S. broadband subscribers. And we have a growing OTT business with HBO NOW and soon DIRECTV Now. And also, our joint venture with the Chernin Group, Otter Media, has 1.2 million subscribers on one [ph] of its various SVOD services. And we have more than 88,000 retail points of sale across North America.
And third, all that will give us some robust viewership insights. And we'll use those insights from our TV, mobile and broadband subscribers to inform what content we create. We'll develop content that's better tailored to what specific audience segments want to watch when, where and on which device. And we'll use the insights to expand the market for addressable advertising. And addressable advertising is far more effective and more valuable both to the advertisers and to our customer. Owning content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will allow us to grow 2-sided business models, help pay for the costs of content creation. And this 2-sided business model, advertising and subscription based, helps to pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers more choices on how they get their content.
As you move to Slide 8, I want to walk you through the highlights of the transaction. And then later, John Stephens is going to dive a little deeper into this.
So we're paying $107.50 per share. It's half stock and half cash, and the stock portion is subject to a collar. And we believe this is the optimal capital structure for a deal of this size. The financial benefits are straightforward and we think they're significant. In the first year after closing, it's accretive to margins and adjusted EPS and free cash flow on a per share basis. It improves our dividend coverage. It enhances and diversifies our revenue and earnings growth profile. And the structure of the deal allows us to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong investment-grade credit matrix (sic) [ metrics ].
The approval is fairly straightforward. Time Warner shareholders will vote on it. And they will have regulatory reviews in the U.S., the EU and a few other countries.
And so that's the structure of the deal. What I'd like to do now is hand it over to Jeff Bewkes, the Chairman and CEO of Time Warner; and let him take you through his thoughts."

Good morning, everyone.I'm really pleased with this transaction and with Time Warner's future as part of AT&T. Joining forces will accelerate the evolution of both our companies as we go where consumers are going in the converging world",384,"Thanks, Randall. Good morning, everyone.
I'm really pleased with this transaction and with Time Warner's future as part of AT&T. Joining forces will accelerate the evolution of both our companies as we go where consumers are going in the converging worlds of media and communications, and that will drive more growth and more value for shareholders. 
This combination creates both immediate and long-term value. The Time Warner shareholders -- share price represents about a 36% premium to our closing price of $79.24 on October 19. And it also has a very attractive consideration mix of 50% cash and 50% AT&T stock for each Time Warner share. That gives our shareholder base roughly a 15% pro forma ownership in the world's leading integrated media and communications company with a strong financial profile, as Randall just said, and a combined track record of success and innovation in both companies. And we believe the pro forma company is very well positioned to drive attractive growth for years to come.
We expect innovation to be an important driver of that growth since we see AT&T's distribution capabilities as an enormous opportunity for us. As I said, we need to go where the consumers are going. And that's increasingly mobile, increasingly multiplatform. And it's increasingly on demand through new services via direct consumer relationships over broadband. And this aligns us with all of that. Additionally, there's the huge opportunity Randall mentioned to utilize consumer insights to inform content creation, and that allows us to continue to create not just the biggest hits but also content and program that really engages with targeted, passionate niches in the audience. We'll be able to do that more efficiently while also innovating very important new subscription and advertising models to increase consumer choice.
So we see the opportunity to create tremendous long-term value in this combination, and that's what's driving this transaction. As I said at the outset, AT&T's distribution capabilities significantly advance our direct-to-consumer reference and our ability to develop new offerings for all the leading content that we already create and distribute today. And together with AT&T, we'll develop new, innovative business models and forms of content that consumers will be demanding tomorrow in this ubiquitous multi-platform, on-demand and increasingly mobile environment.
So now, I'll turn it over to John Stephens."

And good morning, everyone.Let me provide the financial expectations that we have for this transaction and refer to Slide 10.To recap. The purchase price value is Time Warner equity at about $85 billion, plus approximately $21 billion",1243,"Thank you, Jeff. And good morning, everyone.
Let me provide the financial expectations that we have for this transaction and refer to Slide 10.
To recap. The purchase price value is Time Warner equity at about $85 billion, plus approximately $21 billion of net debt from Time Warner. That brings the total transaction value to right at $106 billion. Time Warner shareholders will receive a 50-50 mix of cash and AT&T stock for their equity. The cash portion is already fully funded with a $40 billion bridge loan and additional AT&T liquidity. We remain strongly committed at maintaining a sound balance sheet and solid investment-grade credit metric. And we see significant opportunity for rapid deleveraging potential given the attractive free cash flow of the combined companies. In fact, we expect pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA to be in the 2.5x range by the end of the first year after the close of the transaction and approaching the 1.8x range by the end of year 4. We see solid synergy potential in the $1 billion run rate by the end of year 3. As you would expect, this is substantially cost driven, corporate- and procurement-type expenses, the kind we know how to get, but we believe there are also significant opportunities from the vertical integration of content and distribution. And the vast amount of data available from the combined company will allow not only a greater value proposition to offer advertisers but will allow more informed and efficient content development.
This transaction also diversifies us and enhances our revenue mix. A strong cash flow and a lower capital intensity gives us flexibility as we grow these businesses. As mentioned earlier, we expect adjusted EPS to be accretive in the first year and free cash flow and free cash flow per share to be accretive within that same time frame. The deal also improves our strong free cash flow dividend coverage. And as you saw, we just announced our 33rd consecutive dividend increase. We're shooting a 100% raise in the dividend with every chance we've had over the last 33 years. We are extremely proud of that track record.
Now I'd like to spend the last few minutes of this presentation giving you a high-level view of our very good third quarter results that we released on Saturday, starting with our financial summary on Slide 12.
Our teams continued to execute at a high level in the quarter. Third quarter consolidated revenues grew nearly 5% to $40.9 billion, in large part due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. On a comparable basis, revenues were down slightly, as growth in video and IP-based services mostly offset pressure from declines in wireless, legacy services; and the second quarter 2016 transition of certain hosting operations. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, comparable revenues were essentially flat.
We grew net income in the quarter. After adjustments, third quarter EPS was $0.74, the same as last year's third quarter and up almost 4% year-to-date. This comes even with about $0.02 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. Margins also continued to be solid even with the pressure from our investment cycle in Mexico, thanks to the teams' focus on profitability and our best-ever wireless service margins.
All these continues to drive strong cash flows. We had our second highest-ever operating cash flows of $11 billion, with free cash flow reaching $5.2 billion. That's more than $13 billion in year-to-date free cash flow.
Year-to-date, our dividend payout ratio is 67%, ahead of our full year guidance. Capital investment is on plan coming in at $5.9 billion for the quarter and just over $16 billion year-to-date. We also continued to focus on our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio, which came in at 2.24.
Let's now take a look at our operations. Those details are on Slide 13. In a competitive wireless market, we continue to effectively manage our business. This has helped us add subscribers, lower postpaid churn and improve profitability. We turned in record wireless service EBITDA margins of 50.1%. This comes even as promotions heated up at the end of the quarter. We took a smart, strategic approach with our marketing moves. You see the impact in our postpaid churn. With all the noise in the marketplace, we had our second best third quarter postpaid churn ever. Postpaid churn of 1.05% was an 11 basis point improvement over the year-ago third quarter. And this includes about 2 basis points of pressure from our 2G network migration. Postpaid phone churn was even lower at 0.90%. That's a 14 basis point improvement over a year ago.
We turned in another strong quarter of subscriber growth. We had 1.5 million domestic net adds. And when you include our Mexico operations, we grew our North American subscriber base by 2.3 million. The growth of our prepaid business continues to be exceptional. We had more than 300,000 prepaid phones in the quarter, and prepaid revenues were up more than 20% year-over-year. This drove branded phone growth and helped increase our branded smartphone base by another 700,000 subscribers.
Turning to our Entertainment Group. On a comparative basis, revenues grew as IP and video revenue outpaced legacy declines. Margins also continued to expand at a healthy clip. Our reported margins were up 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by merger synergies and a full quarter of DIRECTV in this year's results.
Overall, TV and broadband subscribers were relatively stable in the quarter. We added more than 300,000 DIRECTV subscribers and then have added 1.2 million DIRECTV subscribers since we acquired DIRECTV in July of last year.
Our business solutions team also performed well in a challenging economy. Our flow share is good, and we continue to see the benefits of an integrated wireless and wireline approach. Thanks to wireless, we grew business revenues in the quarter. And we grew revenues in all our retail segments, enterprise, small business and the public sector. Strategic business services also grew at a solid clip, up $240 million year-over-year. That's up 9.1%. And when you adjust for FX, growth was closer to 10%.
Let me close with a summary of the quarter on Slide 14. We're proud of what we've accomplished this quarter. Earnings continue to grow, and consolidated margins are stable even with the pressure from our Mexico investment. Year-to-date adjusted EPS is up nearly 4%, and we have the second highest cash from operations ever. We answered competitive headwinds in wireless with our best wireless service margins ever and our second best-ever third quarter postpaid churn. We added 1.5 million U.S. subscribers and positive phone net adds and grew our smartphone base by 700,000.
The integration of DIRECTV continues to generate the cost savings and sales opportunities we thought it would. We're on track to launch DIRECTV Now this quarter and are excited about what this brings. And Mexico continues to be a growth story, just a tremendous job by our team. They're ahead of plan with their 4G LTE deployment, with their rebranding efforts and with customer growth.
Our guidance for the year remains on track: double-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth with stable margins. And free cash flow growth has been strong, with dividend coverage year-to-date at 67%.
As we enter the home stretch of the year, we feel very good about our results and we look forward to finishing the year strong.
And with that, I believe we're ready for Q&A. And I'll turn it over to Roxanne."

So you hit the big driver that we're envisioning, and that's the DIRECTV Now product that we'll be launching next month. And I'll tell you, the more we iterate and work on DIRECTV and launch it in November, the more excited we get about what we're going to be putting in the marketplace but, I will tell you, the more excited we get about what else we'll be able to do on this platform. And there are a lot of things we really aspire to do with this platform as it -- as you think about incorporating social into the platform; and as you begin to think about how you share content on this platform, clipping content that you're watching and sharing it with your friends via messaging or being in social media. We think that -- we don't think. We know our customers are really demanding that. Now what I would tell you is trying to develop those type of capabilities with the current content providers is proving difficult. It's arm's-length negotiation, and people are obviously very protective of their content. And so it's just really, really hard to get these type of iterations and innovations on content done. So the thing that Jeff and I get most excited about when we talk about this transaction is now in these over-the-top environments and platforms we can begin to innovate our content much quicker. [indiscernible][indiscernible]  We're under the same umbrella, same ownership structured. And we can get past a lot of these content rights and so forth and move fast. And I will tell you we are both convinced that, as we innovate in this way and as we accelerate the pace of this innovation, it's going to attract others to want to do the same on these platforms. So those are kind of a snippet of some of the things we're thinking about. Jeff, would you add anything to add that?"

We've been trying Time Warner to get more video-on-demand on not just our network, but have it become a universal thing for every American. You go to your set-top, your television, and that whole dial of network, hundreds of channels, they should all be [indiscernible] just like HBO or Netflix is. And we announced that and we made it available to all our distributors for all the Time Warner networks of Turner and HBO, more than 5 years ago. No payment, extra. If the condition was we'll give you full VOD on your television platforms, on your broadband platforms provided that it goes to every consumer with no extra charge, everybody's got to get the same offer, and we could just do it for our networks, we announced it first with Comcast years ago. What we saw to Randall's point is that the various cable and other kinds of distributors took a long time to create that offering across every other kind of network. And often, the reason was they're waiting for various negotiations of this cable company versus that network group, and you just didn't see a universal offering that's what consumers were demanding. And so we think with this, with the AT&T and DIRECTV, our largest affiliate distributor on television, they're the largest and best at mobile delivery. And so when we want to bring more packages, more choice for consumers at different price points at every kind of level, upper, lower, more channels, fewer channels, more mobility, more innovations of the kind of programming. And then with the advertising capabilities, we can make the advertising more interesting for your house versus somebody next door. The products you're interested, not the ones you don't need to see. And that means that more of the consumers get a better experience viewing, they get less interruptions. And it means that more of the cost of the programming, which is -- there's an investment in programming but more of the cost can then be borne by advertisers and consumers get a break. So the benefit from this, for consumers, is very good, very good. And the benefit for advertisers is terrific because if you look at what's happening in that world, advertisers need more competition. And this will give another outlet not just the Google and Facebook one that's gaining all of the -- has been gaining all of the traction, but you get another advertising choice that's equally efficient."

And we get more and more enthusiastic about the world of 5G, the more we get into this and see what kind of services will be consumed over-the-top on our mobile networks. So there's just a real synergistic effect across everything from infrastructure investment, back to the distribution platforms and content creation and advertising models, this just has a lot of opportunities for us."

About the same token, if we're iterating quickly into DIRECTV Now with the Time Warner content, than we begin to differentiate the DIRECTV Now platform as well. And hopefully, as Jeff articulated and expressed, as we begin to iterate and innovate with the Time Warner content, I am actually convinced that if we're successful with this, it will incentivize other content creators to do the same and want to innovate on top of this platform as well. So I think it gives us great diversification. 15% of our revenues after this deal is closed will be Time Warner, which is media and entertainment. So diversification is great.

In terms of where we stand on the DIRECTV integration, Amir, as you recall, the biggest benefit financially from the integration were the cost synergies. And we set an objective of getting $2.5 billion per year of cost out of the business, $1.5 billion of that being this year. We're way ahead of schedule on achieving those cost synergies. And as you think about this transaction that we put together here, closing, end of 2017 time frame, we're going to be way down the path of the integration activities and achieving those cost synergies and so forth. The other elements that was really critical in terms of achieving synergies from this was getting all of those content right to distribute over our mobile platform. And so the DIRECTV now, that required a lot of heavy lifting to go round all the content creators and get this new right to disturb it this content over-the-top to our mobile providers. Those are largely done. We're a little over 1 year into this and all those content agreements are basically in place. That was a lot of heavy lifting. There's been an unbelievable amount of work and effort going to that. And now we're really early into deploying these new platforms. And I would tell you more we get into the DIRECTV Now over-the-top platform, the more excited we get about the opportunity. And then as we think about the ability to bring Time Warner content into that, it's just the enthusiasm level just continues to go up and go up. So I would tell you, I think the timing of the Time Warner deal as it relates to the integration of DIRECTV is actually, a very good fit. I think the timing is very good, bringing it end of 2017, and we're going to be at a place where all of our installation crews or DIRECTV our integrated, we're doing 1 truck roll to the house. Our call center operations will be integrated at that point in time. So a lot of what I call the key logistical difficulty things to do in terms of integration, we'll have the lion's share of those done by the end of 2017. We still have some, what I'd call, big IT type things, information-technology development that won't be completed. But those aren't big rocks that are going to get in the way of trying to integrate Time Warner at this time. So then, lastly, I would tell you, a deal like this when Jeff and I met, and we both gained conviction in terms of what was in the art of possible here as we put these 2 companies together and we both became convinced and convicted that it was a deal that ought to happen, these kind of deals, you don't sit around and wait for the perfect timing. I mean, once you have a deal and you have a deal structure given the potential for leaks, and so forth, the objective is to push them through and get them done, and that's exactly what we did here. And so there's never a perfect time for a deal like this but actually, I think this fits very well with our own integration plans. And I also think it fits well in terms of how fast this industry is moving. The convergence in terms of media and distribution is moving fast. We want to be at the front of it. We don't want to be chasing it. And doing this deal now allows us to lead in this type of convergence activity and brings stuff to our customers that they want before other people bring it to their customers. So I think the time actually, works out quite well."

This is vertical. This company is a supplier to AT&T, and it is a pure technical vertical integration. Vertical integrations where regulators have concerns with those are remedied or addressed, those concerns are addressed through conditions.

And we weren't -- that's the first part. And it needed -- it consolidate to get more efficiency in the scale of what it did. And we didn't think that would be as well accomplished for a number of reasons, financial structure, regulatory approval as part of the media company that we had at the time. The second thing, which I think is more important is the world is much different now. You now have net neutrality in place, you got broadband distribution, you have mobile as an ever bigger part of the dissertation package, and you have a lot of incoming new distributor or competition coming from Facebook, Netflix, Google, Amazon. And so as the distribution world changes, having distribution capabilities to innovate on mobile sets on across broadband and with the ability to speak directly to consumers, offer customized subscription packages and more effective targeted advertising, it's both more competition on both sides and it allows us to add our networks be more attractively offer to consumers. And what, I mean, by that is VOD with better interphases. And what I think that the distribution industry, not AT&T and not Comcast so far they've been good at this, but a lot of the distribution companies quickly the cable companies, have been slow to provide these innovations for consumers. And we think this will help spur that across the industry."

When you're talking about doing really tight integrations of ownership is always best. If you have to iterate and innovate quickly, it's really difficult to do at a partnering arm's-length negotiated type transaction. Our history is long in terms of examples of this, not, the least of which was we had been, what I'd call, a tightly integrated reseller of DIRECTV for a longtime and it was an important part of our package. But you never forget the tight integration of the customer experience. We closed DIRECTV and we get the customer experience integrated and then within 1 year, we've added 1.2 million DIRECTV customers. We've never even begun to approach a number like that when we were just partnering and reselling their products. And then as you think about, for example, the DIRECTV Now launch, we have been working 3 or 4 years to bring to market a mobile-centric package of content to our customers. And we have been working aggressively to put this together and getting the content creators to agree to the rights to put this over our mobile platform was proving to be very, very difficult. We closed DIRECTV and with those great content agreements that we now own a DIRECTV within 1 year, we've achieved all of those content rights. Literally, within a year, we've been trying to do 3 years, we achieved in 1 year after owning DIRECTV. I am convinced that as we try to bring unique capabilities of content our customers and really integrate, I'm talking about integrating deeply, social aspects and interaction of our customers with content and so forth, as we try to do that, doing it in an ownership structure rather than a partnering structure will happen faster. And I'll say it again, and I believe if we're successful on this, it will industry take begin to innovate faster and everybody want to innovate on this platform in the same way. So just a long history, Simon, of where you try to partner you can get there. It's slow, it's painful just the contracting itself takes a lot of time whereas when it's completely owned, you just move a lot faster."

The way we will organize the business, David, is Time Warner will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T and it will stand on its own and we'll continue to operate at very similar to how it's operated today.

Rating agencies, we've had conversations with them, they're still [indiscernible]. The push and pulls of the situation, one, is the amount of debt is large and we're all aware but on the other side, the ability to generate $60 billion of EBITDA and $45 billion, so speak of annual cash from operations provides a great opportunity to service that debt. Third, I think the agency's evaluating the change, if you will, diversification opportunity that this provides. And then growth, the enhanced growth opportunity it provides. If you look at the transaction from a starting point on date of closed, if you assume end of year, kind of in the 2 7 range of net debt to EBITDA and getting down to closer or traditional target of 1.8 after 4 years, that ability to lay that out gives us comfort that we certainly will remain investment grade and will argue very strongly to keep our current ratings with those agencies. I would expect they'll come out with some interim announcements that as they work through the analysis, this is normal in this case. So that's really how we view it. From a rate perspective, I think the one thing I need to point out is over 90% or about 90% of our debt is locked into rates with about 14-year average life. We don't have much floating debt at this time. So first point I want to make to this transaction really doesn't has very minimal effect on our current interest expense cost for the legacy AT&T. When you layer on the towers of debt of Time Warner, they fit very nicely on top of the towers of AT&T and give a very manageable, very easily managed process for refinancing or paying down debt, so we feel very confident of that. Our assumptions were very conservative. We took a step-up from a 30-year bond rate that we see today, we took a step-up from that on our models instead of our traditional normal conservative approach. So we feel good about having the right level of interest expense for the incremental, and as I said, the base is locked up for a long period of time."

We continue to expect the business units, specifically the 3 business units, to operate and they're really -- these are not personnel focused. Just want to make sure that it's clear.

And as we've proven as our leadership in our corporate communications group has proven over the last year, we can mine [ph] savings company out of the combining 2 companies average highs [indiscernible] in communications [indiscernible] we successful from Time Warner and DTV.

We've got a real opportunity to provide really highest quality services and really from a investment based that we already have, that goes for both wireless and wireline. So that's a very direct one. If you think about the platforms, we've been moving very quickly, very effective at building a platform for DTV Now to distribute video overall kinds of screens. With that, we now have that ability to share that platform and that distribution device with HBO, with the Turner networks, with the Warner Studios, we have a real opportunity, and that's going to provide efficiency savings. And then frankly get into things like what I call shared services but efficiencies payroll, efficiencies of accounts payable, efficiencies of cash management all those kind of things. We've done very detailed analysis of these cost focus synergies. That's what gets us to the viewpoint that at the end of the year, the 3 will be a key on a run rate for $1 billion of cost savings and cash flow generation and we feel very good about that. And once again, it's really focused on really the supply chain and then, of course, the corporate -- the corporate structure. But we feel very good about achieving that."

You basically ask how will the regulators look at this deal. I think it's a wise question. Let me focus on why I think is the critically issue that regulators will focus on what the market structure looks like today and what the market structure looks like post transaction. And this is a very important point. Point number 1 is the structure of this industry will not change. There's no loss of competition, there's no loss of competitors. From a horizontal standpoint, the structure remains very much similar as it was today and that's exactly what Randall and Jeff had been talking about in terms of the verticalness of this transaction. Point number two, the distribution model doesn't change. Time Warner has built an incredibly successful business disturbing its content as widely as possible and that won't change either. So that leaves the question of what will change, and that's what's so exciting about this transaction. When you bring together wireless and content for the first time, wireless and content for the first time, you create a unique company that can work within that industry structure to integrate and very important ways that benefit consumers: Number one, you're able to take that wide distribution of Time Warner content and you're able to broaden that distribution, especially in the mobile world; and number two, you've heard it discussed here today, you're able, with that combined company, innovate new platforms, new video experiences, things that can't be done by arm's length contract alone. You can't innovate through arm's length contract arrangements. And so by doing, what the regulators will be interested, first and foremost, is talk about what happens immediately after the transaction and then talk about what happens thereafter. And so once regulators we are convinced to understand the facts about what I described you'll  see a positive story when it comes to market structure, and they'll see a positive story as it comes innovation. And then ultimately, we get to the point that Randall talked about earlier is that innovation spurs more innovation and it generates demand for video applications over mobile networks that is 5G's best friend. And so when you put all that together it's a very compelling case that we look forward to discussing with regulators. You asked about whether it'd be DOJ-only process or will be the SEC be involved, we know at this point, of course, the DOJ will be reviewing the transaction. At this point, we are determining which SEC licenses of Time Warner, if any, would transfer to the new company and obviously, if there are licenses to be transferred, the SEC will review those."

And lo and behold, we invest in mobile broadband and smartphones come long. And smartphones take off as became a catalyst for growth in this business for the last 10 years, literally. And while all these has been going on in the smartphone, we have been accumulating rather aggressively, since 2012, a really big portfolio of wireless Spectrum licenses. And we're sitting here today with 40 megahertz of [indiscernible] Spectrum, [indiscernible] waiting to be built into and deployed for video.

And now video and content that is uniquely curated and developed for these kind of devices and now we haven't even begun to talk about 5G. And as you think about 5G, video is a huge driver of it but it goes so far beyond video. As we think about where it goes in a world of 5G, 1 gig type networks, now virtual reality can truly become reality. Augmented reality now begins to manifest itself. We're talking about autonomous cars. I mean, I am convicted we are going to have autonomous cars traversing our major metropolitan areas in the next 5 years in a really significant way. Depending on who talk to in the autonomous car business, the developers and the inventors. They believe that the bandwidth requirements of an autonomous car is 1 gigabytes per car per mile just huge bandwidth requirement. IoT, Internet of Things, health care. I just think we're one of those moments where yes, everybody has a smartphone, that smartphone is becoming the launching point for what is next. And we think what is next is really significant. And we now have the largest connected car portfolio in the United States, we have most major automobile manufacturers contracted with AT&T and so we just there's just a lot of opportunity left, Mike."

I think one point first on a branded phones, we had net adds this quarter, I want to make sure everybody knows that. Secondly, the 2G migration and the decision to shut down the network [indiscernible] about January 1 is impacting that and we had pressure in the quarter, particularly to our postpaid phone base because of that, and that will alleviate next year, that's correct. Third, we're seeing tremendous development [indiscernible] in the prepaid space of the Cricket brand and adding significant customers in the aerospace. It's still relatively new to us. We've been in it about 2 years now in a significant way. It's what's helping drive margins as it really improved their revenue growth, the profitability and the customer counts. And as we talk about many times before, the cost of adding a prepaid subscriber is very, very low; building of credit checks, no subsidies, and the ARPUs that we have is very good. So all that's happening, and that's what adding to these great margins, that's what building these great margins. One thing I would point to though that are more excited about the fact that we added 700,000 smartphones during the quarter. So the devices -- so that -- so that -- while our total adds, our branded phone adds were certainly less than 700,000, we are trading up to much higher quality customer who has much more functionality with his phone practically in light of this transaction; much higher quality capability to watch video and then utilize the content that Time Warner brings, we feel very good in that position. On a going-forward basis, after we get through the 2G, certainly, we should see some of the 2G, we will see the 2G pressures alleviate. But the focus for growth is what Randall really talked about in the sense of these platforms we built whether it be the connected cars, whether be it the Internet of Things, whether it be the various different capabilities we provide business and consumers in this Internet of Things environment as well as the prepaid market as we continue to take share and grow in that. So that's where we think this real opportunity. Certainly we'll continue to grow our smartphone base. I don't mean to imply we won't at all but it is a more mature market. It's the opportunity to, if you will, ship those feature phones to smartphones and if that opportunity to deploy into a prepaid space or value customers base that hadn't been our focus -- our lead focus for years now has become a very strong focus for us and then the Internet of Things, the connected devices, which provide a dramatic opportunity for us both from a business and a consumer."

And good morning, everybody.
What we're going to do is Jeff and I are going to provide some color on the business combination, and then we'll spend our time addressing whatever questions you might have.
Look, we're convinced this combination, Time Warner and AT&T, is a perfect match for our 2 companies, vertically integrated. I mean we will be able to bring a fresh approach to how the media and communication industry works for customers, for content creators, for distributors as well as advertisers. We'll be uniquely positioned to lead and even accelerate the next wave of innovation in terms of how people enjoy video entertainment. Time Warner is the global leader in media and entertainment with terrific brands; and their brands, we all know and love, from Game of Thrones to CNN and Superman, just to name a few. It is a vast content library, and we believe it's the best on the planet. And hands down, Time Warner has the best creative talent and journalists in the industry.
When you combine Time Warner's content with our scale in distribution, we have 100 million-plus mobile -- TV, mobile and broadband subscribers; you put that with our customer insights and the addressable advertising opportunities that flow from that, we think we build something here that's really special. And it creates significant, strategic as well as financial benefits. With content distribution and customer insights, we'll be able to deliver new subscription as well as advertising models and new content formats that traditional programmers have been hesitant to adopt, particularly for content that's designed for mobile consumption and sharing on social media. Owning content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will help pay for the costs of content creation. And this 2-sided business model, advertising and subscription based, helps pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers more choices in terms of how they get their content. And only AT&T will have the world's best premium content with the networks to deliver on every screen.
We expect to close this transaction by the end of 2017. And I've been asked a lot: Why now? It comes at a time when the media and communication industries are converging. And Jeff and I sat down back in August to talk about where we saw the industry headed and how a combination between our companies would really remove a lot of the friction in the industry; then help accelerate innovation in terms of content that's mobile, customized and social. The next wave of innovation in this business takes vertical integration of premium content and distribution, and I suspect the rest of the industry is going to innovate right with us. And by the time our Time Warner deal closes at the end of next year, we'll be nearly 2.5 years into integrating DIRECTV, and that work is going to be essentially behind us. Our Time Warner deal is more of a bolt-on acquisition. It's not a normal full-blown integration like you've seen in past deals.
The big part of the value of this transaction is Time Warner's outstanding leadership team and the amazing creative talent and journalists that they've put together. And that's why we plan to run Time Warner in the same way that it's run today.
If you would turn to Slide 6 in the deck. Let's talk about the capabilities this business is going to have. First, we'll be the leader in premium content. Time Warner has an amazing portfolio of content creation and aggregation and some iconic brands across programming and TV and film production. HBO is the #1 global leader in premium content subscriptions, producing hit shows like Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley and Veep for its HBO and Cinemax networks. Warner Bros. has the largest film and studio in the world; hit franchises like Harry Potter, Superman and The Voice; and box office hits like American Sniper. And it has the best and biggest entertainment library on the planet. Turner has top-rated basic cable network: TNT, TBS and Cartoon Network and Adult Swim; and Turner's premium sports right, including the NBA, March Madness, Major League Baseball. And that combined with our rights to the NFL SUNDAY TICKET is going to create a very strong sports programming portfolio. And Turner has great digital assets like Bleacher Report, cnn.com.
If you look at Slide 7. We'll have unmatched scale in distribution and customer relationships. 144 million mobile subscribers in the U.S. and Mexico, 45 million subscribers in the U.S. and throughout Latin America make us the world's largest pay TV provider. We have about 16 million U.S. broadband subscribers. And we have a growing OTT business with HBO NOW and soon DIRECTV Now. And also, our joint venture with the Chernin Group, Otter Media, has 1.2 million subscribers on one [ph] of its various SVOD services. And we have more than 88,000 retail points of sale across North America.
And third, all that will give us some robust viewership insights. Then we'll use those insights from our TV, mobile and broadband subscribers to inform what content we create. We'll develop content that's better tailored to what specific audience segments want to watch when, where and on which device. And we'll use the insights to expand the market for addressable advertising. And addressable advertising is far more effective and more valuable both to the advertisers and to our customer. Owning content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will allow us to grow 2-sided business models, help pay for the costs of content creation. And this 2-sided business model, advertising and subscription based, helps to pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers more choices on how they get their content.
As you move to Slide 8, I want to walk you through the highlights of the transaction. And then later, John Stephens is going to dive a little deeper into this.
So we're paying $107.50 per share. It's half stock and half cash, and the stock portion is subject to a collar. And we believe this is the optimal capital structure for a deal of this size. The financial benefits are straightforward and we think they're significant. In the first year after closing, it's accretive to margins and adjusted EPS and free cash flow on a per share basis. It improves our dividend coverage. It enhances and diversifies our revenue and earnings growth profile. And the structure of the deal allows us to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong investment-grade credit matrix (sic) [ metrics ].
The approval is fairly straightforward. Time Warner shareholders will vote on it. And it will have regulatory reviews in the U.S., the EU and a few other countries.
And so that's the structure of the deal. What I'd like to do now is hand it over to Jeff Bewkes, the Chairman and CEO of Time Warner; and let him take you through his thoughts."

Good morning, everyone.I'm really pleased with this transaction and with Time Warner's future as part of AT&T. Joining forces will accelerate the evolution of both our companies as we go where consumers are going in the converging world",384,"Thanks, Randall. Good morning, everyone.
I'm really pleased with this transaction and with Time Warner's future as part of AT&T. Joining forces will accelerate the evolution of both our companies as we go where consumers are going in the converging worlds of media and communications, and that will drive more growth and more value for shareholders. 
This combination creates both immediate and long-term value. The Time Warner shareholders -- share price represents about a 36% premium to our closing price of $79.24 on October 19. And it also has a very attractive consideration mix of 50% cash and 50% AT&T stock for each Time Warner share. That gives our shareholder base roughly a 15% pro forma ownership in the world's leading integrated media and communications company with a strong financial profile, as Randall just said; and a combined track record of success and innovation in both companies. And we believe the pro forma company is very well positioned to drive attractive growth for years to come.
We expect innovation to be an important driver of that growth since we see AT&T's distribution capabilities as an enormous opportunity for us. As I said, we need to go where the consumers are going. And that's increasingly mobile, increasingly multiplatform. And it's increasingly on demand through new services via direct consumer relationships over broadband. And this aligns us with all of that. Additionally, there's the huge opportunity Randall mentioned to utilize consumer insights to inform content creation, and that allows us to continue to create not just the biggest hits but also content and program that really engages with targeted, passionate niches in the audience. We'll be able to do that more efficiently while also innovating very important new subscription and advertising models to increase consumer choice.
So we see the opportunity to create tremendous long-term value in this combination, and that's what's driving this transaction. As I said at the outset, AT&T's distribution capabilities significantly advance our direct-to-consumer reference and our ability to develop new offerings for all the leading content that we already create and distribute today. And together with AT&T, we'll develop new, innovative business models and forms of content that consumers will be demanding tomorrow in this ubiquitous multi-platform, on-demand and increasingly mobile environment.
So now I'll turn it over to John Stephens."

And good morning, everyone.Let me provide the financial expectations that we have for this transaction and refer to Slide 10.To recap. The purchase price value is Time Warner equity at about $85 billion, plus approximately $21 billion",1246,"Thank you, Jeff. And good morning, everyone.
Let me provide the financial expectations that we have for this transaction and refer to Slide 10.
To recap. The purchase price value is Time Warner equity at about $85 billion, plus approximately $21 billion of net debt from Time Warner. That brings the total transaction value to right at $106 billion. Time Warner shareholders will receive a 50-50 mix of cash and AT&T stock for their equity. The cash portion is already fully funded with a $40 billion bridge loan and additional AT&T liquidity. We remain strongly committed at maintaining a sound balance sheet and solid investment-grade credit metric. And we see significant opportunity for rapid deleveraging potential given the attractive free cash flow of the combined companies. In fact, we expect pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA to be in the 2.5x range by the end of the first year after the close of the transaction and approaching the 1.8x range by the end of year 4.
We see solid synergy potential in the $1 billion run rate by the end of year 3. As you would expect, this is substantially cost driven, corporate- and procurement-type expenses, the kind we know how to get, but we believe there are also significant opportunities from the vertical integration of content and distribution. And the vast amount of data available from the combined company will allow not only a greater value proposition to offer advertisers but will allow more informed and efficient content development.
This transaction also diversifies us and enhances our revenue mix. A strong cash flow and a lower capital intensity gives us flexibility as we grow these businesses. As mentioned earlier, we expect adjusted EPS to be accretive in the first year and free cash flow and free cash flow per share to be accretive within that same time frame. The deal also improves our strong free cash flow dividend coverage. And as you saw, we just announced our 33rd consecutive dividend increase. We're shooting a 100% raise in the dividend with every chance we've had over the last 33 years. We are extremely proud of that track record.
Now I'd like to spend the last few minutes of this presentation giving you a high-level view of our very good third quarter results that we released on Saturday, starting with our financial summary on Slide 12.
Our teams continued to execute at a high level in the quarter. Third quarter consolidated revenues grew nearly 5% to $40.9 billion, in large part due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. On a comparable basis, revenues were down slightly, as growth in video and IP-based services mostly offset pressure from declines in wireless, legacy services; and the second quarter 2016 transition of certain hosting operation. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, comparable revenues were essentially flat.
We grew net income in the quarter. After adjustments, third quarter EPS was $0.74, the same as last year's third quarter and up almost 4% year-to-date. This comes even with about $0.02 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. Margins also continued to be solid even with the pressure from our investment cycle in Mexico, thanks to the teams' focus on profitability and our best-ever wireless service margins.
All this continues to drive strong cash flows. We had our second highest-ever operating cash flows of $11 billion, with free cash flow reaching $5.2 billion. That's more than $13 billion in year-to-date free cash flow. Year-to-date, our dividend payout ratio is 67%, ahead of our full year guidance.
Capital investment is on plan coming in at $5.9 billion for the quarter and just over $16 billion year-to-date. We also continue to focus on our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio, which came in at 2.24.
Let's now take a look at our operations. Those details are on Slide 13. In a competitive wireless market, we continue to effectively manage our business. This has helped us add subscribers, lower postpaid churn and improve profitability. We turned in record wireless service EBITDA margins of 50.1%. This comes even as promotions heated up at the end of the quarter. We took a smart, strategic approach with our marketing moves. You see the impact in our postpaid churn. With all the noise in the marketplace, we had our second best third quarter postpaid churn ever. Postpaid churn of 1.05% was an 11 basis point improvement over the year-ago third quarter, and this includes about 2 basis points of pressure from our 2G network migration. Postpaid phone churn was even lower at 0.90%. That's a 14 basis point improvement over a year ago. We turned in another strong quarter of subscriber growth. We had 1.5 million domestic net adds. And when you include our Mexico operations, we grew our North American subscriber base by 2.3 million.
The growth of our prepaid business continues to be exceptional. We added more than 300,000 prepaid phones in the quarter, and prepaid revenues were up more than 20% year-over-year. This drove branded phone growth and helped increase our branded smartphone base by another 700,000 subscribers.
Turning to our Entertainment Group. On a comparative basis, revenues grew as IP and video revenue outpaced legacy declines. Margins also continued to expand at a healthy clip. Our reported margins were up 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by merger synergies and a full quarter of DIRECTV in these -- in this year's results.
Overall, TV and broadband subscribers were relatively stable in the quarter. We added more than 300,000 DIRECTV subscribers and then have added 1.2 million DIRECTV subscribers since we acquired DIRECTV in July of last year.
Our business solutions team also performed well in a challenging economy. Our flow share is good, and we continue to see the benefits of an integrated wireless and wireline approach. Thanks to wireless, we grew business revenues in the quarter. And we grew revenues in all our retail segments, enterprise, small business and the public sector. Strategic business services also grew at a solid clip, up $240 million year-over-year. That's up 9.1%. And when you adjust for FX, growth was closer to 10%.
Let me close with a summary of the quarter on Slide 14.
We're proud of what we've accomplished this quarter. Earnings continue to grow, and consolidated margins are stable even with the pressure from our Mexico investment. Year-to-date adjusted EPS is up nearly 4%, and we have the second highest cash from operations ever. We answered competitive headwinds in wireless with our best wireless service margins ever and our second best-ever third quarter postpaid churn. We added 1.5 million U.S. subscribers and positive phone net adds and grew our smartphone base by 700,000.
The integration of DIRECTV continues to generate the cost savings and sales opportunities we thought it would. We're on track to launch DIRECTV Now this quarter and are excited about what this brings. And Mexico continues to be a growth story, just a tremendous job by our team. They're ahead of plan with their 4G LTE deployment, with their rebranding efforts and with customer growth.
Our guidance for the year remains on track: double-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth with stable margins. And free cash flow growth has been strong, with dividend coverage year-to-date at 67%.
As we enter the home stretch of the year, we feel very good about our results and we look forward to finishing the year strong.
And with that, I believe we're ready for Q&A. And I'll turn it over to Roxanne."

So you hit the big driver that we're envisioning, and that's the DIRECTV Now product that we'll be launching next month. And I'll tell you, the more we iterate and work on DIRECTV and launch it in November, the more excited we get about what we're going to be putting in the marketplace but, I will tell you, the more excited we get about what else we'll be able to do on this platform. And there are a lot of things we really aspire to do with this platform as it -- as you think about incorporating social into the platform; and as you begin to think about how you share content on this platform, clipping content that you're watching and sharing it with your friends via messaging or being in social media. We think that -- we don't think. We know our customers are really demanding that. Now what I would tell you is trying to develop those type of capabilities with the current content providers is proving difficult. It's arm's-length negotiation, and people are obviously very protective of their content. And so it's just really, really hard to get these type of iterations and innovations on content done. So the thing that Jeff and I get most excited about when we talk about this transaction is now in these over-the-top environments and platforms we can begin to innovate our content much quicker. We're under the same umbrella, same ownership structured. And we can get past a lot of these content rights and so forth and move fast. And I will tell you we are both convinced that, as we innovate in this way and as we accelerate the pace of this innovation, it's going to attract others to want to do the same on these platforms. So those are kind of a snippet of some of the things we're thinking about. Jeff, would you add anything to add that?"

We've been trying at Time Warner to get more video on demand on not just our networks but have it become a universal thing for every American. You go to your set-top, your television and that whole dial of networks; hundreds of channels. They should all be VOD, just like HBO or Netflix is. And we announced that and we made it available to all our distributors for all the Time Warner networks at Turner and HBO more than 5 years ago. No payment extra. We -- if -- the condition was we'll give you full VOD on your television platforms, on your broadband platforms provided that it goes to every consumer with no extra charge. Everybody has got to get the same offer. And we could just do it for our networks. We announced it first with Comcast years ago. What we saw, to Randall's point, is that the various cable and other kinds of distributors took a long time to create that offering across every other kind of network. And often, the reason was they are waiting for various negotiations of this cable company versus that network group, and you just didn't see a universal offering that's what consumers were demanding. And so we think with this, with AT&T and DIRECTV, our largest affiliate distributor on television -- they're the largest and best at mobile delivery. And so when -- we want to bring more packages; more choice for consumers at different price points at every kind of level, upper, lower; more channels, fewer channels; more mobility; more innovation of the kinds of programming. And then with the advertising capabilities, we can make the advertising more interesting for your house versus somebody next door, the products you're interested, not the ones you don't need to see. And that means that more of the consumers get a better experience viewing. They get less interruptions. And it means that more of the costs of the programming, which is there's an investment burn [ph] in programming, but more of the costs can then be borne by advertisers and consumers get a break. So you -- the benefit for this -- for consumers is pretty good, very good. And the benefit for advertisers is terrific because, if you look at what's happening in that world, advertisers need more competition. And this will give another outlet, not just the Google and Facebook one that's gaining all of the -- has been gaining all the traction but now have -- you get another advertising choice that's equally efficient."

And we get more and more enthusiastic about the world of 5G the more we get into this and see what kind of services will be consumed over-the-top on our mobile networks. So there's just a real synergistic effect across everything, from infrastructure investment, back to the distribution platforms and content creation and advertising models. This just has a lot of opportunities for us."

DIRECTV Now is a mobile-centric product. And if this product is as good as we believe that it is and our customers really begin to enjoy it, there should be advantages of using DIRECTV Now on AT&T's network, and there will be. And by that same token, if we're iterating quickly into DIRECTV Now with the Time Warner content, then we begin to differentiate the DIRECTV Now platform as well. And hopefully, as Jeff articulated and expressed, as we begin to iterate and innovate the Time Warner content, I am actually convinced that, if we're successful with this, it will incentivize other content creators to do the same and want to innovate on top of this platform as well. So I think it gives us great diversification. 15% of our revenues after this deal is closed will be Time Warner and which is media and entertainment, but -- so the diversification is great, but I think it also gives us an opportunity to differentiate our platform."

You're in the verge of some new business models that you've mentioned on the OTT side. And arguably, the revenue synergies have just begun with respect to DIRECTV.

In terms of where we stand on the DIRECTV integration, Amir, as you recall, the biggest benefit financially from the integration were the cost synergies. And we set an objective of getting $2.5 billion per year of costs out of the business, $1.5 billion of that being this year. We're way ahead of schedule on achieving those cost synergies. And as you think about this transaction that we're -- that we've put together here, closing end-of-2017 time frame, we're going to be way down the path of the integration activities and achieving those cost synergies and so forth. The other element that was really critical in terms of achieving synergies from this was getting all of those content rights to distribute over our mobile platform. And so the DIRECTV Now, that required a lot of heavy lifting to go around all the content creators and get these new rights to distribute this content over-the-top to our mobile providers. Those are largely done. We're a little over 1 year into this, and all those content agreements are basically in place. That was a lot of heavy lifting. There's been an unbelievable amount of work and effort going into that. And now we're really moving the -- we're really early into deploying these new platforms. And I would tell you, the more we get into the DIRECTV Now over-the-top platform, the more excited we get about the opportunity. And then as we think about the ability to bring Time Warner content into that, it's just the enthusiasm level just continues to go up and go up. So I would tell you I think the timing of the Time Warner deal as it relates to the integration of DIRECTV is actually a very good fit. I think the timing is very good bringing it in at the end of 2017. And we're going to be in a place where all of our installation crews for DIRECTV are integrated. We're doing one truck roll to the house. Our call center operations will be integrated at that point in time. So with all -- a lot of what I'd call the key logistical, difficult things to do in terms of integration, we'll have the lion's share of those done by end of 2017. We still have some what I'd call big IT-type things, information technology development that won't be completed, but those aren't big rocks that are going to get in the way of trying to integrate Time Warner at this time. So then lastly, I would tell you, a deal like this, when Jeff and I met, and we both gained conviction in terms of what was in the art of the possible here as we put these 2 companies together, we both became convinced and convicted that it was the deal that ought to happen. These kind of deals, you don't sit around and wait for the perfect timing. I mean, once you have a deal and you have a deal structure, given the potential for leaks and so forth, the objective is to push them through and get them done. And that's exactly what we did here. And so there's never a perfect time for a deal like this, but actually I think this fits very well with our own integration plans and I also think it fits well in terms of how fast this industry is moving. The convergence in terms of media and distribution is moving fast. We want to be at the front of it. We don't want to be chasing it. And doing this deal now allows us to lead in this type of convergence activity and bring stuff to our customers that they want before other people bring it to their customers. So I think the timing actually works out quite well."

But when we looked at this, it's very clear that this qualifies, in every definition of the word, as a vertical merger. It's a vertical integration. And most of the deals, in fact all of the deals, that have gotten in trouble lately over the last few years have been horizontal mergers where a competitor is being taken out of the marketplace or the regulators were concerned that a competitor would be removed from the marketplace. This is vertical. This company is a supplier to AT&T, and it is a pure technical vertical integration. Vertical integrations, where regulators have concerns with those, are remedied or addressed. Those concerns are addressed through conditions. And so we anticipate that the regulators may have some issues that they want to deal with on this. There may be conditions, but we're convinced that these type of issues can be handled with conditions. And it's rare. In fact, I'm not sure we know of a situation where vertical integration has been blocked by the government in our 2 sectors. David, would you have anything to add to that?"

And so as a result, we are looking forward to the regulatory process which is going to be guided by facts and guided by the law. And Randall is right. When you look in modern history of media and the Internet, the U.S. government has always approved vertical mergers like this, and they do so for good reason. They've put downward pressure on consumer prices. They increased competition and consumer choice. And in our case, they spurred the sort of innovation and investment that Randall and Jeff have talked about. So we enter this process confident. We don't prejudge the outcome.

And we didn't think that would be as well accomplished for a number of reasons, financial structure, regulatory approval as part of a media company that we had at that time. The second thing, which I think is more important, is the world is much different now. You now have net neutrality in place. You've got broadband distribution. You have mobile as an ever-bigger part of the distribution package. And you have a lot of incoming new distributor or competition coming from Facebook, Netflix, Google, Amazon. And so as the distribution world changes, having distribution capabilities to innovate on mobile sets, on across broadband; and with the ability to speak directly to consumers, offer customized subscription packages and more effective targeted advertising, it's both more competition on both sides and it allows us to have our networks be more attractively offered to consumers. And what I mean by that is VOD with better interfaces. And I think that the distribution industry, not AT&T and not Comcast so far, they've been good at this, but a lot of the distribution companies, particularly the cable companies, have been slow to provide these innovations for consumers. And we think this will help spur that across the industry."

If you have to iterate and innovate quickly, it's really difficult to do in a partnering, arm's-length negotiated-type transaction. I -- our history is long in terms of examples of this, not the least of which was we had been a -- what I'd call a tightly integrated reseller of DIRECTV for a long time. And it was an important part of our package, but you never could get the tight integration of the customer experience. We closed DIRECTV and we get the customer experience integrated, and then within 1 year, we've added 1.2 million DIRECTV customers. We've never even begun to approach a number like that when we were just partnering and reselling their product. And then as you think about, for example, the DIRECTV Now launch, we have been working 3 or 4 years to bring to market a mobile-centric package of content to our customers. And we have been working aggressively to put this together. And getting the content creators to agree to the rights to put this over our mobile platform was proving to be very, very difficult. We closed DIRECTV, and with those great content agreements that we now own at DIRECTV, within 1 year, we've achieved all of those content rights, literally within a year. So what we've been trying to do in 3 years, we achieved in 1 year after owning DIRECTV. I am convinced that, as we try to bring unique capabilities with content to our customers and really integrate, I'm talking about integrating deeply, social aspects and interaction of our customers with content and so forth, as we try to do that, doing it in an ownership structure rather than a partnering structure will happen faster. And I'll say it again, that I believe, if we're successful at this, it will drive the whole industry to begin to innovate faster. And everybody will want to innovate on these platforms in the same way. So just a long history, Simon, of where you try to partner, you can get there. It's slow. It's painful. Just the contracting itself takes a lot of time, whereas when it's completely owned, you just move a lot faster."

So I think the match between the two of us and being able to help upgrade distribution and lead a real continuing buoyancy, just a secular takeup in Latin American countries of television services. It's a bit like where the U.S. was 20 years ago.

And so keeping the talents and retaining the talent is really, really important to us. And I would tell you I feel like we have some good plans in place to ensure that we can keep the talent in place. The way we will organize the business, David, is Time Warner will be a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T. And it will stand on its own and will continue to operate at very similar to how it's operated today. We'll have to figure out the management art of how we affect the data, beginning to influence content; and how we allow the data and the customer insights that we have on our mobile platform and our TV platform to influence advertising that's delivered into the Time Warner advertising veils and how we begin to take advantage of that. And so there's a lot of integration work that's done at that level, but Time Warner will be operated marginally independent and as an independent subsidiary of AT&T.

They're still concerned in the push and pulls of the situation. One is the amount of debt is large, and we're all aware of that, but the -- on the other side, the ability to generate $60 billion of EBITDA and $45 billion of -- so to speak, of annual cash from operations provides a great opportunity to service that debt. Third, I think the agencies are evaluating the change, if you will; the diversification opportunities that this provides; and then growth, the enhanced growth opportunity it provides. If you look at the transaction from a starting point on date of close, if you assume end of year, kind of in the 2.7x range of net debt-to-EBITDA and getting down to the -- closer to our traditional target of 1.8x after 4 years, that ability to lay that out gives us comfort that we certainly will remain investment grade and would argue very strongly to keep our current ratings with those agencies. I would expect they'll come out with some interim announcements that will -- as they work through the analysis. This is normal in this case. So that's really how we view it. From a rate perspective, I think the one thing I need to point out is over 90% or about 90% of our debt is locked into rates here with about a 14-year average life. We don't have much floating debt at this time. So first point I'd make is this transaction really doesn't have -- has very minimal effect on our current interest expense cost for the legacy AT&T. When you layer-on the towers of debt of Time Warner, they fit very nicely on top of the towers of AT&T; and give a very manageable, very easily managed process for refinancing or paying down debt, so we feel very comfortable with that. Our assumptions were very conservative. We took a step-up from a 30-year bond rate that we'd see today. We took a step-up from that in our models instead of our traditional normal conservative approach. So we feel good about having the right level of interest expense for the incremental. And as I said, the base is locked up for a long period of time."

We continue to expect the business units, specifically the 3 business units, to operate. And they're really -- these are not personnel focused. I just want to make sure that's clear. When you think about our synergies, on a combined basis we'll be a company that spends close to $6 billion a year on advertising. And as we've proven, as our leadership in our corporate communications group has proven over the last year, we can mine savings out of combining 2 companies' advertising and communications because we've been very successful with that. We've gone there from DTV. If you look, quite frankly, at our telcom spend -- or at Time Warner's telcom spend, they're not an AT&T shop extensively today. We've got a real opportunity to provide really highest-quality services. And really from an investment base that we already have, that goes for both wireless and wireline, so that's a very direct one. If you think about the platforms, we've been moving very quickly and very effectively and building a platform for DTV Now to distribute video over all kinds of screens. With that, we now have that ability to share that platform and that distribution device with HBO, with the Turner networks, with the Warner studios. We have a real opportunity. And that's going to provide efficiency savings; and then frankly, get into the things like what I call shared services like efficiencies on payroll, efficiencies on accounts payable, efficiencies in cash management, all those kinds of things. So we've done very detailed analyses of these cost-focused synergies. That's what gets us to the viewpoint that, in the -- at the end of year 3, we'll be on a run rate for $1 billion of cost savings and cash flow generation. And we feel very good about that. And once again, it's really focused on really the supply chain and then, of course, the corporate structure, but we feel very good about achieving that."

And I'll sneak one more in, if I can, on John Stephens just with respect with the handset adds. If it weren't for 2G losses this quarter, postpaid handsets would have been positive, I believe.

I think it's a wise question. Let me focus on what I think is the most critical issue. The regulators will focus on what the market structure looks like today and then what the market structure looks like post transaction. This is a very important point. Point number one is the structure of this industry will not change. There's no loss of competition. There's no loss of competitors. From a horizontal standpoint, the structure remains very much similar as it was today, and that's exactly what Randall and Jeff have been talking about in terms of the verticalness of this transaction. Point number two, the distribution model doesn't change. Time Warner has built an incredibly successful business, distributing its content as widely as possible, and that won't change either. So that leaves the question of what will change, and that's what's so exciting about this transaction. When you bring together wireless and content for the first time, wireless and content for the first time, you create a unique company that can work within that industry structure to innovate in very important ways that benefit consumers. Number one, you're able to take that wide distribution of Time Warner content and you're able to broaden that distribution, especially in the mobile world. And number two, you've heard it discussed here today, you're able to, with that combined company, innovate new platforms, new video experiences, things that can't be done by arm's-length contract alone. You can't innovate through arm's-length contract arrangements. And so by doing so, what the regulators will be interested in, first and foremost, is talk about what happens immediately after the transaction and then talk about what happens thereafter. And so once regulators, we are convinced, understand the facts around what I've just described, they'll see a positive story when it comes to market structure and they'll see a positive story as it comes to innovations. And then ultimately, we get to the point that Randall talked about earlier. It's that innovation spurs more innovation, and it generates demand for video applications over mobile networks that is 5G's best friend. And so when you put all that together, it's a very compelling case that we look forward to discussing with regulators. You asked about whether it'd be a DOJ-only process or whether the FCC would be involved. We know at this point, of course, the DOJ will be reviewing the transaction. At this point, we are determining which FCC licenses of Time Warner, if any, would transfer to the new company. And obviously, if there are licenses to be transferred, the FCC would review those."

We say, wow, it really is mature, and it's just getting hypercompetitive. And I can't help but reflect on, I think it was, 2005, shortly after we bought AT&T Wireless, and we launched the RAZR, the Motorola RAZR. And I will never forget how many people would ask me, ""What are you going to do after everybody has a RAZR? This industry is mature, right?"" And lo and behold, we invest in mobile broadband and smartphones come long. And smartphones take off and they become a catalyst for growth in this business for the last 10 years literally. And while all this has been going on with the smartphone, we have been accumulating rather aggressively since 2012 a really big portfolio of wireless spectrum licenses. And we're sitting here today with 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum, fallow waiting to be built into and deployed for video because now, with these tablets and these smartphones everywhere, they're not just Internet-access devices. They are video-consuming devices. And so we have positioned ourselves to begin investing aggressively and ensuring that our customers can enjoy video and now video and content that is uniquely curated and developed for these kind of devices. And now we haven't even begun to talk about 5G. And as you think about 5G, video is a huge driver of it, but it goes so far beyond video. And as we think about where it goes in a world of 5G, 1-gig-type networks, now virtual reality can truly become reality. Augmented reality now begins to manifest itself. We're talking about autonomous cars. I mean I am convicted we are going to have autonomous cars traversing our major metropolitan areas in the next 5 years in a really significant way. Depending on who you talk to in the autonomous car business, the developers and the inventors, they believe that the bandwidth requirements of an autonomous car is 1 gigabyte per car per mile, just huge bandwidth requirements. IoT, Internet of Things. Health care. I just think we're in one of those moments where, yes, everybody has a smartphone. That smartphone is now becoming the launching point for what is next. And we think what is next is really significant. And we now have the largest connected car portfolio in the United States. We have most major automobile manufacturers contracted with AT&T, and so we just think there's a lot of opportunity left, Mike."

On our branded phones, we had net adds this quarter. I want to make sure everybody knows that. Secondly, the 2G migration and the decision to shut down that network on or about January 1 is impacting that, and we had pressure in the quarter, particularly to our postpaid phone base, because of that. And that will alleviate next year. That's correct. Third, we're seeing tremendous development for us in the prepaid space, so the Cricket brand; and adding significant customers there in the space. It's still relatively new to us. We've been in it about 2 years now in a significant way. It's what's helping drive margins, as it has really improved the revenue growth, the profitability and the customer counts. And as we've talked about many times before, the cost of adding a prepaid subscriber is very, very low; billing of credit checks, no subsidies. And the ARPUs that we're going to have is very good. So all that's happening, and that's what adding to these great margins. That's what's building these great margins. The one thing I would point to you, though, that we're -- that I'm more excited about than just pure count is the fact that we added 700,000 smartphones during the quarter. So the devices that -- so that -- while the -- our total net adds, our branded phone adds were certainly less than that 700,000, we are trading up to a much higher-quality customer who has much more functionality with his phone, particularly in light of this transaction; a much higher-quality capability to watch video and then utilize the content that Time Warner brings. We feel very good in that position. On a going-forward basis, after we get through the 2G, certainly we should see some of the 2G -- we will see the 2G pressures alleviate, but the focus for growth is what Randall really talked about in the sense of these platforms we've built and whether they'd be the connected cars; whether they'd be the Internet of Things; whether they'd be the various, different capabilities we provide business in consumers in this Internet of Things environment; as well as the prepaid market as we continue to take share and grow in that. So that's where we think there's real opportunities. Certainly, we'll continue to grow our smartphone base. I don't mean to imply we won't at all. I -- but it is a more mature market. It's the opportunity to, if you will, shift those feature phones to smartphones. And it's that opportunity to deploy into a prepaid space or value customer space that hadn't been our focus for -- our lead focus for years and now has become a very strong focus for us; and then the Internet of Things, the connected devices, which provide a dramatic opportunity for us both from a business and a consumer/customer point of view."

And good morning, everybody.
What we're going to do is Jeff and I are going to provide some color on the business combination, and then we'll spend our time addressing whatever questions you might have.
Look, we're convinced this combination, Time Warner and AT&T, is a perfect match for our 2 companies, vertically integrated. I mean we'll be able to bring a fresh approach to how the media and communication industry works for customers, for content creators, for distributors as well as advertisers. We'll be uniquely positioned to lead and even accelerate the next wave of innovation in terms of how people enjoy video entertainment. Time Warner is the global leader in media and entertainment, with terrific brands. And they're brands we all know and love, from Game of Thrones to CNN and Superman, just to name a few. It is a vast content library, and we believe it's the best on the planet. And hands down, Time Warner has the best creative talent and journalists in the industry.
When you combine Time Warner's content with our scale in distribution -- we have 100 million-plus mobile -- TV, mobile and broadband subscribers. You put that with our customer insights and the addressable advertising opportunities that flow from that, we think we build something here that's really special. And it creates significant strategic as well as financial benefits. With content distribution and customer insights, we'll be able to deliver new subscription as well as advertising models and new content formats that traditional programmers have been hesitant to adopt, particularly for content that's designed for mobile consumption and sharing on social media. Owning content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will help pay for the cost of content creation. And this 2-sided business model, advertising and subscription-based, helps pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers more choices in terms of how they get their content. And only AT&T will have the world's best premium content with the networks to deliver on every screen.
We expect to close this transaction by the end of 2017. And I've been asked a lot: Why now? It comes at a time when the media and communication industries are converging. And Jeff and I sat down back in August to talk about where we saw the industry headed and how a combination between our companies would really remove a lot of the friction in the industry; then help accelerate innovation in terms of content that's mobile, customized and social. The next wave of innovation in this business takes vertical integration of premium content and distribution, and I suspect the rest of the industry is going to innovate right with us. And by the time our Time Warner deal closes at the end of next year, we'll be nearly 2.5 years into integrating DIRECTV, and that work is going to be essentially behind us. Our Time Warner deal is more of a bolt-on acquisition. It's not a normal full-blown integration like you've seen in past deals.
The big part of the value of this transaction is Time Warner's outstanding leadership team and the amazing creative talent and journalists that they've put together. And that's why we plan to run Time Warner the same way that it's run today.
If you would, turn to Slide 6 in the deck, and let's talk about the capabilities this business is going to have. First, we'll be the leader in premium content. Time Warner has an amazing portfolio of content creation and aggregation and some iconic brands across programming and TV and film production. HBO is the #1 global leader in premium content subscriptions, producing hit shows like Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley and Veep for its HBO and Cinemax networks. Warner Bros. has the largest film studio in the world; hit franchises like Harry Potter, Superman and The Voice; and box office hits like American Sniper. And it has the best and biggest entertainment library on the planet. Turner has top-rated basic cable network: TNT, TBS and Cartoon Network, Adult Swim; and Turner's premium sports rights, including the NBA, March Madness, Major League Baseball. And that combined with our rights to the NFL SUNDAY TICKET is going to create a very strong sports programming portfolio. And Turner has great digital assets like Bleacher Report, cnn.com.
If you look at Slide 7. We'll have unmatched scale in distribution and customer relationships. 144 million mobile subscribers in the U.S. and Mexico, 45 million subscribers in the U.S. and throughout Latin America make us the world's largest pay-TV provider. We have about 16 million U.S. broadband subscribers. And we have a growing OTT business with HBO NOW and soon DIRECTV Now. And also, our joint venture with the Chernin Group, Otter Media, has 1.2 million subscribers on its various SVOD services. And we have more than 88,000 retail points of sale across North America.
And third, all that will give us some robust viewership insights, and we'll use those insights from our TV, mobile and broadband subscribers to inform what content we create. We'll develop content that's better tailored to what specific audience segments want to watch, when, where and on which device. And we'll use the insights to expand the market for addressable advertising. And addressable advertising is far more effective and more valuable, both to the advertisers and to our customer. Owning content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will allow us to grow 2-sided business models, help pay for the costs of content creation. And this 2-sided business model, advertising and subscription-based, helps to pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers more choices on how they get their content.
As you move to Slide 8, I want to walk you through the highlights of the transaction. And then later, John Stephens is going to dive a little deeper into this.
So we're paying $107.50 per share. It's half stock and half cash, and the stock portion is subject to a collar. And we believe this is the optimal capital structure for a deal of this size. The financial benefits are straightforward, and we think they're significant. In the first year after closing, it's accretive to margins and adjusted EPS and free cash flow on a per-share basis. It improves our dividend coverage. It enhances and diversifies our revenue and earnings growth profile. And the structure of the deal allows us to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong investment-grade credit matrix (sic) [ metrics ]. 
The approval is fairly straightforward. Time Warner shareholders will vote on it. And then we'll have regulatory reviews in the U.S., the EU and a few other countries.
And so that's the structure of the deal. What I'd like to do now is hand it over to Jeff Bewkes, the Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, and let him take you through his thoughts."

Good morning, everyone.I'm really pleased with this transaction and with Time Warner's future as part of AT&T.

I'm really pleased with this transaction and with Time Warner's future as part of AT&T. Joining forces will accelerate the evolution of both our companies as we go where consumers are going in the converging worlds of media and communications, and that will drive more growth and more value for shareholders. 
This combination creates both immediate and long-term value. For Time Warner shareholders, the price represents about a 36% premium to our closing price of $79.24 on October 19. And it also has a very attractive consideration mix of 50% cash and 50% AT&T stock for each Time Warner share. That gives our shareholder base roughly a 15% pro forma ownership in the world's leading integrated media and communications company with a strong financial profile, as Randall just said, and a combined track record of success and innovation in both companies. And we believe the pro forma company is very well positioned to drive attractive growth for years to come.
We expect innovation to be an important driver of that growth since we see AT&T's distribution capabilities as an enormous opportunity for us. As I said, we need to go where the consumers are going. And that's increasingly mobile, increasingly multi-platform. And it's increasingly on demand through new services via direct consumer relationships over broadband. And this aligns us with all of that. Additionally, there's the huge opportunity Randall mentioned to utilize consumer insights to inform content creation, and that allows us to continue to create not just the biggest hits, but also content and programming that really engages with targeted, passionate niches in the audience. We'll be able to do that more efficiently while also innovating very important new subscription and advertising models to increase consumer choice.
So we see the opportunity to create tremendous long-term value in this combination, and that's what's driving this transaction. As I said at the outset, AT&T's distribution capabilities significantly advance our direct-to-consumer reference and our ability to develop new offerings for all the leading content that we already create and distribute today. And together with AT&T, we'll develop new, innovative business models and forms of content that consumers will be demanding tomorrow in this ubiquitous multi-platform, on-demand and increasingly mobile environment.
So now I'll turn it over to John Stephens."

And good morning, everyone.
Let me provide the financial expectations that we have for this transaction and refer to Slide 10.
To recap: The purchase price values Time Warner equity at about $85 billion, plus approximately $21 billion of net debt from Time Warner. That brings the total transaction value to right at $106 billion. Time Warner shareholders will receive a 50-50 mix of cash and AT&T stock for their equity. The cash portion is already fully funded with a $40 billion bridge loan and additional AT&T liquidity. We remain strongly committed to maintaining a sound balance sheet and solid investment-grade credit metric. And we see significant opportunity for rapid deleveraging potential given the attractive free cash flow of the combined companies. In fact, we expect pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA to be in the 2.5x range by the end of the first year after the close of the transaction and approaching the 1.8x range by the end of year 4.
We see solid synergy potential in the $1 billion run rate by the end of year 3. As you would expect, this is substantially cost driven, corporate- and procurement-type expenses, the kind we know how to get, but we believe there are also significant opportunities from the vertical integration of content and distribution. And the vast amount of data available from the combined company will allow not only a greater value proposition to offer advertisers but will allow more informed and efficient content development.
This transaction also diversifies us and enhances our revenue mix. A strong cash flow and a lower capital intensity gives us flexibility as we grow these businesses. As mentioned earlier, we expect adjusted EPS to be accretive in the first year and free cash flow and free cash flow per share to be accretive within that same time frame. The deal also improves our strong free cash flow dividend coverage. And as you saw, we just announced our 33rd consecutive dividend increase. We're shooting 100%, raising the dividend with every chance we've had over the last 33 years. We are extremely proud of that track record.
Now I'd like to spend the last few minutes of this presentation giving you a high-level view of our very good third quarter results that we released on Saturday, starting with our financial summary on Slide 12.
Our teams continued to execute at a high level in the quarter. Third quarter consolidated revenues grew nearly 5% to $40.9 billion, in large part due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. On a comparable basis, revenues were down slightly, as growth in video and IP-based services mostly offset pressure from declines in wireless, legacy services and the second quarter 2016 transition of certain hosting operations. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, comparable revenues were essentially flat.
We grew net income in the quarter. After adjustments, third quarter EPS was $0.74, the same as last year's third quarter and up almost 4% year-to-date. This comes even with about $0.02 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. Margins also continued to be solid, even with the pressure from our investment cycle in Mexico, thanks to the team's focus on profitability and our best-ever wireless service margins.
All this continues to drive strong cash flows. We had our second-highest-ever operating cash flows of $11 billion, with free cash flow reaching $5.2 billion. That's more than $13 billion in year-to-date free cash flow. Year-to-date, our dividend payout ratio is 67%, ahead of our full year guidance.
Capital investment is on plan, coming in at $5.9 billion for the quarter and just over $16 billion year-to-date. We also continue to focus on our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio, which came in at 2.24. 
Let's now take a look at our operations. Those details are on Slide 13. In a competitive wireless market, we continue to effectively manage our business. This has helped us add subscribers, lower postpaid churn and improve profitability. We turned in record wireless service EBITDA margins of 50.1%. This comes even as promotions heated up at the end of the quarter. We took a smart, strategic approach with our marketing moves. You see the impact in our postpaid churn. With all the noise in the marketplace, we had our second-best third quarter postpaid churn ever. Postpaid churn of 1.05% was an 11 basis point improvement over the year-ago third quarter, and this includes about 2 basis points of pressure from our 2G network migration. Postpaid phone churn was even lower at 0.90%. That's a 14 basis point improvement over a year ago. We turned in another strong quarter of subscriber growth. We had 1.5 million domestic net adds. And when you include our Mexico operations, we grew our North American subscriber base by 2.3 million.
The growth of our prepaid business continues to be exceptional. We added more than 300,000 prepaid phones in the quarter, and prepaid revenues were up more than 20% year-over-year. This drove branded phone growth and helped increase our branded smartphone base by another 700,000 subscribers.
Turning to our Entertainment Group. On a comparative basis, revenues grew as IP and video revenue outpaced legacy declines. Margins also continued to expand at a healthy clip. Our reported margins were up 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by merger synergies and a full quarter of DIRECTV in these -- in this year's results.
Overall, TV and broadband subscribers were relatively stable in the quarter. We added more than 300,000 DIRECTV subscribers and have added 1.2 million DIRECTV subscribers since we acquired DIRECTV in July of last year.
Our business solutions team also performed well in a challenging economy. Our flow share is good, and we continue to see the benefits of an integrated wireless and wireline approach. Thanks to wireless, we grew business revenues in the quarter. And we grew revenues in all our retail segments, enterprise, small business and the public sector. Strategic business services also grew at a solid clip, up $240 million year-over-year. That's up 9.1%. And when you adjust for FX, growth was closer to 10%.
Let me close with a summary of the quarter on Slide 14.
We're proud of what we've accomplished this quarter. Earnings continue to grow, and consolidated margins are stable, even with the pressure from our Mexico investment. Year-to-date adjusted EPS is up nearly 4%, and we had the second-highest cash from operations ever. We answered competitive headwinds in wireless with our best wireless service margins ever and our second-best-ever third quarter postpaid churn. We added 1.5 million U.S. subscribers, had positive phone net adds and grew our smartphone base by 700,000.
The integration of DIRECTV continues to generate the cost savings and sales opportunities we thought it would. We're on track to launch DIRECTV Now this quarter and are excited about what this brings. And Mexico continues to be a growth story. Just a tremendous job by our team, they're ahead of plan with their 4G LTE deployment, with their rebranding efforts and with customer growth.
Our guidance for the year remains on track: double-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth with stable margins. And free cash flow growth has been strong, with dividend coverage year-to-date at 67%.
As we enter the home stretch of the year, we feel very good about our results, and we look forward to finishing the year strong.
And with that, I believe we're ready for Q&A. And I'll turn it over to Roxanne."

So you hit the big driver that we're envisioning, and that's the DIRECTV Now product that we'll be launching next month. And I'll tell you, the more we iterate and work on DIRECTV and launch it in November, the more excited we get about what we're going to be putting in the marketplace but, I will tell you, the more excited we get about what else we'll be able to do on this platform. And there are a lot of things we really aspire to do with this platform as it -- as you think about incorporating social into the platform; and as you begin to think about how you share content on this platform, clipping content that you're watching and sharing it with your friends via messaging or being in social media. We think that -- we don't think -- we know our customers are really demanding that. Now what I would tell you is trying to develop those type of capabilities with the current content providers is proving difficult. It's arm's-length negotiation, and people are obviously very protective of their content. And so it's just really, really hard to get these type of iterations and innovations on content done. So the thing that Jeff and I get most excited about when we talk about this transaction is now, in these over-the-top environments and platforms, we can begin to innovate our content much quicker. We're under the same umbrella, same ownership structure. And we can get past a lot of these content rights and so forth and move fast. And I will tell you we are both convinced that as we innovate in this way and as we accelerate the pace of this innovation, it's going to attract others to want to do the same on these platforms. So those are kind of a snippet of some of the things we're thinking about. Jeff, would you add anything to add that?"

We've been trying at Time Warner to get more video on demand on not just our networks but have it become a universal thing for every American. You go to your set-top, your television and that whole dial of networks, hundreds of channels. They should all be VOD, just like HBO or Netflix is. And we announced that and we made it available to all our distributors for all the Time Warner networks at Turner and HBO more than 5 years ago. No payment extra. We -- if -- the condition was we'll give you full VOD on your television platforms, on your broadband platforms, provided that it goes to every consumer with no extra charge. Everybody's got to get the same offer. And we could just do it for our networks. We announced it first with Comcast years ago. What we saw, to Randall's point, is that the various cable and other kinds of distributors took a long time to create that offering across every other kind of network. And often, the reason was they were waiting for various negotiations of this cable company versus that network group, and you just didn't see a universal offering. It's what consumers were demanding. And so we think with this, with AT&T and DIRECTV, our largest affiliate distributor on television -- they're the largest and best at mobile delivery. And so when -- we want to bring more packages; more choice for consumers at different price points at every kind of level, upper, lower; more channels, fewer channels; more mobility; more innovation of the kinds of programming. And then with the advertising capabilities, we can make the advertising more interesting for your house versus somebody next door, the products you're interested, not the ones you don't need to see. And that means that more of the consumers get a better experience viewing. They get less interruptions. And it means that more of the cost of the programming, which is -- there's an investment boom in programming, but more of the cost can then be borne by advertisers and consumers get a break. So you -- the benefit for this -- for consumers is pretty good, very good. And the benefit for advertisers is terrific because, if you look at what's happening in that world, advertisers need more competition. And this will give another outlet, not just the Google and Facebook one that's gaining all of the -- has been gaining all the traction, but now you have yet another advertising choice that's equally efficient."

If we're right, as we begin to stimulate even more and more demand of video over-the-top on our mobile networks, the desire and the incentive to go faster on 5G deployment is heightened. And we get more and more enthusiastic about the world of 5G the more we get into this and see what kind of services will be consumed over-the-top on our mobile networks. So there's just a real synergistic effect across everything, from infrastructure investment, back through the distribution platforms and content creation and advertising models.

And by that same token, if we're iterating quickly into DIRECTV Now with the Time Warner content, then we begin to differentiate the DIRECTV Now platform as well. And hopefully, as Jeff articulated and expressed, as we begin to iterate and innovate the Time Warner content, I am actually convinced that, if we're successful with this, it will incentivize other content creators to do the same and want to innovate on top of this platform as well. So I think it gives us great diversification. 15% of our revenues after this deal is closed will be Time Warner and which is media and entertainment, but -- so the diversification is great, but I think it also gives us an opportunity to differentiate our platform."

You're on the verge of some new business models that you've mentioned on the OTT side. And arguably, the revenue synergies have just begun with respect to DIRECTV.

In terms of where we stand on the DIRECTV integration, Amir, as you recall, the biggest benefit financially from the integration were the cost synergies. And we set an objective of getting $2.5 billion per year of costs out of the business, $1.5 billion of that being this year. We're way ahead of schedule on achieving those cost synergies. And as you think about this transaction that we're -- that we've put together here, closing end-of-2017 time frame, we're going to be way down the path of the integration activities and achieving those cost synergies and so forth. The other element that was really critical in terms of achieving synergies from this was getting all of those content rights to distribute over our mobile platform. And so the DIRECTV Now, that required a lot of heavy lifting to go around all the content creators and get these new rights to distribute this content over-the-top to our mobile providers. Those are largely done. We're a little over 1 year into this, and all those content agreements are basically in place. That was a lot of heavy lifting. There's been an unbelievable amount of work and effort going into that. And now we're new into the -- we're really early into deploying these new platforms. And I would tell you, the more we get into the DIRECTV Now over-the-top platform, the more excited we get about the opportunity. And then as we think about the ability to bring Time Warner content into that, just the enthusiasm level just continues to go up and go up. So I would tell you, I think the timing of the Time Warner deal as it relates to the integration of DIRECTV is actually a very good fit. I think the timing is very good, bringing it in end of 2017. And we're going to be at a place where all of our installation crews for DIRECTV are integrated. We're doing 1 truck roll to the house. Our call center operations will be integrated at that point in time. So with all -- a lot of what I'd call the key logistical, difficult things to do in terms of integration, we'll have the lion's share of those done by end of 2017. We still have some what I'd call big IT-type things, information technology development, that won't be completed, but those aren't big rocks that are going to get in the way of trying to integrate Time Warner at this time. So then lastly, I would tell you, a deal like this, when Jeff and I met, and we both gained conviction in terms of what was in the art of possible here as we put these 2 companies together, we both became convinced and convicted that it was the deal that ought to happen. These kind of deals, you don't sit around and wait for the perfect timing. I mean, once you have a deal and you have a deal structure, given the potential for leaks and so forth, the objective is to push them through and get them done. And that's exactly what we did here. And so there's never a perfect time for a deal like this, but actually I think this fits very well with our own integration plans, and I also think it fits well in terms of how fast this industry is moving. The convergence in terms of media and distribution is moving fast. We want to be at the front of it. We don't want to be chasing it. And doing this deal now allows us to lead in this type of convergence activity and bring stuff to our customers that they want before other people bring it to their customers. So I think the timing actually works out quite well."

But when we looked at this, it's very clear that this qualifies, in every definition of the word, as a vertical merger. It's a vertical integration. And most of the deals, in fact all of the deals, that have gotten in trouble lately over the last few years have been horizontal mergers where a competitor has been taken out of the marketplace or the regulators were concerned that a competitor would be removed from the marketplace. This is vertical. Jeff's company is a supplier to AT&T, and it is a pure technical vertical integration. Vertical integrations, where regulators have concerns with those, are remedied or addressed. Those concerns are addressed through conditions. And so we anticipate that the regulators may have some issues that they want to deal with on this. There may be conditions, but we're convinced that these type of issues can be handled with conditions. And it's rare -- in fact, I'm not sure we know of a situation where a vertical integration has been blocked by the government in our 2 sectors. David, would you have anything to add to that?"

And so as a result, we are looking forward to the regulatory process, which is going to be guided by facts and guided by the law. And Randall is right. When you look in modern history of media and the Internet, the U.S. government has always approved vertical mergers like this, and they do so for good reason. They put downward pressure on consumer prices. They increase competition and consumer choice. And in our case, they spur the sort of innovation and investment that Randall and Jeff have talked about.

And we didn't think that would be as well accomplished for a number of reasons, financial structure, regulatory approval as part of a media company that we had at that time. The second thing, which I think is more important, is the world is much different now. You now have net neutrality in place. You've got broadband distribution. You have mobile as an ever-bigger part of the distribution package. And you have a lot of incoming new distributor or competition coming from Facebook, Netflix, Google, Amazon. And so as the distribution world changes, having distribution capabilities to innovate on mobile sets, on across broadband; and with the ability to speak directly to consumers, offer customized subscription packages and more effective targeted advertising, it's both more competition on both sides and it allows us to have our networks be more attractively offered to consumers. And what I mean by that is VOD with better interfaces. And I think that the distribution industry -- not AT&T and not Comcast. So far they've been good at this. But a lot of the distribution companies, particularly the cable companies, have been slow to provide these innovations for consumers. And we think this will help spur that across the industry."

When you're talking about doing really tight integrations of -- ownership is always best. If you have to iterate and innovate quickly, it's really difficult to do in a partnering, arm's-length negotiated-type transaction. I -- our history is long in terms of examples of this, not the least of which was we had been a -- what I'd call a tightly integrated reseller of DIRECTV for a long time. And it was an important part of our package, but you never could get the tight integration of the customer experience. We closed DIRECTV and we get the customer experience integrated, and then within 1 year, we've added 1.2 million DIRECTV customers. We've never even begun to approach a number like that when we were just partnering and reselling their product. And then as you think about, for example, the DIRECTV Now launch, we have been working 3 or 4 years to bring to market a mobile-centric package of content to our customers. And we have been working aggressively to put this together. And getting the content creators to agree to the rights to put this over our mobile platform was proving to be very, very difficult. We closed DIRECTV, and with those great content agreements that we now own at DIRECTV, within 1 year, we've achieved all of those content rights, literally within a year. Something we've been trying to do 3 years, we achieved in 1 year after owning DIRECTV. I am convinced that as we try to bring unique capabilities of content to our customers and really integrate -- I'm talking about integrating deeply, social aspects and interaction of our customers with content and so forth. As we try to do that, doing it in an ownership structure rather than a partnering structure will happen faster. And I'll say it again, that I believe, if we're successful at this, it will drive the whole industry to begin to innovate faster. And everybody will want to innovate on these platforms in this same way. So just a long history, Simon, of where you try to partner, you can get there. It's slow. It's painful. Just the contracting itself takes a lot of time, whereas when it's completely owned, you just move a lot faster."

And I will tell you we just continue to gain more and more conviction around Mexico. And we have a long way to keep growing this business.

We also have a -- we don't just have the U.S.-based networks like Cartoon, CNN, TBS, TNT, HBO that you all know. We also have a number of Latin American-based channels. That strengthens our offering. So I think the match between the two of us and being able to help upgrade distribution and lead a real continuing buoyancy, just a secular takeup in Latin American countries of television services. It's a bit like where the U.S. was 20 years ago.

And Jeff has an employment structure that is really comforting to me in terms of how he has his people compensated and so forth. And David, I know this will probably come as somewhat of a surprise to you, but I've never run a movie studio before. And so keeping the talents and retaining the talent is really, really important to us. And I would tell you I feel like we have some good plans in place to ensure that we can keep the talent in place. The way we will organize the business, David, is Time Warner will be a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T. And it will stand on its own and will continue to operate at very similar to how it's operated today. We'll have to figure out the management art of how we affect the data, beginning to influence content; and how we allow the data and the customer insights that we have on our mobile platform and our TV platform to influence advertising that's delivered into the Time Warner advertising avails and how we begin to take advantage of that. And so there's a lot of integration work that's done at that level, but Time Warner will be operated largely independent and as an independent subsidiary of AT&T. John, do you want to talk about the rating agencies?"

They're still concerned in the push and pulls of the situation. One is the amount of debt is large, and we're all aware of that, but the -- on the other side, the ability to generate $60 billion of EBITDA and $45 billion of -- so to speak, of annual cash from operations provides a great opportunity to service that debt. Third, I think the agencies are evaluating the change, if you will; the diversification opportunity that this provides; and that growth, the enhanced growth opportunity it provides. If you look at the transaction from a starting point on date of close, if you assume end of year, kind of in the 2.7x range of net debt-to-EBITDA and getting down to the -- closer to our traditional target of 1.8x after 4 years, that ability to lay that out gives us comfort that we certainly will remain investment grade and would argue very strongly to keep our current ratings with those agencies. I would expect they'll come out with some interim announcements that will -- as they work through the analysis. This is normal in this case. So that's really how we view it. From a rate perspective, I think the one thing I need to point out is over 90% or about 90% of our debt is locked into rates here with about a 14-year average life. We don't have much floating debt at this time. So first point I'd make to you is this transaction really doesn't have -- has very minimal effect on our current interest expense cost for the legacy AT&T. When you layer on the towers of debt of Time Warner, they fit very nicely on top of the towers of AT&T; and give a very manageable, very easily managed process for refinancing or paying down debt, so we feel very comfortable with that. Our assumptions were very conservative. We took a step-up from a 30-year bond rate that we'd see today. We took a step-up from that in our models in kind of our traditional, normal conservative approach. So we feel good about having the right level of interest expense for the incremental. And as I said, the base is locked up for a long period of time."

And first, I want to focus that these synergies are supply chain. They're vendor costs. They're corporate focused. We continue to expect the business units, specifically the 3 business units, to operate. And they're really -- these are not personnel focused. I just want to make sure that's clear. When you think about our synergies, on a combined basis we'll be a company that spends close to $6 billion a year on advertising. And as we've proven, as our leadership in our corporate communications group has proven over the last year, we can mine savings out of combining 2 companies' advertising and corporate communications because we've been very successful with that. We've learned that from DTV. If you look, quite frankly, at our telecom spend -- or at Time Warner's telecom spend, they're not an AT&T shop extensively today. We've got a real opportunity to provide really highest-quality services. And really from an investment base that we already have. That goes for both wireless and wireline, so that's a very direct one. If you think about the platforms, we've been moving very quickly and very effectively at building a platform for DTV Now to distribute video over all kinds of screens. With that, we now have that ability to share that platform and that distribution device with HBO, with the Turner networks, with the Warner studios. We have a real opportunity to do that. And that's going to provide efficiency savings. And then frankly, you get into the things like what I call shared services, but efficiencies of payroll, efficiencies of accounts payable, efficiencies of cash management, all those kinds of things. So we've done very detailed analysis of these cost-focused synergies. That's what gets us to the viewpoint that in the -- at the end of year 3, we'll be on a run rate for $1 billion of cost savings and cash flow generation. And we feel very good about that. And once again, it's really focused on really the supply chain and then, of course, the corporate structure, but we feel very good about achieving that."

And I'll sneak one more in, if I can, on John Stephens, just with respect to the handset adds. If it weren't for 2G losses this quarter, postpaid handsets would have been positive, I believe. As you step into 4Q, you'll see some more pressure, but looking into 2017, is there a return to handset growth at some point?"

I think it's a wise question. Let me focus on what I think is the most critical issue. The regulators will focus on what the market structure looks like today and then what the market structure looks like post transaction. This is a very important point. Point number one is the structure of this industry will not change. There's no loss of competition. There's no loss of competitors. From a horizontal standpoint, the structure remains very much similar as it was today, and that's exactly what Randall and Jeff have been talking about in terms of the verticalness of this transaction. Point number two, the distribution model doesn't change. Time Warner has built an incredibly successful business, distributing its content as widely as possible, and that won't change either. So that leads to the question of what will change, and that's what's so exciting about this transaction. When you bring together wireless and content for the first time, wireless and content for the first time, you create a unique company that can work within that industry structure to innovate in very important ways that benefit consumers. Number one, you're able to take that wide distribution of Time Warner content and you're able to broaden that distribution, especially in the mobile world. And number two, you've heard it discussed here today, you're able to, with that combined company, innovate new platforms, new video experiences, things that can't be done by arm's-length contract alone. You can't innovate through arm's-length contract arrangements. And so by doing so, what the regulators will be interested in, first and foremost, is talk about what happens immediately after the transaction and then talk about what happens thereafter. And so once regulators, we are convinced, understand the facts around what I've just described, they'll see a positive story when it comes to market structure and they'll see a positive story as it comes to innovations. And then ultimately, we get to the point that Randall talked about earlier, is that innovation spurs more innovation, and it generates demand for video applications over mobile networks that is 5G's best friend. And so when you put all that together, it's a very compelling case that we look forward to discussing with regulators. You asked about whether it'd be a DOJ-only process or whether the FCC would be involved. We know at this point, of course, the DOJ will be reviewing the transaction. At this point, we are determining which FCC licenses of Time Warner, if any, would transfer to the new company. And obviously, if there are licenses to be transferred, the FCC would review those."

And I can't help but reflect on",427,"Mike, as it relates just to the U.S. wireless market, I think it's important to constantly remember in this industry how we cycle through times where we say, wow, it really is mature, and it's just getting hypercompetitive. And I can't help but reflect on, I think it was 2005, shortly after we bought AT&T Wireless, and we launched the RAZR, the Motorola RAZR. And I will never forget how many people would ask me, ""What are you going to do after everybody has a RAZR? This industry is mature, right?"" And lo and behold, we invest in mobile broadband, and smartphones come along. And smartphones take off, and they become a catalyst for growth in this business for the last 10 years literally. And while all this has been going on with the smartphone, we have been accumulating rather aggressively, since 2012, a really big portfolio of wireless spectrum licenses. And we're sitting here today with 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum, fallow waiting to be built into and deployed for video because now, with these tablets and these smartphones everywhere, they're not just Internet-access devices. They are video-consuming devices. And so we have positioned ourselves to begin investing aggressively and ensuring that our customers can enjoy video and now video and content that is uniquely curated and developed for these kind of devices. And now we haven't even begun to talk about 5G. And as you think about 5G, video is a huge driver of it, but it goes so far beyond video. And as we think about where it goes in a world of 5G, 1-gig-type networks, now virtual reality can truly become reality. Augmented reality now begins to manifest itself. We're talking about autonomous cars. I mean I am convicted we are going to have autonomous cars traversing our major metropolitan areas in the next 5 years in a really significant way. Depending on who you talk to in the autonomous car business, the developers and the inventors, they believe that the bandwidth requirements of an autonomous car is 1 gigabyte per car per mile, just huge bandwidth requirements. IoT, Internet of Things. Health care. I just think we're at one of those moments where, yes, everybody has a smartphone. That smartphone is now becoming the launching point for what is next. And we think what is next is really significant. And we now have the largest connected-car portfolio in the United States. We have most major automobile manufacturers contracted with AT&T, and so we just think there's a lot of opportunity left, Mike."

First, on our branded phones, we had net adds this quarter. I want to make sure everybody knows that.

First, on our branded phones, we had net adds this quarter. I want to make sure everybody knows that. Secondly, the 2G migration and the decision to shut down that network on or about January 1 is impacting that, and we had pressure in the quarter, particularly to our postpaid phone base, because of that. And that will alleviate next year. That's correct. Third, we're seeing tremendous development for us in the prepaid space, so the Cricket brand, and adding significant customers there, a space that's still relatively new to us. We've been in there about 2 years now in a significant way. It's what's helping drive margins, as it has really improved the revenue growth, the profitability and the customer counts. And as we've talked about many times before, the cost of adding a prepaid subscriber is very, very low; no billing, no credit checks, no subsidies. And the ARPUs that we're getting out of those are very good. So all that's happening, and that's what adding to these great margins. That's what's building these great margins. The one thing I would point to you, though, that we're more excited about than just pure count is the fact that we added 700,000 smartphones during the quarter. So the devices that -- so that -- while the -- while our total net adds, our branded phone adds were certainly less than that 700,000, we are trading up to a much higher-quality customer who has much more functionality with his phone, particularly in light of this transaction; a much higher-quality capability to watch video and then utilize the content that Time Warner brings. We feel very good in that position. On a going-forward basis, after we get through the 2G, certainly we should see some of the 2G -- we will see the 2G pressures alleviate, but the focus for growth is what Randall really talked about in the sense of these platforms we've built, whether they be the connected cars; whether they be the Internet of Things; whether they be the various, different capabilities we provide business and consumers in this Internet of Things environment; as well as the prepaid market as we continue to take share and grow in that. So that's where we think there's real opportunities. Certainly, we'll continue to grow our smartphone base. I don't mean to imply we won't at all. I -- but it is a more mature market. It's the opportunity to, if you will, shift those feature phones to smartphones. And it's that opportunity to play into a prepaid space, a value customer space that hadn't been our focus for -- our lead focus for years and now has become a very strong focus for us; and then the Internet of Things, the connected devices, which provide a dramatic opportunity for us, both from a business and a consumer/customer point of view."

And good morning, everybody.
What we're going to do is Jeff and I are going to provide some color on the business combination, and then we'll spend our time addressing whatever questions you might have.
Look, we're convinced this combination, Time Warner and AT&T, is a perfect match for our 2 companies, vertically integrated. I mean we'll be able to bring a fresh approach to how the media and communication industry works for customers, for content creators, for distributors as well as advertisers. We'll be uniquely positioned to lead and even accelerate the next wave of innovation in terms of how people enjoy video entertainment. Time Warner is the global leader in media and entertainment, with terrific brands. And they're brands we all know and love, from Game of Thrones to CNN and Superman, just to name a few. It is a vast content library, and we believe it's the best on the planet. And hands down, Time Warner has the best creative talent and journalists in the industry.
When you combine Time Warner's content with our scale in distribution -- we have 100 million-plus mobile -- TV, mobile and broadband subscribers. You put that with our customer insights and the addressable advertising opportunities that flow from that, we think we build something here that's really special. And it creates significant strategic as well as financial benefits. With content distribution and customer insights, we'll be able to deliver new subscription as well as advertising models and new content formats that traditional programmers have been hesitant to adopt, particularly for content that's designed for mobile consumption and sharing on social media. Owning content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will help pay for the cost of content creation. And this 2-sided business model, advertising and subscription-based, helps pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers more choices in terms of how they get their content. And only AT&T will have the world's best premium content with the networks to deliver on every screen.
We expect to close this transaction by the end of 2017. And I've been asked a lot: Why now? It comes at a time when the media and communication industries are converging. And Jeff and I sat down back in August to talk about where we saw the industry headed and how a combination between our companies would really remove a lot of the friction in the industry; then help accelerate innovation in terms of content that's mobile, customized and social. The next wave of innovation in this business takes vertical integration of premium content and distribution, and I suspect the rest of the industry is going to innovate right with us. And by the time our Time Warner deal closes at the end of next year, we'll be nearly 2.5 years into integrating DIRECTV, and that work is going to be essentially behind us. Our Time Warner deal is more of a bolt-on acquisition. It's not a normal full-blown integration like you've seen in past deals.
The big part of the value of this transaction is Time Warner's outstanding leadership team and the amazing creative talent and journalists that they've put together. And that's why we plan to run Time Warner the same way that it's run today.
If you would, turn to Slide 6 in the deck, and let's talk about the capabilities this business is going to have. First, we'll be the leader in premium content. Time Warner has an amazing portfolio of content creation and aggregation and some iconic brands across programming and TV and film production. HBO is the #1 global leader in premium content subscriptions, producing hit shows like Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley and Veep for its HBO and Cinemax networks. Warner Bros. has the largest film studio in the world; hit franchises like Harry Potter, Superman and The Voice; and box office hits like American Sniper. And it has the best and biggest entertainment library on the planet. Turner has top-rated basic cable network: TNT, TBS and Cartoon Network, Adult Swim; and Turner's premium sports rights, including the NBA, March Madness, Major League Baseball. And that combined with our rights to the NFL SUNDAY TICKET is going to create a very strong sports programming portfolio. And Turner has great digital assets like Bleacher Report, cnn.com.
If you look at Slide 7. We'll have unmatched scale in distribution and customer relationships. 144 million mobile subscribers in the U.S. and Mexico, 45 million subscribers in the U.S. and throughout Latin America make us the world's largest pay-TV provider. We have about 16 million U.S. broadband subscribers. And we have a growing OTT business with HBO NOW and soon DIRECTV Now. And also, our joint venture with the Chernin Group, Otter Media, has 1.2 million subscribers on its various SVOD services. And we have more than 88,000 retail points of sale across North America.
And third, all that will give us some robust viewership insights, and we'll use those insights from our TV, mobile and broadband subscribers to inform what content we create. We'll develop content that's better tailored to what specific audience segments want to watch, when, where and on which device. And we'll use the insights to expand the market for addressable advertising. And addressable advertising is far more effective and more valuable, both to the advertisers and to our customer. Owning content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will allow us to grow 2-sided business models, help pay for the costs of content creation. And this 2-sided business model, advertising and subscription-based, helps to pay for creators to develop more great content and gives customers more choices on how they get their content.
As you move to Slide 8, I want to walk you through the highlights of the transaction. And then later, John Stephens is going to dive a little deeper into this.
So we're paying $107.50 per share. It's half stock and half cash, and the stock portion is subject to a collar. And we believe this is the optimal capital structure for a deal of this size. The financial benefits are straightforward, and we think they're significant. In the first year after closing, it's accretive to margins and adjusted EPS and free cash flow on a per-share basis. It improves our dividend coverage. It enhances and diversifies our revenue and earnings growth profile. And the structure of the deal allows us to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong investment-grade credit matrix (sic) [ metrics ]. 
The approval is fairly straightforward. Time Warner shareholders will vote on it. And then we'll have regulatory reviews in the U.S., the EU and a few other countries.
And so that's the structure of the deal. What I'd like to do now is hand it over to Jeff Bewkes, the Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, and let him take you through his thoughts."

Good morning, everyone.I'm really pleased with this transaction and with Time Warner's future as part of AT&T. Joining forces will accelerate the evolution of both our companies as we go where consumers are going in the converging world",383,"Thanks, Randall. Good morning, everyone.
I'm really pleased with this transaction and with Time Warner's future as part of AT&T. Joining forces will accelerate the evolution of both our companies as we go where consumers are going in the converging worlds of media and communications, and that will drive more growth and more value for shareholders. 
This combination creates both immediate and long-term value. For Time Warner shareholders, the price represents about a 36% premium to our closing price of $79.24 on October 19. And it also has a very attractive consideration mix of 50% cash and 50% AT&T stock for each Time Warner share. That gives our shareholder base roughly a 15% pro forma ownership in the world's leading integrated media and communications company with a strong financial profile, as Randall just said, and a combined track record of success and innovation in both companies. And we believe the pro forma company is very well positioned to drive attractive growth for years to come.
We expect innovation to be an important driver of that growth since we see AT&T's distribution capabilities as an enormous opportunity for us. As I said, we need to go where the consumers are going. And that's increasingly mobile, increasingly multi-platform. And it's increasingly on demand through new services via direct consumer relationships over broadband. And this aligns us with all of that. Additionally, there's the huge opportunity Randall mentioned to utilize consumer insights to inform content creation, and that allows us to continue to create not just the biggest hits, but also content and programming that really engages with targeted, passionate niches in the audience. We'll be able to do that more efficiently while also innovating very important new subscription and advertising models to increase consumer choice.
So we see the opportunity to create tremendous long-term value in this combination, and that's what's driving this transaction. As I said at the outset, AT&T's distribution capabilities significantly advance our direct-to-consumer reference and our ability to develop new offerings for all the leading content that we already create and distribute today. And together with AT&T, we'll develop new, innovative business models and forms of content that consumers will be demanding tomorrow in this ubiquitous multi-platform, on-demand and increasingly mobile environment.
So now I'll turn it over to John Stephens."

And good morning, everyone.
Let me provide the financial expectations that we have for this transaction and refer to Slide 10.
To recap: The purchase price values Time Warner equity at about $85 billion, plus approximately $21 billion of net debt from Time Warner. That brings the total transaction value to right at $106 billion. Time Warner shareholders will receive a 50-50 mix of cash and AT&T stock for their equity. The cash portion is already fully funded with a $40 billion bridge loan and additional AT&T liquidity. We remain strongly committed to maintaining a sound balance sheet and solid investment-grade credit metric. And we see significant opportunity for rapid deleveraging potential given the attractive free cash flow of the combined companies. In fact, we expect pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA to be in the 2.5x range by the end of the first year after the close of the transaction and approaching the 1.8x range by the end of year 4.
We see solid synergy potential in the $1 billion run rate by the end of year 3. As you would expect, this is substantially cost driven, corporate- and procurement-type expenses, the kind we know how to get, but we believe there are also significant opportunities from the vertical integration of content and distribution. And the vast amount of data available from the combined company will allow not only a greater value proposition to offer advertisers but will allow more informed and efficient content development.
This transaction also diversifies us and enhances our revenue mix. A strong cash flow and a lower capital intensity gives us flexibility as we grow these businesses. As mentioned earlier, we expect adjusted EPS to be accretive in the first year and free cash flow and free cash flow per share to be accretive within that same time frame. The deal also improves our strong free cash flow dividend coverage. And as you saw, we just announced our 33rd consecutive dividend increase. We're shooting 100%, raising the dividend with every chance we've had over the last 33 years. We are extremely proud of that track record.
Now I'd like to spend the last few minutes of this presentation giving you a high-level view of our very good third quarter results that we released on Saturday, starting with our financial summary on Slide 12.
Our teams continued to execute at a high level in the quarter. Third quarter consolidated revenues grew nearly 5% to $40.9 billion, in large part due to our acquisition of DIRECTV. On a comparable basis, revenues were down slightly, as growth in video and IP-based services mostly offset pressure from declines in wireless, legacy services and the second quarter 2016 transition of certain hosting operations. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, comparable revenues were essentially flat.
We grew net income in the quarter. After adjustments, third quarter EPS was $0.74, the same as last year's third quarter and up almost 4% year-to-date. This comes even with about $0.02 of earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations. Margins also continued to be solid, even with the pressure from our investment cycle in Mexico, thanks to the team's focus on profitability and our best-ever wireless service margins.
All this continues to drive strong cash flows. We had our second-highest-ever operating cash flows of $11 billion, with free cash flow reaching $5.2 billion. That's more than $13 billion in year-to-date free cash flow. Year-to-date, our dividend payout ratio is 67%, ahead of our full year guidance.
Capital investment is on plan, coming in at $5.9 billion for the quarter and just over $16 billion year-to-date. We also continue to focus on our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio, which came in at 2.24. 
Let's now take a look at our operations. Those details are on Slide 13. In a competitive wireless market, we continue to effectively manage our business. This has helped us add subscribers, lower postpaid churn and improve profitability. We turned in record wireless service EBITDA margins of 50.1%. This comes even as promotions heated up at the end of the quarter. We took a smart, strategic approach with our marketing moves. You see the impact in our postpaid churn. With all the noise in the marketplace, we had our second-best third quarter postpaid churn ever. Postpaid churn of 1.05% was an 11 basis point improvement over the year-ago third quarter, and this includes about 2 basis points of pressure from our 2G network migration. Postpaid phone churn was even lower at 0.90%. That's a 14 basis point improvement over a year ago. We turned in another strong quarter of subscriber growth. We had 1.5 million domestic net adds. And when you include our Mexico operations, we grew our North American subscriber base by 2.3 million.
The growth of our prepaid business continues to be exceptional. We added more than 300,000 prepaid phones in the quarter, and prepaid revenues were up more than 20% year-over-year. This drove branded phone growth and helped increase our branded smartphone base by another 700,000 subscribers.
Turning to our Entertainment Group. On a comparative basis, revenues grew as IP and video revenue outpaced legacy declines. Margins also continued to expand at a healthy clip. Our reported margins were up 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by merger synergies and a full quarter of DIRECTV in these -- in this year's results.
Overall, TV and broadband subscribers were relatively stable in the quarter. We added more than 300,000 DIRECTV subscribers and have added 1.2 million DIRECTV subscribers since we acquired DIRECTV in July of last year.
Our business solutions team also performed well in a challenging economy. Our flow share is good, and we continue to see the benefits of an integrated wireless and wireline approach. Thanks to wireless, we grew business revenues in the quarter. And we grew revenues in all our retail segments, enterprise, small business and the public sector. Strategic business services also grew at a solid clip, up $240 million year-over-year. That's up 9.1%. And when you adjust for FX, growth was closer to 10%.
Let me close with a summary of the quarter on Slide 14.
We're proud of what we've accomplished this quarter. Earnings continue to grow, and consolidated margins are stable, even with the pressure from our Mexico investment. Year-to-date adjusted EPS is up nearly 4%, and we had the second-highest cash from operations ever. We answered competitive headwinds in wireless with our best wireless service margins ever and our second-best-ever third quarter postpaid churn. We added 1.5 million U.S. subscribers, had positive phone net adds and grew our smartphone base by 700,000.
The integration of DIRECTV continues to generate the cost savings and sales opportunities we thought it would. We're on track to launch DIRECTV Now this quarter and are excited about what this brings. And Mexico continues to be a growth story. Just a tremendous job by our team, they're ahead of plan with their 4G LTE deployment, with their rebranding efforts and with customer growth.
Our guidance for the year remains on track: double-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth with stable margins. And free cash flow growth has been strong, with dividend coverage year-to-date at 67%.
As we enter the home stretch of the year, we feel very good about our results, and we look forward to finishing the year strong.
And with that, I believe we're ready for Q&A. And I'll turn it over to Roxanne."

So you hit the big driver that we're envisioning, and that's the DIRECTV Now product that we'll be launching next month. And I'll tell you, the more we iterate and work on DIRECTV and launch it in November, the more excited we get about what we're going to be putting in the marketplace but, I will tell you, the more excited we get about what else we'll be able to do on this platform. And there are a lot of things we really aspire to do with this platform as it -- as you think about incorporating social into the platform; and as you begin to think about how you share content on this platform, clipping content that you're watching and sharing it with your friends via messaging or being in social media. We think that -- we don't think -- we know our customers are really demanding that. Now what I would tell you is trying to develop those type of capabilities with the current content providers is proving difficult. It's arm's-length negotiation, and people are obviously very protective of their content. And so it's just really, really hard to get these type of iterations and innovations on content done. So the thing that Jeff and I get most excited about when we talk about this transaction is now, in these over-the-top environments and platforms, we can begin to innovate our content much quicker. We're under the same umbrella, same ownership structure. And we can get past a lot of these content rights and so forth and move fast. And I will tell you we are both convinced that as we innovate in this way and as we accelerate the pace of this innovation, it's going to attract others to want to do the same on these platforms. So those are kind of a snippet of some of the things we're thinking about. Jeff, would you add anything to add that?"

We've been trying at Time Warner to get more video on demand on not just our networks but have it become a universal thing for every American. You go to your set-top, your television and that whole dial of networks, hundreds of channels. They should all be VOD, just like HBO or Netflix is. And we announced that and we made it available to all our distributors for all the Time Warner networks at Turner and HBO more than 5 years ago. No payment extra. We -- if -- the condition was we'll give you full VOD on your television platforms, on your broadband platforms, provided that it goes to every consumer with no extra charge. Everybody's got to get the same offer. And we could just do it for our networks. We announced it first with Comcast years ago. What we saw, to Randall's point, is that the various cable and other kinds of distributors took a long time to create that offering across every other kind of network. And often, the reason was they were waiting for various negotiations of this cable company versus that network group, and you just didn't see a universal offering. It's what consumers were demanding. And so we think with this, with AT&T and DIRECTV, our largest affiliate distributor on television -- they're the largest and best at mobile delivery. And so when -- we want to bring more packages; more choice for consumers at different price points at every kind of level, upper, lower; more channels, fewer channels; more mobility; more innovation of the kinds of programming. And then with the advertising capabilities, we can make the advertising more interesting for your house versus somebody next door, the products you're interested, not the ones you don't need to see. And that means that more of the consumers get a better experience viewing. They get less interruptions. And it means that more of the cost of the programming, which is -- there's an investment boom in programming, but more of the cost can then be borne by advertisers and consumers get a break. So you -- the benefit for this -- for consumers is pretty good, very good. And the benefit for advertisers is terrific because, if you look at what's happening in that world, advertisers need more competition. And this will give another outlet, not just the Google and Facebook one that's gaining all of the -- has been gaining all the traction, but now you have yet another advertising choice that's equally efficient."

And by that same token, if we're iterating quickly into DIRECTV Now with the Time Warner content, then we begin to differentiate the DIRECTV Now platform as well. And hopefully, as Jeff articulated and expressed, as we begin to iterate and innovate the Time Warner content, I am actually convinced that, if we're successful with this, it will incentivize other content creators to do the same and want to innovate on top of this platform as well. So I think it gives us great diversification. 15% of our revenues after this deal is closed will be Time Warner and which is media and entertainment, but -- so the diversification is great, but I think it also gives us an opportunity to differentiate our platform."

In terms of where we stand on the DIRECTV integration, Amir, as you recall, the biggest benefit financially from the integration were the cost synergies. And we set an objective of getting $2.5 billion per year of costs out of the business, $1.5 billion of that being this year. We're way ahead of schedule on achieving those cost synergies. And as you think about this transaction that we're -- that we've put together here, closing end-of-2017 time frame, we're going to be way down the path of the integration activities and achieving those cost synergies and so forth. The other element that was really critical in terms of achieving synergies from this was getting all of those content rights to distribute over our mobile platform. And so the DIRECTV Now, that required a lot of heavy lifting to go around all the content creators and get these new rights to distribute this content over-the-top to our mobile providers. Those are largely done. We're a little over 1 year into this, and all those content agreements are basically in place. That was a lot of heavy lifting. There's been an unbelievable amount of work and effort going into that. And now we're new into the -- we're really early into deploying these new platforms. And I would tell you, the more we get into the DIRECTV Now over-the-top platform, the more excited we get about the opportunity. And then as we think about the ability to bring Time Warner content into that, just the enthusiasm level just continues to go up and go up. So I would tell you, I think the timing of the Time Warner deal as it relates to the integration of DIRECTV is actually a very good fit. I think the timing is very good, bringing it in end of 2017. And we're going to be at a place where all of our installation crews for DIRECTV are integrated. We're doing 1 truck roll to the house. Our call center operations will be integrated at that point in time. So with all -- a lot of what I'd call the key logistical, difficult things to do in terms of integration, we'll have the lion's share of those done by end of 2017. We still have some what I'd call big IT-type things, information technology development, that won't be completed, but those aren't big rocks that are going to get in the way of trying to integrate Time Warner at this time. So then lastly, I would tell you, a deal like this, when Jeff and I met, and we both gained conviction in terms of what was in the art of possible here as we put these 2 companies together, we both became convinced and convicted that it was the deal that ought to happen. These kind of deals, you don't sit around and wait for the perfect timing. I mean, once you have a deal and you have a deal structure, given the potential for leaks and so forth, the objective is to push them through and get them done. And that's exactly what we did here. And so there's never a perfect time for a deal like this, but actually I think this fits very well with our own integration plans, and I also think it fits well in terms of how fast this industry is moving. The convergence in terms of media and distribution is moving fast. We want to be at the front of it. We don't want to be chasing it. And doing this deal now allows us to lead in this type of convergence activity and bring stuff to our customers that they want before other people bring it to their customers. So I think the timing actually works out quite well."

But when we looked at this, it's very clear that this qualifies, in every definition of the word, as a vertical merger. It's a vertical integration. And most of the deals, in fact all of the deals, that have gotten in trouble lately over the last few years have been horizontal mergers where a competitor has been taken out of the marketplace or the regulators were concerned that a competitor would be removed from the marketplace. This is vertical. Jeff's company is a supplier to AT&T, and it is a pure technical vertical integration. Vertical integrations, where regulators have concerns with those, are remedied or addressed. Those concerns are addressed through conditions. And so we anticipate that the regulators may have some issues that they want to deal with on this. There may be conditions, but we're convinced that these type of issues can be handled with conditions. And it's rare -- in fact, I'm not sure we know of a situation where a vertical integration has been blocked by the government in our 2 sectors. David, would you have anything to add to that?"

When you look in modern history of media and the Internet, the U.S. government has always approved vertical mergers like this, and they do so for good reason. They put downward pressure on consumer prices. They increase competition and consumer choice. And in our case, they spur the sort of innovation and investment that Randall and Jeff have talked about.

And we didn't think that would be as well accomplished for a number of reasons, financial structure, regulatory approval as part of a media company that we had at that time. The second thing, which I think is more important, is the world is much different now. You now have net neutrality in place. You've got broadband distribution. You have mobile as an ever-bigger part of the distribution package. And you have a lot of incoming new distributor or competition coming from Facebook, Netflix, Google, Amazon. And so as the distribution world changes, having distribution capabilities to innovate on mobile sets, on across broadband; and with the ability to speak directly to consumers, offer customized subscription packages and more effective targeted advertising, it's both more competition on both sides and it allows us to have our networks be more attractively offered to consumers. And what I mean by that is VOD with better interfaces. And I think that the distribution industry -- not AT&T and not Comcast. So far they've been good at this. But a lot of the distribution companies, particularly the cable companies, have been slow to provide these innovations for consumers. And we think this will help spur that across the industry."

When you're talking about doing really tight integrations of -- ownership is always best. If you have to iterate and innovate quickly, it's really difficult to do in a partnering, arm's-length negotiated-type transaction. I -- our history is long in terms of examples of this, not the least of which was we had been a -- what I'd call a tightly integrated reseller of DIRECTV for a long time. And it was an important part of our package, but you never could get the tight integration of the customer experience. We closed DIRECTV and we get the customer experience integrated, and then within 1 year, we've added 1.2 million DIRECTV customers. We've never even begun to approach a number like that when we were just partnering and reselling their product. And then as you think about, for example, the DIRECTV Now launch, we have been working 3 or 4 years to bring to market a mobile-centric package of content to our customers. And we have been working aggressively to put this together. And getting the content creators to agree to the rights to put this over our mobile platform was proving to be very, very difficult. We closed DIRECTV, and with those great content agreements that we now own at DIRECTV, within 1 year, we've achieved all of those content rights, literally within a year. Something we've been trying to do 3 years, we achieved in 1 year after owning DIRECTV. I am convinced that as we try to bring unique capabilities of content to our customers and really integrate -- I'm talking about integrating deeply, social aspects and interaction of our customers with content and so forth. As we try to do that, doing it in an ownership structure rather than a partnering structure will happen faster. And I'll say it again, that I believe, if we're successful at this, it will drive the whole industry to begin to innovate faster. And everybody will want to innovate on these platforms in this same way. So just a long history, Simon, of where you try to partner, you can get there. It's slow. It's painful. Just the contracting itself takes a lot of time, whereas when it's completely owned, you just move a lot faster."

The -- our biggest overseas network business and sales business is in Latin America, from Mexico all the way to Argentina. That's where we have -- we're the #1 nonlocal channel provider across all of Latin America. We've got it on satellite with you at DIRECTV. We've got it in pretty much most of the cable and telcos. There's not yet as much broadband or mobile as there will be, but there's a real growth in that market. We also have a -- we don't just have the U.S.-based networks like Cartoon, CNN, TBS, TNT, HBO that you all know. We also have a number of Latin American-based channels. That strengthens our offering. So I think the match between the two of us and being able to help upgrade distribution and lead a real continuing buoyancy, just a secular takeup in Latin American countries of television services. It's a bit like where the U.S. was 20 years ago. And it varies from country to country, but potentially all that growth of the golden era of more channels and more TV is coming now across Latin America."

And Jeff has an employment structure that is really comforting to me in terms of how he has his people compensated and so forth. And David, I know this will probably come as somewhat of a surprise to you, but I've never run a movie studio before. And so keeping the talents and retaining the talent is really, really important to us. And I would tell you I feel like we have some good plans in place to ensure that we can keep the talent in place. The way we will organize the business, David, is Time Warner will be a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T. And it will stand on its own and will continue to operate at very similar to how it's operated today. We'll have to figure out the management art of how we affect the data, beginning to influence content; and how we allow the data and the customer insights that we have on our mobile platform and our TV platform to influence advertising that's delivered into the Time Warner advertising avails and how we begin to take advantage of that. And so there's a lot of integration work that's done at that level, but Time Warner will be operated largely independent and as an independent subsidiary of AT&T. John, do you want to talk about the rating agencies?"

They're still concerned in the push and pulls of the situation. One is the amount of debt is large, and we're all aware of that, but the -- on the other side, the ability to generate $60 billion of EBITDA and $45 billion of -- so to speak, of annual cash from operations provides a great opportunity to service that debt. Third, I think the agencies are evaluating the change, if you will; the diversification opportunity that this provides; and that growth, the enhanced growth opportunity it provides. If you look at the transaction from a starting point on date of close, if you assume end of year, kind of in the 2.7x range of net debt-to-EBITDA and getting down to the -- closer to our traditional target of 1.8x after 4 years, that ability to lay that out gives us comfort that we certainly will remain investment grade and would argue very strongly to keep our current ratings with those agencies. I would expect they'll come out with some interim announcements that will -- as they work through the analysis. This is normal in this case. So that's really how we view it. From a rate perspective, I think the one thing I need to point out is over 90% or about 90% of our debt is locked into rates here with about a 14-year average life. We don't have much floating debt at this time. So first point I'd make to you is this transaction really doesn't have -- has very minimal effect on our current interest expense cost for the legacy AT&T. When you layer on the towers of debt of Time Warner, they fit very nicely on top of the towers of AT&T; and give a very manageable, very easily managed process for refinancing or paying down debt, so we feel very comfortable with that. Our assumptions were very conservative. We took a step-up from a 30-year bond rate that we'd see today. We took a step-up from that in our models in kind of our traditional, normal conservative approach. So we feel good about having the right level of interest expense for the incremental. And as I said, the base is locked up for a long period of time."

We continue to expect the business units, specifically the 3 business units, to operate. And they're really -- these are not personnel focused. I just want to make sure that's clear. When you think about our synergies, on a combined basis we'll be a company that spends close to $6 billion a year on advertising. And as we've proven, as our leadership in our corporate communications group has proven over the last year, we can mine savings out of combining 2 companies' advertising and corporate communications because we've been very successful with that. We've learned that from DTV. If you look, quite frankly, at our telecom spend -- or at Time Warner's telecom spend, they're not an AT&T shop extensively today. We've got a real opportunity to provide really highest-quality services. And really from an investment base that we already have. That goes for both wireless and wireline, so that's a very direct one. If you think about the platforms, we've been moving very quickly and very effectively at building a platform for DTV Now to distribute video over all kinds of screens. With that, we now have that ability to share that platform and that distribution device with HBO, with the Turner networks, with the Warner studios. We have a real opportunity to do that. And that's going to provide efficiency savings. And then frankly, you get into the things like what I call shared services, but efficiencies of payroll, efficiencies of accounts payable, efficiencies of cash management, all those kinds of things. So we've done very detailed analysis of these cost-focused synergies. That's what gets us to the viewpoint that in the -- at the end of year 3, we'll be on a run rate for $1 billion of cost savings and cash flow generation. And we feel very good about that. And once again, it's really focused on really the supply chain and then, of course, the corporate structure, but we feel very good about achieving that."

Point number one is the structure of this industry will not change. There's no loss of competition. There's no loss of competitors. From a horizontal standpoint, the structure remains very much similar as it was today, and that's exactly what Randall and Jeff have been talking about in terms of the verticalness of this transaction. Point number two, the distribution model doesn't change. Time Warner has built an incredibly successful business, distributing its content as widely as possible, and that won't change either. So that leads to the question of what will change, and that's what's so exciting about this transaction. When you bring together wireless and content for the first time, wireless and content for the first time, you create a unique company that can work within that industry structure to innovate in very important ways that benefit consumers. Number one, you're able to take that wide distribution of Time Warner content and you're able to broaden that distribution, especially in the mobile world. And number two, you've heard it discussed here today, you're able to, with that combined company, innovate new platforms, new video experiences, things that can't be done by arm's-length contract alone. You can't innovate through arm's-length contract arrangements. And so by doing so, what the regulators will be interested in, first and foremost, is talk about what happens immediately after the transaction and then talk about what happens thereafter. And so once regulators, we are convinced, understand the facts around what I've just described, they'll see a positive story when it comes to market structure and they'll see a positive story as it comes to innovations. And then ultimately, we get to the point that Randall talked about earlier, is that innovation spurs more innovation, and it generates demand for video applications over mobile networks that is 5G's best friend. And so when you put all that together, it's a very compelling case that we look forward to discussing with regulators. You asked about whether it'd be a DOJ-only process or whether the FCC would be involved. We know at this point, of course, the DOJ will be reviewing the transaction. At this point, we are determining which FCC licenses of Time Warner, if any, would transfer to the new company. And obviously, if there are licenses to be transferred, the FCC would review those."

And I can't help but reflect on",427,"Mike, as it relates just to the U.S. wireless market, I think it's important to constantly remember in this industry how we cycle through times where we say, wow, it really is mature, and it's just getting hypercompetitive. And I can't help but reflect on, I think it was 2005, shortly after we bought AT&T Wireless, and we launched the RAZR, the Motorola RAZR. And I will never forget how many people would ask me, ""What are you going to do after everybody has a RAZR? This industry is mature, right?"" And lo and behold, we invest in mobile broadband, and smartphones come along. And smartphones take off, and they become a catalyst for growth in this business for the last 10 years literally. And while all this has been going on with the smartphone, we have been accumulating rather aggressively, since 2012, a really big portfolio of wireless spectrum licenses. And we're sitting here today with 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum, fallow waiting to be built into and deployed for video because now, with these tablets and these smartphones everywhere, they're not just Internet-access devices. They are video-consuming devices. And so we have positioned ourselves to begin investing aggressively and ensuring that our customers can enjoy video and now video and content that is uniquely curated and developed for these kind of devices. And now we haven't even begun to talk about 5G. And as you think about 5G, video is a huge driver of it, but it goes so far beyond video. And as we think about where it goes in a world of 5G, 1-gig-type networks, now virtual reality can truly become reality. Augmented reality now begins to manifest itself. We're talking about autonomous cars. I mean I am convicted we are going to have autonomous cars traversing our major metropolitan areas in the next 5 years in a really significant way. Depending on who you talk to in the autonomous car business, the developers and the inventors, they believe that the bandwidth requirements of an autonomous car is 1 gigabyte per car per mile, just huge bandwidth requirements. IoT, Internet of Things. Health care. I just think we're at one of those moments where, yes, everybody has a smartphone. That smartphone is now becoming the launching point for what is next. And we think what is next is really significant. And we now have the largest connected-car portfolio in the United States. We have most major automobile manufacturers contracted with AT&T, and so we just think there's a lot of opportunity left, Mike."

First, on our branded phones, we had net adds this quarter. I want to make sure everybody knows that. Secondly, the 2G migration and the decision to shut down that network on or about January",492,"Mike, with regard to your last question, let me make one point. First, on our branded phones, we had net adds this quarter. I want to make sure everybody knows that. Secondly, the 2G migration and the decision to shut down that network on or about January 1 is impacting that, and we had pressure in the quarter, particularly to our postpaid phone base, because of that. And that will alleviate next year. That's correct. Third, we're seeing tremendous development for us in the prepaid space, so the Cricket brand, and adding significant customers there, a space that's still relatively new to us. We've been in there about 2 years now in a significant way. It's what's helping drive margins, as it has really improved the revenue growth, the profitability and the customer counts. And as we've talked about many times before, the cost of adding a prepaid subscriber is very, very low; no billing, no credit checks, no subsidies. And the ARPUs that we're getting out of those are very good. So all that's happening, and that's what adding to these great margins. That's what's building these great margins. The one thing I would point to you, though, that we're more excited about than just pure count is the fact that we added 700,000 smartphones during the quarter. So the devices that -- so that -- while the -- while our total net adds, our branded phone adds were certainly less than that 700,000, we are trading up to a much higher-quality customer who has much more functionality with his phone, particularly in light of this transaction; a much higher-quality capability to watch video and then utilize the content that Time Warner brings. We feel very good in that position. On a going-forward basis, after we get through the 2G, certainly we should see some of the 2G -- we will see the 2G pressures alleviate, but the focus for growth is what Randall really talked about in the sense of these platforms we've built, whether they be the connected cars; whether they be the Internet of Things; whether they be the various, different capabilities we provide business and consumers in this Internet of Things environment; as well as the prepaid market as we continue to take share and grow in that. So that's where we think there's real opportunities. Certainly, we'll continue to grow our smartphone base. I don't mean to imply we won't at all. I -- but it is a more mature market. It's the opportunity to, if you will, shift those feature phones to smartphones. And it's that opportunity to play into a prepaid space, a value customer space that hadn't been our focus for -- our lead focus for years and now has become a very strong focus for us; and then the Internet of Things, the connected devices, which provide a dramatic opportunity for us, both from a business and a consumer/customer point of view."

And I -- just I want to reiterate I think, Jeff and I, we'd both have to say we couldn't be more excited about what we're putting together here. We think this is really, really going to be a unique opportunity. We believe that premium content always wins. And we've said this, that it always won in the theater. It now wins in the home, and it is now winning in the mobile device. People want to consume premium content. And we have now partnered and are working to combine forces with, we believe, the top premium content developer, aggregator and distributor in the world. And so we're really looking forward to putting these 2 companies together, defining the future of media and communications as they converge. We want to set the pace for this to happen.
And so thanks, everybody, for joining us. And appreciate your participation."
