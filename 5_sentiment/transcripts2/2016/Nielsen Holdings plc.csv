On a constant currency basis, we posted another year of mid-single digit revenue growth, margin expansion and record free cash flow, despite the v",2034,"Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us on the call. 2015 was a banner year for Nielsen. On a constant currency basis, we posted another year of mid-single digit revenue growth, margin expansion and record free cash flow, despite the volatile economic backdrop. Steady, consistent and resilient, that's who we are. 
In 2015, our top priority and biggest accomplishment was total Audience Measurement, our comprehensive system that provides comparable measurement across all screens and platforms. Today, total audience is here, between the market and is gaining traction with our clients, and I'm extremely proud of our team's execution. 
Looking at the business more broadly. Leveraging our measurement and analytics to help our clients make the important connections that drive their business is what we've done for nearly 93 years. And in a world of growing complexity and speed, our platform-based system oriented approach is nicely aligned with where our clients are going. It helped drive a number of wins across our Watch and Buy segments in 2015. Let's take a quick look at our financial performance for the full year.
First, we had strong revenue growth. On a constant currency basis, 2015 revenues grew 5%, 0.5 point better than our core revenue growth in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7.2% constant currency, reflecting the scalability of our business model and ongoing productivity improvements. Adjusted net income per share grew 12.4% constant currency to $2.53. Free cash flow was a record $804 million, up 18% over the prior year. Our strong free cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in our growth initiatives, while also returning cash to our shareholders. Through our dividends and share repurchase, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders in 2015. 
In December, we announced an additional share buyback authorization of $500 million, bringing us to a total of approximately $850 million at year-end. Driving shareholder value through capital allocation remains a key priority for us. 
Acquisitions are also an integral part of our balanced capital allocation strategy and the stand out acquisition for us in 2015 was eXelate, which added to our ability to help buyers and the sellers of advertising act with more precision and speed. Importantly, we leveraged this acquisition, creating enterprise marketing platform or EMP. This system connects Nielsen data with a wide range of other data sources to help advertisers move from targeting segments of consumers to addressing individual consumers. It's a powerful capability. Lastly, we're reiterating our guidance for 2016. 
Next let's take a look at the fourth quarter highlights. First, Watch. Fourth quarter Watch revenues increased just over 5%. In addition to the growth from our traditional client base, we're also seeing faster growth with our Digital clients, including the big players like Google and Facebook. By the way, we announced last month that we'll be adding Facebook conversations to our existing Twitter feed to fuel our Nielsen Social Content Ratings for TV programs, previously known as Nielsen Twitter TV ratings. We also plan to Instagram data in the near future. 
Our Total Audience Measurement framework was a key driver of our performance in the quarter. On our last call, we talked about the 4 phases we see as the industry moves towards adoption of a new currency: Execute, evaluate, adopt and transact.
First, execute. We've done this. The system is built, and it's available in the market. We brought more than 2 dozen deliverables to the marketplace in 2015 alone. 
Next, evaluate and adopt, these are iterated steps and this is by design. Our clients need time to assess how the new metrics will impact their business and they need flexibility as they explore different ways to monetize their content and we built that flexibility right into the system. 
Let's look at some of the key components. First, Digital Ad Ratings. Digital Ad ratings is now in 17 countries, covering 85% of the global digital ad spend. Revenue doubled in 2015. In January, we successfully completed our beta period on Google's DoubleClick platform, so we're now fully live with DoubleClick in 8 countries. And ours is the only independent digital advertising metric available on the DoubleClick platform outside the U.S. We also continue to gain share with major advertisers, and the most recent is Mandalays [ph] who has chosen Nielsen as its digital advertising measurement provider. 
Moving on to VOD. In 2015, we launched several new measurement solutions, enabling us to cover a variety of video-on-demand viewing situations. If it's VOD or DVR viewing from your cable, satellite or telco provider, no matter whether it's seen within 3 days, 7 days or up to 35 days of the original area, we measure it. If it's VOD from one of the popular subscription-based or as-supported VOD providers, we measure that too. We're doing exactly that now for a wide range of networks and studios. We now cover over 6,000 different program episodes, most of which are viewed through Netflix. All together, our clients are using various metrics to drive about content licensing and advertising monetization decisions.
Next, Digital Content Ratings. Our progress with Digital continued in Q4 and into this year. Diverse group of networks, MVPDs and publishers are already fully operational with another dozen or so currently in process. Notably, a major digital video platform will begin receiving data from us next week. 
As we've said before, our approach to measuring each of the parts, in this case, VOD, digital video and linear TV, is to ensure the measurement of each is comparable, so they can put together to form total content ratings. The ability to provide this comprehensive view of the consumer is unique to Nielsen. It's what enables us to provide our clients with a de-duplicated view of their total audience, putting television and digital video on an even playing field, which is crucial to how clients think about their business going forward. We now have over 70 individual networks signed up for total content ratings and as more clients enable measurement of their digital and VOD content, that number will continue to grow. 
We've also invested in our measurement of linear television viewing. In 2015, we effectively doubled the size of our gold standard U.S. panel. The work is complete and ratings are live in the market. And the larger panel provides greater ratings stability important, especially for the smaller networks that also adds more analytical power to our Total Audience Measurement system. In fact, all of these initiatives contribute to the growing adoption of Nielsen's Total Audience Measurement system, which leads us to the fourth phase, transact.
As we mentioned at our December Analyst Day, we've had successful meetings with a full range of key industry leaders regarding the need to move the currency definition beyond the current C3 and C7. Additional meetings will occur over the next few weeks. Our clients are highly engaged and there's broad-based commitment to redefine the currency to one that's more reflective of how today's consumers watch content. We're confident that no matter how the currency is redefined, our Total Audience Measurement system will support it. In the meantime, we know it's already helped shape how our clients are approaching and thinking about the 2016 upfronts. 
Before I leave the Watch and turn to Buy, I want to touch on Marketing Effectiveness business. We had another strong quarter with revenue up more than 30% as we continue to help both buyers and sellers of media drive better marketing ROI. We strengthened our positioned in this area during the fourth quarter by increasing our stake into Nielsen Catalina Solutions, a business that's perfectly aligned with our strategy. 
Turning to Buy. As we close 2015, our Buy business continued to strengthen and expand. Revenues grew nearly 6% in the quarter, led by emerging markets as well as solid growth in key developed markets, including the U.S. and Europe. We continue to win new clients in the relatively faster-growing mid-tier and small client segments. Just last week, Dole Foods, named Nielsen as their preferred provider of consumer information and analytics. 
We also continue to strengthen our positions with retailers around the world. Retailers are long-term data partners for Nielsen, but they also have a growing need for our analytics to help with their advertising, marketing and merchandising decisions, both online and offline. Our business with retailers saw strong growth in 2015, boosted in part by 40 new e-commerce clients worldwide. 
Emerging markets grew 8.4% in Q4, despite more challenging economic conditions in many key markets. You've heard us say before that when our teams execute well, they're able to find growth even when GDP growth slows because we're still gaining penetration in many emerging markets and our results illustrate this. For example, in 3 key markets, Brazil, Russia and Turkey, our business grew double digits, well above the GDP growth in those markets. 
The secret here really isn't any secret. Comes down to good old-fashioned execute and by our teams, taking our proven product portfolio to new clients, while helping our existing clients manage through the changing market conditions. Our team did a great job. 
Developed markets also exited the year with good momentum. Revenues increased 4.8% in Q4. And notably, this was helped by Europe where we're starting to see growth at the region level, low single digits, but growth, and we're happy to have it. 
And parallel with total audience on the Watch inside, our Buy business is building its own version called total consumer measurements. The idea is to measure all consumer purchases as buying behavior continues to fragment across channels and segments. As millennials carve a path for a new way to buy, for instance, e-commerce, mobile devices and subscription models, we, too, are carving out new ways to measure the full range of consumer purchasing, following the proven formula that combines our high-quality panels with big data to provide the quality, granularity and efficiency that our clients require. 
Measurement is the core of our business and our objective is full coverage. Total audience and Watch, total consumer and Buy. We don't measure just one screen or one channel of distribution. Our objective is to measure all of them and we do that by focusing on and following the consumer. 
Before I close, let me revisit the 3 major trends and the related key investments that will drive our growth in 2016 and beyond. The first is the well-known trend that audiences are fragmenting across screens and platforms, and for us, that means our measurement needs to cover all viewing environments providing comparable metrics for each. 
Our Total Audience Measurement system does exactly that and its adoption continues to grow among our clients. 
The second is that consumers are reacting to ads and brands differently and they're buying in new ways and across new channels. Advertisers want to harness the power of big data to enable them to market to those change in consumers with greater precision and with proven ROI on their marketing spend. This is what our enterprise marketing platform enables. 
The third trend is that our clients information and analytics needs are growing and changing. Clients what data and systems to help them to act and they want more efficiency, speed and precision. This is the basis for our investment in eXelate in the enterprise marketing platform that I just talked about, but it's also the basis for our investment in our Buy platform, the connected Buy system that you heard us talk about at our Analyst Day in December. Clients want to know what consumers are buying, why they're buying it and what action they should take next. 
In all 3 key areas, our platform-oriented, system-based approach provides scalability, flexibility and speed, especially when our systems connect directly to our client systems. And because we own the essential core data, no one is better positioned to do it than Nielsen. 
To sum up, we feel great about our progress and confident about the year ahead. While we certainly don't wish for difficult economic conditions, we're ready for them. In fact, we know from experience that when economic conditions grow more challenging, our business model advantages and strengths show through more clearly. 
Over to you, Jamere."

It was a great year for Nielsen, and I'm especially proud of the contributions of my colleagues around the world. Our teams have had a laser focus on execution and efforts are reflected in our fourth quarter and 2015 results. Our results are also indicative of the consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model and our ability to deliver solid results through the cycles. 
First, let me give a few more details on our 2015 performance. Revenue was just under $6.2 billion, up 5% constant currency, which is slightly above the high end of the revenue range we gave. We have delivered 38 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth behind solid execution on our growth initiatives. 
Our Watch business grew 4.9% on a constant currency basis and we entered 2016 with great momentum behind our total audience Execution. 
Our Buy business grew 5% as an investments in the emerging markets and new client wins continue to deliver solid growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA was just under $1.9 billion, up 7.2% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.1%, up 61 basis points on a constant currency basis as we executed on our productivity initiatives and delivered margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments. 
Adjusted net income was $975 million, up 8.5% constant currency and diluted adjusted net income per share was $2.63, up 12.4% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
We generated record free cash flow, $804 million, up 18.1% versus the year-ago. Our free cash flow conversion of adjusted net income was 82%, up 12 points versus the year-ago, driven by EBITDA growth and working capital management. And as I look ahead, I continue to see opportunities for working capital efficiencies within our business that will continue to drive our free cash flow growth. 
And finally, we delivered a record $1.1 billion back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks in 2015, demonstrating our continued commitment to drive incremental shareholder value through capital allocation. Again, a great year and solid execution of our teams around the world. 
Let me move to the fourth quarter. Revenue was $1.6 billion, up 5.6% constant currency. We had a strong finish to the year with solid revenue growth in both Watch and Buy. Adjusted EBITDA was $531 million, up 7.1% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 32.7%, up 45 basis points on a constant currency basis, as we delivered margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments for the sixth consecutive quarter. 
Adjusted net income was $300 million, up 3.1% constant currency and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.82, up 7.9% versus the prior year on a constant currency basis. 
Finally, we generated $306 million in free cash flow, up an impressive 16.3% versus a year ago. However, our cash flow performance was significantly impacted in the quarter by the severe flooding in one of our major collection centers in Chennai, India, as well as currency impact from the stronger dollar. Despite this, we finished with our second-highest quarterly free cash flow performance ever. As Mitch said, we finished the year on a strong note and we have tremendous momentum heading into 2016.
Next, I'll move to the segments. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter, revenue was $745 million, up 5.2% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement ex-audio, which we know referred to as Audience Measurement of video and text was up 7.6%.
As we talked about last quarter, audio was down 6.9% as the timing of some deliveries were realized in the third quarter, which did not repeat in the fourth quarter. And for those of you who followed us since we acquired Arbitron, you will recall that our deliveries do not always sync up with the quarterly calendar causing our yield results to appear lumpy. But in 2015, the highly profitable Audio business delivered low single-digit revenue growth, outstanding margins and strong free cash flow. Marketing Effectiveness was up 31.3% behind strong quarters in the eXelate product offerings and the performance of the Nielsen Catalina Solutions, or NCS joint venture, which we increased our ownership stake in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned at the Analyst Day. I would also point out that you will see in our filings in GAAP net income loss that we realized $158 million nonoperating gain on the step-up in our base [indiscernible] as a result of our now majority stake in the joint venture. Our majority ownership stake contributed about 1 point to our Watch revenue growth in fourth quarter.
In 2015, Marketing Effectiveness was up 21% as we transformed the portfolio, while making investments in eXelate and NCS while we can go markets growing demand for solutions that help publishers and advertisers better identify, acquire and retain audiences across all screens, devices and formats.
As expected, and as we highlighted in our last quarterly call, we had nearly a 2 points drag on revenue from the partisan our other Watch bucket, we divested in our business late in the fourth quarter and you should also note in our filings in GAAP income loss that we realized an $18 million nonoperating gain on the transaction.
Our growth initiatives are delivering. Digital Ad Ratings continued its momentum, reflecting strong demand from advertisers, agencies and media owners. Digital Ad Ratings is an important offering in our Total Audience Measurement framework. And in 2015, our revenue nearly doubled as we added new clients and existing clients increased the number of campaigns versus a year-ago. Our subscription Video On Demand and Digital Content Ratings products continued to gain traction with our clients, giving us tremendous confidence and momentum heading into 2016.
Watch adjusted EBITDA was $340 million -- $343 million, up 6.9% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded a strong 7 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage in the business. Our Watch segment remains strong. We have executed a Total Audience Measurement, invested to transform the portfolio, our new products and initiatives are gaining momentum. 
Turning to Buy, our business had a strong fourth quarter and a solid year in 2015. Fourth quarter total Buy revenue was $879 million, up 5.9% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $607 million, up 4.8% on a constant currency basis behind relative strength in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, we saw some onetime discretionary spend pickup that led to a really strong quarter and finish to the year. 
Our business in the emerging markets was $272 million, up 8.4% on a constant currency basis. Our teams are executing against the tough backdrop of challenging macroeconomic conditions. We saw broad-based growth in the emerging markets, with double-digit growth in Latin America, the Middle East and Greater China, along with high single digits in Africa. Emerging market revenue grew 8.5% in 2015 and I'm very pleased with our team's execution in these markets.
Buy EBITDA, was $195 million, up 7.1% constant currency. Our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins were up 25 basis points in the quarter. This is the sixth straight quarter of Buy margin expansion as we have worked to improve profitability, while we continue to invest in our products and expand coverage in the emerging markets. Overall, we had a great quarter in Buy, with solid revenue growth and margin expansion on a constant currency basis.
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. 
In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 620 basis point drag on revenue and a 500 basis point -- 580 basis points drag on EBITDA, which represented $0.02 of share earnings headwind versus our third quarter earnings call. For 2015, foreign currency impacted our adjusted net income per share results by $0.21. 
At yesterday's spot rates held constant in 2016, and we expect a 210 basis points drag on revenue and 140 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which represents an incremental $0.02 a share drag on adjusted net income per share guidance that we gave in December. 
Moving to 2016 guidance. We are maintaining our 2016 earnings per share guidance despite an additional $0.02 headwind from FX. We remain confident in our plan to execute and deliver on all the operational elements that we laid out in December. 
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our execution in the fourth quarter and 2015. We have a lot of confidence and momentum in both of our segments as we head into 2016. And in addition, we are committed to an efficient and balanced capital structure that will enable us to grow our business and return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Kate."

One of the areas that has been long been a strength -- a strong growth for us in this areas is our work with the ad tech world, the ad exchanges, the add platforms where our Digital Ad Ratings metric, in particularly, has played very well. But also as we bring eXelate into the picture, it just raises our game in that area and so that's contributed. Jamere?"

And then I think your last question was on -- just to finish up your last question was on the total opportunity as it relates to Digital.

But in particular, an important opportunity for us in developed markets where retailer environment is a a little more consolidated and so their profile in the market is raised. And what we find is that, while retailers have long been data partners for Nielsen and also been long clients of our capabilities, both measurement and analytics, their need for the analytics capabilities we have has been growing in recent years to help them with their pricing and their there merchandising. And now, more recently, we're seeing their needs for our Watch assets to help them with their advertising decisions growing as well and the big advertisers as you well know. And so retailers has been an important part of our Buy business growth and in particular, in developed markets. NVC very, very strong opportunity for our business with retailers going forward. In fact, if we would size it going forward, we would say that they represent as much as 0.5 point of kind of growth for our business over the next 3 to 5 years, 0.5 point per year over the next 3 to 5 years at a global level, that's how significant the opportunity we see with retailers is."

First, credibility. They have amazing talent. They have proven very strong capabilities. Those, now being part of Nielsen portfolio gives us more credibility in this area than we otherwise would have had, how we just continued on the path that we were on. We also bring a lot to the party by connecting with Nielsen historically has and developing recent years with eXelate but they bring into our portfolio has just accelerated our progress, with the both small and with the larger players because, again, they're all connected in some level. It's not just coincidence that Google has emerged over the past year or so to be one of our largest Watch clients in the world. And so it really speaks to what underlies your question. So again, we feel great about the eXelate acquisition. The business itself that we acquired performed incredibly well in 2015.

The reason for that is really 2 key drivers. Number one, we're continuing to scale in the emerging markets and we have a focus on profitability. And as those investments that we made in the emerging markets continue to; scale, then Buy margins are moving in the right direction. You see Buy margins expand over the last 6 quarters and we expect that to continue into 2016. And Then the second dynamic is that, with intensity around cost and productivity, we've done that for a number of years. We're going to continue to that in 2016. So we feel good about the 50 to 70 basis point of margin expansion in the company and we expect Buy to be a bigger contributor. In terms of Watch in 2016, 2016 is an investment year for us as we look to roll out our new product capabilities and that investment isn't necessarily in sort of the traditional OpEx that you would expect. But we're going to add a lot of commercial capabilities to help us to go after the growth opportunities with digital clients.

We'll see other forces that will counterbalance that and one of them is precision. Because you have this -- all these datasets that are being connected, great tools being built by Nielsen and others from an analytics capability that enable more and more precision, not only in the digital world, but even in the linear world going forward. And that increased precision means less waste in terms of advertising exposures to people pay for and that will be a positive driver on costs -- on CPMs. In addition, I think we're also continuing to see people realize the importance of reach. While you can get incredible precision sometimes in the digital world, it's hard to have that and reach at the same time. And that's one of the reasons why  linear television continues to hold up, so well even with all the forces trying to pull viewers away. Linear television still delivers incredible reach in the marketplace. And advertisers know that reach deserves a premium in terms of getting their advertising message out the brand. The first exposure of my ad to a consumer is the best 1 and e reach is what I really am seeking for, first and foremost, and that's the only that first and foremost, and so that will be a second positive force that will continue to support the evolution of these CPMs in the marketplace. So some plusses and minuses, we'll see where it plays out, however it plays out.  Our Total Audience Measurement system will not measure it, but enlighten people to what they're actually getting in the marketplace and how this compare with what they have to get when they planned."

Can you just touch on anything you're using in emerging markets and kind of a more discretionary based spend is looking for clients, particularly exiting the fourth quarter and in the beginning of the year just given some of the more choppiness we're seeing out there?"

Our business held up incredibly well in mainland China in 2015, double-digit growth even with what was happening in the financial markets and the market overall. I think the key reason for that is in addition to our teams staying focused and exhibited will and in doing to gain penetration like I mentioned for our teams what they have done in Brazil, Russia, Turkey, China was very similar for us. The other thing as our core focus is on the consumer end up in supermarkets and retail sales and digital and other media consumption. The consumer focus of our business and in China, that is largely separate, frankly, from a lot of the tour mile that you've seen a differential markets, which has a dominated the press about the China market recently. And so I think those 2 things go to the for why we still had a strong year of double-digit growth in mainland China in 2015."

China, our second-largest region, was up double digits in the fourth quarter. The Middle East was up double digits. Africa, which is our fastest-growing region is up single digits. So we've seen broad-based growth across the market. I think the other dynamic that really stands out for me is that in the emerging markets where multinational makeup about 65% of our business. We really did see them pivot the growth there over the last year or so. And emerging -- the growth in emerging markets for multi-nationals was about on par with what we've seen in locals where locals at one point were growing significant investor than the multinational. So broad-based growth and get health in really both segments of the market after him, so multinationals and locals."

I mentioned, we hadn't made digital video player that will be added in the coming weeks, so excited about that. And also just growing engagement from the industry broadly, dozens of clients participating on our client advisory board. With regard to syndication of Digital Content Ratings, we said on our last call, in quarter 3, that we're on track for syndication in the first part of this year and we remain on track for syndication in the first part of this year. It's likely to be sometime in early to middle part of the second quarter. But we'll do that with the guidance from our clients in our upcoming client advisory board, will help us firm up. What is the right timing for our client. That's really where it starts and ends with us has to do it at the right time and the right way to best serve their needs in the market, so that's the Digital Content Ratings. And then total content ratings, Digital Content Ratings obviously flows into and plays a big part in total content ratings, along with the Audience Measurement we have linear television, video-on-demand and everything else. And we're well on track for syndication of total content rating as well. We would peg that one right around the end of the second quarter of the year right now. But we already have a 70-plus networks that are receiving data from total content ratings. And all of that, along with everything else from our Total Audience Measurement system is already informing and supporting our clients thinking and decision-making as they approach the 2016 upfront. So we already know it's being useful to the marketplace and we are absolutely thrilled about that. And one of the thing on total content ratings I think is, is just interesting to know it's. We did a recent analysis, a sampling of shareholders that we can see through total content ratings. And what we did is we looked that they ratings that you would get out of total content ratings and we compared it to the ratings you would get if you just looked at our Audience Measurement of linear television. In this case, there are number of people that saw it in your television either live or through a DVR for 7 days after the live viewing. So compare total content rating to linear television ratings, what we see that is in total content ratings, ratings are at leats 10% higher in most cases. And in some cases, as much as 50% higher. And so we know that this system is working, and it's really showing the broader range and the lift that's available to clients in the industry as they contemplate how to redefine the currency, what to include in that new definition of a currency, which is, of course, the focus of those ongoing client discussions and meetings that I referred to earlier. So to excited where this is going to go in the marketplace is exciting to see the role that our Total Audience Measurement system is playing in all of it."

We understand that, first of all, what would -- what I take from it very initially is, is always positive when our class our topics all about the marketplace what is a since we are highly relevant, and that's always a good thing. But of course, I prefer that there is a good things as opposed to criticisms, but they are making criticisms, we listen, this the first erupted on we have to ask ourselves is, is that criticism invalid or is that based on misinformation or maybe incomplete information and then we respond accordingly. And what we almost always do is when we hear a comment like this in the market is, we follow up and be follow-up and we say, would like to understand we saw our heard what he said, would like to understand a little bit more about why you said at that and that often give it gives us a case to bring that particular client up-to-date on something, it gives us a chance to make our case on something and in some cases, it gives us a chance to learn and we get better from that. So it's always productive and when we respond to it in the right way, and we've been very focus on doing exactly that in the past year and we're going to continue that in the year ahead. And while we never expect those kinds of comments to go away entirely, we do see and we have heard others say that we're making progress on that front. And so we feel good about that. We're going to stay focused on it. On your other question about [indiscernible] and Media General, you also mentioned the St. Clair and Tribune, we're thrilled, whether it's a client who's signing a contract with us for the first time or whether it's the 50th time, we're always thrilled by those and so the renewals here that are happening in our local television business in to really are when was are just that. And in terms, reflect where we are in this part of the business local television business has been over the last several years that trend has been low single-digit growth and of the contract reflect that and are consistent with the that. What you're also seeing Bill with, for instance, the Hertz renewal, recently is it's not just focused on local television, then your television manage measurement also starting to tap increasingly into the broader range of capability you can bring for them both for digital measurement and also for analytics that have of them better sell of their ad inventory to their advertiser clients in the marketplace. And so we're seeing these relationships broaden a bit, utilize Moravec of abilities we bring to the marketplace, that's a big positive."

There are competitors to some degree, TV networks that have their own apps can collect their own data any of had, so my question is I don't think anybody questions at the relevancy of Total Audience Measurement but is it possible to break down how the revenue streams may look as in will you sell Total Audience Measurement as a data source of the subscription as you ratings? And then is there a separate element of selling data with feeds into programmatic buying in changes.

I'll share a few thoughts on that and maybe Jamere has something to add. First, with regard to competitors or networks or publishers who have their own data, there are 2 things that bring that are highly depreciated versus anybody else out there. One is we bring a comprehensive view, especially when it comes to video, we're able to bring a full range of places and ways of the consumer's view video content, that's our Total Audience Measurement system, that what it's about. Nobody else has that comprehensive view with the level of quality granularity that we bring to the market, so that's one. And then the other is independence, which is incredibly important in the marketplace. For instance, digital publisher and I have my own data, I can share that with an advertiser. So that's great in terms of helping that advertiser understand what's possible on my particular platform. But what I can't put that in context relative to the rest of the options available to that advertiser and also not independent provider of that information and to sell advertisers ultimately want that independence so that things are looked at in the same way with objectivity, not only on that particular publisher's platform, but across other platforms. And to your point about the description versus maybe more volume are based as it might be more typical these days in the ad tech wrote and then there's other dimension, which is measurement versus analytics yes, I think that's exactly consistent with our experience over the past few years. We see a wider range of a business models and expressing the way we've contracted with or engaged with our clients. And part of that businesses the state of fragmentation in the base of a change in the industry and the likely will converge to be a nod our range of this models going forward. But it tougher for a clientele that flexibility right now as everything is changing, so fast and in marketplace. For instance, if I'm going to sign up for a fee-based service, then I need to know whether or not I'm going to really get the value out of that fee-based service over that was of the year that maybe multiple years of that contract applies to. But if it's a something that's emerging in the marketplace rapidly, it's kind of hard to know where it's going to be at year or 2 or 3 years down the road, so I might prefer to instead decide of for more of volume abased contract right now because I don't know if it's going to be 2x bigger next year or 5x or 10x bigger next year, so volume base would be a better way to contract. And we offer that kind of flexibility to our clients and I think that serves us well. Jamere, anything to add?"

Thanks for joining us on the call. 2015 was a banner year for Nielsen. On a constant currency basis, we posted another year of mid-single-digit revenue growth, margin expansion and record free cash flow despite the volatile economic backdrop. Steady, consistent and resilient, that's who we are. 
In 2015, our top priority and biggest accomplishment was Total Audience Measurement, our comprehensive system that provides comparable measurement across all screens and platforms. Today, Total Audience is here, it's in the market, and it's gaining traction with our clients. And I'm extremely proud of our team's execution. 
Looking at the business more broadly. Leveraging our measurement and analytics to help our clients make the important connections that drive their business is what we've done for nearly 93 years. And in a world of growing complexity and speed, our platform-based, system-oriented approach is nicely aligned with where our clients are going. It helped drive a number of wins across our Watch and Buy segments in 2015. 
Let's take a quick look at our financial performance for the full year. First, we had strong revenue growth. On a constant currency basis, 2015 revenues grew 5%, 0.5 point better than our core revenue growth in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7.2% constant currency, reflecting the scalability of our business model and ongoing productivity improvements. Adjusted net income per share grew 12.4% constant currency to $2.53. 
Free cash flow was a record $804 million, up 18% over the prior year. Our strong free cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in our growth initiatives while also returning cash to our shareholders. Through our dividend and share repurchases, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders in 2015. 
In December, we announced an additional share buyback authorization of $500 million, bringing us to a total of approximately $850 million at year-end. Driving shareholder value through capital allocation remains a key priority for us. 
Acquisitions are also an integral part of our balanced capital allocation strategy, and the stand-out acquisition for us in 2015 was eXelate, which added to our ability to help buyers and sellers of advertising act with more precision and speed. Importantly, we leveraged this acquisition in creating Enterprise Marketing Platform or EMP. This system connects Nielsen data with a wide range of other data sources to help advertisers move from targeting segments of consumers to addressing individual consumers. It's a powerful capability. 
Lastly, we're reiterating our guidance for 2016. 
Next, let's take a look at the fourth quarter highlights. First, Watch. Fourth quarter Watch revenues increased just over 5%. In addition to the growth from our traditional client base, we're also seeing faster growth with our Digital clients, including the big players like Google and Facebook. By the way, we announced last month that we'll be adding Facebook conversations to our existing Twitter feed to fuel our Nielsen Social Content Ratings for TV programs, previously known as Nielsen Twitter TV ratings. We also plan to add Instagram data in the near future. 
Our Total Audience Measurement framework was a key driver of our performance in the quarter. On our last call, we talked about the 4 phases we see as the industry moves towards adoption of a new currency: execute, evaluate, adopt and transact.
First, execute. We've done this. The system is built, and it's available in the market. We brought more than 2 dozen deliverables to the marketplace in 2015 alone. 
Next, evaluate and adopt. These are iterated steps, and this is by design. Our clients need time to assess how the new metrics will impact their business, and they need flexibility as they explore different ways to monetize their content. And we built that flexibility right into the system. 
Let's look at some of the key components. First, Digital Ad Ratings. Digital Ad Ratings is now in 17 countries, covering 85% of the global digital ad spend. Revenue doubled in 2015. In January, we successfully completed our beta period on Google's DoubleClick platform, so we're now fully live with DoubleClick in 8 countries. And ours is the only independent digital advertising metric available on the DoubleClick platform outside the U.S. We also continue to gain share with major advertisers, and the most recent is Mandalay's who has chosen Nielsen as its digital advertising measurement provider. 
Moving on to VOD. In 2015, we launched several new measurement solutions, enabling us to cover a variety of video-on-demand viewing situations. If it's VOD or DVR viewing from your cable, satellite or telco provider, no matter whether it's seen within 3 days, 7 days or up to 35 days of the original airing, we measure it. If it's VOD from one of the popular subscription-based or ad-supported VOD providers, we measure that, too. And we're doing exactly that now for a wide range of networks and studios. We now cover over 6,000 different program episodes, most of which are viewed through Netflix. Altogether, our clients are using these various new metrics to drive both content licensing and advertising monetization decisions.
Next, Digital Content Ratings. Our progress with Digital continued in Q4 and into this year. Diverse group of networks, MVPDs and publishers are already fully operational, with another dozen or so currently in process. Notably, a major digital video platform will begin receiving data from us next week. 
As we've said before, our approach to measuring each of the parts, in this case, VOD, digital video and linear TV, is to ensure the measurement of each is comparable so they can be put together to form Total Content Ratings. The ability to provide this comprehensive view of the consumer is unique to Nielsen. It's what enables us to provide our clients with a deduplicated view of their total audience, putting television and digital video on an even playing field, which is crucial to how our clients think about their business going forward. We now have over 70 individual networks signed up for Total Content Ratings, and as more clients enable measurement of their digital and VOD content, that number will continue to grow. 
We've also invested in our measurement of linear television viewing. In 2015, we effectively doubled the size of our gold standard U.S. panel. The work is complete, and the ratings are live in the market. And the larger panel provides greater ratings stability, important especially for the smaller networks. And it also adds more analytical power to our Total Audience Measurement system. In fact, all of these initiatives contribute to the growing adoption of Nielsen's Total Audience Measurement system, which leads us to the fourth phase: transact.
As we mentioned at our December Analyst Day, we've had successful meetings with a full range of key industry leaders regarding the need to move the currency definition beyond the current C3 and C7. Additional meetings will occur over the next few weeks. Our clients are highly engaged, and there's broad-based commitment to redefine the currency to one that's more reflective of how today's consumers watch content. We're confident that no matter how the currency is redefined, our Total Audience Measurement system will support it. In the meantime, we know it's already helped shape how our clients are approaching and thinking about the 2016 upfronts. 
Before I leave Watch and turn to Buy, I want to touch on Marketing Effectiveness business. We had another strong quarter with revenue up more than 30% as we continue to help both buyers and sellers of media drive better marketing ROI. We strengthened our position in this area during the fourth quarter by increasing our stake in Nielsen Catalina Solutions, a business that's perfectly aligned with our strategy. 
Turning to Buy. As we closed 2015, our Buy business continued to strengthen and expand. Revenues grew nearly 6% in the quarter, led by emerging markets as well as solid growth in key developed markets, including the U.S. and Europe. We continue to win new clients in the relatively faster-growing mid-tier and small client segments. Just last week, Dole Foods named Nielsen as their preferred provider of consumer information and analytics. 
We also continued to strengthen our positions with retailers around the world. Retailers are longtime data partners for Nielsen, but they also have a growing need for our analytics to help with their advertising, marketing and merchandising decisions, both online and offline. Our business with retailers saw strong growth in 2015, boosted in part by 40 new e-commerce clients worldwide. 
Emerging markets grew 8.4% in Q4 despite more challenging economic conditions in many key markets. You've heard us say before that when our teams execute well, they're able to find growth even when GDP growth slows because we're still gaining penetration in many emerging markets. And our results illustrate this. For example, in 3 key markets: Brazil, Russia and Turkey, our business grew double digits, well above the GDP growth in those markets. 
The secret here really isn't any secret. Comes down to good old-fashioned execution by our teams, taking our proven product portfolio to new clients while helping our existing clients manage through the changing market conditions. Our team did a great job. 
Developed markets also exited the year with good momentum. Revenues increased 4.8% in Q4. And notably, this was helped by Europe where we're starting to see growth at the region level, low single digits but growth, and we're happy to have it. 
In parallel with Total Audience on the Watch side, our Buy business is building its own version called total consumer measurement. The idea is to measure all consumer purchases as buying behavior continues to fragment across channels and segments. As millennials carve a path for a new way to buy, for instance, e-commerce, mobile devices and subscription models, we, too, are carving out new ways to measure the full range of consumer purchasing, following the proven formula that combines our high-quality panels with big data to provide the quality, granularity and efficiency that our clients require. 
Measurement is the core of our business, and our objective is full coverage. Total Audience in Watch, total consumer in Buy. We don't measure just one screen or one channel with distribution. Our objective is to measure all of them, and we do that by focusing on and following the consumer. 
Before I close, let me revisit the 3 major trends and the related key investments that will drive our growth in 2016 and beyond. The first is the well-known trend that audiences are fragmenting across screens and platforms. And for us, that means our measurement needs to cover all viewing environments, providing comparable metrics for each. 
Our Total Audience Measurement system does exactly that, and its adoption continues to grow among our clients. 
The second is that consumers are reacting to ads in brands differently, and they're buying in new ways and across new channels. Advertisers want to harness the power of big data to enable them to market to those changing consumers with greater precision and with proven ROI on their marketing spend. This is what our Enterprise Marketing Platform enables. 
The third trend is that our clients' information and analytics needs are growing and changing. Clients want data and systems that help them to act, and they want more efficiency, speed and precision. This is the basis for our investment in eXelate and the Enterprise Marketing Platform that I just talked about, but it's also the basis for our investment in our Buy platform, the connected Buy system that you heard us talk about at our Analyst Day in December. Clients want to know what consumers are buying, why they're buying it and what action they should take next. 
In all 3 key areas, our platform-oriented, system-based approach provides scalability, flexibility and speed especially when our systems connect directly to our client systems. And because we own the essential core data, no one is better positioned to do it than Nielsen. 
To sum up, we feel great about our progress and confident about the year ahead. While we certainly don't wish for difficult economic conditions, we're ready for them. In fact, we know from experience that when economic conditions grow more challenging, our business model's advantages and strengths show through more clearly. 
Over to you, Jamere."

It was a great year for Nielsen, and I'm especially proud of the contributions of my colleagues around the world. Our teams have had a laser focus on execution, and their efforts are reflected on our fourth quarter and 2015 results. Our results are also indicative of the consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model and our ability to deliver solid results through the cycles. 
First, let me give a few more details on our 2015 performance. Revenue was just under $6.2 billion, up 5% constant currency, which is slightly above the high end of the revenue range we gave. We have delivered 38 consecutive quarters of constant-currency revenue growth behind solid execution on our growth initiatives. 
Our Watch business grew 4.9% on a constant currency basis, and we entered 2016 with great momentum behind our Total Audience execution. 
Our Buy business grew 5% as our investments in the emerging markets and new client wins continue to deliver solid growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA was just under $1.9 billion, up 7.2% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.1%, up 61 basis points on a constant currency basis as we executed on our productivity initiatives and delivered margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments. 
Adjusted net income was $975 million, up 8.5% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $2.63, up 12.4% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
We generated record free cash flow of $804 million, up 18.1% versus a year ago. Our free cash flow conversion of adjusted net income was 82%, up 12 points versus a year ago, driven by EBITDA growth and working capital management. And as I look ahead, I continue to see opportunities for working capital efficiencies within our business that will continue to drive our free cash flow growth. 
And finally, we delivered a record $1.1 billion back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks in 2015, demonstrating our continued commitment to drive incremental shareholder value through capital allocation. Again, a great year and solid execution by our teams around the world. 
Let me move to the fourth quarter. Revenue was $1.6 billion, up 5.6% constant currency. We had a strong finish to the year with solid revenue growth in both Watch and Buy. Adjusted EBITDA was $531 million, up 7.1% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 32.7%, up 45 basis points on a constant currency basis as we delivered margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments for the sixth consecutive quarter. 
Adjusted net income was $300 million, up 3.1% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.82, up 7.9% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. 
Finally, we generated $306 million in free cash flow, up an impressive 16.3% versus a year ago. However, our cash flow performance was significantly impacted in the quarter by the severe flooding in one of our major collection centers in Chennai, India as well as currency impact from the stronger dollar. Despite this, we finished with our second-highest quarterly free cash flow performance ever. As Mitch said, we finished the year on a strong note, and we have tremendous momentum heading into 2016.
Next, I'll move to the segments. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $745 million, up 5.2% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement ex Audio, which we now refer to as Audience Measurement of Video and Text, was up 7.6%.
As we talked about last quarter, Audio was down 6.9% as the timing of some deliveries were realized in the third quarter, which did not repeat in the fourth quarter. And for those of you who followed us since we acquired Arbitron, you will recall that our deliveries do not always sync up with the quarterly calendar, causing our yield results to appear lumpy. But in 2015, the highly profitable Audio business delivered low single-digit revenue growth, outstanding margins and strong free cash flow. 
Marketing Effectiveness was up 31.3% behind strong quarters in the eXelate product offerings and the performance of the Nielsen Catalina Solutions or NCS joint venture, which we increased our ownership stake in, in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned at Analyst Day. 
I want to also point out that you will see in our filings in GAAP net income/loss that we realized $158 million nonoperating gain on the step-up in our base in NCS as a result of our now majority stake in the joint venture. Our majority ownership stake contributed about 1 point to our Watch revenue growth in fourth quarter.
In 2015, Marketing Effectiveness was up 21% as we transformed the portfolio while making investments in eXelate and NCS while meeting the market's growing demand for solutions that help publishers and advertisers better identify, acquire and retain audiences across all screens, devices and formats.
As expected and as we highlighted in our last quarterly call, we had nearly a 2 points drag on Watch revenue from the products in our other Watch bucket we divested in our GE business late in the fourth quarter. And you should also note in our filings in GAAP income/loss that we realized an $18 million nonoperating gain on the transaction.
Our growth initiatives are delivering. Digital Ad Ratings continued its momentum, reflecting strong demand from advertisers, agencies and media owners. Digital Ad Ratings is an important offering in our Total Audience Measurement framework. And in 2015, our revenue nearly doubled as we added new clients, and existing clients increased the number of campaigns versus a year ago. Our subscription video-on-demand and Digital Content Ratings products continue to gain traction with our clients, giving us tremendous confidence and momentum heading into 2016.
Watch adjusted EBITDA was $340 million -- $343 million, up 6.9% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded a strong 70 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage in the business. Our Watch segment remains strong. We have executed on Total Audience Measurement, invested to transform the portfolio, and our new products and initiatives are gaining momentum. 
Turning to Buy. Our business had a strong fourth quarter and a solid year in 2015. Fourth quarter total Buy revenue was $879 million, up 5.9% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $607 million, up 4.8% on a constant currency basis, behind relative strength in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, we saw some onetime discretionary spend pickup that led to a really strong quarter and finish to the year. 
Our business in the emerging markets was $272 million, up 8.4% on a constant currency basis. Our teams are executing against the tough backdrop of challenging macroeconomic conditions. We saw broad-based growth in the emerging markets, with double-digit growth in Latin America, the Middle East and Greater China, along with high single digits in Africa. Emerging market revenue grew 8.5% in 2015, and I'm very pleased with our team's execution in these markets.
Buy EBITDA was $195 million, up 7.1% constant currency. Our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins were up 25 basis points in the quarter. This is the sixth straight quarter of Buy margin expansion as we have worked to improve profitability while we continue to invest in our products and expand coverage in the emerging markets. 
Overall, we had a great quarter in Buy, with solid revenue growth and margin expansion on a constant currency basis.
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. 
In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 620 basis points drag on revenue and a 500 basis point -- 580 basis points drag on EBITDA, which represented $0.02 a share earnings headwind versus our third quarter earnings call. For 2015, foreign currency impacted our adjusted net income per share results by $0.21. 
If yesterday's spot rates held constant in 2016, then we expect a 210 basis points drag on revenue and 140 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which represents an incremental $0.02 a share drag on the adjusted net income per share guidance that we gave in December. 
Moving to 2016 guidance. We are maintaining our 2016 earnings per share guidance. Despite an additional $0.02 a share headwind from FX, we remain confident in our plan to execute and deliver on all the operational elements that we laid out in December. 
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our execution in the fourth quarter and 2015. We have a lot of confidence and momentum in both of our segments as we head into 2016. And in addition, we are committed to an efficient and balanced capital structure that will enable us to grow our business and return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Kate."

I mentioned Google and Facebook, but there's a number of others. And one of the areas that has been long been a strength -- a strong grower for us in this area is our work with the ad tech world, the ad exchanges, the ad platforms where our Digital Ad Ratings metric in particular has played very well. But also, as we bring eXelate into the picture, it just raises our game in that area, and so that's contributed. Jamere?"

One, the NCS joint venture majority stake closed a little bit sooner than we had anticipated, and energy closed a little bit later than we anticipated. And as a result of that, we were up about 1 point. And then I think your last question was on -- just to finish up, your last question was on the total opportunity as it relates to Digital. Back a couple of years ago, we said that this was potentially a $500 million market opportunity. We still see that as being the case. And we're in the early innings of that obviously, but we're very confident in the products that we have in the marketplace and the adoption that we're seeing from our clients."

And on this call, we mentioned Dole Foods earlier. Retailers is another thing I would call out. We've increased our focus on retailers over the past year. This is a global opportunity for our business but, in particular, an important opportunity for us in developed markets where retailer environment is a little more consolidated, and so their profile in the market is raised. And what we find is that while retailers have long been data partners for Nielsen and have also long been clients of our capabilities, both measurement and analytics, their need for the analytics capabilities we have has been growing in recent years to help them with their pricing and their merchandising. And now more recently, we're seeing their need for our Watch assets to help them with their advertising decisions growing as well and the big advertisers, as you well know. And so retailers have been an important part of our Buy business growth and, in particular, in developed markets. And we see very, very strong opportunity for our business with retailers going forward. In fact, if we were to size it going forward, we would say that they represent as much as 0.5 point of kind of growth for our business over the next 3 to 5 years, 0.5 point per year over the next 3 to 5 years at a global level. That's how significant the opportunity we see with retailers is."

Those now being part of the Nielsen portfolio gives us more credibility in this area than we otherwise would have had, had we just continued down the path that we were on. We also bring a lot to the party by connecting what Nielsen has historically had and has been developing in recent years. With eXelate, what they bring into our portfolio has just accelerated our progress with both the small and with the larger players because again, they're all connected at some level. It's not just coincidence that Google has emerged over the past year or so to be one of our largest Watch clients in the world. And so yes, it really speaks to what underlies your question. So again, we feel great about the eXelate acquisition. The business itself that we acquired performed incredibly well in 2015.

So we've made these VOD measurement capabilities available, both VOD viewed through the cable or telco or satellite providers' set-top box as well as VOD viewed over the top, if you will, through a connected device. And we're measuring all of those different ways the consumers watch this content. I mentioned earlier, we're now covering more than 6,000 different program episodes in the marketplace and serving a wide range of clients as we do that. And yes, so sometimes it is the original owner of that content who wants to make sure that they are licensing it to that platform for a fee that's consistent with what its value is given the size of the audience and the appetite for that content. And in some cases, yes, it might be a studio who's producing it or other players. So we're really serving a much broader range of needs and a much broader range of clients than just the original source of that content itself, the platform itself. In some cases, a platform might say, ""Well, look, I already have a lot of data about just how much viewing is happening on my platform."" They might not feel a great need for what Nielsen brings to the party there, and that's okay. We respect that. But there's still other players who would like us to bring that content to them who do want more information about how much viewing is happening and how does it compare with the other places that they might choose to license that content instead."

So we did give guidance for 50 to 70 basis points of margin expansion, and that is on a total company basis, and we do expect Buy to be a slightly bigger contributor in 2016. The reason for that is really 2 key drivers. Number one, we're continuing to scale in the emerging markets, and we have a focus on profitability. And as those investments that we made in the emerging markets continue to scale, then Buy margins are moving in the right direction. And you've seen Buy margins expand over the last 6 quarters, and we expect that to continue into 2016. And then the second dynamic is that we're just running the place with intensity around cost and productivity. We've done that for a number of years. We're going to continue that in 2016. So we feel good about the 50 to 70 basis points of margin expansion in the company, and we expect Buy to be a bigger contributor. In terms of Watch in 2016, 2016 is an investment year for us as we look to roll out our new product capabilities, and that investment isn't necessarily in sort of the traditional OpEx that you would expect. But we're going to add a lot of commercial capabilities to help us go after the growth opportunities with digital clients. And so you're going to expect margins to be positive in Watch, and we're going to manage the total company to 50 to 70 basis points, and you're going to expect Buy to be a bigger contributor in 2016."

That's common conversation in the industry, and I think there are some things that will counter that. So we'll see some forces that'll push it that direction. We'll see other forces that will counterbalance that, and one of them is precision because you have this -- all of these datasets that are being connected, great tools being built by Nielsen and others from an analytics capability that enable more and more precision not only in the digital world but even in the linear world going forward. And that increased precision means less waste in terms of advertising exposures that people pay for, and that will be a positive driver on costs -- on CPMs. In addition, I think we're also continuing to see people realize the importance of reach. While you can get incredible precision sometimes in the digital world, it's hard to have that and reach at the same time. And it's one reason why linear television continues to hold up so well even with all of the forces trying to pull viewers away. Linear television still delivers incredible reach in the marketplace, and advertisers know that reach deserves a premium in terms of getting their advertising message out of the brand. The first exposure of my ad to a consumer is the best one, and so reach is what I really am seeking for, first and foremost, not the only thing but first and foremost. And so that will be a second positive force that will continue to support the evolution of these CPMs in the marketplace. So some pluses, some minuses. We'll see where it plays out. However it plays out, our Total Audience Measurement system will not only measure it but enlighten people to what they're actually getting in the marketplace and how does it compare with what they hope to get when they planned."

And then they put that together to provide measurement and analytics capabilities to clients to help clients, first of all, find the right audiences for their advertising and then also to assess the ROI on that advertising. This is Nielsen. This is Nielsen right at the heart of our business. And so while we have enjoyed this very positive and productive partnership with Catalina to put this business together, this is really right at the core of our business. And so that's why we saw this as something that we really, really want to secure the controlling stake in going forward. You see us doing -- this business, by the way, focuses primarily on FMCG brands, consumer packaged goods in the marketplace.

With regard to syndication of Digital Content Ratings, we said on our last call in quarter 3 that we were on track for syndication in the first part of this year, and we remain on track for syndication in the first part of this year. It's likely to be sometime in the early to middle part of the second quarter, but we'll do that with the guidance from our clients, and our upcoming client advisory board will help us firm up what is the right timing for our clients. That's really where it starts, always where it starts and ends, with us to do it at the right time and in the right way to best serve their needs in the market. So that's Digital Content Ratings. And then Total Content Ratings, Digital Content Ratings obviously flows into and plays a big part in Total Content Ratings, along with the Audience Measurement we have of linear television, video-on-demand and everything else. And we're well on track for syndication of Total Content Ratings as well. We would peg that one right around the end of the second quarter of the year right now. But we already have 70-plus networks that are receiving data from Total Content Ratings. And all of that, along with everything else from our Total Audience Measurement system, is already informing and supporting our clients' thinking and decision-making as they approach the 2016 upfronts. So we already know that it's being useful to the marketplace, and we're obviously thrilled about that. And so one other thing on Total Content Ratings that I think is just interesting to note, we did a recent analysis, a sampling of shows that we can see through Total Content Ratings. And what we did is we looked at the ratings that you would get out of Total Content Ratings, and we compared it to the ratings you would get if you just looked at our Audience Measurement of linear television. In this case, there are a number of people that saw the linear television either live or through a DVR for 7 days after the live viewing. So we compared Total Content Ratings to linear television ratings. What we see is that in Total Content Ratings, ratings are at least 10% higher, in most cases, and, in some cases, as much as 50% higher. And so we know that this system is working, and it's really showing the broader range and the lift that's available to the clients in the industry as they contemplate how to redefine the currency, what to include in that new definition of the currency, which is, of course, the focus of those ongoing client discussions and meetings that I referred to earlier. So it's exciting to see where this is going to go in the marketplace and exciting to see the role that our Total Audience Measurement system is playing in all of it."

Thanks, Brian. Great questions. First, on the comments or -- and criticism sometimes that we'll hear from our clients in the marketplace, look, we understand that first of all, what would I -- what I take away from it very initially is, it's always positive when our clients are talking to us about the marketplace because what it says is we're highly relevant, and that's always a good thing. But of course, I prefer that they're saying good things as opposed to criticisms. When they're making criticisms, we listen. That's always the first thing we have to do. And we have to ask ourselves, is that criticism valid or is it based on misinformation or maybe incomplete information? And then we respond accordingly. And what we almost always do is we -- when we hear a comment like this in the marketplace, we follow up, and we follow up and we say, ""Look, we would like to understand. We saw or we heard what you said. We'd like to understand a little bit more about why you said that."" And that often gives us a case to bring that particular client up to date on something. It gives us a chance to make our case on something. And in some cases, it gives us a chance to learn, and we get better from that. And so it's always productive when we respond to it in the right way. And we've been very focused on doing exactly that in the past year, and we're going to continue that in the year ahead. And while we don't -- never expect those kinds of comments to go away entirely, we do see and we have heard others say that we're making progress on that front. And so we feel good about that. We're going to stay focused on it. On your other question about Hearst and Media General, you also mentioned Sinclair and Tribune, look, we're thrilled to have -- whether it's a client who's signing a contract with us for the first time or whether it's the 50th time, we're always thrilled by those. And so the renewals here that are happening in our local television business and really our renewals, they are just that. And the terms reflect, I think, where we are in this part of the business, the local television business has been over the last several years. The trend line has been low single-digit growth, and the contract renewals reflect that and are consistent with that. What you're also seeing, though, with, for instance, the Hearst renewal recently is it's not just focused on local television, linear television audience measurement, but also, they're starting to tap increasingly into the broader range of capabilities we can bring to them, both for digital measurement and also for analytics that help them better sell their ad inventory to their advertiser clients in the marketplace. And so we're seeing these relationships broaden a bit to utilize more of the capabilities we bring to the marketplace. That's a big positive."

Back in the day, Nielsen TV Ratings were basically the only way for a TV network to monetize advertising. Now there are other ways. There are competitors, to some degree, TV networks that have their own apps can collect their own data and use that to sell ads. So my question is -- I don't think anybody questions the relevancy of Nielsen Total Audience Measurement, but is it possible to break down how the revenue streams may look? As in will you sell Total Audience Measurement as a data source of the subscription as you always have your ratings? And then is there a separate element of selling data with feeds into programmatic buying exchanges? I just -- if you could maybe help us understand how we should think about the Total Audience Measurement revenue stream. Does that make sense?"

I'll share a few thoughts on that, and maybe Jamere will have something to add. First, with regard to competitors or networks or publishers who have their own data, there are 2 things that we bring that are highly differentiated versus anybody else out there. One is we bring a comprehensive view. Especially when it comes to video, we're able to bring a full range of places and ways the consumers view video content. That's our Total Audience Measurement system. That's what it's about. Nobody else has that comprehensive view with the level of quality and granularity that we bring to the market. So that's one. And then the other is independence, which is incredibly important in the marketplace. For instance, if I'm a digital publisher and I have my own data, I can share that with an advertiser. So that's great in terms of helping that advertiser understand what's possible on my particular platform. But what I -- I can't put that in context relative to the rest of the options available to that advertiser, and I'm also not an independent provider of that information. And so advertisers ultimately want that independence so that things are looked at in the same way with objectivity, not only on that particular publisher's platform but across other platforms. And to your point about subscription versus maybe more volume-based as might be more typical these days in the ad tech world, and then there's another dimension, which is measurement versus analytics, yes, I think that's exactly consistent with our experience over the past few years. We see a wider range of business models expressing the way we've contracted with or engaged with our clients. And part of that is just a state of fragmentation and the pace of change in the industry, and it likely will converge to be a narrower range of business models going forward. But it's helpful for clients to have that flexibility right now as everything is changing so fast in the marketplace. For instance, if I am going to sign up for a fee-based service, then I need to know whether or not I'm going to really get value out of that fee-based service over the course of the year that -- or maybe multiple years that, that contract applies to. But if it's something that's emerging in the marketplace rapidly, it's kind of hard to know where it's going to be a year or 2 or 3 years down the road. And so I might prefer to instead sign up for more of a volume-based contract right now because I don't know if it's going to be 2x bigger next year or 5x or 10x bigger next year. So volume-based would be a better way to contract, and we offer that kind of flexibility to our clients, and I think that serves us well. Jamere, anything to add?"

Thanks for joining us on the call. 2015 was a banner year for Nielsen. On a constant currency basis, we posted another year of mid-single-digit revenue growth, margin expansion and record free cash flow despite the volatile economic backdrop. Steady, consistent and resilient, that's who we are. 
In 2015, our top priority and biggest accomplishment was Total Audience Measurement, our comprehensive system that provides comparable measurement across all screens and platforms. Today, Total Audience is here, it's in the market, and it's gaining traction with our clients. And I'm extremely proud of our team's execution. 
Looking at the business more broadly. Leveraging our measurement and analytics to help our clients make the important connections that drive their business is what we've done for nearly 93 years. And in a world of growing complexity and speed, our platform-based, system-oriented approach is nicely aligned with where our clients are going. It helped drive a number of wins across our Watch and Buy segments in 2015. 
Let's take a quick look at our financial performance for the full year. First, we had strong revenue growth. On a constant currency basis, 2015 revenues grew 5%, 0.5 point better than our core revenue growth in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7.2% constant currency, reflecting the scalability of our business model and ongoing productivity improvements. Adjusted net income per share grew 12.4% constant currency to $2.63. 
Free cash flow was a record $804 million, up 18% over the prior year. Our strong free cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in our growth initiatives while also returning cash to our shareholders. Through our dividend and share repurchases, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders in 2015. 
In December, we announced an additional share buyback authorization of $500 million, bringing us to a total of approximately $850 million at year-end. Driving shareholder value through capital allocation remains a key priority for us. 
Acquisitions are also an integral part of our balanced capital allocation strategy, and the stand-out acquisition for us in 2015 was eXelate, which added to our ability to help buyers and sellers of advertising act with more precision and speed. Importantly, we leveraged this acquisition and created an Enterprise Marketing Platform or EMP. This system connects Nielsen data with a wide range of other data sources to help advertisers move from targeting segments of consumers to addressing individual consumers. It's a powerful capability. 
Lastly, we're reiterating our guidance for 2016. 
Next, let's take a look at the fourth quarter highlights. First, Watch. Fourth quarter Watch revenues increased just over 5%. In addition to the growth from our traditional client base, we're also seeing faster growth with our Digital clients, including the big players like Google and Facebook. By the way, we announced last month that we'll be adding Facebook conversations to our existing Twitter feed to fuel our Nielsen Social Content Ratings for TV programs, previously known as Nielsen Twitter TV ratings. We also plan to add Instagram data in the near future. 
Our Total Audience Measurement framework was a key driver of our performance in the quarter. On our last call, we talked about the 4 phases we see as the industry moves towards adoption of a new currency: execute, evaluate, adopt and transact.
First, execute. We've done this. The system is built, and it's available in the market. We brought more than 2 dozen deliverables to the marketplace in 2015 alone. 
Next, evaluate and adopt. These are iterative steps, and this is by design. Our clients need time to assess how the new metrics will impact their business, and they need flexibility as they explore different ways to monetize their content. And we built that flexibility right into the system. 
Let's look at some of the key components. First, Digital Ad Ratings. Digital Ad Ratings is now in 17 countries, covering 85% of global digital ad spend. Revenue doubled in 2015. In January, we successfully completed our beta period on Google's DoubleClick platform, so we're now fully live with DoubleClick in 8 countries. And ours is the only independent digital advertising metric available on the DoubleClick platform outside the U.S. We also continue to gain share with major advertisers, and the most recent is Mondelez who has chosen Nielsen as its digital advertising measurement provider. 
Moving on to VOD. In 2015, we launched several new measurement solutions, enabling us to cover a variety of video-on-demand viewing situations. If it's VOD or DVR viewing from your cable, satellite or telco provider, no matter whether it's seen within 3 days, 7 days or up to 35 days of the original airing, we measure it. If it's VOD from one of the popular subscription-based or ad-supported VOD providers, we measure that, too. And we're doing exactly that now for a wide range of networks and studios. We now cover over 6,000 different program episodes, most of which are viewed through Netflix. Altogether, our clients are using these various new metrics to drive both content licensing and advertising monetization decisions.
Next, Digital Content Ratings. Our progress with this rollout continued in Q4 and into this year. Diverse group of networks, MVPDs and publishers are already fully operational, with another dozen or so currently in process. Notably, a major digital video platform will begin receiving data from us next week. 
As we've said before, our approach to measuring each of the parts, in this case, VOD, digital video and linear TV, is to ensure the measurement of each is comparable so they can be put together to form Total Content Ratings. The ability to provide this comprehensive view of the consumer is unique to Nielsen. It's what enables us to provide our clients with a deduplicated view of their total audience, putting television and digital video on an even playing field, which is crucial to how our clients think about their business going forward. We now have over 70 individual networks signed up for Total Content Ratings, and as more clients enable measurement of their digital and VOD content, that number will continue to grow. 
We've also invested in our measurement of linear television viewing. In 2015, we effectively doubled the size of our gold standard U.S. panel. The work is complete, and the ratings are live in the market. And the larger panel provides greater ratings stability, important especially for the smaller networks. And it also adds more analytical power to our Total Audience Measurement system. In fact, all of these initiatives contribute to the growing adoption of Nielsen's Total Audience Measurement system, which leads us to the fourth phase: transact.
As we mentioned at our December Analyst Day, we've had successful meetings with a full range of key industry leaders regarding the need to move the currency definition beyond the current C3 and C7. Additional meetings will occur over the next few weeks. Our clients are highly engaged, and there's broad-based commitment to redefine the currency to one that's more reflective of how today's consumers watch content. We're confident that no matter how the currency is redefined, our Total Audience Measurement system will support it. In the meantime, we know it's already helped shape how our clients are approaching and thinking about the 2016 upfronts. 
Before I leave Watch and turn to Buy, I want to touch on Marketing Effectiveness business. We had another strong quarter with revenue up more than 30% as we continue to help both buyers and sellers of media drive better marketing ROI. We strengthened our position in this area during the fourth quarter by increasing our stake in Nielsen Catalina Solutions, a business that's perfectly aligned with our strategy. 
Turning to Buy. As we closed 2015, our Buy business continued to strengthen and expand. Revenues grew nearly 6% in the quarter, led by emerging markets as well as solid growth in key developed markets, including the U.S. and Europe. We continue to win new clients in the relatively faster-growing mid-tier and small client segments. Just last week, Dole Foods named Nielsen as their preferred provider of consumer information and analytics. 
We also continued to strengthen our positions with retailers around the world. Retailers are longtime data partners for Nielsen, but they also have a growing need for our analytics to help with their advertising, marketing and merchandising decisions, both online and offline. Our business with retailers saw strong growth in 2015, boosted in part by 40 new e-commerce clients worldwide. 
Emerging markets grew 8.4% in Q4 despite more challenging economic conditions in many key markets. You've heard us say before that when our teams execute well, they're able to find growth even when GDP growth slows because we're still gaining penetration in many emerging markets. And our results illustrate this. For example, in 3 key markets: Brazil, Russia and Turkey, our business grew double digits, well above the GDP growth in those markets. 
The secret here really isn't any secret. Comes down to good old-fashioned execution by our teams, taking our proven product portfolio to new clients while helping our existing clients manage through the changing market conditions. Our teams did a great job. 
Developed markets also exited the year with good momentum. Revenues increased 4.8% in Q4. And notably, this was helped by Europe where we're starting to see growth at the region level, low single digits but growth, and we're happy to have it. 
In parallel with Total Audience on the Watch side, our Buy business is building its own version called total consumer measurement. The idea is to measure all consumer purchases as buying behavior continues to fragment across channels and segments. As millennials carve a path for a new way to buy, for instance, e-commerce, mobile devices and subscription models, we, too, are carving out new ways to measure the full range of consumer purchasing, following the proven formula that combines our high-quality panels with big data to provide the quality, granularity and efficiency that our clients require. 
Measurement is the core of our business, and our objective is full coverage. Total Audience in Watch, total consumer in Buy. We don't measure just one screen or one channel of distribution. Our objective is to measure all of them, and we do that by focusing on and following the consumer. 
Before I close, let me revisit the 3 major trends and the related key investments that will drive our growth in 2016 and beyond. The first is the well-known trend that audiences are fragmenting across screens and platforms. And for us, that means our measurement needs to cover all viewing environments, providing comparable metrics for each. 
Our Total Audience Measurement system does exactly that, and its adoption continues to grow among our clients. 
The second is that consumers are reacting to ads and brands differently, and they're buying in new ways and across new channels. Advertisers want to harness the power of big data to enable them to market to those changing consumers with greater precision and with proven ROI on their marketing spend. This is what our Enterprise Marketing Platform enables. 
The third trend is that our clients' information and analytics needs are growing and changing. Clients want data and systems that help them to act, and they want more efficiency, speed and precision. This is the basis for our investment in eXelate and the Enterprise Marketing Platform that I just talked about, but it's also the basis for our investment in our Buy platform, the connected Buy system that you heard us talk about at our Analyst Day in December. Clients want to know what consumers are buying, why they're buying it and what action they should take next. 
In all 3 key areas, our platform-oriented, system-based approach provides scalability, flexibility and speed especially when our systems connect directly to our client systems. And because we own the essential core data, no one is better positioned to do it than Nielsen. 
To sum up, we feel great about our progress and confident about the year ahead. While we certainly don't wish for difficult economic conditions, we're ready for them. In fact, we know from experience that when economic conditions grow more challenging, our business model's advantages and strengths show through more clearly. 
Over to you, Jamere."

It was a great year for Nielsen, and I'm especially proud of the contributions of my colleagues around the world. Our teams have had a laser focus on execution, and their efforts are reflected on our fourth quarter and 2015 results. Our results are also indicative of the consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model and our ability to deliver solid results through the cycles. 
First, let me give a few more details on our 2015 performance. Revenue was just under $6.2 billion, up 5% constant currency, which is slightly above the high end of the revenue range we gave. We have delivered 38 consecutive quarters of constant-currency revenue growth behind solid execution on our growth initiatives. 
Our Watch business grew 4.9% on a constant currency basis, and we entered 2016 with great momentum behind our Total Audience execution. 
Our Buy business grew 5% as our investments in the emerging markets and new client wins continue to deliver solid growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA was just under $1.9 billion, up 7.2% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.1%, up 61 basis points on a constant currency basis as we executed on our productivity initiatives and delivered margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments. 
Adjusted net income was $975 million, up 8.5% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $2.63, up 12.4% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
We generated record free cash flow of $804 million, up 18.1% versus a year ago. Our free cash flow conversion of adjusted net income was 82%, up 12 points versus a year ago, driven by EBITDA growth and working capital management. And as I look ahead, I continue to see opportunities for working capital efficiencies within our business that will continue to drive our free cash flow growth. 
And finally, we delivered a record $1.1 billion back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks in 2015, demonstrating our continued commitment to drive incremental shareholder value through capital allocation. Again, a great year and solid execution by our teams around the world. 
Let me move to the fourth quarter. Revenue was $1.6 billion, up 5.6% constant currency. We had a strong finish to the year with solid revenue growth in both Watch and Buy. Adjusted EBITDA was $531 million, up 7.1% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 32.7%, up 45 basis points on a constant currency basis as we delivered margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments for the sixth consecutive quarter. 
Adjusted net income was $300 million, up 3.1% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.82, up 7.9% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. 
Finally, we generated $306 million in free cash flow, up an impressive 16.3% versus a year ago. However, our cash flow performance was significantly impacted in the quarter by the severe flooding in one of our major collection centers in Chennai, India as well as currency impacts from the stronger dollar. Despite this, we finished with our second-highest quarterly free cash flow performance ever. As Mitch said, we finished the year on a strong note, and we have tremendous momentum heading into 2016.
Next, I'll move to the segments. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $745 million, up 5.2% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement ex Audio, which we now refer to as Audience Measurement of Video and Text, was up 7.6%.
As we talked about last quarter, Audio was down 6.9% as the timing of some deliveries were realized in the third quarter, which did not repeat in the fourth quarter. And for those of you who have followed us since we acquired Arbitron, you will recall that our deliveries do not always sync up with the quarterly calendar, causing our yield results to appear lumpy. But in 2015, the highly profitable Audio business delivered low single-digit revenue growth, outstanding margins and strong free cash flow. 
Marketing Effectiveness was up 31.3% behind strong quarters in the eXelate product offerings and the performance of the Nielsen Catalina Solutions or NCS joint venture, which we increased our ownership stake in, in the fourth quarter as I mentioned at Analyst Day. 
I want to also point out that you will see in our filings in GAAP net income/loss that we realized $158 million nonoperating gain on the step-up in our basis in NCS as a result of our now majority stake in the joint venture. Our majority ownership stake contributed about 1 point to our Watch revenue growth in fourth quarter.
In 2015, Marketing Effectiveness was up 21% as we transformed the portfolio by making investments in eXelate and NCS while meeting the market's growing demand for solutions that help publishers and advertisers better identify, acquire and retain audiences across all screens, devices and formats.
As expected and as we highlighted in our last quarterly call, we had nearly a 2 points drag on Watch revenue from the products in our other Watch bucket. We divested the NRG business late in the fourth quarter. And you should also note in our filings in GAAP income/loss that we realized an $18 million nonoperating gain on the transaction.
Our growth initiatives are delivering. Digital Ad Ratings continued its momentum, reflecting strong demand from advertisers, agencies and media owners. Digital Ad Ratings is an important offering in our Total Audience Measurement framework. And in 2015, our revenue nearly doubled as we added new clients, and existing clients increased the number of campaigns versus a year ago. Our subscription video-on-demand and Digital Content Ratings products continue to gain traction with our clients, giving us tremendous confidence and momentum heading into 2016.
Watch adjusted EBITDA was $340 million -- $343 million, up 6.9% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded a strong 70 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage in the business. Our Watch segment remains strong. We have executed on Total Audience Measurement, invested to transform the portfolio, and our new products and initiatives are gaining momentum. 
Turning to Buy. Our business had a strong fourth quarter and a solid year in 2015. Fourth quarter total Buy revenue was $879 million, up 5.9% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $607 million, up 4.8% on a constant currency basis, behind relative strength in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, we saw some onetime discretionary spend pickup that led to a really strong quarter and finish to the year. 
Our business in the emerging markets was $272 million, up 8.4% on a constant currency basis. Our teams are executing against the tough backdrop of challenging macroeconomic conditions. We saw broad-based growth in the emerging markets, with double-digit growth in Latin America, the Middle East and Greater China, along with high single digits in Africa. Emerging market revenue grew 8.5% in 2015, and I'm very pleased with our team's execution in these markets.
Buy EBITDA was $195 million, up 7.1% constant currency. Our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins were up 25 basis points in the quarter. This is the sixth straight quarter of Buy margin expansion as we have worked to improve profitability while we continue to invest in our products and expand coverage in the emerging markets. 
Overall, we had a great quarter in Buy, with solid revenue growth and margin expansion on a constant currency basis.
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. 
In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 620 basis points drag on revenue and a 500 basis point -- 580 basis points drag on EBITDA, which represented $0.02 a share earnings headwind versus our third quarter earnings call. For 2015, foreign currency impacted our adjusted net income per share results by $0.21. 
If yesterday's spot rates held constant in 2016, then we expect a 210 basis points drag on revenue and 140 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which represents an incremental $0.02 a share drag on the adjusted net income per share guidance that we gave in December. 
Moving to 2016 guidance. We are maintaining our 2016 earnings per share guidance despite an additional $0.02 a share headwind from FX. We remain confident in our plan to execute and deliver on all the operational elements that we laid out in December. 
So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our execution in the fourth quarter and 2015. We have a lot of confidence and momentum in both of our segments as we head into 2016. And in addition, we are committed to an efficient and balanced capital structure that will enable us to grow our business and return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Kate."

I mentioned Google and Facebook, but there's a number of others. And one of the areas that has been long been a strength -- a strong grower for us in this area is our work with the ad tech world, the ad exchanges, the ad platforms where our Digital Ad Ratings metric in particular has played very well. But also, as we bring eXelate into the picture it just raises our game in that area, and so that's contributed. Jamere?"

One, the NCS joint venture majority stake closed a little bit sooner than we had anticipated, and NRG closed a little bit later than we anticipated. And as a result of that, we were up about 1 point. And then I think your last question was on -- just to finish up, your last question was on the total opportunity as it relates to Digital. Back a couple of years ago, we said that this was potentially a $500 million market opportunity. We still see that as being the case. And we're in the early innings of that obviously, but we're very confident in the products that we have in the marketplace and in the adoption that we're seeing from our clients."

And on this call we mentioned Dole Foods earlier. Retailers is another thing I would call out. We've increased our focus on retailers over the past year. This is a global opportunity for our business but, in particular, an important opportunity for us in developed markets where retailer environment is a little more consolidated, and so their profile in the market is raised. And what we find is that while retailers have long been data partners for Nielsen and have also long been clients of our capabilities, both measurement and analytics, their need for the analytics capabilities we have has been growing in recent years to help them with their pricing and their merchandising. And now more recently, we're seeing their need for our Watch assets to help them with their advertising decisions growing as well, and they're big advertisers as you well know. And so retailers have been an important part of our Buy business growth and, in particular, in developed markets. And we see very, very strong opportunity for our business with retailers going forward. In fact, if we were to size it going forward, we would say that they represent as much as 0.5 point of kind of growth for our business over the next 3 to 5 years, 0.5 point per year over the next 3 to 5 years at a global level. That's how significant the opportunity we see with retailers is."

I think what's implied by your question is exactly what our experience has been. That the big clients, the small clients, this is an ecosystem that is as connected as any other that we work in across our business around the world. And eXelate has helped us on every front. First, credibility. They have amazing talent. They have proven very strong capabilities. Those now being part of the Nielsen portfolio gives us more credibility in this area than we otherwise would have had, had we just continued down the path that we were on. We also bring a lot to the party by connecting what Nielsen has historically had and has been developing in recent years with eXelate. What they bring into our portfolio has just accelerated our progress with both the small and with the larger players because again, they're all connected at some level. It's not just coincidence that Google has emerged over the past year or so to be one of our largest Watch clients in the world. And so yes, it really speaks to what underlies your question. So again, we feel great about the eXelate acquisition. The business itself that we acquired performed incredibly well in 2015. But even beyond that business, at P&L, it's the assets and the talent that came into Nielsen that are contributing all across our portfolio that we're also seeing good value from that.

So we've made these VOD measurement capabilities available, both VOD viewed through the cable or telco or satellite providers' set-top box as well as VOD viewed over the top, if you will, through a connected device. And we're measuring all of those different ways that consumers watch this content. I mentioned earlier, we're now covering more than 6,000 different program episodes in the marketplace and serving a wide range of clients as we do that. And yes, so sometimes it is the original owner of that content who wants to make sure that they are licensing it to that platform for a fee that's consistent with what its value is given the size of the audience and the appetite for that content. And in some cases, yes, it might be a studio who's producing it or other player. So we're really serving a much broader range of needs and a much broader range of clients than just the original source of that content itself, the platform itself. In some cases, a platform might say, ""Well, look, I already have a lot of data about just how much viewing is happening on my platform."" They might not feel a great need for what Nielsen brings to the party there, and that's okay. We respect that. But there are still other players who are licensing that content to them who do want more information about how much viewing is happening and how does it compare with the other places that they might choose to license that content instead."

While you can get incredible precision sometimes in the digital world, it's hard to have that and reach at the same time. And it's one reason why linear television continues to hold up so well even with all of the forces trying to pull viewers away. Linear television still delivers incredible reach in the marketplace, and advertisers know that reach deserves a premium in terms of getting their advertising message out that brands. The first exposure of my ad to a consumer is the best one, and so reach is what I really am seeking for, first and foremost, not the only thing but first and foremost. And so that will be a second positive force that will continue to support the evolution of these CPMs in the marketplace. So some pluses, some minuses. We'll see where it plays out. However it plays out, our Total Audience Measurement system will not only measure it but enlighten people to what they're actually getting in the marketplace and how does it compare with what they hoped to get when they planned."

They connect it with information about what consumers watch, whether it's on television or in the digital world and therefore their advertising exposure. And then they put that together to provide measurement and analytics capabilities to clients to help clients, first of all, find the right audiences for their advertising and then also to assess the ROI on that advertising. This is Nielsen. This is Nielsen right at the heart of our business. And so while we have enjoyed this very positive and productive partnership with Catalina to put this business together, this is really right at the core of our business. And so that's why we saw this as something that we really, really want to secure the controlling stake in going forward. You see us doing -- this business, by the way, focuses primarily on FMCG brands, consumer packaged goods in the marketplace. We have similar capabilities in our portfolio already, with more to come, that do pretty much the same thing in other verticals out there in the marketplace.

And emerging -- the growth in the emerging markets for multinationals was about on par with what we've seen in locals, where locals at one point were growing significantly faster than the multinationals.

Thanks for the question. Digital Content Ratings, I mentioned earlier the rollout is progressing well and have a diverse range of clients, networks, MVPDs, publishers, a number of them fully operational already, more in process, soon to be operational. I mentioned we have a major digital video player to be added in the coming weeks, so we're excited about that. And also, just growing engagement from the industry broadly, dozens of clients participating on our Client Advisory Board. With regard to syndication of Digital Content Ratings, we said on our last call in quarter 3 that we were on track for syndication in the first part of this year, and we remain on track for syndication in the first part of this year. It's likely to be sometime in the early to middle part of the second quarter, but we'll do that with the guidance from our clients, and our upcoming client advisory board will help us firm up what is the right timing for our clients. That's really where it starts, always where it starts and ends with us is to do it at the right time and in the right way to best serve their needs in the market. So that's Digital Content Ratings. And then Total Content Ratings, Digital Content Ratings obviously flows into and plays a big part in Total Content Ratings, along with the Audience Measurement we have of linear television, video-on-demand and everything else. And we're well on track for syndication of Total Content Ratings as well. We would peg that one right around the end of the second quarter of the year right now. But we already have 70-plus networks that are receiving data from Total Content Ratings. And all of that, along with everything else from our Total Audience Measurement system, is already informing and supporting our clients' thinking and decision-making as they approach the 2016 upfronts. So we already know that it's being useful to the marketplace, and we're obviously thrilled about that. And so one other thing on Total Content Ratings that I think is just interesting to note, we did a recent analysis, a sampling of shows that we can see through Total Content Ratings. And what we did is we looked at the ratings that you would get out of Total Content Ratings, and we compared it to the ratings you would get if you just looked at our Audience Measurement of linear television. In this case, there are a number of people that saw the linear television either live or through a DVR with the 7 days after the live viewing. So compared Total Content Ratings to linear television ratings. What we see is that in Total Content Ratings, ratings are at least 10% higher, in most cases, and, in some cases, as much as 50% higher. And so we know that this system is working, and it's really showing the broader range and the lift that's available to the clients in the industry as they contemplate how to redefine the currency, what to include in that new definition of the currency, which is, of course, the focus of those ongoing client discussions and meetings that I referred to earlier. So it's exciting to see where this is going to go in the marketplace and exciting to see the role that our Total Audience Measurement system is playing in all of it."

And so it's always productive when we respond to it in the right way. And we've been very focused on doing exactly that in the past year, and we're going to continue that in the year ahead. And while we don't -- never expect those kinds of comments to go away entirely, we do see and we have heard others say that we're making progress on that front. And so we feel good about that. We're going to stay focused on it. On your other question about Hearst and Media General, you also mentioned Sinclair and Tribune. Look, we're thrilled. Whether it's a client who's signing a contract with us for the first time or whether it's the 50th time, we're always thrilled by those. And so the renewals here that are happening in our local television business, really, are renewals. They are just that. And the terms reflect, I think, where we are in this part of the business, the local television business has been over the last several years. The trend line has been low single-digit growth, and the contract renewals reflect that and are consistent with that. What you're also seeing, though, with, for instance, the Hearst renewal recently is it's not just focused on local television, linear television audience measurement, but also, they're starting to tap increasingly into the broader range of capabilities we can bring to them, both for digital measurement and also for analytics that help them better sell their ad inventory to their advertiser clients in the marketplace. And so we're seeing these relationships broaden a bit to utilize more of the capabilities we bring to the marketplace. That's a big positive."

Back in the day, Nielsen TV Ratings were basically the only way for a TV network to monetize advertising. Now there are other ways. There are competitors, to some degree, TV networks that have their own apps can collect their own data and use that to sell ads. So my question is -- I don't think anybody questions the relevancy of Nielsen Total Audience Measurement, but is it possible to break down how the revenue streams may look? As in will you sell Total Audience Measurement as a data source as a subscription, as you always have your ratings? And then is there a separate element of selling data with feeds into programmatic buying exchanges? I just -- if you could maybe help us understand how we should think about the Total Audience Measurement revenue stream. Does that make sense?"
422760,323469708,931920,"Nielsen Holdings plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Nielsen Holdings plc","Executives","Yes, it does. I'll share a few thoughts on that, and maybe Jamere will have something to add.

I'll share a few thoughts on that, and maybe Jamere will have something to add. First, with regard to competitors or networks or publishers who have their own data, there are 2 things that we bring that are highly differentiated versus anybody else out there. One is we bring a comprehensive view. Especially when it comes to video, we're able to bring a full range of places and ways that consumers view video content. That's our Total Audience Measurement system. That's what it's about. Nobody else has that comprehensive view with the level of quality and granularity that we bring to the market. So that's one. And then the other is independence, which is incredibly important in the marketplace. For instance, if I'm a digital publisher and I have my own data, I can share that with an advertiser. So that's great in terms of helping that advertiser understand what's possible on my particular platform. But what I -- I can't put that in context relative to the rest of the options available to that advertiser, and I'm also not an independent provider of that information. And so advertisers ultimately want that independence so that things are looked at in the same way with objectivity, not only on that particular publisher's platform but across other platforms. And to your point about subscription versus maybe more volume-based as might be more typical these days in the ad tech world, and then there's another dimension, which is measurement versus analytics, yes, I think that's exactly consistent with our experience over the past few years. We see a wider range of business models expressing the way we've contracted with or engaged with our clients. And part of that is just a state of fragmentation and the pace of change in the industry, and it likely will converge to be a narrower range of business models going forward. But it's helpful for clients to have that flexibility right now as everything is changing so fast in the marketplace. For instance, if I am going to sign up for a fee-based service, then I need to know whether or not I'm going to really get value out of that fee-based service over the course of the year that -- or maybe multiple years that, that contract applies to. But if it's something that's emerging in the marketplace rapidly, it's kind of hard to know where it's going to be a year or 2 or 3 years down the road. And so I might prefer to instead sign up for more of a volume-based contract right now because I don't know if it's going to be 2x bigger next year or 5x or 10x bigger next year. So volume-based would be a better way to contract, and we offer that kind of flexibility to our clients, and I think that serves us well. Jamere, anything to add?"

Good morning, everyone. 2016 is off to a good start for Nielsen underpinned by our consistent, resilient business model.

Good morning, everyone. 2016 is off to a good start for Nielsen underpinned by our consistent, resilient business model. Our strong financial results in the first quarter were fueled by our Watch segment's progress with Total Audience Measurement and our Buy segment continued strength in emerging market and growing momentum with retailers. In both Watch and Buy, our teams are executing well and there's a lot to look forward to for the rest of the year and beyond. 
What I'd like you to take away from this quarter's call is that we continue to deliver consistent growth and profitability, all while managing through the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve. Our teams do great job of leveraging change as a means for progress as they continuously renew and improve the services we provide. We're continuing to gain client adoption of our Total Audience Measurement framework, our complimentary analytics business continues its strong growth and our global footprint remains a key competitive advantage. It's these factors in particular that gives us continued confidence in our business and our strategy going forward.
Looking at the first quarter financials, we had revenue growth of 5.2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA grew 7.2% reflecting our scalable business model and our continuous focus on productivity improvements. Adjusted net income per share grew nearly 11% constant currency to $0.51. 
Our strong business model enables us to consistently invest in our future growth, while also returning cash to our shareholders. Today, we're announcing that our board has approved a dividend increase of 11%, increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.31 per share. 
During the quarter, we also continue to buy back our stock. And at the end of the first quarter, we had almost $800 million remaining under the existing authorization. We remain committed to drive shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy. 
Lastly, we're reiterating our guidance for 2016. 
At a high level across both of our businesses, Watch and Buy, we did 2 things, we measured performance for our clients and we help them improve their performance. Measurement is the core of our business, it tells our clients what happened. Our analytics help them understand why it happened and what they should do next to improve. Measurement and analytics are 2 separate things and each is important and valuable on its own, but the connection of measurement with analytics makes them even more useful and valuable and our efforts to increase this connection are helping to fuel our growth and continue to do so long into the future. 
In our Watch business, first quarter revenues increased more than 6% on a constant currency basis, including a 7.5% increase in the measurement of Video and Text. We're seeing significant momentum with our Total Audience Measurement system where our focus is on driving client adoption. We also continue to expand to enhance our offerings to meet the full range of our clients' needs. A great example of this is our recently announced agreement with DISH Networks to improve their set-top box data as part of our industry standard TV ratings service. 
Integrating DISH's data with our panel data fits perfectly with our hybrid approach, panels, plus big data, providing both the quality and granularity our clients need. This will both bolster our core measurement service and help fuel our analytics capabilities and initial feedback from our clients is, of course, been positive. 
Looking at the Digital Ad Ratings, some of you have asked for an update on client adoption. We continue to make progress with publishers and advertisers alike. In March, we added Snapchat to our growing roster of leading digital publishers that already includes Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pandora. On the advertiser side, we recently were selected by Unilever in China and in July, Procter & Gamble, will be coming on board in the United States.
We also are continuing to expand Digital Ad Ratings internationally. In 2016, we're adding 8 new markets, many of which are mobile first markets and that will bring the country total to 25. 
In China, Weibo, a widely used social media site, has come on board as a data partner joining Tencent who we began working with last year. Also, in March, we acquired Informe [ph], a leading mobile measurement provider in emerging markets to support our ongoing international expansion efforts.
On Digital Content Ratings, we have a wide range of clients spanning big media and digital evaluating their audiences for video and text base contents, as well as a robust pipeline of clients who are actively integrating the SDK. For participating clients, we remain on track syndication later this quarter. Syndicated reporting will continue to roll out for additional clients as they go through the onboarding process throughout the year. I mean will, we also be sharing data with our agency clients so that they can increase their familiarity with the data, so very good progress overall. 
Last week, Facebook announced at their F8 conference that they're opening up their Instant Articles program to all publishers around the world. The program has been a tremendous success for them as they seek to provide a better reading experience for their users and help publishers reach their audiences. We're mentioning this because those audiences will be measured by Nielsen's Digital Content Ratings. So this is a great example of the growing client adoption that we're seeing.
Next, let's move to Total Content Ratings. We now have about 140 networks for whom we are reporting time-shifted viewing through day 35, enabling these clients to see the incremental contribution to their Total Audience. Additionally, we have 55 networks enabled for our measurement of video-on-demand, including subscription video-on-demand through our Total Content Ratings reporting. Overall, we're now covering over 8,000 different programs episodes, up from about 6,000 last quarter. 
We also enhanced our coverage of TV connected devices, such as Apple TV, Roku, Chrome Cast and Amazon Fire. This data is flowing through our reporting with total content ratings today helping our clients to understand how viewing compares across the different brands of connected devices. 
Regarding the efforts update the definition of the currency, in March, we had another productive meeting with key industry stakeholders as we continue to move towards of the new expanded definition of currency for the marketplace. These discussions continue to progress well and they're getting much more specific about how the elements of our Total Audience Measurement system will be used in the new definition of the currency. 
In advance of this year's upfronts and new fronts, our clients are actively engaging and evaluating our data from Digital Content Ratings and Total Content Ratings. We're helping them understand that comparable metrics and the impact to their business. It's crucial for us to work with our clients through this process and we'll continue to support them both and the broad client forms as well as in individual meetings. 
It's exciting really to see how these the new metrics help our clients understand and leverage the changing ways that audiences are consuming content. They're used to these new metrics will continue to grow throughout the year leading to a more central role and even greater impact in next year's new fronts and upfronts. 
One final component of Total Audience measurement, we also recently announced Nielsen Digital Audio Ratings, which measures radio listening via mobile apps and web players. A ratings now captured broadcast radio total reach. This also leads the groundwork for us to measure other audio platforms where people listen to music, news, talk, sports and syndicated programs. Radio continues to have incredible reach with 93% of all adults listening to the radio each week making it an important, productive part of a brand's multimedia plan. 
Let's turn to Marketing Effectiveness. We had revenue growth of nearly 30% in the quarter, and this is largely where our Watch-related analytics fall and over the past several years, we've made significant investments in these space. As a result, we now produce the industry's most impressive suite of analytics solutions across the broader set of categories. In addition, Nielsen data also helps power many of our clients' own in-house selling and buying tools to add hear more about at the time of the offense. The role of analytics for assessing audience segmentation advertising ROI as well as fueling activation will only continue to grow. We feel great about our position in this part of the market. Recently we strengthened that position through acquisitions like eXelate in 2015 and Pointlogic in March of this year. 
Even prior to our acquisition of Pointlogic, we work with them to develop our Nielsen media impact service, which is a software solution for cross media planning, and it's connected to our Total Audience Measurement system. Media impact, along with other products from Pointlogic, enables agencies, media owners and advertisers to better plan, activate and optimize the value of their media investments. So you can see how this Pointlogic acquisition supports both our core measurement and our analytics services for our clients. 
Now a moment ago, I mentioned our eXelate acquisition and just last week, we announced the official launch of the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, formerly known as the Enterprise Marketing Platform. Look, we know how much you guys love it when we change the name of one of our services, so there you go, that's this quarter. Well, this Nielsen Marketing Cloud is impact heavily leverages our eXelate acquisition. It integrates Nielsen's data management, analytics, media planning and activation applications all on a single platform to help brands reach consumers more efficiently and precisely and to help media companies sell more effectively. We recognize we're not the only one out there with a Marketing Cloud capability but what sets our support is our access to the essential core data. That's the key reason why we are seeing strong initial momentum having already signed deals with over a dozen top fast moving consumer goods, pharma, spirited media companies in Q1.
Separately, we also recently announced the partnership with Time Warner leveraging Nielsen's neuroscience and biometrics tools in their media lab to help them understand and leverage the changing ways audiences engage with content and advertising. We have a similar long-running partnership with CBS and their television facility. 
So again, while measurement has always been and will continue to be the core of our business, we're also a significant player into analytics space and our ability to connect measurement with analytics increases the value of each and will continue to drive growth for our business.
Let's turn to Buy. In Buy segment revenues increased 4.3% on a constant currency basis and emerging markets were again the significant growth driver in the quarter with revenues up 10%. These markets experienced volatility from time to time but with it also comes tremendous growth opportunities. With our unmatched global footprint, supported by the investments we made in coverage for these markets over the past several years, we love our position.  This quarter, our teams once again executed well and we saw solid growth with multinational and local clients as they invested in both measurement and analytics. 
In developed markets, revenues grew 2% with our core measurement business remaining rock-solid. We saw growth shoots in Europe for the second quarter in a row, which is encouraging and also a huge testament to the efforts of our teams and their solid execution. One of the keys in Europe, in fact, one of the keys to our growth globally is our progress with our retailer clients. In fact, good traction capping into this opportunity and with our growth driven by our analytics capabilities, as well as core measurement wins and renewals. 
And on that front, last week, we reached a new agreement with Walmart. It's a multiyear renewal of our relationship and it elevates Nielsen to the status of preferred provider for Walmart's data. It also expands the range of our analytics work with Walmart and it includes the deployment of our latest technology solutions. Finally, the new agreement also grants Nielsen the ability to provide Walmart's store level market share to manufacturers beginning in July of 2016.
Moving onto coverage. In parallel with our Watch business focus on Total Audience Measurement, our Buy business is focused on total consumer measurement across all channels, including e-commerce. In February, we announced some significant enhancements to our e-commerce measurement capability in the U.S. following the proven formula that combines our high-quality panels with big data. This combination enables us to provide our manufacturer clients with both broad and gradual or coverage of their e-commerce sales, including on the largest platforms. Client reaction has been very positive. Also a recently announced partnership with Profitero further expands on our e-commerce capabilities.
Lastly, we're making excellent progress in our efforts to build a platform system that aligns and connects our Buy businesses wide variety of measurement and analytics needed to drive increased value for our clients. We're thrilled to announce that Kellogg's has signed up to be one of the early adopters, partnering with us as we build out this disconnected system for our fast moving consumer goods clients. 
So as you can see, our teams have been busy embracing the market changes and leveraging them as a means for progress as they execute on our strategy. That's the key to our ability to deliver consistent revenue and profit growth, driving returns for our shareholders. We feel great about the quarter and we feel great about the year ahead. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our next call. 
Over to you, Jamere."

We had another great quarter and [indiscernible] with the execution and efforts of our teams around the world. The year if off to a strong start and our results are indicative of the consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model which continued to deliver solid results through the cycles. 
First, let me cover our total company results for the first quarter. Revenue was just under $1.5 billion, up 5.2% constant currency. We have delivered 39 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth driven by strength in our core business and solid execution on our growth initiatives. 
Our Watch business grew 6.3% on a constant currency basis with great momentum in our Total Audience execution and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. 
Our Buy business grew 4.3% constant currency led by continued strength in emerging markets and new client wins. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $402 million, up 7.2% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 27%, up 49 basis points on a constant currency basis with margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments. 
We continue to run the productivity play with intensity and our operations team led by John [ph] is executing against the strong pipeline of projects across the company.
Adjusted net income was $187 million, up 9.4% constant currency and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.51, up 10.9% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth is driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
We generated free cash flow of $14 million, up from a $1 million usage a year ago and we're driving working capital efficiencies within our business. As a reminder, the majority of our free cash flow is generated in the second, third and fourth quarters and we remain on track to deliver our 2016 guidance of approximately $950 million. 
And finally, we continue to deliver on our commitment to drive incremental shareholder value and capital allocation by increasing the quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.31 a share. It's worth noting that our dividend is yielding double since its inception in 2013. Again, a great quarter with solid execution and a strong start to 2016.
Next, I will move to the segments. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $694 million, up 6.3% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 7.5%. 
Audio was up nearly 1% and the business continues to deliver outstanding margins and strong free cash flow. 
Marketing Effectiveness was up 28.8% behind strong results in eXelate and Nielsen Catalina Solutions product offerings. Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth as publishers and content owners seek to amplify the value of their ad inventories and advertisers seek to better identify audiences across all screens and platforms to improve the return on their investments.
Other Watch is about a 2 point strike on Watch revenue reflective the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter. 
Let me say a few words about our key initiatives. Our Total Audience growth initiative is off to a great start. Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 58% behind strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners. We continue to see strong renewals and new wins with clients, such as Videology  [ph] a demand site video ad platform, Crackle [ph], a screening network and Snapchat, along with continued strength with advertisers.
Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, is also off to a great start in 2016. In addition to clients who are evaluating video measurement data, we're making solid progress with text measurement with the most recent addition being Facebook for their Instant Articles content. 
And finally, our subscription video-on-demand product continues to gain attraction as the number of episodes we are now measuring for our clients increased by nearly 1/3 versus the prior quarter. 
Watch adjusted EBITDA was $297 million, up 7.2% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded 38 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage in the business. 
In the quarter, we signed a deal with DISH to integrate set-top box data in our ratings. The acquisition of this rich dataset is included in our annual guidance and our teams are executing on our product line. In addition to helping us strengthen our product over time, set-top box data will give us significant productivity benefits and operating and capital expense by enabling us to reduce the size and frequency of future panel expansion.
Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy and Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth.
Turning to Buy. Our business had a solid first quarter. First quarter totaled Buy revenues was $793 million, up 4.3% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $550 million, up 2% on a constant currency basis and our business in the emerging markets was $243 million, up 10% on a constant currency basis. 
Our teams are continuing to execute in line with the guidance we gave for 2016. 
In the developed markets, our core measurement business was solid in our 2 largest markets, the U.S. and Western Europe. We also saw broad-based growth in the emerging markets with double-digit growth in Latin America, China and Southeast Asia, along with mid- to high single digits in Eastern Europe and Africa. Overall, discretionary spend remains stable with relevant strength in areas like innovation.
Buy EBITDA was $114 million, up 7.5% constant currency. Our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins were up 43 basis points in the quarter. This is the seventh straight quarter of Buy margin expansion and we expect Buy to be a strong contributor to our margins in 2016, as emerging markets continue to scale and we execute on the productivity pipeline that I referenced earlier. Overall, we had a quarter in Buy with solid revenue growth and margin expansion on a constant currency basis.
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. 
In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 320 basis points drag on revenue and 140 basis points drag on EBITDA, which were both in the ballpark of what we laid out on our last earnings call. If yesterday's spots rates held constant in 2016, then we expect 120 basis point drag on revenue and a 50 basis point drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is slightly better than the forecast we gave last quarter.
Moving to 2016 guidance, we are maintaining our annual guidance. We remain confident in our plan to deliver on all of the operational elements that we laid out on our fourth quarter call, highlighted by revenue growth of 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis, adjusted net income per share of $2.83 to $2.93 per share and free cash flow of roughly $950 million.
So to wrap up, the year is off to a great start and coming out of the first quarter we had a lot of confidence and momentum in both of our segments. In addition, we are committed to an efficient and balanced capital structure and we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I will turn it back to Kate."

I'm glad I asked because I was assuming it was something else. We do have maybe 2 different dimensions coverage. One is measurement coverage, so in the developed markets, that's not exclusively, but it is largely about e-commerce, adding e-commerce into the sales that we cover in our core measurement service right now. And then other markets around the world, it might be more about geographic coverage or covering the marketplace with increasing granularity giving regional or even city-level views and some of the faster-growing emerging markets around the world. And this is what we've been investing as a company for a number of years in emerging markets and then more recently, our focus has now turned to e-commerce coverage for our retail sales measurement service in the developed markets around the world. That's one division. The second dimension that I think you are also touching on as how our range of services, both measurement and our analytics capabilities cover the range of business questions that our clients have, and that's where we're really putting together focus on putting together this system-based platform-oriented approach that we talked about most recently in a very in-depth way at our Analyst Day last December. I mentioned briefly it at the end of the my prepared comments, and that's why I referenced the Kellogg's signed on to be one of our early adopters to partner with this as we build out this system. And what this is about this taking our core measurement service and our key analytics capabilities, the ones that are focused on the most common and most important business questions our clients have, each of these are valuable on individual basis right now. But they'll be even more valuable as we can connect them together so that they function as an operating system, if you will, to support our clients' marketing and sales and innovation processes in their business. When our services connect together on a technology platform and support one another and then that connects the market with our client uses them, then that's going to be very powerful. Now to your question about where we are, milestones and timing, we're still in the earlier stages of putting that the system together and that work will continue throughout this year and will be supported by the partnership with Kellogg's and other clients who I'm sure will want to get on board as well, as we build that out. Milestones that you're going to see are -- just it'll be very smart to what we talked about on the Watch side of the business with Total Audience Measurement. They'll be a steady growth in client adoption, clients adapting their key individual parts and then gradually over time you see them in adopt the comprehensive system as well. And we'll be sure to update you on future earnings calls about how that's progressing. We don't have a whole lot more to say about it at this stage because we're still in the really relatively early stages of that. As far as growth potential or where really is going to come down to is what I commented on in my prepared comments, measurement is important on its own, analytics are incredibly important available on their own, connecting these 2 things together is where the incremental value delivery opportunity and growth opportunity comes for our business, and that's what we're focused on and pursuing."

Right now, when you hear people refer to Nielsen or ratings, they are generally, in most cases, referring to the current definition of the currency, so C3 or C7, which is capturing an important part of total viewing, but, of course, many parts are left out of the current definition of the currency. The Total Audience system is all designed to capture all of that viewing. All important viewing across all screens and platforms that are out there. Right now there's a disconnect between what Total Audience measures and what the current definition of the currency that the market trades on captures. And so yes, either you're going to see people starts to talk about Total Audience exactly as you say or I think just as likely, more likely, perhaps, is that the definition of the currency will be revised and expanded, to include more of the viewing that's happening on these other platforms, in these other viewing environments that our Total Audience Measurement system was designed to capture. And so that's the tension the very positive and productive tension I think that is now growing and emerging in the marketplace, that's why discussions with a broad range of industry players to talk about redefining and updating the definition of the currency and we're happy to say that the those conversations have progressed well and gotten a lot more a specific about what the options are for a new definition of the currency."

And one thing important to know is what's powering many of those in-house selling tools and a lot of those proprietary analytics that you're hearing about is Nielsen data and Nielsen analytics. And in fact, it's one of the reason why our Marketing Effectiveness business saw such good growth in the first quarter of this year, almost 30%. So look, this is just the time of year. I think important to think about when we see these metrics coming from the big media companies is to also to think about it from the buyer side. So buyer sees those proprietary metrics and, of course, they're interested in them but they also want a broad view of the market, they want comparable metrics that enable them to compare across all of the places where they can invest their money. And those GAAP to the metrics from the individual media companies that don't satisfy that need that the buyers have either side of the table. Nielsen obviously support that. It's an essential role that we play in the marketplace that their broad view and independence in the picture, meanwhile a lot of these other analytics still can be very help helpful as additional use of the marketplace to provide supplementary guarantees, supplementary understanding of how to find value as you seek audiences if you're an advertiser."

We guided 1.5% to 3.5% for the year, so the performance is in line with the guidance. I think we saw a couple of things. One, the U.S. and Europe, which represents roughly 85% of our developed markets had a very good quarter in terms of our core measurement business, both in the low single digits. Western Europe is actually strengthening. We saw strong results behind new clients and innovation. So core measurement, up low singles and the discretionary environment, Europe was actually a discretionary environment was actually in the mid-singles. From a U.S. standpoint, the core measurement is strong, and that's why we saw some of the increase in discretionary spend in the fourth quarter behind some historical datasets that we sold. So that cooled down a little bit and remember, discretionary spend can be a lumpy after a big quarter. So overall, 2% growth that's in line with our guidance and we feel pretty good about our 2 largest markets performing very well through the balance of the year."

Look, this is largely activation for our clients. We have lots of great data, we have lots of great analytics. Sometime analytics are about helping our clients to learn, to plan, to think about strategy. But in many cases, the analytics are really about action, activation, they want to use it to more precisely target the audiences in the marketplace that they're aiming at for their brands -- for their brand's growth, whether that's through advertising or elements of the marketing mix. That's our cloud is designed to do and what difference is our way out from some of the other cloud capabilities out there in the marketplaces our access to the essential core data. We start with the core data, whereas other cloud providers maybe have great technology, but they have to go find the data. So that's our point of differentiation. The way our commercial teams are approaching this going forward is we're not going to take proprietary approach were everything ahs to go through our cloud. We're going to have our cloud out there, it'll have its strengths and that clients who want to work with us on our cloud-based capabilities for activation, we're going to work with them and we'll be very happy to do it. But in other cases a client might choose to use some other providers' cloud, and we're going to collaborate very productively with those other cloud-based providers because we know the value of our data. And they'll be very important to those other cloud-based providers to have access to the essential core data that Nielsen brings to the table. So we're going to work through both models. All value ultimately comes back to our data, which is our historical strength and our most important point of leverage in the marketplace."

With our Audience Measurement of Video and Text up 7.5% in the quarter, one of the reasons is our clients continue to invest in our capabilities because they see what Total Audience is able to do and they see how it fits with where there business needs to go. That's why our contract renewals with our big media clients are good, that's why our analytics capabilities in our Marketing Effectiveness business why that the business continues to grow so well. And so for our big media clients, that's the way we monetize this capability. We also have, though, the digital first clients out there. More of the revenue that the Total Audience attracts more of that incremental to our business, but it's a smaller component of our total revenue picture. And while it certainly contributes to our growth and will continue to do so, it's not the more important of the 2.

The preferred provider designation is Walmart elevating us from what they referred to as primary provider in the path to status preferred provider. And what it is, is a signal to the marketplace that if you're going to come and if you're a supplier Walmart come to Walmart and you want to make your pitch, they want to use Nielsen's data, Nielsen's hierarchy. They want a common hierarchy, a common view of the world for the providers, the suppliers that come to Walmart, Walmart, operate more efficiently, less variation in all the different views that they have to interpret as they pitch to buy their suppliers. And so what that means. It doesn't mean that supplier can't use data from another measurement provider by Walmart's signaled their clear preference for how our suppliers should pitch to them. The other things that this deal expands on, it increases the analytics work that we do for Walmart. We already doing some analytics with them. They like that. They've seen it as being available. And so basically, what this contract renewal does is it makes that were continuous with them as opposed to more project-oriented. And it's a real strong validation the value that they've seen from, whether it's the pricing analytics or the assortment optimization analytics, all the different things, including our marketing mix capabilities because, of course, Walmart is a big advertiser. And so our marketing mix capability helped them to get more ROI out of the money that they spend to promote their brand. This other element that I mentioned, too, which is we're now for the first time in able due to provide Walmart's suppliers with store level market share, that's a key thing, too. So you go into your town if you have a Walmart where they're you live come there's a Walmart there, there's a trading area that's a defined around that individual store, so suppliers always knew what their sales were in that store, but they didn't necessarily know what their market share was in that trading area around that Walmart store. So we're now able to provide that kind of perspective and that is really important to both Walmart and to Walmart's suppliers, the manufacturers that we're also working with. Those are the key components. And then, as far as how it will play beyond Walmart, it's a signal to other retailers in the industry that the biggest retailer in the industry has designated Nielsen as its preferred provider, we're certainly very happy about that we think is quite meaningful and it into other markets around the world where we already work with Walmart, we'll look to leverage some of the components of this relationship with Walmart in the U.S. and many of those other markets where we're already actively engaged with this, the biggest retailer in the world."

So as that happens, there's also another dimension, which is a maturity of marketing in those markets. So if you look backwards, a lot of the growth for our clients is about gaining distribution has the retail environment starts to develop. And as it develops, and especially in the larger cities, then it starts to become more about a market share gain, and that's where a lot of our analytics capable to start to become more important.

Good morning, everyone. 2016 is off to a good start for Nielsen, underpinned by our consistent, resilient business model. Our strong financial results in the first quarter were fueled by our Watch segment's progress with Total Audience",2271,"Yes, thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. 2016 is off to a good start for Nielsen, underpinned by our consistent, resilient business model. Our strong financial results in the first quarter were fueled by our Watch segment's progress with Total Audience Measurement and our Buy segment's continued strength in emerging market and growing momentum with retailers. In both Watch and Buy, our teams are executing well. And there's a lot to look forward to for the rest of the year and beyond. 
What I'd like you to take away from this quarter's call is that we continue to deliver consistent growth and profitability, all while managing through the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve. Our teams do a great job of leveraging change as a means for progress as they continuously renew and improve the services we provide. We're continuing to gain client and industry adoption of our Total Audience Measurement framework, our complementary analytics business continues its strong growth and our global footprint remains a key competitive advantage. It's these factors in particular that give us continued confidence in our business and our strategy going forward.
Looking at the first quarter financials. We had revenue growth of 5.2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA grew 7.2% constant currency, reflecting our scalable business model and our continuous focus on productivity improvements. Adjusted net income per share grew nearly 11% constant currency to $0.51. Our strong business model enables us to consistently invest in our future growth while also returning cash to our shareholders. Today, we're announcing that our board has approved a dividend increase of 11%, increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.31 per share. During the quarter, we also continued to buy back our stock. And at the end of the first quarter, we had almost $800 million remaining under the existing authorization. We remain committed to drive shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy. Lastly, we're reiterating our guidance for 2016. 
At a high level across both of our businesses, Watch and Buy, we do 2 things: we measured performance for our clients and we help them improve their performance. Measurement is the core of our business. It tells our clients what happened. Our analytics help them understand why it happened and what they should do next to improve. Measurement and analytics are 2 separate things. And each is important and valuable on its own. But the connection of measurement with analytics makes them both even more useful and valuable. And our efforts to increase this connection are helping to fuel our growth and they'll continue to do so long into the future. 
In our Watch business, first quarter revenues increased more than 6% on a constant currency basis, including a 7.5% increase in the measurement of video and text. We're seeing significant momentum with our Total Audience Measurement system, where our focus is on driving client adoption. We also continue to expand and enhance our offerings to meet the full range of our clients' needs. A great example of this is our recently announced agreement with DISH Network to improve their set-top box data as part of our industry standard TV ratings service. 
Integrating DISH's data with our panel data fits perfectly with our hybrid approach, panels plus big data, providing both the quality and granularity our clients need. This will both bolster our core measurement service and help fuel our analytics capabilities. And initial feedback from our clients has, of course, been positive. 
Looking at Digital Ad Ratings. Some of you have asked for an update on client adoption. We continue to make progress with publishers and advertisers alike. In March, we added Snapchat to our growing roster of leading digital publishers that already includes Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pandora. On the advertiser side, we recently were selected by Unilever in China. And in July, Procter & Gamble will be coming onboard in the United States. We also are continuing to expand Digital Ad Ratings internationally. In 2016, we're adding 8 new markets, many of which are mobile-first markets. And that will bring the country total to 25. In China, Sina Weibo, a widely used social media site, has come onboard as a data partner, joining Tencent, who we began working with last year. Also in March, we acquired Informate, a leading mobile measurement provider in emerging markets, to support our ongoing international expansion efforts.
On Digital Content Ratings, we have a wide range of clients spanning big media and digital natives evaluating their audiences for video- and text-based content as well as a robust pipeline of clients who are actively integrating the SDK. For participating clients, we remain on track for syndication later this quarter. Syndicated reporting will continue to roll out for additional clients as they go through the onboarding process throughout the year. Meanwhile, we'll also be sharing data with our agency clients, so they can increase their familiarity with the data. So very good progress overall. Last week, Facebook announced at their F8 conference that they're opening up their Instant Articles program to all publishers around the world. The program has been a tremendous success for them as they seek to provide a better reading experience for their users and help publishers reach their audiences. We're mentioning this because those audiences will be measured by Nielsen's Digital Content Ratings. So this is a great example of the growing client adoption that we're seeing.
Next, let's move to Total Content Ratings. We now have about 140 networks for whom we're reporting time-shifted viewing through day 35, enabling these clients to see the incremental contribution to their Total Audience. Additionally, we have 55 networks enabled for our measurement of video-on-demand, including subscription video-on-demand through our Total Content Ratings reporting. Overall, we're now covering over 8,000 different program episodes, up from about 6,000 last quarter. We also enhanced our coverage of TV connected devices, such as Apple TV, Roku, Chromecast and Amazon Fire. This data is flowing through our reporting of Total Content Ratings today, helping our clients to understand how viewing compares across the different brands of connected devices. 
Regarding the effort to update the definition of the currency. In March, we had another productive meeting with key industry stakeholders as we continue to move towards the new expanded definition of currency for the marketplace. These discussions continue to progress well. And they're getting much more specific about how the elements of our Total Audience Measurement system will be used in the new definition of the currency. 
In advance of this year's upfronts and NewFronts, our clients are actively engaging and evaluating our data from Digital Content Ratings and Total Content Ratings. We're helping them understand that comparable metrics and the impact to their business. It's crucial for us to work with our clients through this process. And we'll continue to support them both in the broad client forms as well as in individual meetings. It's exciting really to see how these the new metrics help our clients understand and leverage the changing ways that audiences are consuming content. Their use of these new metrics will continue to grow throughout the year, leading to a more central role and even greater impact in next year's NewFronts and upfronts. 
One final component of Total Audience Measurement, we also recently announced Nielsen Digital Audio Ratings, which measures radio listening via mobile apps and Web players. Our ratings now capture broadcast radio's total reach. This also leads the groundwork for us to measure other audio platforms, where people listen to music, news, talk, sports and syndicated programs. Radio continues to have incredible reach with 93% of all adults listening to the radio each week, making it an important, productive part of a brand's multimedia plan. 
Let's turn to Marketing Effectiveness. We had revenue growth of nearly 30% in the quarter. And this is largely where our Watch-related analytics fall. And over the past several years, we've made significant investments in this space. As a result, we now produce the industry's most comprehensive suite of analytic solutions across the broadest set of categories. In addition, Nielsen data also helps power many of our clients' own in-house selling and buying tools that you tend to hear more about around the time of the upfronts. The role of analytics for assessing audience segmentation and advertising ROI as well as fueling activation will only continue to grow. We feel great about our position in this part of the market. Recently, we strengthened that position through acquisitions like eXelate in 2015 and Pointlogic in March of this year. 
Even prior to our acquisition of Pointlogic, we worked with them to develop our Nielsen Media Impact service, which is a software solution for cross-media planning. And it's connected to our Total Audience Measurement system. Media Impact, along with other products from Pointlogic, enables agencies, media owners and advertisers to better plan, activate and optimize the value of their media investments. So you can see how this Pointlogic acquisition supports both our core measurement and our analytic services for our clients. 
Now a moment ago, I mentioned our eXelate acquisition. And just last week, we announced the official launch of the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, formerly known as the Enterprise Marketing Platform. Look, we know how much you guys love it when we change the name of one of our services. So there you go, that's this quarter. Well, this Nielsen Marketing Cloud, it, in fact, heavily leverages our eXelate acquisition. It integrates Nielsen's data management, analytics, media planning and activation applications all on a single platform to help brands reach consumers more efficiently and precisely and to help media companies sell more effectively. We recognize we're not the only one out there with a marketing cloud capability. But what sets ours apart is our access to the essential core data. That's the key reason why we're seeing strong initial momentum, having already signed deals with over a dozen top, fast-moving consumer goods, pharma, spirits and media companies in Q1.
Separately, we also recently announced a partnership with Time Warner, leveraging Nielsen's neuroscience and biometrics tools in their Medialab to help them understand and leverage the changing ways audiences engage with the content and advertising. We have a similar long-running partnership with CBS and their Television City facility. So again, while measurement has always been and will continue to be the core of our business, we're also a significant player in the analytic space. And our ability to connect measurement with analytics increases the value of each and will continue to drive growth for our business.
Let's turn to Buy. In Buy segment, revenues increased 4.3% on a constant currency basis and emerging markets were again the significant growth driver in the quarter with revenues up 10%. These markets experienced volatility from time to time, but with it also comes tremendous growth opportunities. And with our unmatched global footprint, supported by the investments we made in coverage for these markets over the past several years, we love our position. This quarter, our teams once again executed well and we saw solid growth with multinational and local clients as they invested in both measurement and analytics. 
In developed markets, revenues grew 2% with our core measurement business remaining rock-solid. We saw growth shoots in Europe for the second quarter in a row, which is encouraging and also a huge testament to the efforts of our teams and their solid execution. One of the keys in Europe, in fact, one of the keys to our growth globally is our progress with our retailer clients. We've had good traction tapping into this opportunity with our growth-driven buyer analytics capabilities as well as core measurement wins and renewals. And on that front, last week, we reached a new agreement with Walmart. It's a multiyear renewal of our relationship and it elevates Nielsen to the status of preferred provider for Walmart's data. It also expands the range of our analytics work with Walmart and it includes the deployment of our latest technology solutions. Finally, the new agreement also grants Nielsen the ability to provide Walmart's store-level market share to manufacturers beginning in July of 2016.
Moving on to coverage. In parallel with our Watch business' focus on Total Audience Measurement, our Buy business is focused on Total Consumer measurement across all channels, including e-commerce. In February, we announced some significant enhancements to our e-commerce measurement capability in the U.S., following the proven formula that combines our high-quality panels with big data. This combination enables us to provide our manufacturer clients with both broad and granular coverage of their e-commerce sales, including on the largest platforms. Client reaction has been very positive. Also a recently announced partnership with Profitero further expands on our e-commerce capabilities.
Lastly, we're making excellent progress in our effort to build a platform-based system that aligns and connects our Buy business' wide variety of measurement and analytics data to drive increased value for our clients. We're thrilled to announce that Kellogg's has signed up to be one of the early adopters, partnering with us as we build out this connected system for our fast-moving consumer goods clients. 
So as you can see, our teams have been busy embracing the market's changes and leveraging them as a means for progress as they execute on our strategy. That's the key to our ability to deliver consistent revenue and profit growth, driving returns for our shareholders. We feel great about the quarter and we feel great about the year ahead. And we look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our next call. Over to you, Jamere."

We had another great quarter, and I am pleased with the execution and efforts of our teams around the world. The year is off to a strong start and our results are indicative of the consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model, which continues to deliver solid results through the cycles. 
First, let me cover our total company results for the first quarter. Revenue was just under $1.5 billion, up 5.2% constant currency. We have delivered 39 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth, driven by strength in our core business and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 6.3% on a constant currency basis with great momentum in our Total Audience execution and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew 4.3% constant currency, led by continued strength in the emerging markets and new client wins. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $402 million, up 7.2% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 27%, up 49 basis points on a constant currency basis with margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments. We continue to run the productivity play with intensity and our operations team, led by John Tavolieri, is executing against the strong pipeline of projects across the company. Adjusted net income was $187 million, up 9.4% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.51, up 10.9% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth is driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
We generated free cash flow of $14 million, up from a $1 million usage a year ago, and we're driving working capital efficiencies within our business. As a reminder, the majority of our free cash flow is generated in the second, third and fourth quarters and we remain on track to deliver our 2016 guidance of approximately $950 million. And finally, we continue to deliver on our commitment to drive incremental shareholder value through capital allocation by increasing the quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.31 a share. It's worth noting that our dividend has nearly doubled since its inception in 2013. Again, a great quarter with solid execution and a strong start to 2016.
Next, I will move to the segments. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $694 million, up 6.3% in constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 7.5%. Audio was up nearly 1% and the business continues to deliver outstanding margins and strong free cash flow. Marketing Effectiveness was up 28.8% behind strong results in the eXelate and Nielsen Catalina Solutions product offerings. Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth as publishers and content owners seek to amplify the value of their ad inventories and advertisers seek to better identify audiences across all screens and platforms to improve the return on their investments. Other Watch is about a 2 point strike on Watch revenue, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter. 
Let me say a few words about our key initiatives. Our Total Audience growth initiative is off to a great start. Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 58% behind strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners. We continue to see strong renewals and new wins with clients such as Videology, a demand-side video ad platform; Crackle, a screen and TV network; and Snapchat, along with continued strength with top advertisers. Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, is also off to a great start in 2016. In addition to clients who are evaluating video measurement data, we're making solid progress with text measurement with the most recent addition being Facebook for their Instant Articles content. And finally, our subscription video-on-demand product continues to gain attraction as the number of episodes we are now measuring for our clients increased by nearly 1/3 versus the prior quarter. 
Watch adjusted EBITDA was $297 million, up 7.2% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded 38 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage in the business. In the quarter, we signed a deal with DISH to integrate set-top box data into our ratings. The acquisition of this rich dataset is included in our annual guidance and our teams are executing on our product plan. In addition to helping us strengthen our products over time, set-top box data will give us significant productivity benefits and operating and capital expense by enabling us to reduce the size and frequency of future panel expansions. Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy and Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth.
Turning to Buy. Our business had a solid first quarter. First quarter total Buy revenue was $793 million, up 4.3% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $550 million, up 2% on a constant currency basis, and our business in the emerging markets was $243 million, up 10% on a constant currency basis. Our teams are continuing to execute in line with the guidance framework we gave for 2016. In the developed markets, our core measurement business was solid in our 2 largest markets, the U.S. and Western Europe. We also saw broad-based growth in the emerging markets with double-digit growth in Latin America, China and Southeast Asia, along with mid- to high single digits in Eastern Europe and Africa. Overall, discretionary spend remains stable with relevant strength in areas like innovation.
Buy EBITDA was $114 million, up 7.5% constant currency. Our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins were up 43 basis points in the quarter. This is the seventh straight quarter of Buy margin expansion. And we expect Buy to be a strong contributor to our margins in 2016 as emerging markets continue to scale and we execute on the productivity pipeline that I referenced earlier. Overall, we had a good quarter in Buy with solid revenue growth and margin expansion on a constant currency basis.
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 320 basis points drag on revenue and 140 basis points drag on EBITDA, which were both in the ballpark of what we laid out on our last earnings call. If yesterday's spot rates held constant through 2016, then we expect 120 basis points drag on revenue and a 50 basis point drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is slightly better than the forecast we gave last quarter.
Moving to 2016 guidance. We are maintaining our annual guidance. We remain confident in our plan to deliver on all of the operational elements that we laid out on our fourth quarter call, highlighted by revenue growth of 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis, adjusted net income per share of $2.83 to $2.93 per share and free cash flow of roughly $950 million.
So to wrap up, the year is off to a great start. And coming out of the first quarter, we have a lot of confidence and momentum in both of our segments. In addition, we are committed to an efficient and balanced capital structure and we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I will turn it back to Kate."

I'm glad I asked because I was assuming it was something else. We do have maybe 2 different dimensions to coverage. One is measurement coverage.

We do have maybe 2 different dimensions to coverage. One is measurement coverage. So in the developed markets, that is not exclusively, but it is largely about e-commerce, adding e-commerce into the sales that we cover in our core measurement service right now. And then other markets around the world, it might be more about geographic coverage or covering the marketplace with increasing granularity, giving regional or even city-level views in some of the faster-growing emerging markets around the world. And this is what we've been investing in as a company for a number of years, in emerging markets. And then more recently, our focus has now turned to e-commerce coverage for our retail sales measurement service in the developed markets around the world. That's one dimension. The second dimension that I think you're also touching on is how our range of services, both measurement and our analytics capabilities, cover the range of business questions that our clients have. And that's where we're really putting together -- focused on putting together this system-based, platform-oriented approach that we talked about most recently in a very in-depth way at our Analyst Day this past December. I mentioned it briefly at the end of the my prepared comments. And that's where I referenced that Kellogg's has signed on to be one of our early adopters to partner with this as we build out this system. And what this is about is taking our core measurement service and our key analytics capabilities, the ones that are focused on the most common and most important business questions our clients have, each of these are valuable on individual basis right now. But they'll be even more valuable as we connect them together so that they function as an operating system, if you will, to support our clients' marketing and sales and innovation processes in their business. When our services connect together on a technology platform and support one another, and then that system connects directly with our clients' system, then that's going to be very powerful. Now to your question about where we are, milestones and timing, we're still in the earlier stages of putting that system together. And that work will continue throughout this year and will be supported by the partnership with Kellogg's and other clients who I'm sure will want to get onboard as well as we build that out. Milestones that you're going to see are just -- it'll be very similar to what we talked about on the Watch side of the business with Total Audience Measurement. There will be a steady growth in client adoption, clients adopting the key individual parts, and then gradually over time you'll see them adopt the comprehensive system as well. And we'll be sure to update you on future earnings calls about how that's progressing. We don't have a whole lot more to say about it at this stage because we're still in the really relatively early stages of that. As far as growth potential or where it really is going to come down to is what I commented on in my prepared comments, measurement is important on its own, analytics are incredibly important and valuable on their own. Connecting these 2 things together is where the incremental value delivery opportunity and growth opportunity comes for our business. And that's what we're focused on and pursuing."

I think that's exactly where we would expect the industry to go. Right now, when you hear people refer to Nielsen or ratings, they are generally, in most cases, referring to the current definition of the currency, so C3 or C7, which is capturing an important part of total viewing, but of course, many parts are left out of the current definition of the currency. The Total Audience system is all designed to capture all of that viewing, all important viewing across all screens and platforms that are out there. Right now, there's a disconnect between what Total Audience measures and what the current definition of the currency that the market trades on captures. And so yes, either you're going to see people start to talk about Total Audience exactly as you say or I think just as likely, more likely perhaps, is that definition of the currency will be revised and expanded to include more of the viewing that's happening on these other platforms, in these other viewing environments that our Total Audience Measurement system was designed to capture. And so that's the tension, the very positive and productive tension, I think, that is now growing and emerging in the marketplace. That's why we have convened these discussions with a broad range of industry players to talk about redefining and updating the definition of the currency.

As I said, the set-top box data integration is actually included in our guidance for earnings and free cash flow. And over time, we're confident that we're able to acquire the data and build the products within our existing long-term financial framework because we have a ton of experience already working with set-top box data. And as I mentioned, on the plus side, set-top box integration is going to enable us to gain OpEx and CapEx efficiencies by reducing the size and frequencies of panel expansions over time. You've got to remember that panels are very expensive. And so we expect those productivity benefits to be plowed back into our business to either help us improve the profitability of our business and/or reinvest that into new products over time. In terms of the timeframe of DISH being integrated, the teams are already working on the product plans. We won't be [indiscernible] certain about that integration. But the good news is that we have a lot of experience there. And I would expect that by the end of the year, we will have sort of the first generation of that in the marketplace for clients to start to take a look at."

It wouldn't be appropriate for me to go further than that and share the specific details. I want to get out in front of our clients on that. So I'm going to stop there as far as that goes. Your point about critiques in the marketplace is a good one. And interesting is, look, everybody, Nielsen included, wishes all of this were in the marketplace a year ago, if not even sooner than that. So that's one critique. And another critique is that as some of these elements of the Total Audience Measurement systems have rolled out, we also get the opposite, which is too fast. We need more time to understand the data and the impact on my business. And so we work closely with our clients on that to support them as they grow in their familiarity, understand the impact to their business. And as we've done throughout this process, we calibrate the timing of the next step of the rollout based on that client feedback. So look, the good news is the product is in great shape. We are continuing in our confidence that this system fits perfectly with what the market needs. And so we're going to continue to execute on our plan and build client adoption and work closely with the industry as each of these steps unfolds in the marketplace."

Around the upfronts, this happens every year, where a lot of the big media companies will come out with some of their own in-house selling tools, some of their own in-house analytics. And it's smart. They're looking to differentiate themselves from the pack. And that's what good sellers do. So that's really what we're seeing right now. And one thing that's important to know is what's powering many of those in-house selling tools and a lot of those proprietary analytics that you're hearing about is Nielsen data and Nielsen analytics. And in fact, it's one of the reason why our Marketing Effectiveness business saw such good growth in the first quarter of this year, up almost 30%. So look, this is just the time of year. I think the important thing to think about when we see these metrics coming from the big media companies is to also think about it from the buyer side. So a buyer sees those proprietary metrics, and of course, they're interested in them, but they also want a broad view of the market. They want comparable metrics that enable them to compare across all of the places where they can invest their money. And those captive metrics from the individual media companies don't satisfy that need that the buyers have on their side of the table. Nielsen obviously supports that and it's an essential role that we play in the marketplace that their broad view independence in the picture. Meanwhile, a lot of these other analytics still can be very helpful as additional views of the marketplace to provide supplementary guarantees, supplementary understanding of how to find value as you seek audiences if you're an advertiser."

It's not about IP addresses or about devices, it's not about the size of your dataset, it's really quality and it's access to persons-level data.

And the discretionary environment in Europe is actually improving. The discretionary environment was actually in the mid-singles. From a U.S. standpoint, the core measurement is strong.

That's what our cloud is designed to do. And what differentiates our cloud from some of the other cloud capabilities out there in the marketplace is our access to the essential core data. We start with the core data whereas other cloud providers maybe have great technology, but they have to go find the data. So that's our point of differentiation.

We're going to have our cloud out there. It will have its strengths. And clients who want to work with us on our cloud-based capabilities for activation, we're going to work with them and we'll be very happy to do it.

Yes, happy to talk a little bit more about this. The preferred provider designation is Walmart elevating us from what they refer to as a primary provider in the past to status preferred provider. And what it is, is a signal to the marketplace",500,"Thanks, Dan. Yes, happy to talk a little bit more about this. The preferred provider designation is Walmart elevating us from what they refer to as a primary provider in the past to status preferred provider. And what it is, is a signal to the marketplace that if you're going to come and if you're a supplier to Walmart and you're come to Walmart and you want to make your pitch, they want you to use Nielsen's data, Nielsen's hierarchy. They want a common hierarchy, a common view of the world for the providers, the suppliers as they come to Walmart. That helps Walmart obviously operate more efficiently, less variation in all the different views that they have to interpret as they're pitched to buy their suppliers. And so that's what that means. It doesn't mean that a supplier can't use data from another measurement provider, but Walmart signaled their clear preference for how a supplier should pitch to them. The other thing that this deal expands on, it increases the analytics work that we do for Walmart. We already were doing some analytics with them. They like that. They've seen it as being valuable. And so basically, what this contract renewal does is it makes that work continuous with them as opposed to more project-oriented. And it's a real strong validation of the value that they've seen from the -- whether it's the pricing analytics or the assortment optimization analytics, all the different things, including our marketing mix capabilities because, of course, Walmart is a big advertiser. And so our marketing mix capabilities help them to get more ROI out of the money that they spend to promote their brand. This other element that I mentioned, too, which is we're now for the first time enabled to provide Walmart's suppliers with store-level market share. That's a key thing, too. So if you go around into your town, if you have a Walmart where you live, there's a Walmart there, there's a trading area that's defined around that individual store. So suppliers always knew what their sales were in that store, but they didn't necessarily know what their market share was in that trading area around that Walmart store. So we're now able to provide that kind of perspective. And that is really important to both Walmart and to Walmart's suppliers, the manufacturers that we're also working with. Those are the key components. And then as far as how it will play beyond Walmart, well, it's a signal to the other retailers in the industry that the biggest retailer in the industry has designated Nielsen as its preferred provider. We're certainly very happy about that. We think that's quite meaningful. And then in the other markets around the world where we already work with Walmart, we look to leverage some of the components of this relationship with Walmart in the U.S. in many of those other markets where we're already actively engaged with this, the biggest retailer in the world."

One is to sort of catch up to the rapid pace of change in these markets, which we have done very successfully in the last several years. And then the other opportunity is created around keeping up with that ongoing pace of change. And that's going to continue in a lot of these markets. So as that happens, there's also another dimension, which is the maturity of marketing in those markets. So if you look backwards, a lot of the growth for our clients is about gaining distribution as the retail environment starts to develop. And as it develops, and especially in the larger cities, then it starts to become more about a market share gain. And that's where a lot of our analytics capabilities start to become more important. So we're still underpenetrated on that front in almost all of the most important emerging markets around the world, and so we still -- when we look out into the future, we still see very good growth opportunity and we continue with this, yes, 8% to 10% range, not only for this year but as far as we can see into the future."

Good morning, everyone. 2016 is off to a good start for Nielsen, underpinned by our consistent, resilient business model. Our strong financial results in the first quarter were fueled by our Watch segment's progress with Total Audience",2271,"Yes, thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. 2016 is off to a good start for Nielsen, underpinned by our consistent, resilient business model. Our strong financial results in the first quarter were fueled by our Watch segment's progress with Total Audience Measurement and our Buy segment's continued strength in emerging markets and growing momentum with retailers. In both Watch and Buy, our teams are executing well. And there's a lot to look forward to for the rest of the year and beyond. 
What I'd like you to take away from this quarter's call is that we continue to deliver consistent growth and profitability, all while managing through the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve. Our teams do a great job of leveraging change as a means for progress as they continuously renew and improve the services we provide. We're continuing to gain client and industry adoption of our Total Audience Measurement framework, our complementary analytics business continues its strong growth and our global footprint remains a key competitive advantage. It's these factors in particular that give us continued confidence in our business and our strategy going forward.
Looking at the first quarter financials. We had revenue growth of 5.2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA grew 7.2% constant currency, reflecting our scalable business model and our continuous focus on productivity improvements. Adjusted net income per share grew nearly 11% constant currency to $0.51. Our strong business model enables us to consistently invest in our future growth while also returning cash to our shareholders. Today, we're announcing that our board has approved a dividend increase of 11%, increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.31 per share. During the quarter, we also continued to buy back our stock. And at the end of the first quarter, we had almost $800 million remaining under the existing authorization. We remain committed to drive shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy. Lastly, we're reiterating our guidance for 2016. 
At a high level across both of our businesses, Watch and Buy, we do 2 things: we measure performance for our clients and we help them improve their performance. Measurement is the core of our business. It tells our clients what happened. Our analytics help them understand why it happened and what they should do next to improve. Measurement and analytics are 2 separate things. And each is important and valuable on its own. But the connection of measurement with analytics makes them both even more useful and valuable. And our efforts to increase this connection are helping to fuel our growth and they'll continue to do so long into the future. 
In our Watch business, first quarter revenues increased more than 6% on a constant currency basis, including a 7.5% increase in the measurement of video and text. We're seeing significant momentum with our Total Audience Measurement system, where our focus is on driving client adoption. We also continue to expand and enhance our offerings to meet the full range of our clients' needs. A great example of this is our recently announced agreement with DISH Network to improve their set-top box data as part of our industry standard TV ratings service. 
Integrating DISH's data with our panel data fits perfectly with our hybrid approach, panels plus big data, providing both the quality and granularity our clients need. This will both bolster our core measurement service and help fuel our analytics capabilities. And initial feedback from our clients has, of course, been positive. 
Looking at Digital Ad Ratings. Some of you have asked for an update on client adoption. We continue to make progress with publishers and advertisers alike. In March, we added Snapchat to our growing roster of leading digital publishers that already includes Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pandora. On the advertiser side, we recently were selected by Unilever in China. And in July, Procter & Gamble will be coming onboard in the United States. We also are continuing to expand Digital Ad Ratings internationally. In 2016, we're adding 8 new markets, many of which are mobile-first markets. And that will bring the country total to 25. In China, Sina Weibo, a widely used social media site, has come onboard as a data partner, joining Tencent, who we began working with last year. Also in March, we acquired Informate, a leading mobile measurement provider in emerging markets, to support our ongoing international expansion efforts.
On Digital Content Ratings, we have a wide range of clients spanning big media and digital natives evaluating their audiences for video- and text-based content as well as a robust pipeline of clients who are actively integrating the SDK. For participating clients, we remain on track for syndication later this quarter. Syndicated reporting will continue to roll out for additional clients as they go through the onboarding process throughout the year. Meanwhile, we'll also be sharing data with our agency clients, so they can increase their familiarity with the data. So very good progress overall. Last week, Facebook announced at their F8 conference that they're opening up their Instant Articles program to all publishers around the world. The program has been a tremendous success for them as they seek to provide a better reading experience for their users and help publishers reach their audiences. We're mentioning this because those audiences will be measured by Nielsen's Digital Content Ratings. So this is a great example of the growing client adoption that we're seeing.
Next, let's move to Total Content Ratings. We now have about 140 networks for whom we're reporting time-shifted viewing through day 35, enabling these clients to see the incremental contribution to their Total Audience. Additionally, we have 55 networks enabled for our measurement of video-on-demand, including subscription video-on-demand through our Total Content Ratings reporting. Overall, we're now covering over 8,000 different program episodes, up from about 6,000 last quarter. We also enhanced our coverage of TV connected devices, such as Apple TV, Roku, Chromecast and Amazon Fire. This data is flowing through our reporting of Total Content Ratings today, helping our clients to understand how viewing compares across the different brands of connected devices. 
Regarding the effort to update the definition of the currency. In March, we had another productive meeting with key industry stakeholders as we continue to move towards the new expanded definition of currency for the marketplace. These discussions continue to progress well. And they're getting much more specific about how the elements of our Total Audience Measurement system will be used in the new definition of the currency. 
In advance of this year's upfronts and NewFronts, our clients are actively engaging and evaluating our data from Digital Content Ratings and Total Content Ratings. We're helping them understand that comparable metrics and the impact to their business. It's crucial for us to work with our clients through this process. And we'll continue to support them both in the broad client forums as well as in individual meetings. It's exciting really to see how these the new metrics help our clients understand and leverage the changing ways that audiences are consuming content. Their use of these new metrics will continue to grow throughout the year, leading to a more central role and even greater impact in next year's NewFronts and upfronts. 
One final component of Total Audience Measurement, we also recently announced Nielsen Digital Audio Ratings, which measures radio listening via mobile apps and Web players. Our ratings now capture broadcast radio's total reach. This also leads the groundwork for us to measure other audio platforms, where people listen to music, news, talk, sports and syndicated programs. Radio continues to have incredible reach with 93% of all adults listening to the radio each week, making it an important, productive part of a brand's multimedia plan. 
Let's turn to Marketing Effectiveness. We had revenue growth of nearly 30% in the quarter. And this is largely where our Watch-related analytics fall. And over the past several years, we've made significant investments in this space. As a result, we now produce the industry's most comprehensive suite of analytic solutions across the broadest set of categories. In addition, Nielsen data also helps power many of our clients' own in-house selling and buying tools that you tend to hear more about around the time of the upfronts. The role of analytics for assessing audience segmentation and advertising ROI as well as fueling activation will only continue to grow. We feel great about our position in this part of the market. Recently, we strengthened that position through acquisitions like eXelate in 2015 and Pointlogic in March of this year. 
Even prior to our acquisition of Pointlogic, we worked with them to develop our Nielsen Media Impact service, which is a software solution for cross-media planning. And it's connected to our Total Audience Measurement system. Media Impact, along with other products from Pointlogic, enables agencies, media owners and advertisers to better plan, activate and optimize the value of their media investments. So you can see how this Pointlogic acquisition supports both our core measurement and our analytic services for our clients. 
Now a moment ago, I mentioned our eXelate acquisition. And just last week, we announced the official launch of the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, formerly known as the Enterprise Marketing Platform. Look, we know how much you guys love it when we change the name of one of our services. So there you go, that's this quarter. Well, this Nielsen Marketing Cloud, it, in fact, heavily leverages our eXelate acquisition. It integrates Nielsen's data management, analytics, media planning and activation applications all on a single platform to help brands reach consumers more efficiently and precisely and to help media companies sell more effectively. We recognize we're not the only one out there with a marketing cloud capability. But what sets ours apart is our access to the essential core data. That's the key reason why we're seeing strong initial momentum, having already signed deals with over a dozen top, fast-moving consumer goods, pharma, spirits and media companies in Q1.
Separately, we also recently announced a partnership with Time Warner, leveraging Nielsen's neuroscience and biometrics tools in their Medialab to help them understand and leverage the changing ways audiences engage with the content and advertising. We have a similar long-running partnership with CBS and their Television City facility. So again, while measurement has always been and will continue to be the core of our business, we're also a significant player in the analytic space. And our ability to connect measurement with analytics increases the value of each and will continue to drive growth for our business.
Let's turn to Buy. In Buy segment, revenues increased 4.3% on a constant currency basis and emerging markets were again the significant growth driver in the quarter with revenues up 10%. These markets experienced volatility from time to time, but with it also comes tremendous growth opportunities. And with our unmatched global footprint, supported by the investments we made in coverage for these markets over the past several years, we love our position. This quarter, our teams once again executed well and we saw solid growth with multinational and local clients as they invested in both measurement and analytics. 
In developed markets, revenues grew 2% with our core measurement business remaining rock-solid. We saw growth shoots in Europe for the second quarter in a row, which is encouraging and also a huge testament to the efforts of our teams and their solid execution. One of the keys in Europe, in fact, one of the keys to our growth globally is our progress with our retailer clients. We've had good traction tapping into this opportunity with our growth-driven buyer analytics capabilities as well as core measurement wins and renewals. And on that front, last week, we reached a new agreement with Walmart. It's a multiyear renewal of our relationship and it elevates Nielsen to the status of preferred provider for Walmart's data. It also expands the range of our analytics work with Walmart and it includes the deployment of our latest technology solutions. Finally, the new agreement also grants Nielsen the ability to provide Walmart's store-level market share to manufacturers beginning in July of 2016.
Moving on to coverage. In parallel with our Watch business' focus on Total Audience Measurement, our Buy business is focused on Total Consumer measurement across all channels, including e-commerce. In February, we announced some significant enhancements to our e-commerce measurement capability in the U.S., following the proven formula that combines our high-quality panels with big data. This combination enables us to provide our manufacturer clients with both broad and granular coverage of their e-commerce sales, including on the largest platforms. Client reaction has been very positive. Also a recently announced partnership with Profitero further expands on our e-commerce capabilities.
Lastly, we're making excellent progress in our effort to build a platform-based system that aligns and connects our Buy business' wide variety of measurement and analytics data to drive increased value for our clients. We're thrilled to announce that Kellogg's has signed up to be one of the early adopters, partnering with us as we build out this connected system for our fast-moving consumer goods clients. 
So as you can see, our teams have been busy embracing the market's changes and leveraging them as a means for progress as they execute on our strategy. That's the key to our ability to deliver consistent revenue and profit growth, driving returns for our shareholders. We feel great about the quarter and we feel great about the year ahead. And we look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our next call. Over to you, Jamere."

The year is off to a strong start and our results are indicative of the consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model, which continues to deliver solid results through the cycles. 
First, let me cover our total company results for the first quarter. Revenue was just under $1.5 billion, up 5.2% constant currency. We have delivered 39 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth, driven by strength in our core business and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 6.3% on a constant currency basis with great momentum in our Total Audience execution and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew 4.3% constant currency, led by continued strength in the emerging markets and new client wins. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $402 million, up 7.2% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 27%, up 49 basis points on a constant currency basis with margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments. We continue to run the productivity play with intensity and our operations team, led by John Tavolieri, is executing against the strong pipeline of projects across the company. Adjusted net income was $187 million, up 9.4% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.51, up 10.9% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth is driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
We generated free cash flow of $14 million, up from a $1 million usage a year ago, and we're driving working capital efficiencies within our business. As a reminder, the majority of our free cash flow is generated in the second, third and fourth quarters and we remain on track to deliver our 2016 guidance of approximately $950 million. And finally, we continue to deliver on our commitment to drive incremental shareholder value through capital allocation by increasing the quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.31 a share. It's worth noting that our dividend has nearly doubled since its inception in 2013. Again, a great quarter with solid execution and a strong start to 2016.
Next, I will move to the segments. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $694 million, up 6.3% in constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 7.5%. Audio was up nearly 1% and the business continues to deliver outstanding margins and strong free cash flow. Marketing Effectiveness was up 28.8% behind strong results in the eXelate and Nielsen Catalina Solutions product offerings. Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth as publishers and content owners seek to amplify the value of their ad inventories and advertisers seek to better identify audiences across all screens and platforms to improve the return on their investments. Other Watch is about a 2 point strike on Watch revenue, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter. 
Let me say a few words about our key initiatives. Our Total Audience growth initiative is off to a great start. Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 58% behind strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners. We continue to see strong renewals and new wins with clients such as Videology, a demand-side video ad platform; Crackle, a screen and TV network; and Snapchat, along with continued strength with top advertisers. Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, is also off to a great start in 2016. In addition to clients who are evaluating video measurement data, we're making solid progress with text measurement with the most recent addition being Facebook for their Instant Articles content. And finally, our subscription video-on-demand product continues to gain traction as the number of episodes we are now measuring for our clients increased by nearly 1/3 versus the prior quarter. 
Watch adjusted EBITDA was $297 million, up 7.2% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded 38 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage in the business. In the quarter, we signed a deal with DISH to integrate set-top box data into our ratings. The acquisition of this rich dataset is included in our annual guidance and our teams are executing on our product plan. In addition to helping us strengthen our products over time, set-top box data will give us significant productivity benefits and operating and capital expense by enabling us to reduce the size and frequency of future panel expansions. Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy and Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth.
Turning to Buy. Our business had a solid first quarter. First quarter total Buy revenue was $793 million, up 4.3% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $550 million, up 2% on a constant currency basis, and our business in the emerging markets was $243 million, up 10% on a constant currency basis. Our teams are continuing to execute in line with the guidance framework we gave for 2016. In the developed markets, our core measurement business was solid in our 2 largest markets, the U.S. and Western Europe. We also saw broad-based growth in the emerging markets with double-digit growth in Latin America, China and Southeast Asia, along with mid- to high single digits in Eastern Europe and Africa. Overall, discretionary spend remains stable with relevant strength in areas like innovation.
Buy EBITDA was $114 million, up 7.5% constant currency. Our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins were up 43 basis points in the quarter. This is the seventh straight quarter of Buy margin expansion. And we expect Buy to be a strong contributor to our margins in 2016 as emerging markets continue to scale and we execute on the productivity pipeline that I referenced earlier. Overall, we had a good quarter in Buy with solid revenue growth and margin expansion on a constant currency basis.
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 320 basis points drag on revenue and 140 basis points drag on EBITDA, which were both in the ballpark of what we laid out on our last earnings call. If yesterday's spot rates held constant through 2016, then we expect 120 basis points drag on revenue and a 50 basis point drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is slightly better than the forecast we gave last quarter.
Moving to 2016 guidance. We are maintaining our annual guidance. We remain confident in our plan to deliver on all of the operational elements that we laid out on our fourth quarter call, highlighted by revenue growth of 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis, adjusted net income per share of $2.83 to $2.93 per share and free cash flow of roughly $950 million.
So to wrap up, the year is off to a great start. And coming out of the first quarter, we have a lot of confidence and momentum in both of our segments. In addition, we are committed to an efficient and balanced capital structure and we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I will turn it back to Kate."

We do have maybe 2 different dimensions to coverage. One is measurement coverage. So in the developed markets, that is not exclusively, but it is largely about e-commerce, adding e-commerce into the sales that we cover in our core measurement service right now. And then other markets around the world, it might be more about geographic coverage or covering the marketplace with increasing granularity, giving regional or even city-level views in some of the faster-growing emerging markets around the world. And this is what we've been investing in as a company for a number of years, in emerging markets. And then more recently, our focus has now turned to e-commerce coverage for our retail sales measurement service in the developed markets around the world. That's one dimension. The second dimension that I think you're also touching on is how our range of services, both measurement and our analytics capabilities, cover the range of business questions that our clients have. And that's where we're really putting together -- focused on putting together this system-based, platform-oriented approach that we talked about most recently in a very in-depth way at our Analyst Day this past December. I mentioned it briefly at the end of the my prepared comments. And that's where I referenced that Kellogg's has signed on to be one of our early adopters to partner with this as we build out this system. And what this is about is taking our core measurement service and our key analytics capabilities, the ones that are focused on the most common and most important business questions our clients have, each of these are valuable on individual basis right now. But they'll be even more valuable as we connect them together so that they function as an operating system, if you will, to support our clients' marketing and sales and innovation processes in their business. When our services connect together on a technology platform and support one another, and then that system connects directly with our clients' system, then that's going to be very powerful. Now to your question about where we are, milestones and timing, we're still in the earlier stages of putting that system together. And that work will continue throughout this year and will be supported by the partnership with Kellogg's and other clients who I'm sure will want to get onboard as well as we build that out. Milestones that you're going to see are just -- it'll be very similar to what we talked about on the Watch side of the business with Total Audience Measurement. There will be a steady growth in client adoption, clients adopting the key individual parts, and then gradually over time you'll see them adopt the comprehensive system as well. And we'll be sure to update you on future earnings calls about how that's progressing. We don't have a whole lot more to say about it at this stage because we're still in the really relatively early stages of that. As far as growth potential or where it really is going to come down to is what I commented on in my prepared comments, measurement is important on its own, analytics are incredibly important and valuable on their own. Connecting these 2 things together is where the incremental value delivery opportunity and growth opportunity comes for our business. And that's what we're focused on and pursuing."

I think that's exactly where we would expect the industry to go. Right now, when you hear people refer to Nielsen or ratings, they are generally, in most cases, referring to the current definition of the currency, so C3 or C7, which is capturing an important part of total viewing, but of course, many parts are left out of the current definition of the currency. The Total Audience system is all designed to capture all of that viewing, all important viewing across all screens and platforms that are out there. Right now, there's a disconnect between what Total Audience measures and what the current definition of the currency that the market trades on captures. And so yes, either you're going to see people start to talk about Total Audience exactly as you say or I think just as likely, more likely perhaps, is that definition of the currency will be revised and expanded to include more of the viewing that's happening on these other platforms, in these other viewing environments that our Total Audience Measurement system was designed to capture. And so that's the tension, the very positive and productive tension, I think, that is now growing and emerging in the marketplace. That's why we have convened these discussions with a broad range of industry players to talk about redefining and updating the definition of the currency. And we're happy to say that those conversations have progressed well and gotten a lot more specific about what the options are for a new definition of the currency."

And another critique is that as some of these elements of the Total Audience Measurement systems have rolled out, we also get the opposite, which is too fast. We need more time to understand the data and the impact on my business. And so we work closely with our clients on that to support them as they grow in their familiarity, understand the impact to their business.

And in fact, it's one of the reason why our Marketing Effectiveness business saw such good growth in the first quarter of this year, up almost 30%. So look, this is just the time of year. I think the important thing to think about when we see these metrics coming from the big media companies is to also think about it from the buyer side. So a buyer sees those proprietary metrics, and of course, they're interested in them, but they also want a broad view of the market. They want comparable metrics that enable them to compare across all of the places where they can invest their money. And those captive metrics from the individual media companies don't satisfy that need that the buyers have on their side of the table. Nielsen obviously supports that and it's an essential role that we play in the marketplace that their broad view independence in the picture. Meanwhile, a lot of these other analytics still can be very helpful as additional views of the marketplace to provide supplementary guarantees, supplementary understanding of how to find value as you seek audiences if you're an advertiser."

And that was a combination of eXelate being about 1 point up, NCS getting about 2 points up, and then NRG being about a 170 basis points drag. So 5% organic in Watch and the Buy number of 4.3% was pretty much all organic."

Incredibly important, this idea of deduplicating the reach of ads and of campaigns in the marketplace, as an advertiser, you know reach has got to be your first priority. It's incredibly important. So if you're going to have a measurement system that covers all these different environments, where consumers are consuming content, and then you're going to put them together to represent the Total Audience, being able to deduplicate that reach is really important to the buyers of that advertising inventory. We have the best deduplication methodology out there in the market and the reason for that is our access to persons-level data. And that's really the key. It's not about IP addresses or about devices, it's not about the size of your dataset, it's really quality and it's access to persons-level data. And that really plays to the historical strengths of our measurement system and also the strengths of how our Total Audience Measurement system was designed. And so we can always continue to advance our capabilities on things like this and we will. But we have the best one out there now and when we know how important it is for the marketplace if you're going to deliver a Total Audience view of the world."

Western Europe is actually strengthening. We saw strong results behind new clients and innovation. So core measurement, up low singles. And the discretionary environment in Europe is actually improving. The discretionary environment was actually in the mid-singles. From a U.S. standpoint, the core measurement is strong. And that's where we saw some of the increase in discretionary spend in the fourth quarter behind some historical datasets that we sold. So that cooled down a little bit. And remember, discretionary spending can be a little lumpy after a big quarter. So overall, 2% growth, that's in line with our guidance.

Look, this is largely about activation for our clients. We have lots of great data, we have lots of great analytics.

They want to use it to more precisely target the audiences in the marketplace that they're aiming at for their brand's growth, whether that's through advertising or a few other elements of the marketing mix. That's what our cloud is designed to do. And what differentiates our cloud from some of the other cloud capabilities out there in the marketplace is our access to the essential core data. We start with the core data whereas other cloud providers maybe have great technology, but they have to go find the data. So that's our point of differentiation. The way our commercial teams are approaching this going forward is we're not going to take a proprietary approach where everything has to go through our cloud. We're going to have our cloud out there. It will have its strengths. And clients who want to work with us on our cloud-based capabilities for activation, we're going to work with them and we'll be very happy to do it. But in other cases, a client might choose to use some other providers' cloud and we're going to collaborate very productively with those other cloud-based providers because we know the value of our data. And it will be very important to those other cloud-based providers to have access to the essential core data that Nielsen brings to the table. So we're going to work through both models. All the value ultimately comes back to our data, which is our historical strength and our most important point of leverage in the marketplace."

That's why our contract renewals with our big media clients are good. That's why our analytics capabilities in our Marketing Effectiveness business, why that business continues to grow so well. And so for our big media clients, that's the way we monetize this capability. We also have though the digital-first clients out there. More of that revenue that Total Audience attracts, more of that is incremental to our business. But it's a smaller component of our total revenue picture. And while it certainly contributes to our growth and will continue to do so, it's not the more important of the 2.

The preferred provider designation is Walmart elevating us from what they refer to as a primary provider in the past to status preferred provider. And what it is, is a signal to the marketplace that if you're going to come and if you're a supplier to Walmart and you're come to Walmart and you want to make your pitch, they want you to use Nielsen's data, Nielsen's hierarchy. They want a common hierarchy, a common view of the world for the providers, the suppliers as they come to Walmart. That helps Walmart obviously operate more efficiently, less variation in all the different views that they have to interpret as they're pitched to by their suppliers. And so that's what that means. It doesn't mean that a supplier can't use data from another measurement provider, but Walmart signaled their clear preference for how a supplier should pitch to them. The other thing that this deal expands on, it increases the analytics work that we do for Walmart. We already were doing some analytics with them. They like that. They've seen it as being valuable. And so basically, what this contract renewal does is it makes that work continuous with them as opposed to more project-oriented. And it's a real strong validation of the value that they've seen from the -- whether it's the pricing analytics or the assortment optimization analytics, all the different things, including our marketing mix capabilities because, of course, Walmart is a big advertiser. And so our marketing mix capabilities help them to get more ROI out of the money that they spend to promote their brand. This other element that I mentioned, too, which is we're now for the first time enabled to provide Walmart's suppliers with store-level market share. That's a key thing, too. So if you go around into your town, if you have a Walmart where you live, there's a Walmart there, there's a trading area that's defined around that individual store. So suppliers always knew what their sales were in that store, but they didn't necessarily know what their market share was in that trading area around that Walmart store. So we're now able to provide that kind of perspective. And that is really important to both Walmart and to Walmart's suppliers, the manufacturers that we're also working with. Those are the key components. And then as far as how it will play beyond Walmart, well, it's a signal to the other retailers in the industry that the biggest retailer in the industry has designated Nielsen as its preferred provider. We're certainly very happy about that. We think that's quite meaningful. And then in the other markets around the world where we already work with Walmart, we look to leverage some of the components of this relationship with Walmart in the U.S. in many of those other markets where we're already actively engaged with this, the biggest retailer in the world."

Good morning, everyone. 2016 is off to a good start for Nielsen, underpinned by our consistent, resilient business model. Our strong financial results in the first quarter were fueled by our Watch segment's progress with Total Audience",2271,"Yes, thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. 2016 is off to a good start for Nielsen, underpinned by our consistent, resilient business model. Our strong financial results in the first quarter were fueled by our Watch segment's progress with Total Audience Measurement and our Buy segment's continued strength in emerging markets and growing momentum with retailers. In both Watch and Buy, our teams are executing well. And there's a lot to look forward to for the rest of the year and beyond. 
What I'd like you to take away from this quarter's call is that we continue to deliver consistent growth and profitability, all while managing through the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve. Our teams do a great job of leveraging change as a means for progress as they continuously renew and improve the services we provide. We're continuing to gain client and industry adoption of our Total Audience Measurement framework, our complementary analytics business continues its strong growth and our global footprint remains a key competitive advantage. It's these factors in particular that give us continued confidence in our business and our strategy going forward.
Looking at the first quarter financials. We had revenue growth of 5.2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA grew 7.2% constant currency, reflecting our scalable business model and our continuous focus on productivity improvements. Adjusted net income per share grew nearly 11% constant currency to $0.51. Our strong business model enables us to consistently invest in our future growth while also returning cash to our shareholders. Today, we're announcing that our board has approved a dividend increase of 11%, increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.31 per share. During the quarter, we also continued to buy back our stock. And at the end of the first quarter, we had almost $800 million remaining under the existing authorization. We remain committed to drive shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy. Lastly, we're reiterating our guidance for 2016. 
At a high level across both of our businesses, Watch and Buy, we do 2 things: we measure performance for our clients and we help them improve their performance. Measurement is the core of our business. It tells our clients what happened. Our analytics help them understand why it happened and what they should do next to improve. Measurement and analytics are 2 separate things. And each is important and valuable on its own. But the connection of measurement with analytics makes them both even more useful and valuable. And our efforts to increase this connection are helping to fuel our growth and they'll continue to do so long into the future. 
In our Watch business, first quarter revenues increased more than 6% on a constant currency basis, including a 7.5% increase in the measurement of video and text. We're seeing significant momentum with our Total Audience Measurement system, where our focus is on driving client adoption. We also continue to expand and enhance our offerings to meet the full range of our clients' needs. A great example of this is our recently announced agreement with DISH Network to improve their set-top box data as part of our industry standard TV ratings service. 
Integrating DISH's data with our panel data fits perfectly with our hybrid approach, panels plus big data, providing both the quality and granularity our clients need. This will both bolster our core measurement service and help fuel our analytics capabilities. And initial feedback from our clients has, of course, been positive. 
Looking at Digital Ad Ratings. Some of you have asked for an update on client adoption. We continue to make progress with publishers and advertisers alike. In March, we added Snapchat to our growing roster of leading digital publishers that already includes Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pandora. On the advertiser side, we recently were selected by Unilever in China. And in July, Procter & Gamble will be coming onboard in the United States. We also are continuing to expand Digital Ad Ratings internationally. In 2016, we're adding 8 new markets, many of which are mobile-first markets. And that will bring the country total to 25. In China, Sina Weibo, a widely used social media site, has come onboard as a data partner, joining Tencent, who we began working with last year. Also in March, we acquired Informate, a leading mobile measurement provider in emerging markets, to support our ongoing international expansion efforts.
On Digital Content Ratings, we have a wide range of clients spanning big media and digital natives evaluating their audiences for video- and text-based content as well as a robust pipeline of clients who are actively integrating the SDK. For participating clients, we remain on track for syndication later this quarter. Syndicated reporting will continue to roll out for additional clients as they go through the onboarding process throughout the year. Meanwhile, we'll also be sharing data with our agency clients, so they can increase their familiarity with the data. So very good progress overall. Last week, Facebook announced at their F8 conference that they're opening up their Instant Articles program to all publishers around the world. The program has been a tremendous success for them as they seek to provide a better reading experience for their users and help publishers reach their audiences. We're mentioning this because those audiences will be measured by Nielsen's Digital Content Ratings. So this is a great example of the growing client adoption that we're seeing.
Next, let's move to Total Content Ratings. We now have about 140 networks for whom we're reporting time-shifted viewing through day 35, enabling these clients to see the incremental contribution to their Total Audience. Additionally, we have 55 networks enabled for our measurement of video-on-demand, including subscription video-on-demand through our Total Content Ratings reporting. Overall, we're now covering over 8,000 different program episodes, up from about 6,000 last quarter. We also enhanced our coverage of TV connected devices, such as Apple TV, Roku, Chromecast and Amazon Fire. This data is flowing through our reporting of Total Content Ratings today, helping our clients to understand how viewing compares across the different brands of connected devices. 
Regarding the effort to update the definition of the currency. In March, we had another productive meeting with key industry stakeholders as we continue to move towards the new expanded definition of currency for the marketplace. These discussions continue to progress well. And they're getting much more specific about how the elements of our Total Audience Measurement system will be used in the new definition of the currency. 
In advance of this year's upfronts and NewFronts, our clients are actively engaging and evaluating our data from Digital Content Ratings and Total Content Ratings. We're helping them understand that comparable metrics and the impact to their business. It's crucial for us to work with our clients through this process. And we'll continue to support them both in the broad client forums as well as in individual meetings. It's exciting really to see how these the new metrics help our clients understand and leverage the changing ways that audiences are consuming content. Their use of these new metrics will continue to grow throughout the year, leading to a more central role and even greater impact in next year's NewFronts and upfronts. 
One final component of Total Audience Measurement, we also recently announced Nielsen Digital Audio Ratings, which measures radio listening via mobile apps and Web players. Our ratings now capture broadcast radio's total reach. This also leads the groundwork for us to measure other audio platforms, where people listen to music, news, talk, sports and syndicated programs. Radio continues to have incredible reach with 93% of all adults listening to the radio each week, making it an important, productive part of a brand's multimedia plan. 
Let's turn to Marketing Effectiveness. We had revenue growth of nearly 30% in the quarter. And this is largely where our Watch-related analytics fall. And over the past several years, we've made significant investments in this space. As a result, we now produce the industry's most comprehensive suite of analytic solutions across the broadest set of categories. In addition, Nielsen data also helps power many of our clients' own in-house selling and buying tools that you tend to hear more about around the time of the upfronts. The role of analytics for assessing audience segmentation and advertising ROI as well as fueling activation will only continue to grow. We feel great about our position in this part of the market. Recently, we strengthened that position through acquisitions like eXelate in 2015 and Pointlogic in March of this year. 
Even prior to our acquisition of Pointlogic, we worked with them to develop our Nielsen Media Impact service, which is a software solution for cross-media planning. And it's connected to our Total Audience Measurement system. Media Impact, along with other products from Pointlogic, enables agencies, media owners and advertisers to better plan, activate and optimize the value of their media investments. So you can see how this Pointlogic acquisition supports both our core measurement and our analytic services for our clients. 
Now a moment ago, I mentioned our eXelate acquisition. And just last week, we announced the official launch of the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, formerly known as the Enterprise Marketing Platform. Look, we know how much you guys love it when we change the name of one of our services. So there you go, that's this quarter. Well, this Nielsen Marketing Cloud, it, in fact, heavily leverages our eXelate acquisition. It integrates Nielsen's data management, analytics, media planning and activation applications all on a single platform to help brands reach consumers more efficiently and precisely and to help media companies sell more effectively. We recognize we're not the only one out there with a marketing cloud capability. But what sets ours apart is our access to the essential core data. That's the key reason why we're seeing strong initial momentum, having already signed deals with over a dozen top, fast-moving consumer goods, pharma, spirits and media companies in Q1.
Separately, we also recently announced a partnership with Time Warner, leveraging Nielsen's neuroscience and biometrics tools in their Medialab to help them understand and leverage the changing ways audiences engage with the content and advertising. We have a similar long-running partnership with CBS and their Television City facility. So again, while measurement has always been and will continue to be the core of our business, we're also a significant player in the analytic space. And our ability to connect measurement with analytics increases the value of each and will continue to drive growth for our business.
Let's turn to Buy. In Buy segment, revenues increased 4.3% on a constant currency basis and emerging markets were again the significant growth driver in the quarter with revenues up 10%. These markets experienced volatility from time to time, but with it also comes tremendous growth opportunities. And with our unmatched global footprint, supported by the investments we made in coverage for these markets over the past several years, we love our position. This quarter, our teams once again executed well and we saw solid growth with multinational and local clients as they invested in both measurement and analytics. 
In developed markets, revenues grew 2% with our core measurement business remaining rock-solid. We saw growth shoots in Europe for the second quarter in a row, which is encouraging and also a huge testament to the efforts of our teams and their solid execution. One of the keys in Europe, in fact, one of the keys to our growth globally is our progress with our retailer clients. We've had good traction tapping into this opportunity with our growth-driven buyer analytics capabilities as well as core measurement wins and renewals. And on that front, last week, we reached a new agreement with Walmart. It's a multiyear renewal of our relationship and it elevates Nielsen to the status of preferred provider for Walmart's data. It also expands the range of our analytics work with Walmart and it includes the deployment of our latest technology solutions. Finally, the new agreement also grants Nielsen the ability to provide Walmart's store-level market share to manufacturers beginning in July of 2016.
Moving on to coverage. In parallel with our Watch business' focus on Total Audience Measurement, our Buy business is focused on Total Consumer measurement across all channels, including e-commerce. In February, we announced some significant enhancements to our e-commerce measurement capability in the U.S., following the proven formula that combines our high-quality panels with big data. This combination enables us to provide our manufacturer clients with both broad and granular coverage of their e-commerce sales, including on the largest platforms. Client reaction has been very positive. Also a recently announced partnership with Profitero further expands on our e-commerce capabilities.
Lastly, we're making excellent progress in our effort to build a platform-based system that aligns and connects our Buy business' wide variety of measurement and analytics data to drive increased value for our clients. We're thrilled to announce that Kellogg's has signed up to be one of the early adopters, partnering with us as we build out this connected system for our fast-moving consumer goods clients. 
So as you can see, our teams have been busy embracing the market's changes and leveraging them as a means for progress as they execute on our strategy. That's the key to our ability to deliver consistent revenue and profit growth, driving returns for our shareholders. We feel great about the quarter and we feel great about the year ahead. And we look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our next call. Over to you, Jamere."

We had another great quarter, and I am pleased with the execution and efforts of our teams around the world. The year is off to a strong start and our results are indicative of the consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model, which continues to deliver solid results through the cycles. 
First, let me cover our total company results for the first quarter. Revenue was just under $1.5 billion, up 5.2% constant currency. We have delivered 39 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth, driven by strength in our core business and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 6.3% on a constant currency basis with great momentum in our Total Audience execution and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew 4.3% constant currency, led by continued strength in the emerging markets and new client wins. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $402 million, up 7.2% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 27%, up 49 basis points on a constant currency basis with margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments. We continue to run the productivity play with intensity and our operations team, led by John Tavolieri, is executing against the strong pipeline of projects across the company. Adjusted net income was $187 million, up 9.4% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.51, up 10.9% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth is driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
We generated free cash flow of $14 million, up from a $1 million usage a year ago, and we're driving working capital efficiencies within our business. As a reminder, the majority of our free cash flow is generated in the second, third and fourth quarters and we remain on track to deliver our 2016 guidance of approximately $950 million. And finally, we continue to deliver on our commitment to drive incremental shareholder value through capital allocation by increasing the quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.31 a share. It's worth noting that our dividend has nearly doubled since its inception in 2013. Again, a great quarter with solid execution and a strong start to 2016.
Next, I will move to the segments. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $694 million, up 6.3% in constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 7.5%. Audio was up nearly 1% and the business continues to deliver outstanding margins and strong free cash flow. Marketing Effectiveness was up 28.8% behind strong results in the eXelate and Nielsen Catalina Solutions product offerings. Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth as publishers and content owners seek to amplify the value of their ad inventories and advertisers seek to better identify audiences across all screens and platforms to improve the return on their investments. Other Watch is about a 2 point strike on Watch revenue, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter. 
Let me say a few words about our key initiatives. Our Total Audience growth initiative is off to a great start. Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 58% behind strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners. We continue to see strong renewals and new wins with clients such as Videology, a demand-side video ad platform; Crackle, a screen and TV network; and Snapchat, along with continued strength with top advertisers. Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, is also off to a great start in 2016. In addition to clients who are evaluating video measurement data, we're making solid progress with text measurement with the most recent addition being Facebook for their Instant Articles content. And finally, our subscription video-on-demand product continues to gain traction as the number of episodes we are now measuring for our clients increased by nearly 1/3 versus the prior quarter. 
Watch adjusted EBITDA was $297 million, up 7.2% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded 38 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage in the business. In the quarter, we signed a deal with DISH to integrate set-top box data into our ratings. The acquisition of this rich dataset is included in our annual guidance and our teams are executing on our product plan. In addition to helping us strengthen our products over time, set-top box data will give us significant productivity benefits and operating and capital expense by enabling us to reduce the size and frequency of future panel expansions. Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy and Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth.
Turning to Buy. Our business had a solid first quarter. First quarter total Buy revenue was $793 million, up 4.3% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $550 million, up 2% on a constant currency basis, and our business in the emerging markets was $243 million, up 10% on a constant currency basis. Our teams are continuing to execute in line with the guidance framework we gave for 2016. In the developed markets, our core measurement business was solid in our 2 largest markets, the U.S. and Western Europe. We also saw broad-based growth in the emerging markets with double-digit growth in Latin America, China and Southeast Asia, along with mid- to high single digits in Eastern Europe and Africa. Overall, discretionary spend remains stable with relevant strength in areas like innovation.
Buy EBITDA was $114 million, up 7.5% constant currency. Our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins were up 43 basis points in the quarter. This is the seventh straight quarter of Buy margin expansion. And we expect Buy to be a strong contributor to our margins in 2016 as emerging markets continue to scale and we execute on the productivity pipeline that I referenced earlier. Overall, we had a good quarter in Buy with solid revenue growth and margin expansion on a constant currency basis.
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 320 basis points drag on revenue and 140 basis points drag on EBITDA, which were both in the ballpark of what we laid out on our last earnings call. If yesterday's spot rates held constant through 2016, then we expect 120 basis points drag on revenue and a 50 basis point drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is slightly better than the forecast we gave last quarter.
Moving to 2016 guidance. We are maintaining our annual guidance. We remain confident in our plan to deliver on all of the operational elements that we laid out on our fourth quarter call, highlighted by revenue growth of 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis, adjusted net income per share of $2.83 to $2.93 per share and free cash flow of roughly $950 million.
So to wrap up, the year is off to a great start. And coming out of the first quarter, we have a lot of confidence and momentum in both of our segments. In addition, we are committed to an efficient and balanced capital structure and we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I will turn it back to Kate."

I'm glad I asked because I was assuming it was something else. We do have maybe 2 different dimensions to coverage. One is measurement coverage.

We do have maybe 2 different dimensions to coverage. One is measurement coverage. So in the developed markets, that is not exclusively, but it is largely about e-commerce, adding e-commerce into the sales that we cover in our core measurement service right now. And then other markets around the world, it might be more about geographic coverage or covering the marketplace with increasing granularity, giving regional or even city-level views in some of the faster-growing emerging markets around the world. And this is what we've been investing in as a company for a number of years, in emerging markets. And then more recently, our focus has now turned to e-commerce coverage for our retail sales measurement service in the developed markets around the world. That's one dimension. The second dimension that I think you're also touching on is how our range of services, both measurement and our analytics capabilities, cover the range of business questions that our clients have. And that's where we're really putting together -- focused on putting together this system-based, platform-oriented approach that we talked about most recently in a very in-depth way at our Analyst Day this past December. I mentioned it briefly at the end of the my prepared comments. And that's where I referenced that Kellogg's has signed on to be one of our early adopters to partner with this as we build out this system. And what this is about is taking our core measurement service and our key analytics capabilities, the ones that are focused on the most common and most important business questions our clients have, each of these are valuable on individual basis right now. But they'll be even more valuable as we connect them together so that they function as an operating system, if you will, to support our clients' marketing and sales and innovation processes in their business. When our services connect together on a technology platform and support one another, and then that system connects directly with our clients' system, then that's going to be very powerful. Now to your question about where we are, milestones and timing, we're still in the earlier stages of putting that system together. And that work will continue throughout this year and will be supported by the partnership with Kellogg's and other clients who I'm sure will want to get onboard as well as we build that out. Milestones that you're going to see are just -- it'll be very similar to what we talked about on the Watch side of the business with Total Audience Measurement. There will be a steady growth in client adoption, clients adopting the key individual parts, and then gradually over time you'll see them adopt the comprehensive system as well. And we'll be sure to update you on future earnings calls about how that's progressing. We don't have a whole lot more to say about it at this stage because we're still in the really relatively early stages of that. As far as growth potential or where it really is going to come down to is what I commented on in my prepared comments, measurement is important on its own, analytics are incredibly important and valuable on their own. Connecting these 2 things together is where the incremental value delivery opportunity and growth opportunity comes for our business. And that's what we're focused on and pursuing."

I understand what that means. But do you think this could lead to the entire industry talking more about Total Audience viewership of programming rather than the term ratings, which we're always using, which is usually Live + Same Day or C3 and as we all know is limited in terms of total viewership?

I think that's exactly where we would expect the industry to go. Right now, when you hear people refer to Nielsen or ratings, they are generally, in most cases, referring to the current definition of the currency, so C3 or C7, which is capturing an important part of total viewing, but of course, many parts are left out of the current definition of the currency. The Total Audience system is all designed to capture all of that viewing, all important viewing across all screens and platforms that are out there. Right now, there's a disconnect between what Total Audience measures and what the current definition of the currency that the market trades on captures. And so yes, either you're going to see people start to talk about Total Audience exactly as you say or I think just as likely, more likely perhaps, is that definition of the currency will be revised and expanded to include more of the viewing that's happening on these other platforms, in these other viewing environments that our Total Audience Measurement system was designed to capture. And so that's the tension, the very positive and productive tension, I think, that is now growing and emerging in the marketplace. That's why we have convened these discussions with a broad range of industry players to talk about redefining and updating the definition of the currency. And we're happy to say that those conversations have progressed well and gotten a lot more specific about what the options are for a new definition of the currency."

As I said, the set-top box data integration is actually included in our guidance for earnings and free cash flow. And over time, we're confident that we're able to acquire the data and build the products within our existing long-term financial framework because we have a ton of experience already working with set-top box data. And as I mentioned, on the plus side, set-top box integration is going to enable us to gain OpEx and CapEx efficiencies by reducing the size and frequencies of panel expansions over time. You've got to remember that panels are very expensive. And so we expect those productivity benefits to be plowed back into our business to either help us improve the profitability of our business and/or reinvest that into new products over time. In terms of the timeframe of DISH being integrated, the teams are already working on the product plans. We won't be date certain about that integration.

Your point about critiques in the marketplace is a good one.

And another critique is that as some of these elements of the Total Audience Measurement systems have rolled out, we also get the opposite, which is too fast. We need more time to understand the data and the impact on my business. And so we work closely with our clients on that to support them as they grow in their familiarity, understand the impact to their business.

They're looking to differentiate themselves from the pack. And that's what good sellers do. So that's really what we're seeing right now. And one thing that's important to know is what's powering many of those in-house selling tools and a lot of those proprietary analytics that you're hearing about is Nielsen data and Nielsen analytics. And in fact, it's one of the reason why our Marketing Effectiveness business saw such good growth in the first quarter of this year, up almost 30%. So look, this is just the time of year. I think the important thing to think about when we see these metrics coming from the big media companies is to also think about it from the buyer side. So a buyer sees those proprietary metrics, and of course, they're interested in them, but they also want a broad view of the market. They want comparable metrics that enable them to compare across all of the places where they can invest their money. And those captive metrics from the individual media companies don't satisfy that need that the buyers have on their side of the table. Nielsen obviously supports that and it's an essential role that we play in the marketplace that their broad view independence in the picture. Meanwhile, a lot of these other analytics still can be very helpful as additional views of the marketplace to provide supplementary guarantees, supplementary understanding of how to find value as you seek audiences if you're an advertiser."

But other than that, what we're doing is taking already existing components, which are valuable on a stand-alone basis, and we're bringing them together and connecting them in a system in this Marketing Cloud capability. So we didn't have to go and invent new capabilities that are, at the moment, not important new components to this Marketing Cloud. What's new is the connectedness of all of these already proven capabilities, and then delivering that system of capabilities to our clients, so they can activate with even more precision, more efficiency and more speed, but yes, clearly powered by the capabilities that came to Nielsen through our acquisition of eXelate in 2015. But otherwise, not requiring any new invention or any new components, at least not at the initial launch. But even having said that, as we mentioned, very strong initial interest from clients across a pretty broad range of industries already here in the first quarter. And you're going to continue to see the clients who are signing on to our Marketing Cloud capability grow throughout the year."

Yes, happy to talk a little bit more about this. The preferred provider designation is Walmart elevating us from what they refer to as a primary provider in the past to status preferred provider. And what it is, is a signal to the marketplace",500,"Thanks, Dan. Yes, happy to talk a little bit more about this. The preferred provider designation is Walmart elevating us from what they refer to as a primary provider in the past to status preferred provider. And what it is, is a signal to the marketplace that if you're going to come and if you're a supplier to Walmart and you're come to Walmart and you want to make your pitch, they want you to use Nielsen's data, Nielsen's hierarchy. They want a common hierarchy, a common view of the world for the providers, the suppliers as they come to Walmart. That helps Walmart obviously operate more efficiently, less variation in all the different views that they have to interpret as they're pitched to by their suppliers. And so that's what that means. It doesn't mean that a supplier can't use data from another measurement provider, but Walmart signaled their clear preference for how a supplier should pitch to them. The other thing that this deal expands on, it increases the analytics work that we do for Walmart. We already were doing some analytics with them. They like that. They've seen it as being valuable. And so basically, what this contract renewal does is it makes that work continuous with them as opposed to more project-oriented. And it's a real strong validation of the value that they've seen from the -- whether it's the pricing analytics or the assortment optimization analytics, all the different things, including our marketing mix capabilities because, of course, Walmart is a big advertiser. And so our marketing mix capabilities help them to get more ROI out of the money that they spend to promote their brand. This other element that I mentioned, too, which is we're now for the first time enabled to provide Walmart's suppliers with store-level market share. That's a key thing, too. So if you go around into your town, if you have a Walmart where you live, there's a Walmart there, there's a trading area that's defined around that individual store. So suppliers always knew what their sales were in that store, but they didn't necessarily know what their market share was in that trading area around that Walmart store. So we're now able to provide that kind of perspective. And that is really important to both Walmart and to Walmart's suppliers, the manufacturers that we're also working with. Those are the key components. And then as far as how it will play beyond Walmart, well, it's a signal to the other retailers in the industry that the biggest retailer in the industry has designated Nielsen as its preferred provider. We're certainly very happy about that. We think that's quite meaningful. And then in the other markets around the world where we already work with Walmart, we look to leverage some of the components of this relationship with Walmart in the U.S. in many of those other markets where we're already actively engaged with this, the biggest retailer in the world."

One is to sort of catch up to the rapid pace of change in these markets, which we have done very successfully in the last several years. And then the other opportunity is created around keeping up with that ongoing pace of change. And that's going to continue in a lot of these markets. So as that happens, there's also another dimension, which is the maturity of marketing in those markets. So if you look backwards, a lot of the growth for our clients is about gaining distribution as the retail environment starts to develop. And as it develops, and especially in the larger cities, then it starts to become more about a market share gain. And that's where a lot of our analytics capabilities start to become more important. So we're still underpenetrated on that front in almost all of the most important emerging markets around the world, and so we still -- when we look out into the future, we still see very good growth opportunity and we continue with this, yes, 8% to 10% range, not only for this year but as far as we can see into the future."

Our second quarter results marked our 40th consecutive quarter or 10 years of constant currency revenue growth. Once again, this quarter, we also delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth driven by our scalable consistent business model and our continuous focus on productivity. These results reflect the continued client and industry adoption of our Total Audience Measurement framework, ongoing strength in emerging markets and strong execution by our teams around the globe. 
Our long-standing on measuring our clients performance and helping them improve their performance remains as valuable as ever. And as we look into the second half of the year and beyond, we have continued confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute. 
Looking at the second quarter, we had revenue growth of 4.5% on a constant currency basis. In Watch, revenues increased almost 6% on a constant currency basis, including a 7.9% increase in Audience Measurement of Video and Text. Buy segment revenues grew 3.3% on a constant currency basis driven by 8.9% growth in emerging markets and just under 1% in developed markets. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.5% constant currency, reflecting our ongoing productivity initiatives and our scalable business model. Adjusted net income per share grew just over 9% constant currency to $0.71. 
Driving shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy remains a key priority. While we continue to invest consistently in our future growth, we're also focused on returning capital to shareholders and during the quarter, we continued our steady rhythm of share buybacks. And as of June 30, we still had approximately $550 million remaining under our existing authorization. Lastly, we're reiterating our guidance for 2016.
On our last call, we talked about the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve and the great job our teams are doing and leveraging these changes as a means for progress. Historically, we've talked about change more frequently on the Watch side of the business but in fact, in both the Watch and Buy, our teams are focused on continuously renewing and improving our products and systems to keep pace with changing client needs. So let's spend a few minutes on this.
In Watch, change continues to be driven by media fragmentation as consumers now have the ability to view content across more channels, devices, platforms and even time periods, that means more things to measure, which creates more opportunity for us. Our clients want us to measure all of it: TV, mobile, video-on-demand, over-the-top viewing, video, audio, text and want to see measures each of these individually as well as combined into one metric and that's exactly what our Total Audience Measurement system does. 
Bringing Total Audience Measurement to the market has not been easy, it's been a multiyear process and our teams have been executing extraordinarily well. We now have in the market a comprehensive system that provides comparable measurement of all ad and content across all screens and platforms. We continue to work closely with our clients towards fully syndicated reporting of all key metrics. But Total Audience is not just about measuring audiences, it's also about ensuring that our Total Audience metrics support the complete process of buying and selling media from planning to activation, to assessing the return on the assessment. Our total audiences system underpins all 3 of these activities as the visual on the webcast slide shows. 
The loop begins with our measurement data feeding our advertising clients planning systems and helping them to find the right consumers based on demographics or behavioral segmentation, as well as helping them to allocate their resources efficiently across platforms to reach their desired audience. From there, the focus to the system turns to activation enabled by our 2015 eXelate acquisition and now delivered via the Nielsen Marketing Cloud.  Studio enabled advertisers to target specific audiences in a programmatic environment and to activate their buy through the eXelate pipes that go directly to ad servers. 
The next step is to measure effectiveness. How well did the ad reach the target audience? What effect did the ad have on the brand? What was the sales lift? What was the ROI on the media spend? This is a continuous cycle: Plan, activate, measure, then repeat. This is the process that our Total Audience Measurement system supports. And with that in mind, I'll mention a few highlights that illustrate the recent progress we've made on our strategy.
In the second quarter, our national TV business remained rock solid. While our data shows that the average U.S. adult is watching 3 minutes less of linear television compared to last year, it's still over 4.5 hours per day. With the broadest reach, television remains a critical component for brand-building campaigns. Meanwhile, digital advertising, with its promise of precision, continued to grow at a double-digit pace, that's despite the recent industry concerns related to digital advertising fraud and Viewability that appeared to have slowed down the shift in spend from traditional media. For us, wherever the advertising dollars flow, we'll be there to measure the audience. 
Last week, we announced that we've integrated 3 leading providers of viewability metrics, Double Verify [ph], Integral Ad Science [ph] and Mote [ph] into our Digital Ad Ratings system, making it much easier for our clients to know the delivery of viewable impressions to their target consumers.  Another highlight in the quarter for Digital Ad Ratings relates to Hulu. In May, Hulu announced that they're partnering with us to use our Digital Ad Ratings system to measure living room impressions delivered over-the-top through connected TV devices, such as Roku, Apple TV, PlayStation or smart TVs. 70% of Hulu's viewing now occurs on connected TVs, whereas earlier in their existence, nearly all Hulu viewing took place on a PC. This serves as yet another example of why our clients need the Total Audience feel of a changing market.
We continue to see strong demand of our measurement of subscription video-on-demand. With 52% of households now subscribing to a subscription video-on-demand service, audience data is more valuable than ever to studios and content owners seeking to fully monetize their programs for this growing audience. Late in the second quarter, as-reported in the Wall Street Journal, we unveiled streaming ratings for the Lions Gate production of Orange is the New Black, the fourth season's premiere episode was watched by 6.7 million people in the U.S. This is comparable to the second most viewed cable drama on TV behind HBO's Game of Thrones. This is valuable information for studios that they look to monetize their content. 
On Digital Content Ratings, our release of syndicated data to participate in clients occurred in late May on schedule. And we remain on track to syndicate Total Content Ratings for participating clients in August. We have strong pipeline of additional clients, both big media and digital [indiscernible] integrating the FDK that enables this measurement. Exciting to see how these new metrics help our clients understand and leverage the changing ways audiences are consuming content. 
For example, was it recorded on a DVR and watched a month later, or did the consumer view it through their cable provider's video-on-demand service, or was it viewed over-the-top via a Roku streaming player. This level of granularity helps our clients align their strategy with their audiences viewing habits. 
Regarding the effort update the currency data used to plan and measure advertising, in June, we had yet another positive and productive meeting with key industry stakeholders. Clients continue to be supportive of Total Audience and are engaged in moving the industry toward a new rating standard in time for their 2017 upfront negotiations. 
Internationally, we remain on track to have Digital Ad Ratings in 25 countries by years end, and we recently confirmed the contract extensions for our TV Audience Measurement services in Australia and Sweden. 
Finally, last quarter, we mentioned our [indiscernible] DISH network to license their set-top box data supporting our local and national TV rating services. This quarter, we're pleased to announce that we recently reached agreement with Charter Communications to license their set-top box data further expanding our coverage. Both of these datasets will help strengthen our TV measurement products as well as help fuel our Marketing Effectiveness analytics. 
Speaking to Marketing Effectiveness, we had another strong quarter with constant currency revenue growth of 15%. As a reminder, this is where we help clients plan, activate and evaluate the return on their media investments. The Nielsen Marketing Cloud brings all of these capabilities together in one system. It's off to a great start in the U.S. and in June, we launched our cloud system in Europe. This is a dynamic part of our business and has a lot of runway. 
Shifting to the Buy business. Similar to the media world, the fast-moving consumer goods industry is also seeing fragmentation, driven by new channels and shifts in consumer purchasing behavior. Adapting to this changing environment we're focused on providing both manufacturer and retailer clients with a complete view of consumers whether they buy in store, out-of-home or online. Our focus here is on coverage. We call it Total Consumer Measurement and now it gets to Total Audience Measurement in our Watch business.
Our investments in coverage in the emerging markets continue to be a significant growth driver. In the second quarter, our growth was fueled by both local and multinational audiences, as well as steps taken to strengthen our portfolio through innovation. Retailer clients are another important part of our Buy growth strategy as the growing world of technology for consumers, retailers and manufacturers is changing the path to purchase. At the end of June, we launched our Brand Bank [ph] capabilities in the U.S. This has been a very successful business for us in Europe, and we're excited about the U.S. launch. 
Recall that brand bank is focused on supporting retailers and their e-commerce product content needs. As an example, brand bank can now connect directly to Walmart systems as an improved content service provider supporting Walmart's omnichannel strategy. For our manufacturer clients, brand bank will collect, manage and submit content on their behalf along with Walmart's requirements for data attributes and formats. 
During the quarter, we also welcomed Whole Foods to our retail client roster, leveraging our market share data and analytics. We're helping them build on their strength with natural and organic products as they doubled down on consumer-centric category management. Health and wellness is a growing importance to many of our manufacturing clients and our work with Whole Foods adds to our ability to help them drive growth in these product segments. 
When we look at the developed markets, the environment continues to be challenging. In the absence of strong top line growth, our clients are looking to find efficiencies in their business, which in some instances includes their marketing, sales or innovation processes. One action we took in the quarter was up to realign our Buy business globally in the clusters of countries with similar market characteristics. We also accelerated our investments in our Buy business connected system which will enhance the value and speed we bring to our clients. I'll spend a few minutes on this connected system. 
Our business is focused on measuring and improving performance for our clients, understanding what is happening is the first step. We answer this with our measurement of sales and market share. Once our clients know what happens, the next question is why. What were the key drivers of the results. Our analytics will automatically pinpoint the key drivers, including marketing and sales activity, competitive activity and market trends. Then the most important question is what next. What does the need to do to improve.
These are all capabilities that we have in the market today, but our opportunity is to them make more valuable for our clients by connecting them into one fully integrated system underpinned by one source of truth that enables more speed and efficiency for Nielsen and more importantly, for our clients. That's what our connected system will do.
Clients have been enthusiastic in their feedback and they want it now and that's a key reason why we've accelerated the pace of our investment in this platform-based connected system. We begin with an initial group of clients who will be on board by the end of the year with more transitioning through 2017. A faster, more efficient system creates more value for our clients and bolsters our position as the leading global provider of measurement and analytics to the FMCG industry.
I want to close with a few words on corporate social responsibility. We know many long-term investors are putting more emphasis on this lately and we agree with you. The way I often say it to our teams internally is that, companies need to care for the communities they rely on for their business. Our company lives this out in a variety of ways focusing on education, nutrition, diversity and inclusion and access to technology. In May, we published our first global responsibility report, which describes our efforts in detail. One of our recent efforts was Nielsen Global Impact Day. On June 2, as part of our fifth annual day of service, over 23,000 Nielsen associates participated in more than 1,400 volunteer activities across 92 countries. I'm extremely proud of them for their commitment and their service. 
So those are my comments on the quarter. We're looking forward to the rest of the year with continued confidence and excitement about the progress to come. Over to you, Jamere."
422760,370292048,1011762,"Nielsen Holdings plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Nielsen Holdings plc","Executives","Thank you, Mitch. We had another solid quarter reflecting consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model that continues to deliver solid results through the cycles. First, let me cover our total company results for the second quarter. On the left side",1203,"Thank you, Mitch. We had another solid quarter reflecting consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model that continues to deliver solid results through the cycles. 
First, let me cover our total company results for the second quarter. On the left side of the page, our results on U.S. GAAP basis, revenue was just under $1.6 billion, up 2.4% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in both our Watch and Buy segments and offset partially by the impact of foreign exchange. Net income was $114 million and net income per share was $0.31, which is flat versus the second quarter of 2015. Our net income per share results were driven by solid revenue growth, margin expansion and our share buyback program, offset by restructuring charges related to realignment of the markets in our Buy segment. 
Moving to the right side of the page, on a non-GAAP basis, revenue was up 4.5% constant currency. We have delivered 40 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth driven by strength in our core business and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 5.8% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued momentum in Audience Measurement of Video and Text, an impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew 3.3% constant currency led by continued strength in the emerging markets.
Adjusted EBITDA was $490 million, up 6.5% constant currency and adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.7%, up 60 basis points on a constant currency basis with margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments. 
Our productivity pipeline remains strong, and we're confident in our guidance of 50 to 70 basis points of constant currency margin expansion for the total company in 2016. 
Adjusted net income was $257 million, up 6.6% constant currency and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.71, up 9.2% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
Finally, we generated free cash flow of $98 million compared to $156 million in the second part of last year. This was primarily driven by working capital timing and CapEx investments in our growth initiatives in Watch and Buy. And we remain on track to deliver our 2016 guidance of approximately $950 million. Again, solid quarter of consistent and steady results.
Next I'll move to the segments and provide a little more color, the first is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $744 million, up 5.8% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 7.9% on a constant currency basis. Audio was up nearly 2% constant currency, while delivering solid margins, improved cash flow. Marketing Effectiveness was up 15.1% constant currency behind strong results from Nielsen Marketing Cloud and Nielsen Catalina Solutions product offerings. The investments we've made in Marketing Effectiveness continues to drive Watch segment grow and we're seeing strong demand from both publishers and advertisers.
As expected, Other Watch is about 2 points drag on Watch revenue on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter of 2015. Watch adjusted EBITDA was $332 million, up 6.4% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded 24 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage, while investing in the business. 
Let me say just a few words about our key initiatives in Watch. First, Total Audience has strong momentum. Digital Ad Ratings has been widely adopted by the industry as a way of measuring reach and frequency on ad campaigns. And in the second quarter, Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 53% led by strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platform and content owners. 
Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content, types and platforms with metrics comparable continues to gain traction with key clients for both Video and Text measurement. In the quarter, we signed new digital platform clients, such as Cake [ph] and Mashable. In addition, we reached an important milestone with the successful release of syndicated data with participating clients. Our efforts to provide our clients with more capability and flexibility in measuring content and campaigns is a key growth driver for our business. Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy and Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth. We remain confident in our 2016 Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis.
Turning to Buy. Second quarter total Buy revenue was $852 million, up 3.3% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $582 million, up just under 1% on a constant currency basis, which we saw modest growth in core measurement offset by softness in discretionary spend. We continue to invest by realigning our market clusters and accelerating the development of our connected system which will enable us to create a faster-growing higher-margin business in the developed markets. 
Our business in the emerging markets was $270 million, up 8.9% on a constant currency basis. In the emerging markets, growth was broad-based with double-digit growth in Latin America, China and Southeast Asia, along with high single digits in Eastern Europe and India.
Buy EBITDA was $166 million, up 6.4% constant currency. Our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins were up 57 basis points on a constant currency basis in the quarter. This is the eighth straight quarter of Buy margin expansion as emerging markets continue to scale and we execute on the productivity pipeline that I referenced earlier. We remain confident in our 2016 Buy guidance of 3.5% to 5.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis.
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risks, so this slide focuses strictly on the transition impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 210 basis points drag on revenue and 180 basis point drag on EBITDA, which were both in the ballpark of what we laid out on our last earnings call. The current spot rates held constant through 2016 and we expect 170 basis points drag on revenue and an 80 basis point drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which was slightly worst than the forecast we gave last quarter.
Moving to 2016 guidance, we are maintaining our annual guidance. We remain confident in our plan to deliver on all of operational elements that we laid out at the beginning of the year, highlighted by revenue growth of 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis, adjusted net income per share of $2.83 to $2.93 a share, and a free cash flow of roughly $950 million.
So to wrap up, overall, we had another quarter of consistent, steady revenue growth and margin expansion. In addition, we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Amy."

Europe actually saw modest growth in core measurement, while the discretionary side was a little soft as was in the U.S. And I'll just remind you that discretionary spend can be a little lumpy. We're coming off 2 stable quarters, so it's not uncommon to see these dynamics from time to time. And in the second half, I expect developed Buy we gave at Analyst Day of 1.5% to 3.5%."

Well, I mentioned in my opening comments that our national TV business remains rock solid. And while television isn't the only thing that those clients that you referred to are focused on, it's still the biggest part of their business. And so, it's still the centerpiece of those contract renewals. But as we said in previous quarters when we've updated this group on how those contract renewals are going, increasingly, the conversation is around our Total Audience framework. They want to know how we're going to measure television but also how we're going to measure the content audiences for their content across all these additional screens and platforms where their content is now viewable by consumers. And you see that reflected as you would expect in their structure of our contract renewals these days and increasingly so as time goes on and Total Audience becomes more used and more real in the marketplace. So that's the change in the texture of those contracts and those contract discussions. They'll continue the same time to be very pleased with the terms of those contract renewals. Length of the contract, fairly in line with what historically been the case. And then, the terms in terms of the annual increases in price, also fairly well in line. What's the difference is the breadth of measurement that our service will provide. If you go back many years, it was all about television and that's very much not the case today. It's now all about video and wherever that the video content happens to be viewed."

We were pleased with DISH that we announced last quarter because, of course, DISH is a service that's available to consumers naturally, so it gives us that breadth. And Charter gives us a little bit more depth in certain parts of the country where Charter is the provider to markets in cities, communities out there. We're going to continue to look for additional providers to add into the mix. The good news is we don't need them all. And as we talk with the additional options, the other companies who have set-top box data available, we're going to continue to look at them as almost pieces to a puzzle and we look for the best configuration, not just as you've referenced, the biggest quantity of data. So DISH is a great start. Charter is fabulous addition. We're looking to add 1 or 2 more in the quarters ahead, and we'll be sure to keep this group updated on our progress on that front. But already, even where we stand right now, we're happy with what we're going to be able to do with these 2 existing datasets in terms of both bolstering our national and local television Audience Measurement products as we look out into next year and beyond, as well as using these datasets to help drive our Marketing Effectiveness business, which continues its very strong double-digit growth quarter-after-quarter. So yes, we love the direction we're going. As far as margins, one thing we mentioned on prior calls is, while on the one hand, licensing these set-top box datasets is a new expense in our budget, on the other hand, it also helps relieve some of the long-term pressure on our panels, they don't have to bear as much of the weight, if you will, when the market requires additional granularity and they're calling for us to increase the size of our panels. Increasing our traditional panels, that's a very extensive, a very expensive thing to do and so by bringing these big datasets from the set-top box data providers into the mix for our measurement service, we don't have to increase the size of our panels as much going forward as we otherwise would have. And so that avoidance of future cost helps offset the cost of licensing set-top boxes data as we bring it into the picture."

One is measurement in video of logos for both brands and for sports teams and franchises. And the reason that this is important is because, there is an important trend that's also happening as it relates to native advertising. And in essence, what these guys are doing is native advertising related to sports. And in sports, that is measurement of logos and signage. In addition to that, they provide sponsorship valuation and analytics to teams and leagues and rights holders. Sports is a big business. The combination of media rights, sponsorship and analytics is a big business that we're very interested in from an analytics standpoint. What we've seen in our data inside the company is that 93 of the top 100 live TV events was sports and that was up from probably 14 or 15 just a few years ago and this is an opportunity for us to connect our Total Audience data and drive tremendous value for our clients. So an important contribution and an important add to the Nielsen profile.

And then our productivity pipeline is pretty strong, we actually have about 4,000 projects across both Watch and Buy that are going from a productivity standpoint. And the teams are doing a fantastic job executing on those. So our focus will be driving the margin expansion and the total company. We expect a positive contribution from both Watch and Buy in the back half of the year."

We're very pleased in the quarter with the revenue growth we're seeing in the Watch side of our business, in particular with Audience Measurement of Video and Text as we referenced, that's up 7.9%. And while that's boosted in part by some of the acquisitions that we've made, the underlying organic growth component of that remains as strong as well. And just as your referenced, that's reflective of both sides of our business, the traditional media companies, the media conglomerates. Back to the question asked before, our contract renewals with the big media companies remain solid. And then, the growth that we continue to see with the digital natives who are leveraging the different components of our Total Audience Measurement framework, Digital Content Ratings being the newest comer on the block but Digital Ad Ratings being a really key component of that growth, these are the real key drivers. Jamere mentioned some of the progress we've made in the quarter with Digital Ad Ratings, for example, Cake and Mashable coming onboard. We also saw international expansion with both Snapchat and Twitter. I mentioned Hulu, leveraging Digital Ad Ratings for the over-the-top devise viewing measurements. There's a number of other things happening on this front, including one very important thing that we referenced briefly last quarter, that I'll just highlight again, which is the U.S.' largest advertiser, Proctor and Gamble, we went live with Digital Ad Ratings on July 1. And so that's a big milestone in our progress. And we continue to be very strong with all the top U.S. advertisers. So these things are growing at a very healthy rate. And as the size of the digital side of our business is starts to get more critical mass, it'll be a bigger contributor to the overall growth of our Watch business going forward."

If we can expand in the future to include their newly acquired Time Warner cable franchise obviously, we're interested in doing that. But so far, the focus has been on what has historically been the Charter communications part of the business. On the other question, it's a great one, on the Buy part of our business, in terms of PPG moving more to subsection models. And so there's a lot of things happening there. I assume what you're referring to, by the way, is subscription models in terms of how they provide their products to their consumers, Dan. So if I'm misinterpreting that, let me know. Really interesting things happening there and probably the ones that's been most prominent in the news the dollar shape [ph] club, not that that's new, but, of course, Unilever is taking a lot of interest in dollar shape club and acquired them for a pretty big price tag from what I saw in the press. So that's one of the big trends that we see emerging. And obviously, Amazon [indiscernible] trend in part with I think the call it, Amazon Dash and that allows consumers to have a button, a physical button in their household where they can press the button and it will automatically reorder a product, which is not a purely subscription model, but it's certainly heading in that direction. And I think more and more companies are going to be at least experimenting with this. I think the positive piece of this, from my perspective, Dan, is the emphasis that puts on branded goods in the marketplace. Because I think one of the key struggles for the FMCG industry broadly is the growth of private label, which has abated somewhat the U.S. market in the last couple of years, but continues to grow in terms of its market share around the world. And this is obviously not good news for the big manufacturing clients that we work with whose businesses are built around brands. So subscription models really put a lot more emphasis on the importance of brands, because you're going to sign up to be a continuous user of that product. Brand equity and brand attachment are probably going to be a stronger magnet in that business model versus buying the product, week end, week out by going to a grocery store where they might be lured away more by price. So we're interested to see how this unfolds. Our time Total Consumer Measurement approach, that whole philosophy in the system platform that underpins it, we'll be able to measure it either way because again, part of the focus area is on coverage. And in developed world, the biggest coverage objective right now is all around e-com where a lot subsection models, would show up. So that's going to be interesting. I love to see the FMCG industry experimenting with business model. I think it's healthy. In fact, I hope I see more of it going forward."

First, for those who may not have seen it, what we announced a couple of weeks ago is that we've moved to that much closer integration with 3 of the leading providers of viewability metrics to the marketplace.

And what these firms do is they measure whether -- when ad was served to a consumer; whether that impression resulted in the ad actually being viewable on the screen; and what portion and for how long. And so what's what viewability refers, as I'm sure all of you may know. What we have done is we've integrated these 3 leading providers into our Digital Ad Ratings system in order to make that ability to see viewable impressions much more seamless, much easier for our clients. And we've gotten very good feedback on that announcement. We've integrated 3, not just one because right now, this is still a very pragmatic markets. There's a quite a number of different providers of viewability metrics. And so we felt it was important to give our clients a choice.

We're focused on executing on our strategy, total Audience Measurement. We love the feedback we're getting from our clients in terms of that strategy being perfectly aligned with what they need. And our teams have executed extraordinarily well. They've been hitting their milestones. As I mentioned earlier, we syndicated the reporting of Digital Content Ratings on schedule. We are on track to syndicate Total Content Ratings on schedule. And I know that if you go back a year or 2 ago, we talked about where we we're going to go with Total Audience Measurement, there was a lot of skepticism around, okay, maybe the concept sounds good, but the will Nielsen really be able to deliver. And well, we have. We have delivered, and we're proud of that. Now our work isn't done. We still have a lot more to do. But I think our execution is the key reason for the strength in our business right now. I wouldn't attribute it to anybody else's misstep or weakness. I really would attribute it to the strength of our execution and the fit with our strategy with what our clients really need. So we feel great about that piece. On your second question regarding this perceived shift in the marketplace between traditional media and digital advertising, I think it's in part driven by concerns around digital advertising, fraud, that includes nonhuman traffic and there's also concern around blockers. And the viewability seems to be the most prominent of all the concerns out there and that's given some pause to people as they allocate their budgets going forward. I also think another driver, which I did not mention in my opening comments, is just a reacquaintance in the industry advertisers in the industry but the importance of reach. So digital gives you incredible precision when you can get it right, but it's hard to get both precision and reach in a digital environment. Whereas, television, while it may not offer the precision of the digital world, at least not yet, still is the best place to get reach. And if you're a brand manager and a brand builder, you know that reach is still your first priority. And so I think that reacquaintance with the importance of reach is one of the reasons why we've seen that perceived shift, a little bit of slowing of the growth in digital and people still investing heavily in good old-fashioned television because, it gets the job done and there's a good ROI on that media investment. So again, wherever they go, however the shift happens, if its accelerate in one area or it moves back in another direction, one of the reasons why we love our Total Audience Measurement framework is because we cover it all. And we not only enable people to see these trends in shifts, but we're able to connect it with the return and help them really drive the most efficient, most effective allocation of resources, whether they're buying or whether they're on the sell side of this equation."

And 9,500 different program episodes, clients has asked us to measure each of those. And so it shows really the very strong interest in and demand for this particular measurement component of our overall Total Audience Measurement system. Then to your second question regarding syndication in August of the Total Content Ratings portion of our Total Audience Measurement framework, really nothing else has to happen other than the passage of time on that. We're on track product capability is sound, it's improving. Clients need of a little bit more time in, they continue to sort through the data and make sure they're comfortable with data, that they understand what it means for their business. And so that's the key issue right now is allowing sufficient time for the marketplace to see the data and understand and project what is the likely impact is on their business and start to orient themselves around it. And so yes, we'll do hit that mark in August for total content ratings and we'll continue on to the next step from there."

So what we saw in the upfronts this year with some of those types of things that you referenced is pretty typical of what we see in the upfronts pretty much every year where each of the individual media companies on the sell side of this equation look to differentiate themselves and they look to differentiate themselves sometimes at their own proprietary metrics. And by the way, in my opinion, that's smart. That's what I would do if I were them. If You're on the other side of this equation though, if you're an agency or an advertiser, you're a buyer, you're looking to be able to compare across all the different places where you could invest money. And so these proprietary metrics aren't so useful sometimes if you're on the buying side of this because yes, you don't know how to compare them to what the other media company or what the other digital platform is offering. That's where Nielsen comes in. We offer that ability to compare across all the different options with these comparable metrics across all the different media companies and also across all the screens and platforms where consumers go, the consumer's contents. Now having said that, yes, some of these proprietary metrics that some of those companies that you mentioned are tallying the marketplace. They are, in fact, tallied by some of the capabilities from our portfolio and especially, our Marketing Effectiveness portfolio. The analytics capabilities that are there, our ability to combine our understanding of what consumers watch and how it connects to what consumers buy, often drive some quality is often referred to as secondary guarantees in the marketplace. They're not guarantees that replace the primary currency, which is based on the currency metrics that Nielsen provides, but they're a secondary guaranty, which added to that as people seek to target the specific groups of consumers maybe based on behavioral characteristics or purchasing behavior."

422760,370292048,1012128,"Nielsen Holdings plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Nielsen Holdings plc","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everyone.

Our second quarter results mark our 40th consecutive quarter or 10 years of constant currency revenue growth. Once again, this quarter, we also delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth, driven by our scalable consistent business model and our continuous focus on productivity. These results reflect the continued client and industry adoption of our Total Audience Measurement framework, ongoing strength in emerging markets and strong execution by our teams around the globe.
Our long-standing focus on measuring our clients' performance and helping them improve their performance remains as valuable as ever. And as we look into the second half of the year and beyond, we have continued confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute.
Looking at the second quarter, we had revenue growth of 4.5% on a constant currency basis. In Watch, revenues increased almost 6% on a constant currency basis, including a 7.9% increase in Audience Measurement of Video and Text. Buy segment revenues grew 3.3% on a constant currency basis, driven by 8.9% growth in emerging markets and just under 1% in developed markets.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.5% constant currency, reflecting our ongoing productivity initiatives and our scalable business model. Adjusted net income per share grew just over 9% constant currency to $0.71.
Driving shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy remains a key priority. While we continue to invest consistently in our future growth, we're also focused on returning capital to shareholders, and during the quarter, we continued our steady rhythm of share buybacks. And as of June 30, we still had approximately $550 million remaining under our existing authorization. Lastly, we're reiterating our guidance for 2016.
On our last call, we talked about the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve and the great job our teams are doing in leveraging these changes as a means for progress. Historically, we've talked about change more frequently on the Watch side of the business. But in fact, in both the Watch and Buy, our teams are focused on continuously renewing and improving our products and systems to keep pace with changing client needs. So let's spend a few minutes on this.
In Watch, change continues to be driven by media fragmentation as consumers now have the ability to view content across more channels, devices, platforms and even time periods. That means more things to measure, which creates more opportunity for us. Our clients want us to measure all of it: TV, mobile, video-on-demand, over-the-top viewing, video, audio, text and want to see measures each of these individually as well as combined into one metric, and that's exactly what our Total Audience Measurement system does.
Bringing Total Audience Measurement to the market has not been easy. It's been a multiyear process, and our teams have been executing extraordinarily well. We now have in the market a comprehensive system that provides comparable measurement of all ads and content across all screens and platforms. We continue to work closely with our clients towards fully syndicated reporting of all key metrics. But Total Audience is not just about measuring audiences. It's also about ensuring that our Total Audience metrics support the complete process of buying and selling media from planning to activation to assessing the return on the investment. Our Total Audience system underpins all 3 of these activities as the visual on the webcast slide shows.
The loop begins with our measurement data feeding our advertising clients' planning systems, helping them to find the right consumers based on demographics or behavioral segmentation as well as helping them to allocate their resources efficiently across platforms to reach their desired audience. From there, the focus to the system turns to activation, enabled by our 2015 eXelate acquisition and now delivered via the Nielsen Marketing Cloud. This should [ph] enable advertisers to target specific audiences in a programmatic environment and to activate their buy through the eXelate pipes to go directly to ad servers.
The next step is to measure effectiveness. How well did the ad reach the target audience? What effect did the ad have on the brand? What was the sales lift? What was the ROI on the media spend? This is a continuous cycle: plan, activate, measure, then repeat. This is the process that our Total Audience Measurement system supports. And with that in mind, I'll mention a few highlights that illustrate the recent progress we've made on our strategy.
In the second quarter, our national TV business remained rock solid. While our data shows that the average U.S. adult is watching 3 minutes less of linear television compared to last year, it's still over 4.5 hours per day. With the broadest reach, television remains a critical component for brand-building campaigns. Meanwhile, digital advertising, with its promise of precision, continues to grow at a double-digit pace. That's despite the recent industry concerns related to digital advertising fraud and viewability that appear to have slowed down the shift in spend from traditional media. For us, wherever the advertising dollars flow, we'll be there to measure the audience.
Last week, we announced that we've integrated 3 leading providers of viewability metrics, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science and Moat into our Digital Ad Ratings system, making it much easier for our clients to know the delivery of viewable impressions to their target consumers. Another highlight in the quarter for Digital Ad Ratings relates to Hulu. In May, Hulu announced that they're partnering with us to use our Digital Ad Ratings system to measure living room impressions delivered over-the-top through connected TV devices, such as Roku, Apple TV, PlayStation or smart TVs. 70% of Hulu's viewing now occurs on connected TVs, whereas earlier in their existence, nearly all Hulu viewing took place on a PC. This serves as yet another example of why our clients need a Total Audience view of a changing market.
We continue to see strong demand of our measurement of subscription video-on-demand. With 52% of households now subscribing to a subscription video-on-demand service, audience data is more valuable than ever to studios and content owners seeking to fully monetize their programs for this growing audience. Late in the second quarter, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, we unveiled streaming ratings for the Lionsgate production of Orange Is the New Black. The fourth season's premiere episode was watched by 6.7 million people in the U.S. This is comparable to the second most viewed cable drama on TV, behind HBO's Game of Thrones. This is valuable information for studios if they look to monetize their content.
On Digital Content Ratings, our release of syndicated data to participating clients occurred in late May, on schedule, and we remain on track to syndicate Total Content Ratings for participating clients in August. We have strong pipeline of additional clients, both big media and digital natives, integrating the SDK that enables this measurement. Exciting to see how these new metrics help our clients understand and leverage the changing ways audiences are consuming content.
For example, was it recorded on a DVR and watched a month later? Or did the consumer view it through their cable provider's video-on-demand service? Or was it viewed over-the-top via a Roku streaming player? This level of granularity helps our clients align their strategy with their audiences' viewing habits.
Regarding the effort to update the currency data used to plan and measure advertising, in June, we had yet another positive and productive meeting with key industry stakeholders. Clients continue to be supportive of Total Audience and are engaged in moving the industry toward a new rating standard in time for their 2017 upfront negotiations.
Internationally, we remain on track to have Digital Ad Ratings in 25 countries by year's end, and we recently confirmed the contract extensions for our TV Audience Measurement services in Australia and Sweden.
Finally, last quarter, we mentioned our agreement with DISH Network to license their set-top box data, supporting our local and national TV rating services. This quarter, we're pleased to announce that we recently reached agreement with Charter Communications to license their set-top box data, further expanding our coverage. Both of these data sets will help strengthen our TV measurement products as well as help fuel our Marketing Effectiveness analytics.
Speaking to Marketing Effectiveness, we had another strong quarter with constant currency revenue growth of 15%. As a reminder, this is where we help clients plan, activate and evaluate the return on their media investments. The Nielsen Marketing Cloud brings all of these capabilities together in one system. It's off to a great start in the U.S., and in June, we launched our cloud system in Europe. This is a dynamite part of our business and it has a lot of runway.
Shifting to the Buy business. Similar to the media world, the fast-moving consumer goods industry is also seeing fragmentation, driven by new channels and shifts in consumer purchasing behavior. Adapting to this changing environment, we're focused on providing both manufacturer and retailer clients with a complete view of consumers, whether they buy in store, out of home or online. Our focus here is on coverage. We call it Total Consumer Measurement, analogous to Total Audience Measurement in our Watch business.
Our investments in coverage in the emerging markets continue to be a significant growth driver. In the second quarter, our growth was fueled by both local and multinational clients as well as steps we've taken to strengthen our portfolio through innovation. Retailer clients are another important part of our Buy growth strategy as the growing world of technology for consumers, retailers and manufacturers is changing the path to purchase.
At the end of June, we launched our Brandbank capabilities in the U.S. This has been a very successful business for us in Europe, and we're excited about the U.S. launch. Recall that Brandbank is focused on supporting retailers and their e-commerce product content needs. As an example, Brandbank can now connect directly to Walmart's systems as an approved content service provider, supporting Walmart's omnichannel strategy. For our manufacturer clients, Brandbank will collect, manage and submit content on their behalf, aligned with Walmart's requirements for data attributes and formats.
During the quarter, we also welcomed Whole Foods to our retail client roster, leveraging our market share data and analytics. We're helping them build on their strength with natural and organic products as they double down on consumer-centric category management. Health and wellness is of growing importance to many of our manufacturing clients, and our work with Whole Foods adds to our ability to help them drive growth in these product segments.
When we look at the developed markets, the environment continues to be challenging. In the absence of strong top line growth, our clients are looking to find efficiencies in their business, which in some instances includes their marketing, sales or innovation processes. One action we took in the quarter was to realign our Buy business globally in the clusters of countries with similar market characteristics. We also accelerated our investments in our Buy business' connected system, which will enhance the value and speed we bring to our clients. I'll spend a few minutes on this connected system.
Our business is focused on measuring and improving performance for our clients, understanding what is happening is the first step. We answer this with our measurement of sales and market share. Once our clients know what happens, the next question is why. What were the key drivers of the results? Our analytics will automatically pinpoint the key drivers, including marketing and sales activity, competitive activity and market trends. Then the most important question is what next. What does the need to do to improve?
These are all capabilities that we have in the market today, but our opportunity is to make them more valuable for our clients by connecting them into one fully integrated system underpinned by one source of truth that enables more speed and efficiency for Nielsen and more importantly, for our clients. That's what our connected system will do.
Clients have been enthusiastic in their feedback and they want it now, and that's the key reason why we've accelerated the pace of our investment in this platform-based connected system. We begin with an initial group of clients who will be on board by the end of the year with more transitioning through 2017. A faster, more efficient system creates more value for our clients and bolsters our position as the leading global provider of measurement and analytics to the FMCG industry.
I want to close with a few words on corporate social responsibility. We know many long-term investors are putting more emphasis on this lately, and we agree with you. The way I often say it to our teams internally is that companies need to care for the communities they rely on for their business. Our company lives this out in a variety of ways, focusing on education, nutrition, diversity and inclusion and access to technology.
In May, we published our first global responsibility report, which describes our efforts in detail. One of our recent efforts was Nielsen Global Impact Day. On June 2, as part of our fifth annual day of service, over 23,000 Nielsen associates participated in more than 1,400 volunteer activities across 92 countries. I'm extremely proud of them for their commitment and their service.
So those are my comments on the quarter. We're looking forward to the rest of the year with continued confidence and excitement about the progress to come. Over to you, Jamere."

We had another solid quarter, reflecting consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model that continues to deliver solid results through the cycles.First, let me cover our total company results for the second quarter. On the left side",1214,"Thank you, Mitch. We had another solid quarter, reflecting consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model that continues to deliver solid results through the cycles.
First, let me cover our total company results for the second quarter. On the left side of the page, our results on U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just under $1.6 billion, up 2.4% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in both our Watch and Buy segments and offset partially by the impact of foreign exchange. Net income was $114 million and net income per share was $0.31, which was flat versus the second quarter of 2015. Our net income per share results were driven by solid revenue growth, margin expansion and our share buyback program, offset by restructuring charges related to the realignment of the markets and our Buy segment.
Moving to the right side of the page, on a non-GAAP basis, revenue was up 4.5% constant currency. We have delivered 40 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth, driven by strength in our core business and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 5.8% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued momentum in Audience Measurement of Video and Text and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew 3.3% constant currency, led by continued strength in the emerging markets.
Adjusted EBITDA was $490 million, up 6.5% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.7%, up 60 basis points on a constant currency basis with margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments. Our productivity pipeline remains strong, and we're confident in our guidance of 50 to 70 basis points of constant currency margin expansion for the total company in 2016.
Adjusted net income was $257 million, up 6.6% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.71, up 9.2% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program.
Finally, we generated free cash flow of $98 million compared to $156 million in the second part of last year. This was primarily driven by working capital timing and CapEx investments in our growth initiatives in Watch and Buy. And we remain on track to deliver our 2016 guidance of approximately $950 million. Again, a solid quarter of consistent and steady results.
Next, I'll move to the segments and then provide a little more color. The first is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $744 million, up 5.8% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 7.9% on a constant currency basis. Audio was up nearly 2% constant currency, while delivering solid margins and free cash flow. Marketing Effectiveness was up 15.1% constant currency behind strong results from the Nielsen Marketing Cloud and Nielsen Catalina Solutions product offerings. The investments we have made in Marketing Effectiveness continue to drive Watch segment growth, and we're seeing strong demand from both publishers and advertisers.
As expected, Other Watch is about a 2 points drag on Watch revenue on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter of 2015. Watch adjusted EBITDA was $332 million, up 6.4% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded 24 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage while investing in the business.
Let me say just a few words about our key initiatives in Watch. First, Total Audience has strong momentum. Digital Ad Ratings has been widely adopted by the industry as a way of measuring reach and frequency on ad campaigns. And in the second quarter, Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 53%, led by strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners.
Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, continues to gain traction with key clients for both Video and Text measurement. In the quarter, we signed new digital platform clients such as Kick [ph] and Mashable. In addition, we reached an important milestone with the successful release of syndicated data to participating clients.
Our efforts to provide our clients with more capability and flexibility in measuring content and campaigns is a key growth driver for our business. Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy, and Marketing Effectiveness continued to deliver impressive growth. We remain confident in our 2016 Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis.
Turning to Buy. Second quarter total Buy revenue was $852 million, up 3.3% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $582 million, up just under 1% on a constant currency basis as we saw modest growth in core measurement, offset by softness in discretionary spend. We are continuing to invest by realigning our market clusters and accelerating the development of our connected system, which will enable us to create a faster-growing, higher-margin business in the developed markets.
Our business in the emerging markets was $270 million, up 8.9% on a constant currency basis. In the emerging markets, growth was broad based with double-digit growth in Latin America, China and Southeast Asia, along with high single digits in Eastern Europe and India.
Buy EBITDA was $166 million, up 6.4% constant currency. Our Buy-adjusted EBITDA margins were up 57 basis points on a constant currency basis in the quarter. This is the eighth straight quarter of Buy margin expansion as emerging markets continue to scale and we execute on the productivity pipeline that I referenced earlier. We remain confident in our 2016 Buy guidance of 3.5% to 5.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis.
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risks, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 210 basis points drag on revenue and 180 basis points drag on EBITDA, which were both in the ballpark of what we laid out on our last earnings call. The current spot rates held constant through 2016, and we expect 170 basis points drag on revenue and an 80 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is slightly worse than the forecast we gave last quarter.
Moving to 2016 guidance, we are maintaining our annual guidance. We remain confident in our plan to deliver on all of the operational elements that we laid out at the beginning of the year, highlighted by revenue growth of 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis, adjusted net income per share of $2.83 to $2.93 a share and free cash flow of roughly $950 million.
So to wrap up, overall, we had another quarter of consistent, steady revenue growth and margin expansion. In addition, we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Amy."

Well, I mentioned in my opening comments that our national TV business remains rock solid. And while television isn't the only thing that those clients that you've referred to are focused on, it's still the biggest part of their business. And so it's still the centerpiece of those contract renewals. But as we said in previous quarters when we've updated this group on how those contract renewals are going, increasingly, the conversation is around our Total Audience framework. They want to know how we're going to measure television but also how we're going to measure their content -- audiences for their content across all these additional screens and platforms where their content is now viewable by consumers. And you see that reflected, as you would expect, in their structure of our contract renewals these days and increasingly so as time goes on and Total Audience becomes more used and more real in the marketplace. So that's the change in the texture of those contracts and those contract discussions. We -- they'll continue, at the same time, to be very pleased with the terms of those contract renewals. Length of the contract, fairly in line with what's historically been the case. And then, the terms in terms of the annual increases in price, also are fairly well in line. What's different is the breadth of measurement that our service will provide. If you go back many years, it was all about television, and that's very much not the case today. It's now all about video and wherever that the video content happens to be viewed."

We were pleased with DISH that we announced last quarter because, of course, DISH is a service that's available to consumers nationally, and so it gives us that breadth. And Charter gives us a little bit more depth in certain parts of the country where Charter is the provider to markets in cities, states, communities out there. We're going to continue to look for additional providers to add into the mix. The good news is we don't need them all. And as we talk with the additional options, the other companies who have set-top box data available, yes, we're going to continue to look at them as almost pieces to a puzzle and we need to look for the best configuration, not just, as you referenced, the biggest quantity of data. So DISH is a great start. Charter is a fabulous addition. We're looking to add 1 or 2 more in the quarters ahead, and we'll be sure to keep this group updated on our progress on that front. So already, even where we stand right now, we're happy with what we're going to be able to do with these 2 existing data sets in terms of both bolstering our national and local television Audience Measurement products as we look out into next year and beyond as well as using these data sets to help drive our Marketing Effectiveness business, which continues its very strong double-digit growth quarter after quarter. So yes, we love the direction we're going. As far as margins, one thing we mentioned on prior calls is, while on the one hand, licensing these set-top box data sets is a new expense in our budget, on the other hand, it also helps relieve some of the long-term pressure on our panels. They don't have to bear as much of the weight, if you will, when the market requires additional granularity and they're calling for us to increase the size of our panels. Increasing our traditional panels, that's a very extensive, a very expensive thing to do. And so by bringing big -- these big data sets from the set-top box data providers into the mix for our measurement service, we don't have to increase the size of our panels as much going forward as we otherwise would have. And so that avoidance of future cost helps offset the cost of licensing set-top data as we bring it into the picture."

One is measurement in video of logos for both brands and for sports teams and franchises. And the reason this is important is because there is an important trend that's also happening as it relates to native advertising. And in essence, what these guys are doing is native advertising related to sports. And in sports, that is the measurement of logos and signage. In addition to that, they provide sponsorship valuation and analytics to teams and leagues and rights holders. And sports is a big business. The combination of media rights, sponsorships and analytics is a big business that we're very interested in from an analytics standpoint. What we've seen in our data inside the company is that 93 of the top 100 live TV events were sports, and that was up from probably 14 or 15 just a few years ago, and this is an opportunity for us to connect our Total Audience data and drive tremendous value for our clients, so an important contribution and an important add to the Nielsen profile.

And then, the growth that we continue to see with the digital natives who are leveraging the different components of our Total Audience Measurement framework, Digital Content Ratings being the newest comer on the block but Digital Ad Ratings being a really key component of that growth, these are the, really, key drivers. Jamere mentioned some of the progress we've made in the quarter with Digital Ad Ratings, for example, Kick and Mashable coming onboard. We also saw international expansion with both Snapchat and Twitter. I mentioned Hulu, leveraging Digital Ad Ratings for over-the-top device viewing measurement. There's a number of other things happening on this front, including one very important thing that we referenced briefly last quarter that I'll just highlight it again, which is the U.S.' largest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, went live with Digital Ad Ratings on July 1.

Yes, for -- on your first question regarding Charter, the agreement that we've reached recently with Charter is specific to the Charter part of the business. If we can expand in the future to include their newly acquired Time Warner Cable franchise, obviously, we're interested in doing that. But so far, the focus has been on what has historically been the Charter Communications part of the business. On the other question, it's a great one, on the Buy part of our business, in terms of PPG moving more to subscription models. And so there's a lot of things happening there. I assume what you're referring to, by the way, is subscription models in terms of how they provide their products to their consumers, Dan. So if I'm misinterpreting that, let me know. There's some really interesting things happening there. And probably, the one that's been most prominent in the news lately is Dollar Shave Club. Not that, that's new, but of course, Unilever is taking a lot of interest in Dollar Shave Club and acquired them for a pretty big price tag, from what I saw in the press. So that's one of the big trends that we see emerging. Obviously, Amazon is fueling that trend in part with, I think they call it Amazon Dash, and it allows consumers to have a button, a physical button in their household where they can just press the button, it will automatically reorder a product, which is not purely a subscription model, but it's certainly heading in that direction. And I think more and more companies are going to be at least experimenting with this. I think the positive piece of this, from my perspective, Dan, is the emphasis that it puts on branded goods in the marketplace because I think one of the key struggles for the FMCG industry broadly is the growth of private label, which has abated somewhat in the U.S. market in the last couple of years but continues to grow in terms of its market share around the world. And this is obviously not good news for the big manufacturing clients that we work with whose businesses are built around brands. So subscription models really put a lot more emphasis on the importance of brands because you're going to sign up to be a continuous user of that product. Brand equity and brand attachment are probably going to be a stronger magnet in that business model versus buying the product week in, week out by going to a grocery store where you might be lured away more by price. So we're interested to see how this unfolds. Our Total Consumer Measurement approach, that whole philosophy in the system platform that underpins it, we'll be able to measure it either way because again, part of the focus area is on coverage. And in developed world, the biggest coverage objective right now is all around e-com where a lot of the subscription models would show up. So that's going to be interesting. I love to see the FMCG industry experimenting with business models. I think it's healthy. In fact, I hope I see more of it going forward."

Thanks for the question. First, for those who may not have seen it, what we announced a couple of weeks ago is that we've moved to that much closer integration with 3 of the leading providers of viewability metrics to the marketplace, and the 3 are called DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science and Moat. And what these firms do is they measure whether -- when ad was served to a consumer, whether that impression resulted in the ad actually being viewable on the screen and what portion or for how long. And so what's what viewability refers to, as I'm sure many of you already know. So what we've done is we've integrated these 3 leading providers into our Digital Ad Ratings system in order to make that ability to see viewable impressions much more seamless, much easier for our clients, and we've gotten very good feedback on that announcement. We've integrated 3, not just one, because right now, this is still a very fragmented marketplace. There's quite a number of different providers of viewability metrics. And so we felt it was important to give our clients a choice. And it's a big part of our philosophy to have as much openness to our platforms as we can to the extent that it serves the interest of our clients, and so you see that reflected in these 3. As you look forward, we'll keep an eye in this part of the market and we'll see how it continues to unfold. But right now, we like this arrangement where we're partnering with these 3 leading providers and their feedback again, from our clients as we gather the equity [ph] right."

And then the second thing is I was really intrigued by your early comments here, Mitch, where you said digital advertising, maybe there's been a slowdown in the shift to digital platforms. And media dynamics data around the upfront in television would support that because it looks like there was $1 billion added to the TV market in the upfront this year. So I'm actually really -- could you give us some granularity given Nielsen's unique seat [ph] on this comment about how you think there might be a slowing shift of advertising to digital platforms?"

That's really what it all comes down to. We're focused on executing on our strategy. Total Audience Measurement, we love the feedback we're getting from our clients in terms of that strategy being perfectly aligned with what they need. And our teams have executed extraordinarily well. They've been hitting their milestones. As I mentioned earlier, we syndicated the reporting of Digital Content Ratings on schedule. We are on track to syndicate reporting of Total Content Ratings on schedule. And I know that -- if I go back a year or 2 ago, we talked about where we were going to go with Total Audience Measurement, there was a lot of skepticism around -- okay, maybe the concept sounds good, but will Nielsen really be able to deliver? And well, we have. We have delivered and we're proud of that. Now our work isn't done. We still have a lot more to do. But I think our execution is the key reason for the strength in our business right now. I wouldn't attribute it to anybody else's misstep or weakness. I really would attribute it to the strength of our execution and the fit with our strategy with what our clients really need. So we feel great about that piece. On your second question regarding this perceived shift in the marketplace between traditional media and digital advertising, I think it is in part driven by these concerns around digital advertising, fraud, that includes nonhuman traffic and there's also concern around blockers. And the viewability seems to be the most prominent of all the concerns out there, and that's given some pause to people as they allocate their budgets going forward. I also think another driver, which I did not mention in my opening comments, is just a reacquaintance in the industry advertisers in the industry, but the importance of reach. So digital gives you incredible precision when you can get it right, but it's hard to get both precision and reach in a digital environment, whereas television, while it may not offer the precision of the digital world, at least not yet, still is the best place to get reach. And if you're a brand manager and a brand builder, you know that reach is still your first priority. And so I think that reacquaintance with the importance of reach is one of the reasons why we've seen, yes, that perceived shift, a little bit of slowing of the growth in digital and people still investing heavily in good old-fashioned television because it gets the job done and there's a good ROI on that media investment. So again, wherever they go, however the shift happens, if it accelerates in one area or if it moves back in another direction, one of the reasons why we love our Total Audience Measurement framework is because we cover it all. And we not only enable people to see these trends in shifts, but we're able to connect it with the return and help them really drive the most efficient, most effective allocation of the resources, whether they're buying or whether they're on the sell side of this equation."

But given the progress being made in the world around us with regard to technology and all the new capabilities made available, yes, that's where we see this opportunity to automate a lot of this delivery. And in concert with that, as I mentioned with this connected system, also connect these great individual pieces of our portfolio into an integrated interoperable system. So by connecting our individual products into a system and then automating a lot of that delivery where our system connects directly into our clients' systems, feeding directly their key business processes with our measurement data and with our analytics, you move from what has traditionally been much people-as-a-service business model to more of data-as-a-service or software-as-a-service business model, which, of course, drives efficiency and speed and agility everywhere you look.

Thanks, Tom. So what we saw in the upfronts this year with some of those types of things that you referenced is pretty typical of what we see in the upfronts pretty much every year, where each of the individual media companies on the sell side of this equation look to differentiate themselves, and they look to differentiate themselves sometimes at their own proprietary metrics. And by the way, in my opinion, that's smart. That's what I would do if I were them. If you're on the other side of this equation though, if you're an agency or an advertiser, you're a buyer, you're looking to be able to compare across all the different places where you could invest your money. And so these proprietary metrics aren't so useful sometimes if you're on the buying side of this because yes, you don't know how to compare them to what the other media company or the other digital platform is offering. That's where Nielsen comes in. We offer that ability to compare across all the different options with these comparable metrics across all the different media companies and also across all the screens and platforms where consumers go to consumers' content. Now having said that, yes, some of these proprietary metrics that some of those companies that you mentioned are touting in the marketplace, they are, in fact, powered by some of the capabilities from our portfolio and especially, our Marketing Effectiveness portfolio. The analytics capabilities that are there, our ability to combine our understanding of what consumers watch and how it connects to what consumers buy, often drives some of these, we often refer to as, secondary guarantees in the marketplace. They're not guarantees that replace the primary guarantee, which is based on the currency metric that Nielsen provides. But there's a secondary guarantee that's added to that as people seek to target specific groups of consumers maybe based on behavioral characteristics or purchasing behavior."

422760,370292048,1012290,"Nielsen Holdings plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Nielsen Holdings plc","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everyone.

Our second quarter results mark our 40th consecutive quarter or 10 years of constant currency revenue growth. Once again, this quarter, we also delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth, driven by our scalable consistent business model and our continuous focus on productivity. These results reflect the continued client and industry adoption of our Total Audience Measurement framework, ongoing strength in emerging markets and strong execution by our teams around the globe.
Our long-standing focus on measuring our clients' performance and helping them improve their performance remains as valuable as ever. And as we look into the second half of the year and beyond, we have continued confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute.
Looking at the second quarter, we had revenue growth of 4.5% on a constant currency basis. In Watch, second quarter revenues increased almost 6% on a constant currency basis, including a 7.9% increase in Audience Measurement of Video and Text. Buy segment revenues grew 3.3% on a constant currency basis, driven by 8.9% growth in emerging markets and just under 1% in developed markets.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.5% constant currency, reflecting our ongoing productivity initiatives and our scalable business model. Adjusted net income per share grew just over 9% constant currency to $0.71.
Driving shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy remains a key priority. While we continue to invest consistently in our future growth, we're also focused on returning capital to shareholders, and during the quarter, we continued our steady rhythm of share buybacks. And as of June 30, we still had approximately $550 million remaining under our existing authorization. Lastly, we're reiterating our guidance for 2016.
On our last call, we talked about the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve and the great job our teams are doing in leveraging these changes as a means for progress. Historically, we've talked about change more frequently on the Watch side of the business. But in fact, in both the Watch and Buy, our teams are focused on continuously renewing and improving our products and systems to keep pace with changing client needs. So let's spend a few minutes on this.
In Watch, change continues to be driven by media fragmentation as consumers now have the ability to view content across more channels, devices, platforms and even time periods. That means more things to measure, which creates more opportunity for us. Our clients want us to measure all of it: TV, mobile, video-on-demand, over-the-top viewing, video, audio, text and want to see measures for each of these individually as well as combined into one metric, and that's exactly what our Total Audience Measurement system does.
Bringing Total Audience Measurement to the market has not been easy. It's been a multiyear process, and our teams have been executing extraordinarily well. We now have in the market a comprehensive system that provides comparable measurement of all ads and content across all screens and platforms. We continue to work closely with our clients towards fully syndicated reporting of all key metrics. But Total Audience is not just about measuring audiences. It's also about ensuring that our Total Audience metrics support the complete process of buying and selling media, from planning to activation to assessing the return on the investment. Our Total Audience system underpins all 3 of these activities, as the visual on the webcast slide shows.
The loop begins with our measurement data feeding our advertising clients' planning systems, helping them to find the right consumers based on demographics or behavioral segmentation as well as helping them to allocate their resources efficiently across platforms to reach their desired audience. From there, the focus of the system turns to activation, enabled by our 2015 eXelate acquisition and now delivered via the Nielsen Marketing Cloud. This should [ph] enable advertisers to target specific audiences in a programmatic environment and to activate their buy through the eXelate pipes to go directly to ad servers.
The next step is to measure effectiveness. How well did the ad reach the target audience? What effect did the ad have on the brand? What was the sales lift? What was the ROI on the media spend? This is a continuous cycle: plan, activate, measure, then repeat. This is the process that our Total Audience Measurement system supports. And with that in mind, I'll mention a few highlights that illustrate the recent progress we've made on our strategy.
In the second quarter, our national TV business remained rock solid. While our data shows that the average U.S. adult is watching 3 minutes less of linear television compared to last year, it's still over 4.5 hours per day. With the broadest reach, television remains a critical component for brand-building campaigns. Meanwhile, digital advertising, with its promise of precision, continues to grow at a double-digit pace. That's despite the recent industry concerns related to digital advertising fraud and viewability that appear to have slowed down the shift in spend from traditional media. For us, wherever the advertising dollars flow, we'll be there to measure the audience.
Last week, we announced that we've integrated 3 leading providers of viewability metrics, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science and Moat, into our Digital Ad Ratings system, making it much easier for our clients to know the delivery of viewable impressions to their target consumers. Another highlight in the quarter for Digital Ad Ratings relates to Hulu. In May, Hulu announced that they're partnering with us to use our Digital Ad Ratings system to measure living room impressions delivered over-the-top through connected TV devices such as Roku, Apple TV, PlayStation or smart TVs. 70% of Hulu's viewing now occurs on connected TVs, whereas earlier in their existence, nearly all Hulu viewing took place on a PC. This serves as yet another example of why our clients need a Total Audience view of a changing market.
We continue to see strong demand of our measurement of subscription video-on-demand. With 52% of households now subscribing to a subscription video-on-demand service, audience data is more valuable than ever to studios and content owners seeking to fully monetize their programs for this growing audience. Late in the second quarter, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, we unveiled streaming ratings for the Lionsgate production of Orange Is the New Black. The fourth season's premiere episode was watched by 6.7 million people in the U.S. This is comparable to the second most viewed cable drama on TV, behind HBO's Game of Thrones. This is valuable information for studios as they look to monetize their content.
On Digital Content Ratings, our release of syndicated data to participating clients occurred in late May, on schedule, and we remain on track to syndicate Total Content Ratings for participating clients in August. We have a strong pipeline of additional clients, both big media and digital natives, integrating the SDK that enables this measurement. Exciting to see how these new metrics help our clients understand and leverage the changing ways audiences are consuming content.
For example, was it recorded on a DVR and watched a month later? Or did the consumer view it through their cable provider's video-on-demand service? Or was it viewed over-the-top via a Roku streaming player? This level of granularity helps our clients align their strategy with their audiences' viewing habits.
Regarding the effort to update the currency data used to plan and measure advertising, in June, we had yet another positive and productive meeting with key industry stakeholders. Clients continue to be supportive of Total Audience and are engaged in moving the industry toward a new rating standard in time for their 2017 upfront negotiations.
Internationally, we remain on track to have Digital Ad Ratings in 25 countries by year's end, and we recently confirmed the contract extensions for our TV Audience Measurement services in Australia and Sweden.
Finally, last quarter, we mentioned our agreement with DISH Network to license their set-top box data, supporting our local and national TV rating services. This quarter, we're pleased to announce that we recently reached agreement with Charter Communications to license their set-top box data, further expanding our coverage. Both of these data sets will help strengthen our TV measurement products as well as help fuel our Marketing Effectiveness analytics.
Speaking to Marketing Effectiveness, we had another strong quarter with constant currency revenue growth of 15%. As a reminder, this is where we help clients plan, activate and evaluate the return on their media investments. The Nielsen Marketing Cloud brings all of these capabilities together in one system. It's off to a great start in the U.S., and in June, we launched our cloud system in Europe. This is a dynamite part of our business and it has a lot of runway.
Shifting to the Buy business. Similar to the media world, the fast-moving consumer goods industry is also seeing fragmentation, driven by new channels and shifts in consumer purchasing behavior. Adapting to this changing environment, we're focused on providing both manufacturer and retailer clients with a complete view of consumers, whether they buy in store, out of home or online. Our focus here is on coverage. We call it Total Consumer Measurement, analogous to Total Audience Measurement in our Watch business.
Our investments in coverage in the emerging markets continue to be a significant growth driver. In the second quarter, our growth was fueled by both local and multinational clients as well as steps we've taken to strengthen our portfolio through innovation. Retailer clients are another important part of our Buy growth strategy as the growing world of technology for consumers, retailers and manufacturers is changing the path to purchase.
At the end of June, we launched our Brandbank capabilities in the U.S. This has been a very successful business for us in Europe, and we're excited about the U.S. launch. Recall that Brandbank is focused on supporting retailers and their e-commerce product content needs. As an example, Brandbank can now connect directly to Walmart's systems as an approved content service provider, supporting Walmart's omnichannel strategy. For our manufacturer clients, Brandbank will collect, manage and submit content on their behalf, aligned with Walmart's requirements for data attributes and formats.
During the quarter, we also welcomed Whole Foods to our retail client roster, leveraging our market share data and analytics. We're helping them build on their strength with natural and organic products as they double down on consumer-centric category management. Health and wellness is of growing importance to many of our manufacturing clients, and our work with Whole Foods adds to our ability to help them drive growth in these product segments.
When we look at the developed markets, the environment continues to be challenging. In the absence of strong top line growth, our clients are looking to find efficiencies in their business, which in some instances includes their marketing, sales or innovation processes. One action we took in the quarter was to realign our Buy business globally into clusters of countries with similar market characteristics. We also accelerated our investments in our Buy business' connected system, which will enhance the value and speed we bring to our clients. I'll spend a few minutes on this connected system.
Our business is focused on measuring and improving performance for our clients. Understanding what is happening is the first step. We answer this with our measurement of sales and market share. Once our clients know what happens, the next question is why. What were the key drivers of the results? Our analytics will automatically pinpoint the key drivers, including marketing and sales activity, competitive activity and market trends. Then the most important question is what next. What does the brand need to do to improve?
These are all capabilities that we have in the market today, but our opportunity is to make them more valuable for our clients by connecting them into one fully integrated system underpinned by one source of truth that enables more speed and efficiency for Nielsen and more importantly, for our clients. That's what our connected system will do.
Clients have been enthusiastic in their feedback and they want it now, and that's the key reason why we've accelerated the pace of our investment in this platform-based connected system. We begin with an initial group of clients who will be on board by the end of the year, with more transitioning through 2017. A faster, more efficient system creates more value for our clients and bolsters our position as the leading global provider of measurement and analytics to the FMCG industry.
I want to close with a few words on corporate social responsibility. We know many long-term investors are putting more emphasis on this lately, and we agree with you. The way I often say it to our teams internally is that companies need to care for the communities they rely on for their business. Our company lives this out in a variety of ways, focusing on education, nutrition, diversity and inclusion and access to technology.
In May, we published our first global responsibility report, which describes our efforts in detail. One of our recent efforts was Nielsen Global Impact Day. On June 2, as part of our fifth annual day of service, over 23,000 Nielsen associates participated in more than 1,400 volunteer activities across 92 countries. I'm extremely proud of them for their commitment and their service.
So those are my comments on the quarter. We're looking forward to the rest of the year with continued confidence and excitement about the progress to come. Over to you, Jamere."

We had another solid quarter, reflecting consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model that continues to deliver solid results through the cycles.First, let me cover our total company results for the second quarter. On the left side",1215,"Thank you, Mitch. We had another solid quarter, reflecting consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model that continues to deliver solid results through the cycles.
First, let me cover our total company results for the second quarter. On the left side of the page, our results on a U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just under $1.6 billion, up 2.4% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in both our Watch and Buy segments and offset partially by the impact of foreign exchange. Net income was $114 million and net income per share was $0.31, which was flat versus the second quarter of 2015. Our net income per share results were driven by solid revenue growth, margin expansion and our share buyback program, offset by restructuring charges related to the realignment of the markets in our Buy segment.
Moving to the right side of the page, on a non-GAAP basis, revenue was up 4.5% constant currency. We have delivered 40 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth, driven by strength in our core business and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 5.8% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued momentum in Audience Measurement of Video and Text and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew 3.3% constant currency, led by continued strength in the emerging markets.
Adjusted EBITDA was $490 million, up 6.5% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.7%, up 60 basis points on a constant currency basis with margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments. Our productivity pipeline remains strong, and we're confident in our guidance of 50 to 70 basis points of constant currency margin expansion for the total company in 2016.
Adjusted net income was $257 million, up 6.6% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.71, up 9.2% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program.
Finally, we generated free cash flow of $98 million compared to $156 million in the second quarter of last year. This was primarily driven by working capital timing and CapEx investments in our growth initiatives in Watch and Buy. And we remain on track to deliver our 2016 guidance of approximately $950 million. Again, a solid quarter of consistent and steady results.
Next, I'll move to the segments and provide a little more color. The first is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $744 million, up 5.8% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 7.9% on a constant currency basis. Audio was up nearly 2% constant currency, while delivering solid margins and free cash flow. Marketing Effectiveness was up 15.1% constant currency behind strong results from the Nielsen Marketing Cloud and Nielsen Catalina Solutions product offerings. The investments we have made in Marketing Effectiveness continue to drive Watch segment growth, and we're seeing strong demand from both publishers and advertisers.
As expected, Other Watch is about a 2 points drag on Watch revenue on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter of 2015. Watch adjusted EBITDA was $332 million, up 6.4% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded 24 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage while investing in the business.
Let me say just a few words about our key initiatives in Watch. First, Total Audience has strong momentum. Digital Ad Ratings has been widely adopted by the industry as a way of measuring reach and frequency on ad campaigns. And in the second quarter, Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 53%, led by strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners.
Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, continues to gain traction with key clients for both Video and Text measurement. In the quarter, we signed new digital platform clients such as Kick [ph] and Mashable. In addition, we reached an important milestone with the successful release of syndicated data to participating clients.
Our efforts to provide our clients with more capability and flexibility in measuring content and campaigns is a key growth driver for our business. Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy, and Marketing Effectiveness continued to deliver impressive growth. We remain confident in our 2016 Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis.
Turning to Buy. Second quarter total Buy revenue was $852 million, up 3.3% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $582 million, up just under 1% on a constant currency basis as we saw modest growth in core measurement, offset by softness in discretionary spend. We are continuing to invest by realigning our market clusters and accelerating the development of our connected system, which will enable us to create a faster-growing, higher-margin business in the developed markets.
Our business in the emerging markets was $270 million, up 8.9% on a constant currency basis. In the emerging markets, growth was broad based with double-digit growth in Latin America, China and Southeast Asia, along with high single digits in Eastern Europe and India.
Buy EBITDA was $166 million, up 6.4% constant currency. Our Buy-adjusted EBITDA margins were up 57 basis points on a constant currency basis in the quarter. This is the eighth straight quarter of Buy margin expansion as emerging markets continue to scale and we execute on the productivity pipeline that I referenced earlier. We remain confident in our 2016 Buy guidance of 3.5% to 5.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis.
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risks, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 210 basis points drag on revenue and a 180 basis points drag on EBITDA, which were both in the ballpark of what we laid out on our last earnings call. The current spot rates held constant through 2016, and we expect 170 basis points drag on revenue and an 80 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is slightly worse than the forecast we gave last quarter.
Moving to 2016 guidance, we are maintaining our annual guidance. We remain confident in our plan to deliver on all of the operational elements that we laid out at the beginning of the year, highlighted by revenue growth of 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis, adjusted net income per share of $2.83 to $2.93 a share and free cash flow of roughly $950 million.
So to wrap up, overall, we had another quarter of consistent, steady revenue growth and margin expansion. In addition, we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Amy."

Europe actually saw a modest growth in core measurement, while the discretionary side was a little soft, as it was in the U.S. And I'll just remind you that discretionary spend can be a little lumpy.

Well, I mentioned in my opening comments that our national TV business remains rock solid. And while television isn't the only thing that those clients that you've referred to are focused on, it's still the biggest part of their business. And so it's still the centerpiece of those contract renewals. But as we said in previous quarters when we've updated this group on how those contract renewals are going, increasingly, the conversation is around our Total Audience framework. They want to know how we're going to measure television but also how we're going to measure their content -- audiences for their content across all these additional screens and platforms where their content is now viewable by consumers. And you see that reflected, as you would expect, in their structure of our contract renewals these days and increasingly so as time goes on and Total Audience becomes more used and more real in the marketplace. So that's the change in the texture of those contracts and those contract discussions. We -- they'll continue, at the same time, to be very pleased with the terms of those contract renewals. Length of the contract, fairly in line with what's historically been the case. And then the terms in terms of the annual increases in price also are fairly well in line. What's different is the breadth of measurement that our service will provide. If you go back many years, it was all about television, and that's very much not the case today. It's now all about video and wherever that the video content happens to be viewed."

We were pleased with DISH that we announced last quarter because, of course, DISH is a service that's available to consumers nationally, and so it gives us that breadth. And Charter gives us a little bit more depth in certain parts of the country where Charter is the provider to markets in cities, states, communities out there. We're going to continue to look for additional providers to add into the mix. The good news is we don't need them all. And as we talk with the additional options, the other companies who have set-top box data available, yes, we're going to continue to look at them as almost pieces to a puzzle. And we need to look for the best configuration, not just, as you referenced, the biggest quantity of data. So DISH is a great start. Charter is a fabulous addition. We're looking to add 1 or 2 more in the quarters ahead, and we'll be sure to keep this group updated on our progress on that front. So already, even where we stand right now, we're happy with what we're going to be able to do with these 2 existing data sets in terms of both bolstering our national and local television Audience Measurement products as we look out into next year and beyond as well as using these data sets to help drive our Marketing Effectiveness business, which continues its very strong double-digit growth quarter after quarter. So yes, we love the direction we're going. As far as margins, one thing we mentioned on prior calls is, while on the one hand, licensing these set-top box data sets is a new expense in our budget, on the other hand, it also helps relieve some of the long-term pressure on our panels. They don't have to bear as much of the weight, if you will, when the market requires additional granularity and they're calling for us to increase the size of our panels. Increasing our traditional panels, that's a very extensive, a very expensive thing to do. And so by bringing big -- these big data sets from the set-top box data providers into the mix for our measurement service, we don't have to increase the size of our panels as much going forward as we otherwise would have. And so that avoidance of future cost helps offset the cost of licensing set-top data as we bring it into the picture."

One is measurement in video of logos for both brands and for sports teams and franchises. And the reason this is important is because there is an important trend that's also happening as it relates to native advertising. And in essence, what these guys are doing is native advertising related to sports. And in sports, that is the measurement of logos and signage. In addition to that, they provide sponsorship valuation and analytics to teams and leagues and rights holders. And sports is a big business. The combination of media rights, sponsorships and analytics is a big business that we're very interested in from an analytics standpoint. What we've seen in our data inside the company is that 93 of the top 100 live TV events were sports, and that was up from probably 14 or 15 just a few years ago, and this is an opportunity for us to connect our Total Audience data and drive tremendous value for our clients, so an important contribution and an important add to the Nielsen profile.

And just as you referenced, that's reflective of both sides of our business, the traditional media companies, the media conglomerates. Back to the question asked before, our contract renewals with the big media companies remain solid. And then, the growth that we continue to see with the digital natives who are leveraging the different components of our Total Audience Measurement framework, Digital Content Ratings being the newest comer on the block but Digital Ad Ratings being a really key component of that growth, these are the really key drivers. Jamere mentioned some of the progress we've made in the quarter with Digital Ad Ratings, for example, Kick [ph] and Mashable coming onboard. We also saw international expansion with both Snapchat and Twitter. I mentioned Hulu leveraging Digital Ad Ratings for over-the-top device viewing measurement. There's a number of other things happening on this front, including one very important thing that we referenced briefly last quarter that I'll just highlight it again, which is the U.S.' largest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, went live with Digital Ad Ratings on July 1. And so that's a big milestone in our progress. And we continue to be very strong with all the top U.S. advertisers. So these things are growing at a very healthy rate.

Yes, for -- on your first question regarding Charter, the agreement that we've reached recently with Charter is specific to the Charter part of the business. If we can expand in the future to include their newly acquired Time Warner Cable franchise, obviously, we're interested in doing that. But so far, the focus has been on what has historically been the Charter Communications part of the business. On the other question, it's a great one, on the Buy part of our business, in terms of PPG (sic) [ CPG ] moving more to subscription models. And so there's a lot of things happening there. I assume what you're referring to, by the way, is subscription models in terms of how they provide their products to their consumers, Dan. So if I'm misinterpreting that, let me know. There's some really interesting things happening there. And probably, the one that's been most prominent in the news lately is Dollar Shave Club. Not that that's new, but of course, Unilever is taking a lot of interest in Dollar Shave Club and acquired them for a pretty big price tag, from what I saw in the press. So that's one of the big trends that we see emerging. Obviously, Amazon is fueling that trend in part with, I think they call it Amazon Dash, and it allows consumers to have a button, a physical button in their household where they can just press the button, it will automatically reorder a product, which is not purely a subscription model, but it's certainly heading in that direction. And I think more and more companies are going to be at least experimenting with this. I think the positive piece of this, from my perspective, Dan, is the emphasis that it puts on branded goods in the marketplace because I think one of the key struggles for the FMCG industry broadly is the growth of private label, which has abated somewhat in the U.S. market in the last couple of years but continues to grow in terms of its market share around the world. And this is obviously not good news for the big manufacturing clients that we work with whose businesses are built around brands. So subscription models really put a lot more emphasis on the importance of brands because you're going to sign up to be a continuous user of that product. Brand equity and brand attachment are probably going to be a stronger magnet in that business model versus buying the product week in, week out by going to a grocery store where you might be lured away more by price. So we're interested to see how this unfolds. Our Total Consumer Measurement approach, that whole philosophy and the system platform that underpins it, we'll be able to measure it either way because again, part of the focus there is on coverage. And in the developed world, the biggest coverage objective right now is all around e-com, where a lot of these subscription models would show up. So that's going to be interesting. I love to see the FMCG industry experimenting with business models. I think it's healthy. In fact, I hope I see more of it going forward."

Thanks for the question. First, for those who may not have seen it, what we announced a couple of weeks ago is that we've moved to that much closer integration with 3 of the leading providers of viewability metrics to the marketplace, and the 3 are called DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science and Moat. And what these firms do is they measure whether -- when ad was served to a consumer, whether that impression resulted in the ad actually being viewable on the screen and what portion or for how long. And so what's what viewability refers to, as I'm sure many of you already know. So what we've done is we've integrated these 3 leading providers into our Digital Ad Ratings system in order to make that ability to see viewable impressions much more seamless, much easier for our clients, and we've gotten very good feedback on that announcement. We've integrated 3, not just one, because right now, this is still a very fragmented marketplace. There's quite a number of different providers of viewability metrics. And so we felt it was important to give our clients a choice. And it's a big part of our philosophy to have as much openness to our platforms as we can to the extent that it serves the interest of our clients, and so you see that reflected in these 3. As you look forward, we'll keep an eye in this part of the market and we'll see how it continues to unfold. But right now, we like this arrangement where we're partnering with these 3 leading providers, and the feedback we've gotten from our clients is we got it exactly right."

For a while, you were really neck and neck with your Total Audience and Total Content Rating with comScore. But given their accounting issues, I'm wondering if you think that part of your robust growth in Watch is attributable to their maybe distraction. And then the second thing is I was really intrigued by your early comments here, Mitch, where you said digital advertising, maybe there's been a slowdown in the shift to digital platforms. And the Media Dynamics data around the upfront in television would support that because it looks like there was $1 billion added to the TV market in the upfront this year. So I'm actually really -- could you give us some granularity given Nielsen's unique seat on this comment about how you think there might be a slowing shift of advertising to digital platforms?"

That's really what it all comes down to. We're focused on executing on our strategy. Total Audience Measurement, we love the feedback we're getting from our clients in terms of that strategy being perfectly aligned with what they need. And our teams have executed extraordinarily well. They've been hitting their milestones. As I mentioned earlier, we syndicated the reporting of Digital Content Ratings on schedule. We are on track to syndicate reporting of Total Content Ratings on schedule. And I know that -- if I go back a year or 2 ago, we talked about where we were going to go with Total Audience Measurement. There was a lot of skepticism around, okay, maybe the concept sounds good, but will Nielsen really be able to deliver? And well, we have. We have delivered and we're proud of that. Now our work isn't done. We still have a lot more to do. But I think our execution is the key reason for the strength in our business right now. I wouldn't attribute it to anybody else's misstep or weakness. I really would attribute it to the strength of our execution and the fit with our strategy with what our clients really need. So we feel great about that piece. On your second question regarding this perceived shift in the marketplace between traditional media and digital advertising, I think it is in part driven by these concerns around digital advertising, fraud, that includes nonhuman traffic, and there's also concern around blockers. And the viewability seems to be the most prominent of all the concerns out there, and that's given some pause to people as they allocate their budgets going forward. I also think another driver, which I did not mention in my opening comments, is just a reacquaintance in the industry -- advertisers in the industry, but the importance of reach. So digital gives you incredible precision when you can get it right, but it's hard to get both precision and reach in a digital environment, whereas television, while it may not offer the precision of the digital world, at least not yet, still is the best place to get reach. And if you're a brand manager and a brand builder, you know that reach is still your first priority. And so I think that reacquaintance with the importance of reach is one of the reasons why we've seen, yes, that perceived shift, a little bit of slowing of the growth in digital and people still investing heavily in good old-fashioned television because it gets the job done and there's a good ROI on that media investment. So again, wherever they go, however the shift happens, if it accelerates in one area or if it moves back in another direction, one of the reasons why we love our Total Audience Measurement framework is because we cover it all. And we not only enable people to see these trends in shifts, but we're able to connect it with the return and help them really drive the most efficient, most effective allocation of their resources, whether they're buying or whether they're on the sell side of this equation."

Look, we're really pleased with the progress we're making on those objectives that you outlined in your question. If I step back from it, the way I think about this is we had traditionally been very much, especially on the Buy side of our business, by the way, a people-as-a-service business model and more manually intensive in terms of creating and delivering and then helping our clients ultimately leverage our products, in particular, our measurement products. That business has been a great business for a long time. But given the progress being made in the world around us with regard to technology and all the new capabilities made available, yes, that's where we see this opportunity to automate a lot of this delivery. And in concert with that, as I mentioned with this connected system, also connect these great individual pieces of our portfolio into an integrated interoperable system. So by connecting our individual products into a system and then automating a lot of that delivery where our system connects directly into our clients' systems, feeding directly their key business processes with our measurement data and with our analytics, you move from what has traditionally been much people-as-a-service business model to more of data-as-a-service or software-as-a-service business model, which, of course, drives efficiency and speed and agility everywhere you look. And that's going to be beneficial to Nielsen and our shareholders, and it will also be beneficial to our clients, increasing the value of what we do and increasing the ability for us to help them drive growth and strengthen their business. So this is what we're focused on, and we've been making great progress on it. It's a multiyear process, and we will continue to provide updates on some of the key milestones as it unfolds over the course of the next year or 2."

In terms of the restructuring, we feel very confident that the things that we're doing from a restructuring standpoint in our Buy business do 2 things. One, it gives us fuel to invest and accelerate our investments in things like the connected Buy system, but also gives us fuel for the margin expansion, long-term targets that we talked about of 50 to 70 basis points.

And the reason why I point to that growth in the number of program episodes is the way this measurement -- this part of our measurement system works, is we only measure program episodes if it's specifically requested by one of our clients, that's the way this works. And so 9,500 different program episodes, a client has asked us to measure each of those. And so it shows really the very strong interest in and demand for this particular measurement component of our overall Total Audience Measurement system. Then to your second question regarding syndication in August of the Total Content Ratings portion of our Total Audience Measurement framework, really nothing else has to happen other than the passage of time on that. We're on track. Product capability is sound, it's proven. Clients need a little bit more time to continue to sort through the data and make sure they're comfortable with it, that they understand what it means for their business. And so that's the key issue right now is allowing sufficient time for the marketplace to see the data and understand and project what the likely impact is on their business and start to orient themselves around it.

Thanks, Tom. So what we saw in the upfronts this year with some of those types of things that you referenced is pretty typical of what we see in the upfronts pretty much every year, where each of the individual media companies on the sell side of this equation look to differentiate themselves, and they look to differentiate themselves sometimes with their own proprietary metrics. And by the way, in my opinion, that's smart. That's what I would do if I were them. If you're on the other side of this equation though, if you're an agency or an advertiser, you're a buyer, you're looking to be able to compare across all the different places where you could invest your money. And so these proprietary metrics aren't so useful sometimes if you're on the buying side of this because, yes, you don't know how to compare them to what the other media company or the other digital platform is offering. That's where Nielsen comes in. We offer that ability to compare across all the different options with these comparable metrics across all the different media companies and also across all the screens and platforms where consumers go to consume this content. Now having said that, yes, some of these proprietary metrics that some of those companies that you mentioned are touting in the marketplace, they are, in fact, powered by some of the capabilities from our portfolio and especially, our Marketing Effectiveness portfolio. The analytics capabilities that are there, our ability to combine our understanding of what consumers watch and how it connects to what consumers buy, often drives some of these, what we often refer to as, secondary guarantees in the marketplace. They're not guarantees that replace the primary guarantee, which is based on the currency metric that Nielsen provides. But there's a secondary guarantee that's added to that as people seek to target specific groups of consumers maybe based on behavioral characteristics or purchasing behavior."

422760,370292048,1012816,"Nielsen Holdings plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Nielsen Holdings plc","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results mark our 40th consecutive quarter or 10 years of constant currency revenue growth.

Our second quarter results mark our 40th consecutive quarter or 10 years of constant currency revenue growth. Once again, this quarter, we also delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth, driven by our scalable consistent business model and our continuous focus on productivity. These results reflect the continued client and industry adoption of our Total Audience Measurement framework, ongoing strength in emerging markets and strong execution by our teams around the globe.
Our long-standing focus on measuring our clients' performance and helping them improve their performance remains as valuable as ever. And as we look into the second half of the year and beyond, we have continued confidence in our strategy and our ability to execute.
Looking at the second quarter, we had revenue growth of 4.5% on a constant currency basis. In Watch, second quarter revenues increased almost 6% on a constant currency basis, including a 7.9% increase in Audience Measurement of Video and Text. Buy segment revenues grew 3.3% on a constant currency basis, driven by 8.9% growth in emerging markets and just under 1% in developed markets.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.5% constant currency, reflecting our ongoing productivity initiatives and our scalable business model. Adjusted net income per share grew just over 9% constant currency to $0.71.
Driving shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy remains a key priority. While we continue to invest consistently in our future growth, we're also focused on returning capital to shareholders, and during the quarter, we continued our steady rhythm of share buybacks. And as of June 30, we still had approximately $550 million remaining under our existing authorization. Lastly, we're reiterating our guidance for 2016.
On our last call, we talked about the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve and the great job our teams are doing in leveraging these changes as a means for progress. Historically, we've talked about change more frequently on the Watch side of the business. But in fact, in both the Watch and Buy, our teams are focused on continuously renewing and improving our products and systems to keep pace with changing client needs. So let's spend a few minutes on this.
In Watch, change continues to be driven by media fragmentation as consumers now have the ability to view content across more channels, devices, platforms and even time periods. That means more things to measure, which creates more opportunity for us. Our clients want us to measure all of it: TV, mobile, video-on-demand, over-the-top viewing, video, audio, text and want to see measures for each of these individually as well as combined into one metric, and that's exactly what our Total Audience Measurement system does.
Bringing Total Audience Measurement to the market has not been easy. It's been a multiyear process, and our teams have been executing extraordinarily well. We now have in the market a comprehensive system that provides comparable measurement of all ads and content across all screens and platforms. We continue to work closely with our clients towards fully syndicated reporting of all key metrics. But Total Audience is not just about measuring audiences. It's also about ensuring that our Total Audience metrics support the complete process of buying and selling media, from planning to activation to assessing the return on the investment. Our Total Audience system underpins all 3 of these activities, as the visual on the webcast slide shows.
The loop begins with our measurement data feeding our advertising clients' planning systems, helping them to find the right consumers based on demographics or behavioral segmentation as well as helping them to allocate their resources efficiently across platforms to reach their desired audience. From there, the focus of the system turns to activation, enabled by our 2015 eXelate acquisition and now delivered via the Nielsen Marketing Cloud. This should [ph] enable advertisers to target specific audiences in a programmatic environment and to activate their buy through the eXelate pipes to go directly to ad servers.
The next step is to measure effectiveness. How well did the ad reach the target audience? What effect did the ad have on the brand? What was the sales lift? What was the ROI on the media spend? This is a continuous cycle: plan, activate, measure, then repeat. This is the process that our Total Audience Measurement system supports. And with that in mind, I'll mention a few highlights that illustrate the recent progress we've made on our strategy.
In the second quarter, our national TV business remained rock solid. While our data shows that the average U.S. adult is watching 3 minutes less of linear television compared to last year, it's still over 4.5 hours per day. With the broadest reach, television remains a critical component for brand-building campaigns. Meanwhile, digital advertising, with its promise of precision, continues to grow at a double-digit pace. That's despite the recent industry concerns related to digital advertising fraud and viewability that appear to have slowed down the shift in spend from traditional media. For us, wherever the advertising dollars flow, we'll be there to measure the audience.
Last week, we announced that we've integrated 3 leading providers of viewability metrics, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science and Moat, into our Digital Ad Ratings system, making it much easier for our clients to know the delivery of viewable impressions to their target consumers. Another highlight in the quarter for Digital Ad Ratings relates to Hulu. In May, Hulu announced that they're partnering with us to use our Digital Ad Ratings system to measure living room impressions delivered over-the-top through connected TV devices such as Roku, Apple TV, PlayStation or smart TVs. 70% of Hulu's viewing now occurs on connected TVs, whereas earlier in their existence, nearly all Hulu viewing took place on a PC. This serves as yet another example of why our clients need a Total Audience view of a changing market.
We continue to see strong demand of our measurement of subscription video-on-demand. With 52% of households now subscribing to a subscription video-on-demand service, audience data is more valuable than ever to studios and content owners seeking to fully monetize their programs for this growing audience. Late in the second quarter, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, we unveiled streaming ratings for the Lionsgate production of Orange Is the New Black. The fourth season's premiere episode was watched by 6.7 million people in the U.S. This is comparable to the second most viewed cable drama on TV, behind HBO's Game of Thrones. This is valuable information for studios as they look to monetize their content.
On Digital Content Ratings, our release of syndicated data to participating clients occurred in late May, on schedule, and we remain on track to syndicate Total Content Ratings for participating clients in August. We have a strong pipeline of additional clients, both big media and digital natives, integrating the SDK that enables this measurement. Exciting to see how these new metrics help our clients understand and leverage the changing ways audiences are consuming content.
For example, was it recorded on a DVR and watched a month later? Or did the consumer view it through their cable provider's video-on-demand service? Or was it viewed over-the-top via a Roku streaming player? This level of granularity helps our clients align their strategy with their audiences' viewing habits.
Regarding the effort to update the currency data used to plan and measure advertising, in June, we had yet another positive and productive meeting with key industry stakeholders. Clients continue to be supportive of Total Audience and are engaged in moving the industry toward a new rating standard in time for their 2017 upfront negotiations.
Internationally, we remain on track to have Digital Ad Ratings in 25 countries by year's end, and we recently confirmed the contract extensions for our TV Audience Measurement services in Australia and Sweden.
Finally, last quarter, we mentioned our agreement with DISH Network to license their set-top box data, supporting our local and national TV rating services. This quarter, we're pleased to announce that we recently reached agreement with Charter Communications to license their set-top box data, further expanding our coverage. Both of these data sets will help strengthen our TV measurement products as well as help fuel our Marketing Effectiveness analytics.
Speaking to Marketing Effectiveness, we had another strong quarter with constant currency revenue growth of 15%. As a reminder, this is where we help clients plan, activate and evaluate the return on their media investments. The Nielsen Marketing Cloud brings all of these capabilities together in one system. It's off to a great start in the U.S., and in June, we launched our cloud system in Europe. This is a dynamite part of our business and it has a lot of runway.
Shifting to the Buy business. Similar to the media world, the fast-moving consumer goods industry is also seeing fragmentation, driven by new channels and shifts in consumer purchasing behavior. Adapting to this changing environment, we're focused on providing both manufacturer and retailer clients with a complete view of consumers, whether they buy in store, out of home or online. Our focus here is on coverage. We call it Total Consumer Measurement, analogous to Total Audience Measurement in our Watch business.
Our investments in coverage in the emerging markets continue to be a significant growth driver. In the second quarter, our growth was fueled by both local and multinational clients as well as steps we've taken to strengthen our portfolio through innovation. Retailer clients are another important part of our Buy growth strategy as the growing world of technology for consumers, retailers and manufacturers is changing the path to purchase.
At the end of June, we launched our Brandbank capabilities in the U.S. This has been a very successful business for us in Europe, and we're excited about the U.S. launch. Recall that Brandbank is focused on supporting retailers and their e-commerce product content needs. As an example, Brandbank can now connect directly to Walmart's systems as an approved content service provider, supporting Walmart's omnichannel strategy. For our manufacturer clients, Brandbank will collect, manage and submit content on their behalf, aligned with Walmart's requirements for data attributes and formats.
During the quarter, we also welcomed Whole Foods to our retail client roster, leveraging our market share data and analytics. We're helping them build on their strength with natural and organic products as they double down on consumer-centric category management. Health and wellness is of growing importance to many of our manufacturing clients, and our work with Whole Foods adds to our ability to help them drive growth in these product segments.
When we look at the developed markets, the environment continues to be challenging. In the absence of strong top line growth, our clients are looking to find efficiencies in their business, which in some instances includes their marketing, sales or innovation processes. One action we took in the quarter was to realign our Buy business globally into clusters of countries with similar market characteristics. We also accelerated our investments in our Buy business' connected system, which will enhance the value and speed we bring to our clients. I'll spend a few minutes on this connected system.
Our business is focused on measuring and improving performance for our clients. Understanding what is happening is the first step. We answer this with our measurement of sales and market share. Once our clients know what happens, the next question is why. What were the key drivers of the results? Our analytics will automatically pinpoint the key drivers, including marketing and sales activity, competitive activity and market trends. Then the most important question is what next. What does the brand need to do to improve?
These are all capabilities that we have in the market today, but our opportunity is to make them more valuable for our clients by connecting them into one fully integrated system underpinned by one source of truth that enables more speed and efficiency for Nielsen and more importantly, for our clients. That's what our connected system will do.
Clients have been enthusiastic in their feedback and they want it now, and that's the key reason why we've accelerated the pace of our investment in this platform-based connected system. We begin with an initial group of clients who will be on board by the end of the year, with more transitioning through 2017. A faster, more efficient system creates more value for our clients and bolsters our position as the leading global provider of measurement and analytics to the FMCG industry.
I want to close with a few words on corporate social responsibility. We know many long-term investors are putting more emphasis on this lately, and we agree with you. The way I often say it to our teams internally is that companies need to care for the communities they rely on for their business. Our company lives this out in a variety of ways, focusing on education, nutrition, diversity and inclusion and access to technology.
In May, we published our first global responsibility report, which describes our efforts in detail. One of our recent efforts was Nielsen Global Impact Day. On June 2, as part of our fifth annual day of service, over 23,000 Nielsen associates participated in more than 1,400 volunteer activities across 92 countries. I'm extremely proud of them for their commitment and their service.
So those are my comments on the quarter. We're looking forward to the rest of the year with continued confidence and excitement about the progress to come. Over to you, Jamere."

We had another solid quarter, reflecting consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model that continues to deliver solid results through the cycles.First, let me cover our total company results for the second quarter. On the left side",1215,"Thank you, Mitch. We had another solid quarter, reflecting consistency and resiliency of the Nielsen model that continues to deliver solid results through the cycles.
First, let me cover our total company results for the second quarter. On the left side of the page, our results on a U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just under $1.6 billion, up 2.4% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in both our Watch and Buy segments and offset partially by the impact of foreign exchange. Net income was $114 million and net income per share was $0.31, which was flat versus the second quarter of 2015. Our net income per share results were driven by solid revenue growth, margin expansion and our share buyback program, offset by restructuring charges related to the realignment of the markets in our Buy segment.
Moving to the right side of the page, on a non-GAAP basis, revenue was up 4.5% constant currency. We have delivered 40 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth, driven by strength in our core business and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 5.8% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued momentum in Audience Measurement of Video and Text and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew 3.3% constant currency, led by continued strength in the emerging markets.
Adjusted EBITDA was $490 million, up 6.5% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.7%, up 60 basis points on a constant currency basis with margin expansion in both our Watch and Buy segments. Our productivity pipeline remains strong, and we're confident in our guidance of 50 to 70 basis points of constant currency margin expansion for the total company in 2016.
Adjusted net income was $257 million, up 6.6% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.71, up 9.2% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program.
Finally, we generated free cash flow of $98 million compared to $156 million in the second quarter of last year. This was primarily driven by working capital timing and CapEx investments in our growth initiatives in Watch and Buy. And we remain on track to deliver our 2016 guidance of approximately $950 million. Again, a solid quarter of consistent and steady results.
Next, I'll move to the segments and provide a little more color. The first is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $744 million, up 5.8% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 7.9% on a constant currency basis. Audio was up nearly 2% constant currency, while delivering solid margins and free cash flow. Marketing Effectiveness was up 15.1% constant currency behind strong results from the Nielsen Marketing Cloud and Nielsen Catalina Solutions product offerings. The investments we have made in Marketing Effectiveness continue to drive Watch segment growth, and we're seeing strong demand from both publishers and advertisers.
As expected, Other Watch is about a 2 points drag on Watch revenue on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter of 2015. Watch adjusted EBITDA was $332 million, up 6.4% on a constant currency basis. Watch margins expanded 24 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage while investing in the business.
Let me say just a few words about our key initiatives in Watch. First, Total Audience has strong momentum. Digital Ad Ratings has been widely adopted by the industry as a way of measuring reach and frequency on ad campaigns. And in the second quarter, Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 53%, led by strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners.
Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, continues to gain traction with key clients for both Video and Text measurement. In the quarter, we signed new digital platform clients such as Kick [ph] and Mashable. In addition, we reached an important milestone with the successful release of syndicated data to participating clients.
Our efforts to provide our clients with more capability and flexibility in measuring content and campaigns is a key growth driver for our business. Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy, and Marketing Effectiveness continued to deliver impressive growth. We remain confident in our 2016 Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis.
Turning to Buy. Second quarter total Buy revenue was $852 million, up 3.3% on a constant currency basis. Our business in the developed markets was $582 million, up just under 1% on a constant currency basis as we saw modest growth in core measurement, offset by softness in discretionary spend. We are continuing to invest by realigning our market clusters and accelerating the development of our connected system, which will enable us to create a faster-growing, higher-margin business in the developed markets.
Our business in the emerging markets was $270 million, up 8.9% on a constant currency basis. In the emerging markets, growth was broad based with double-digit growth in Latin America, China and Southeast Asia, along with high single digits in Eastern Europe and India.
Buy EBITDA was $166 million, up 6.4% constant currency. Our Buy-adjusted EBITDA margins were up 57 basis points on a constant currency basis in the quarter. This is the eighth straight quarter of Buy margin expansion as emerging markets continue to scale and we execute on the productivity pipeline that I referenced earlier. We remain confident in our 2016 Buy guidance of 3.5% to 5.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis.
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risks, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 210 basis points drag on revenue and a 180 basis points drag on EBITDA, which were both in the ballpark of what we laid out on our last earnings call. The current spot rates held constant through 2016, and we expect 170 basis points drag on revenue and an 80 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is slightly worse than the forecast we gave last quarter.
Moving to 2016 guidance, we are maintaining our annual guidance. We remain confident in our plan to deliver on all of the operational elements that we laid out at the beginning of the year, highlighted by revenue growth of 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis, adjusted net income per share of $2.83 to $2.93 a share and free cash flow of roughly $950 million.
So to wrap up, overall, we had another quarter of consistent, steady revenue growth and margin expansion. In addition, we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Amy."

Well, I mentioned in my opening comments that our national TV business remains rock solid. And while television isn't the only thing that those clients that you've referred to are focused on, it's still the biggest part of their business. And so it's still the centerpiece of those contract renewals. But as we said in previous quarters when we've updated this group on how those contract renewals are going, increasingly, the conversation is around our Total Audience framework. They want to know how we're going to measure television but also how we're going to measure their content -- audiences for their content across all these additional screens and platforms where their content is now viewable by consumers. And you see that reflected, as you would expect, in their structure of our contract renewals these days and increasingly so as time goes on and Total Audience becomes more used and more real in the marketplace. So that's the change in the texture of those contracts and those contract discussions. We -- they'll continue, at the same time, to be very pleased with the terms of those contract renewals. Length of the contract, fairly in line with what's historically been the case. And then the terms in terms of the annual increases in price also are fairly well in line. What's different is the breadth of measurement that our service will provide. If you go back many years, it was all about television, and that's very much not the case today. It's now all about video and wherever that the video content happens to be viewed."

We were pleased with DISH that we announced last quarter because, of course, DISH is a service that's available to consumers nationally, and so it gives us that breadth. And Charter gives us a little bit more depth in certain parts of the country where Charter is the provider to markets in cities, states, communities out there. We're going to continue to look for additional providers to add into the mix. The good news is we don't need them all. And as we talk with the additional options, the other companies who have set-top box data available, yes, we're going to continue to look at them as almost pieces to a puzzle. And we need to look for the best configuration, not just, as you referenced, the biggest quantity of data. So DISH is a great start. Charter is a fabulous addition. We're looking to add 1 or 2 more in the quarters ahead, and we'll be sure to keep this group updated on our progress on that front. So already, even where we stand right now, we're happy with what we're going to be able to do with these 2 existing data sets in terms of both bolstering our national and local television Audience Measurement products as we look out into next year and beyond as well as using these data sets to help drive our Marketing Effectiveness business, which continues its very strong double-digit growth quarter after quarter. So yes, we love the direction we're going. As far as margins, one thing we mentioned on prior calls is, while on the one hand, licensing these set-top box data sets is a new expense in our budget, on the other hand, it also helps relieve some of the long-term pressure on our panels. They don't have to bear as much of the weight, if you will, when the market requires additional granularity and they're calling for us to increase the size of our panels. Increasing our traditional panels, that's a very extensive, a very expensive thing to do. And so by bringing big -- these big data sets from the set-top box data providers into the mix for our measurement service, we don't have to increase the size of our panels as much going forward as we otherwise would have. And so that avoidance of future cost helps offset the cost of licensing set-top data as we bring it into the picture."

One is measurement in video of logos for both brands and for sports teams and franchises. And the reason this is important is because there is an important trend that's also happening as it relates to native advertising. And in essence, what these guys are doing is native advertising related to sports. And in sports, that is the measurement of logos and signage. In addition to that, they provide sponsorship valuation and analytics to teams and leagues and rights holders. And sports is a big business. The combination of media rights, sponsorships and analytics is a big business that we're very interested in from an analytics standpoint. What we've seen in our data inside the company is that 93 of the top 100 live TV events were sports, and that was up from probably 14 or 15 just a few years ago, and this is an opportunity for us to connect our Total Audience data and drive tremendous value for our clients, so an important contribution and an important add to the Nielsen profile.

Look, we're very pleased in the quarter with the revenue growth we're seeing in the Watch side of our business, in particular with Audience Measurement of Video and Text.

And just as you referenced, that's reflective of both sides of our business, the traditional media companies, the media conglomerates. Back to the question asked before, our contract renewals with the big media companies remain solid. And then, the growth that we continue to see with the digital natives who are leveraging the different components of our Total Audience Measurement framework, Digital Content Ratings being the newest comer on the block but Digital Ad Ratings being a really key component of that growth, these are the really key drivers. Jamere mentioned some of the progress we've made in the quarter with Digital Ad Ratings, for example, Kick [ph] and Mashable coming onboard. We also saw international expansion with both Snapchat and Twitter. I mentioned Hulu leveraging Digital Ad Ratings for over-the-top device viewing measurement. There's a number of other things happening on this front, including one very important thing that we referenced briefly last quarter that I'll just highlight it again, which is the U.S.' largest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, went live with Digital Ad Ratings on July 1. And so that's a big milestone in our progress. And we continue to be very strong with all the top U.S. advertisers. So these things are growing at a very healthy rate.

Yes, for -- on your first question regarding Charter, the agreement that we've reached recently with Charter is specific to the Charter part of the business. If we can expand in the future to include their newly acquired Time Warner Cable franchise, obviously, we're interested in doing that. But so far, the focus has been on what has historically been the Charter Communications part of the business. On the other question, it's a great one, on the Buy part of our business, in terms of PPG (sic) [ CPG ] moving more to subscription models. And so there's a lot of things happening there. I assume what you're referring to, by the way, is subscription models in terms of how they provide their products to their consumers, Dan. So if I'm misinterpreting that, let me know. There's some really interesting things happening there. And probably, the one that's been most prominent in the news lately is Dollar Shave Club. Not that that's new, but of course, Unilever is taking a lot of interest in Dollar Shave Club and acquired them for a pretty big price tag, from what I saw in the press. So that's one of the big trends that we see emerging. Obviously, Amazon is fueling that trend in part with, I think they call it Amazon Dash, and it allows consumers to have a button, a physical button in their household where they can just press the button, it will automatically reorder a product, which is not purely a subscription model, but it's certainly heading in that direction. And I think more and more companies are going to be at least experimenting with this. I think the positive piece of this, from my perspective, Dan, is the emphasis that it puts on branded goods in the marketplace because I think one of the key struggles for the FMCG industry broadly is the growth of private label, which has abated somewhat in the U.S. market in the last couple of years but continues to grow in terms of its market share around the world. And this is obviously not good news for the big manufacturing clients that we work with whose businesses are built around brands. So subscription models really put a lot more emphasis on the importance of brands because you're going to sign up to be a continuous user of that product. Brand equity and brand attachment are probably going to be a stronger magnet in that business model versus buying the product week in, week out by going to a grocery store where you might be lured away more by price. So we're interested to see how this unfolds. Our Total Consumer Measurement approach, that whole philosophy and the system platform that underpins it, we'll be able to measure it either way because again, part of the focus there is on coverage. And in the developed world, the biggest coverage objective right now is all around e-com, where a lot of these subscription models would show up. So that's going to be interesting. I love to see the FMCG industry experimenting with business models. I think it's healthy. In fact, I hope I see more of it going forward."

Thanks for the question. First, for those who may not have seen it, what we announced a couple of weeks ago is that we've moved to that much closer integration with 3 of the leading providers of viewability metrics to the marketplace, and the 3 are called DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science and Moat. And what these firms do is they measure whether -- when ad was served to a consumer, whether that impression resulted in the ad actually being viewable on the screen and what portion or for how long. And so what's what viewability refers to, as I'm sure many of you already know. So what we've done is we've integrated these 3 leading providers into our Digital Ad Ratings system in order to make that ability to see viewable impressions much more seamless, much easier for our clients, and we've gotten very good feedback on that announcement. We've integrated 3, not just one, because right now, this is still a very fragmented marketplace. There's quite a number of different providers of viewability metrics. And so we felt it was important to give our clients a choice. And it's a big part of our philosophy to have as much openness to our platforms as we can to the extent that it serves the interest of our clients, and so you see that reflected in these 3. As you look forward, we'll keep an eye in this part of the market and we'll see how it continues to unfold. But right now, we like this arrangement where we're partnering with these 3 leading providers, and the feedback we've gotten from our clients is we got it exactly right."

Now our work isn't done. We still have a lot more to do. But I think our execution is the key reason for the strength in our business right now. I wouldn't attribute it to anybody else's misstep or weakness. I really would attribute it to the strength of our execution and the fit with our strategy with what our clients really need. So we feel great about that piece. On your second question regarding this perceived shift in the marketplace between traditional media and digital advertising, I think it is in part driven by these concerns around digital advertising, fraud, that includes nonhuman traffic, and there's also concern around blockers. And the viewability seems to be the most prominent of all the concerns out there, and that's given some pause to people as they allocate their budgets going forward. I also think another driver, which I did not mention in my opening comments, is just a reacquaintance in the industry -- advertisers in the industry, but the importance of reach. So digital gives you incredible precision when you can get it right, but it's hard to get both precision and reach in a digital environment, whereas television, while it may not offer the precision of the digital world, at least not yet, still is the best place to get reach. And if you're a brand manager and a brand builder, you know that reach is still your first priority. And so I think that reacquaintance with the importance of reach is one of the reasons why we've seen, yes, that perceived shift, a little bit of slowing of the growth in digital and people still investing heavily in good old-fashioned television because it gets the job done and there's a good ROI on that media investment. So again, wherever they go, however the shift happens, if it accelerates in one area or if it moves back in another direction, one of the reasons why we love our Total Audience Measurement framework is because we cover it all. And we not only enable people to see these trends in shifts, but we're able to connect it with the return and help them really drive the most efficient, most effective allocation of their resources, whether they're buying or whether they're on the sell side of this equation."

Look, we're really pleased with the progress we're making on those objectives that you outlined in your question. If I step back from it, the way I think about this is we had traditionally been very much, especially on the Buy side of our business, by the way, a people-as-a-service business model and more manually intensive in terms of creating and delivering and then helping our clients ultimately leverage our products, in particular, our measurement products. That business has been a great business for a long time. But given the progress being made in the world around us with regard to technology and all the new capabilities made available, yes, that's where we see this opportunity to automate a lot of this delivery. And in concert with that, as I mentioned with this connected system, also connect these great individual pieces of our portfolio into an integrated interoperable system. So by connecting our individual products into a system and then automating a lot of that delivery where our system connects directly into our clients' systems, feeding directly their key business processes with our measurement data and with our analytics, you move from what has traditionally been much people-as-a-service business model to more of data-as-a-service or software-as-a-service business model, which, of course, drives efficiency and speed and agility everywhere you look. And that's going to be beneficial to Nielsen and our shareholders, and it will also be beneficial to our clients, increasing the value of what we do and increasing the ability for us to help them drive growth and strengthen their business. So this is what we're focused on, and we've been making great progress on it. It's a multiyear process, and we will continue to provide updates on some of the key milestones as it unfolds over the course of the next year or 2."

We're coming off a couple of stable quarters, so it's not uncommon to see these dynamics from time to time. And in the second half, we expect developed Buy to be in the range that we gave at Analyst Day, 1.5% to 3.5%. In terms of the restructuring, we feel very confident that the things that we're doing from a restructuring standpoint in our Buy business do 2 things. One, it gives us fuel to invest and accelerate our investments in things like the connected Buy system, but also gives us fuel for the margin expansion, long-term targets that we talked about of 50 to 70 basis points. And the teams are executing very well against that, and we're able to deliver on of those restructuring programs and still grow our business and return margin back to the company."

On subscription video-on-demand measurement, looks like the market likes it pretty much. And the reason why I say that is, if you go back several quarters, we were covering about 6,000 different program episodes. And last quarter, we highlighted the fact that the number had grown to 8,000. And then, this quarter, the number is now sitting in the neighborhood of 9,500 different program episodes. And the reason why I point to that growth in the number of program episodes is the way this measurement -- this part of our measurement system works, is we only measure program episodes if it's specifically requested by one of our clients, that's the way this works. And so 9,500 different program episodes, a client has asked us to measure each of those. And so it shows really the very strong interest in and demand for this particular measurement component of our overall Total Audience Measurement system. Then to your second question regarding syndication in August of the Total Content Ratings portion of our Total Audience Measurement framework, really nothing else has to happen other than the passage of time on that. We're on track. Product capability is sound, it's proven. Clients need a little bit more time to continue to sort through the data and make sure they're comfortable with it, that they understand what it means for their business. And so that's the key issue right now is allowing sufficient time for the marketplace to see the data and understand and project what the likely impact is on their business and start to orient themselves around it. And so yes, we'll hit that mark in August for the Total Content Ratings, and we'll continue on to the next step from there."

Thanks, Tom. So what we saw in the upfronts this year with some of those types of things that you referenced is pretty typical of what we see in the upfronts pretty much every year, where each of the individual media companies on the sell side of this equation look to differentiate themselves, and they look to differentiate themselves sometimes with their own proprietary metrics. And by the way, in my opinion, that's smart. That's what I would do if I were them. If you're on the other side of this equation though, if you're an agency or an advertiser, you're a buyer, you're looking to be able to compare across all the different places where you could invest your money. And so these proprietary metrics aren't so useful sometimes if you're on the buying side of this because, yes, you don't know how to compare them to what the other media company or the other digital platform is offering. That's where Nielsen comes in. We offer that ability to compare across all the different options with these comparable metrics across all the different media companies and also across all the screens and platforms where consumers go to consume this content. Now having said that, yes, some of these proprietary metrics that some of those companies that you mentioned are touting in the marketplace, they are, in fact, powered by some of the capabilities from our portfolio and especially, our Marketing Effectiveness portfolio. The analytics capabilities that are there, our ability to combine our understanding of what consumers watch and how it connects to what consumers buy, often drives some of these, what we often refer to as, secondary guarantees in the marketplace. They're not guarantees that replace the primary guarantee, which is based on the currency metric that Nielsen provides. But there's a secondary guarantee that's added to that as people seek to target specific groups of consumers may be based on behavioral characteristics or purchasing behavior."

In our Watch business, our momentum continued with our Total Audience Measurement system. Client adoption continued to grow as Digital Content Ratings moved to syndicated reporting, Digital Ad Ratings expanded to new markets and the industry further narrowed in on a new currency definition. We also announced upgrade to our local TV measurement. So we feel great about our progress here. 
For our Buy business, emerging markets continued to produce solid top line growth as our investments in coverage and granularity and our balanced strength with both local and global clients continued to pay off. But regarding developed markets, while Europe made good progress in the quarter, our U.S. results were down versus the prior year as clients looked for more efficiency and productivity in the face of an increasingly difficult growth environment.  Earlier this year, as we saw these more challenging trends unfolding, we realigned our Buy business to be more focused in our product development and more efficient in our overhead. More recently, as the trends continued for our clients, we stepped up our efforts to reduce our cost base, reallocate resources and accelerate our investments and initiatives that will help our clients and better position our business for the future. We've been hard at work on these initiatives, and you'll hear more about them in a few minutes. But for now, let me say that our Buy business is working through a process of change that's similar to what we've been executing on successfully in our Watch business, and we're confident that our Buy initiatives will produce similar results. 
Let's look at the financials for the third quarter. 
At a total company level, revenue grew 3.6% on a constant currency basis. Revenues in our Watch segment increased 6.7% on a constant currency basis, including an 8.5% increase in Audience Measurement of Video and Text. Buy segment revenues grew just under 1% on a constant currency basis as emerging markets growth of nearly 9% was offset by a decline in developed markets driven by the U.S. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 4% constant currency, supported by ongoing productivity and operating leverage, offset in part by our accelerated investments in key initiatives. 
Adjusted net income per share grew almost 6% constant currency to $0.74. 
Free cash flow was a record $353 million in the quarter, up slightly compared to a year ago. 
We remain committed to driving shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy, and we do this by investing consistently in our future growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back approximately $90 million in shares, and as of September 30, we had approximately $450 million remaining under our existing authorization. 
Lastly, in light of our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're updating our guidance for the full year, and Jamere will provide detail on this in a few minutes. 
Let's look at the segments. First, Watch. If we turn back the clock a bit, it was just a few years ago when the market was still thinking of Nielsen as the television measurement company. As viewing fragmented across screens and digital platforms, we responded with measurement capabilities that followed the consumer. Over time, this developed into what we know today as our Total Audience Measurement system. The progress we've made is reflected in our Watch business performance. But it didn't happen overnight. It's been a multiyear evolution, and our teams have diligently executed on each step, bringing this whole framework to life. And while we've made very good progress, we continue to work alongside our clients every day, adding new features as clients explore all potential use cases for the data. It's an exciting time for the industry and for Nielsen. 
Let's look at some specific highlights from the quarter. 
In September, Digital Content Ratings became available in full syndication on schedule. This was a tremendous milestone. Publishers, agencies and advertisers are now equipped with powerful daily data that helps them understand the value of content across digital platforms. Adoption is growing daily. 
For Total Content Ratings, at the direct request of our clients, we made some changes to our original release schedule. Initial step of this schedule occurred on August 1, making Total Content Ratings available on a syndicated basis to all participating publishers. We'll broaden that to include agencies at the start of 2017 before making the data available to the entire industry by the end of the first quarter. In the meantime, we continue to work closely with our clients to help them gain comfort with the comparable metrics in advance of full syndication. Just a reminder, Total Content Ratings includes measurement of subscription video-on-demand, now covering over 15,000 different program episodes, nearly double the number from about 6 months ago. 
On Digital Ad Ratings, we continue to grow and expand. Campaigns in the third quarter were up 45%, reflecting growing volumes with existing large clients as well as very strong adoption from new, smaller advertisers. Across the board, we're seeing growing use of Digital Ad Ratings for guarantees. 
We've also made good progress with Digital Ad Ratings internationally. For example, in Canada, our penetration among the top 25 advertisers is now comparable to the U.S. We also recently announced Digital Ad Ratings in Taiwan, our 24th market. In 2017, we'll add 8 to 10 additional markets, and we'll also help [ph] create [ph] some existing markets to include Total Ad Ratings. 
Overall, client adoption in support of our Total Audience Measurement system is steadily growing. As we look out to 2017, our clients remain highly engaged in the effort to move the industry toward a new ratings standard. While the definition of a new currency is not up for Nielsen alone to decide, we're confident that with the clarity and momentum we built with Total Audience Measurement, it'll play an important role in the 2017 upfronts . 
In local TV, we recently announced some important new initiatives that will substantially enhance our offerings in the U.S. by leveraging our investments in Return Path Data from DISH and Charter as well as our currency-grade panel data. We'll introduce full electronic measurement across all 210 designated market areas by mid-2017, paving the way for the retirement of paper diaries in early 2018. 
Starting in 2017, we'll also integrate Portable People Meter, or PPM, data, for both in-home and out-of-home viewing in the top 44 markets. This will lead to increased stability, a decrease in 0 sells [ph] and richer analytics of local viewing habits. By including out-of-home viewing in the ratings, we'll help our local TV clients more fully capture the value of this portion of the TV audience that was previously unmeasured. And by the way, just yesterday, we announced to our clients that out-of-home viewing will also soon be credited to the national ratings. 
We also recently upgraded Social Content Ratings, now covering both Facebook and Twitter in a unified fashion. This upgraded service will replace Nielsen Twitter TV Ratings in all markets, including Australia, Italy, Mexico and the U.S. With social media playing a growing role in consumers' lives and TV experiences, its value for the media industry will also continue to grow. 
Turning to Marketing Effectiveness. We had another strong quarter with constant currency revenues up over 30%. As a reminder, this is the part of our business where we bring together our Watch and Buy assets to help marketers improve their return on investment in advertising. A large part of this is enabled by the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, which provides our clients with faster access to data and analytics, helping them make more informed marketing and media decisions. One recent example of this is our advanced marketing optimization solution made available in partnership with RevTrax, a one-to-one digital promotions company. Kimberly-Clark is one of the lead clients leveraging this new application to continuously update their promotions content based on real-time changes in consumer behavior, all with the name of increasing the ROI of their digital promotions. 
Also notable is Nielsen Catalina's recently announced collaboration with Facebook. This deal enables marketers to directly connect their advertising activity to its impact on sales as well as deliver more relevant advertising to target consumers. By combining the largest, most representative purchase dataset in the fast-moving consumer goods industry with ad exposure information from Facebook, we get a deep understanding of how these ads are driving consumers to purchase. 
Turning to the Buy business. In emerging markets, our business continues to deliver solid, broad-based growth, including double-digit growth across several key markets in Latin America, South East Asia, Eastern Europe and India. As a group, these markets do have a lot of runway for continued growth via added coverage, granularity and increasing penetration of the related analytics that help our clients drive progress in their business. Our investments in coverage and granularity and our balanced strength with both local and global clients continue to pay off. 
In developed markets, specifically the U.S., the environment which we operate has become more challenging. Large global manufacturers are the strength of our client base. And as I'm sure you've seen in the recent press, they found it increasingly difficult to achieve growth in markets with growing fragmentation in consumer demand, more competition from smaller and local players and increased commodity pricing. Together, these factors have led them to seek efficiencies and productivity in their business, and our business has not been immune. Our clients continue to value our core measurement services, especially given the growing product and retail fragmentation in the market. But when it comes to analytics, their needs have been shifting. Clients are shifting away from custom insights delivered via deep-dive projects, and they're shifting toward everyday analytics, often called activation, delivered directly to multiple end users. Our view is that this is a secular shift, not a passing phase or a cycle that'll swing back. Clients want analytics that'll help them answer the question of what do I need to do this week or tomorrow or even today to drive sales, protect market share or improve my competitive position. In today's challenging growth environment, that's what's most valuable to them. 
Now let me walk you through what we're doing to respond to this. First, you'll see us aggressively moving away from slower-growing noncore services. These moves are enabling us to accelerate and increase our investments in our key initiatives that will better position our business for the future. The most important of these initiatives are Total Consumer measurement and our connected system. 
Total Consumer measurement is about following consumers across all retail formats to ensure full coverage of sales. In a changing and fragmenting retail environment, this requires ongoing effort to help our clients understand emerging channels like specialty retailers, hard discounters, direct-to-consumer models and, of course, e-commerce. Speaking of e-commerce, we've made good progress on our hybrid solution announced earlier this year. It combines high-quality panels with big data to provide broad and granular coverage of e-commerce sales, including on the largest platforms. 
Our second initiative, our connected system, is the bigger of the 2. This open system connects Nielsen, client and third-party data, including our core Watch and Buy measurement data, with applications designed for decision makers in our clients' marketing, sales, R&D and finance functions. This means faster, data-driven decisions on everyday questions related to pricing, promotion, distribution, new product innovation, assortment and marketing mix optimization, all in one connected system. And this is the key because many of these capabilities already exist as stand-alone point solutions. But connecting them all in one system, one that delivers these capabilities continuously every day and directly to end users, that's what will help our clients reduce their internal costs while also driving a big step-up in value and speed for their business. And just as importantly, it'll significantly reduce costs and improve margins for Nielsen. 
Since we first talked with you about the connected system at our Analyst Day last December, we've been hard at work. Today, it's in the hands of 5 initial clients who are working with us to refine the system's design. We've also demonstrated live modules for our client advisory board and others. And the positive feedback from our clients, coupled with the changes we see unfolding in the market, have encouraged us to accelerate our development schedule and investments. We'll expand the availability of the system to 20 to 30 additional clients in mid-2017, followed by a further rollout late in the year. And as that rollout unfolds, you'll see -- you'll also see the ongoing development of our Connected Partner Program that we announced last week. Connected partners are third-party analytics companies who build apps, and those apps run on our connected system's open platform, providing more usefulness and value for our clients. These apps amplify the value of the underlying measurement data that is the core of our business. A recent Forbes article referred to this as Nielsen opening its big data treasure chest. We'll go into a deep dive on all this at our upcoming Analyst Day in December. 
Regarding the time line, one way to think about this is that our Buy business is working through a process similar to what we've been executing on successfully in our Watch business. We'll work through most of 2017 bringing additional components of the connected system to market. It will likely not be until 2018 until the fuller version begins to contribute meaningfully to the performance of our Buy business. 
Through this process, we're truly transforming the core of our Buy business: comprehensive measurement coverage, integrated data and analytics embedded in our clients workflows with data as a service and software as a service solutions, directly accessed by our client teams in marketing, sales, R&D and finance. And for Nielsen, a stronger, higher-margin business better positioned for the future. 
It's important to note that these benefits will reach beyond our U.S. business. We'll leverage this system across the developed world on roughly the same schedule. And longer term, it'll also add value to our business in key emerging markets. In the meantime, we'll continue to realign our cost base, prune our portfolio and reallocate resources to enable us to accelerate our progress and better position this part of our business for the future. 
We have a lot of work to do, but it's exciting. And because we're guided by our clients, we have a high level of confidence in our strategy and the key bets we're placing. Because I know the Nielsen team behind this work,  I have a high level of confidence in our ability to execute. We look forward to updating you at our Analyst Day in December. 
Over to you, Jamere."

Overall, as Mitch mentioned, our business grew in a much more challenging environment than we have seen in the past few quarters, highlighting the strength of our balanced portfolio. First, let me cover our total company results for the third quarter. 
On the left side of the page, our results on a U.S. GAAP basis, revenue was just under $1.6 billion, up 2.5% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment, partially offset by softness in the developed markets in our Buy segment. Net income was $132 million, and net income per share was $0.36, which was down $0.02 a share versus the third quarter of 2015. Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and our share buyback program, offset by higher restructuring charges related to further restructuring in our Buy segment. 
Moving to the right side of the page. On a non-GAAP basis, revenue was up 3.6% constant currency. Despite a more challenging environment, we still delivered revenue growth, driven by strength in our subscription-based recurring revenue and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 6.7% on a constant currency basis, driven by our investments, continued momentum in Audience Measurement of Video and Text and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew just under 1% constant currency led by continued strength in the emerging markets, which was partially offset by a decline in the developed markets. Adjusted EBITDA was $498 million, up 4% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.7%, up 10 basis points on a constant currency basis. 
In the quarter, we continued disciplined investments in growth and productivity initiatives that will generate top line growth and margin expansion in 2017 and beyond. Adjusted net income was $266 million, up 3.1% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.74, up 5.7% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
Finally, we generated record free cash flow of $353 million, which was up 2% versus a strong third quarter in 2015. 
Next, I'll move to the segments and provide a little more color. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $761 million, up 6.7% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 8.5% on a constant currency basis. As expected, Audio was down 2.8% on a constant currency basis against the tough comp in 3Q '15 that grew 11%, driven by timing of deliveries. The business is performing in line with our expectations and generating strong earnings and cash flow. 
Marketing Effectiveness was up 31.8% constant currency behind strong results from the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, Nielsen Catalina Solutions and Repucom, which is now branded as Nielsen Sports. The investments we have made in Marketing Effectiveness continue to drive Watch segment growth, and we continue to see strong demand from a broad array of clients. 
As expected, Other Watch was about a 2-points drag on Watch revenue on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the Energy business late in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Watch adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, up 7.5% constant currency. Watch margins expanded 33 basis points on a constant currency business basis as we continue to drive operating leverage while investing in the business. 
Let me say a few words about a couple of our key initiatives in Watch. First, Total Audience's strong momentum. Digital Ad Ratings have been widely adopted by the industry as a way of measuring reach and frequency on ad campaigns. In the third quarter, Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 45%, led by strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners. We have added nearly 100 new Digital Ad Ratings clients this year and experienced strong renewals with good pricing from existing clients. 
Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, continues to gain traction with key clients for both video and text measurement. In the quarter, DCR was fully syndicated, and we continue to add networks and digital players to an already strong roster of previously signed clients. In fact, we have over 90 brands being measured in DCR, and syndicated clients include A+E, ABC, AOL, Buzzfeed, Discovery and Vice, among many others. Digital Content Ratings is a key piece of our Total Audience capabilities and will be a future growth driver for our business. 
Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy, and Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth. We remain confident in our 2016 Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis. 
Turning to Buy. Third quarter total Buy revenue was $809 million, up just under 1% on a constant currency basis. On a total segment basis, our syndicated recurring revenue business remains solid. However, our ad hoc discretionary revenue declined. Our business in the developed markets was $542 million, down 2.5% on a constant currency basis as we continue to see softness in discretionary spend, especially in the U.S. Additionally, we are taking steps to future-proof our business by pruning and sunsetting slow-growth, noncore services in developed markets. These actions, along with further restructuring in our Buy segment and accelerating the development of our connected system, will strengthen our business. 
As you've often heard me say, we are clearly operating in a 2-speed world with significantly higher growth rates in the emerging markets versus developed markets. In the third quarter, our business in the emerging markets was $267 million, up 8.5% on a constant currency basis. As Mitch mentioned, growth was broad based across a number of markets. In addition, we saw double-digit growth from multinationals that gives us more confidence that emerging markets will continue to be a tailwind for our Buy segment revenue into 2017. 
Buy EBITDA was $150 million, down 3.8% constant currency. In this environment, we continue to invest in a disciplined way in coverage and building out the connected system, which will drive future growth and profitability in our Buy business. Nearly from our initial pilot clients is promising, and we are confident that our investment will further strengthen our competitive position. These key investments, along with an unfavorable mix between our developed and emerging markets revenue, are the key drivers markets for Buy adjusted EBITDA margins being down 91 basis points versus the prior year. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter outlook in developed Buy, we now expect our Buy revenue to grow approximately 1.5% to 2% for 2016. 
Moving to foreign currency impact, I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant-currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focus quickly on translation impact for reporting purposes. In the quarter, foreign currency was over than 110 basis points drag on revenue. If current spot rates held constant in 2016, then we expect 170 basis points drag on revenue and a 70 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is in line with the forecast we gave last quarter. 
Moving to 2016 guidance. In light of our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook in developed Buy, we are updating our full year guidance highlighted by revenue growth of approximately 3.5% to 4% on a constant-currency basis, adjusted EBITDA margin growth of 30 basis points, adjusted net income per share of $2.73 to $2.79 and free cash flow of approximately $850 million. 
So to wrap up, our third quarter was highlighted by revenue growth and margin expansion in a more challenging environment. First, our Watch business has tremendous momentum behind our Total Audience initiatives, and at Buy, our subscription-based were recurring revenue business remain solid and emerging market growth remains robust while our developed market business in the U.S. has declined. But importantly, both Watch and Buy, we continue to invest in a disciplined way to build a stronger, higher-margin business. In addition, we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Jenny."

First, with regard to Buy develop, yes, that is the challenging spot for our business in the quarter. But I would even narrow it further for you, because within Buy developed, Europe grew, the Pacific were, Canada grew. It's really the U.S, where the problem is focused at the moment. And so just to sharpen the focus a little bit, focus on the U.S. What we're seeing in the U.S. market, let me give you a couple of examples in terms of the external environment that our clients are dealing with. First, if you just focus in on food and beverage manufacturers. 2015, we saw this trend starting to emerge where the small and medium-sized manufacturers accounted for about half of the growth in the categories. And private label accounted for about 1/4 of the growth. And the big -- the top 25 players, they accounted collectively for only 3% of the growth in food and beverage categories in 2015. And that situation really hasn't changed that much in 2016. The reason why that's especially noteworthy for our business is the strength of our business just so happens to be the biggest global companies, the biggest global players. And so you see that reflected in our U.S. results. What all these companies are dealing with, both food and beverage and others, is a combination of things, product segmentation where consumers are increasingly shifting their purchasing to smaller, specialty, more niche products, moving away a little bit from the bigger brands. You see retail fragmentations to purchases moving across additional channels. Of course, see the 3G effect sweeping through the fast-moving consumer goods industry, where companies, whether 3G as a factor o r not are practicing zero-based budgeting. They're running the room internal 3G play. And you add up all these things together, and that's the situation that our clients are contending with, and you see that reflected back in our results. Now, for us, what that means in terms of their discretionary spend, as I said, they're shifting from these more deep dive projects that help them think about what they are going to do next year and focus much more on these every day analytics that help them with activation. What should I do today or tomorrow or this week? And that's where the shift is happening in the marketplace. And so we're realigning our portfolio to better serve those clients' interest, and those client needs. And as I mentioned, we don't see this as just a passing phase that the market place is going to. We see this as a trend that will continue on more of a secular basis over the long run. As we make this shift and as we build out this connected system, you see us building a very different business, really, frankly. Right now, it's very much a Professional Services model for Nielsen. As that connected system starts to unfold as a marketplace, it helps us to move from a professional service or people as a service business model to much more as data as a service and Software-as-a-Service business model, and that all results in, as Jamere said in his opening comments, having a stronger, higher-margin business. Jamere, what would you add?"

You did see our margins dipped in the quarter. I would say the key drivers, as I said in my comments, were a bit of a mix issue as the emerging markets revenue grew 8.5% and the higher-margin developed markets revenue actually declined. The second thing, as I said, we're continuing to invest in the connected system and our total consumer initiatives to future-proof the business. And so on the short-term, with software revenue profile, this obviously puts pressure on margins. But in terms of our long-term productivity drivers, I would say 3 things. One is we are continuing to see scale benefits in the emerging markets, and there's a focus on profitability. We're running the place with intensity around cost and productivity, as I mentioned before, that we have over 4,000 projects that are running inside the company. We invested in our products, our higher-margin products. And I'd say the last thing is you've seen us take a couple of rounds of restructuring in the second quarter and the third quarter to put us on the right trajectory going forward. We have confidence again that we will expand margins on a total company basis and we're running all the right plays inside the company to be able to achieve that."

So I guess a question is, is that any reason to think that it's not sort of similar to that today? Any comments you'd make on, so the relative margin profile of that part of the business compared to the segment overall margin profile. And then as we think about what part of that is at risk, can you help us through, with all of that revenue pull at risk, some of that risk, as you transition to replacing it with this other shape of revenue and just helping to size it that way, whatever you help us say will be really helpful."

So in terms of the size of what I will call our analytics or discretionary business, it is probably in the 30 percent-ish kind of range in terms of our total portfolio, sometimes a little bit more, a little bit less on a quarter basis just dependent on what the project pipeline is. I would say a couple of things. First of all, from in terms of what the focus area is in our portfolio is, there's probably 3% to 4% of the Buy revenue that is, as Mitch mentioned, slow-growing or becoming non-core. And as a couple of examples, if you look at a year ago, we will provide the data and analytics for things like helping retailers optimize store locations in a world where bricks and mortar is under pressure and e-commerce is actually growing, we will provide the data and analytics around video sales and retail channels in an environment where consumers are moving to more screen and digital consumption, providing data and analytics around alcoholic beverages moving through wholesalers channels. So giving some examples of a very broad portfolio Buy. And as we look at our resource allocation, as we look at the discretionary nature of some of those data sets and those analytics, we're actually going to move away from some of those. So it's 3% to 4% of the portfolio, and we're going to be aggressive about that and replace that with things that are more future-proof and things that are actually in our connected Buy system platform,  if you will. Now in terms of the margin profile, the analytics or ad hoc or discretionary projects have tended to be a lower margin profile than the overall business. And so as we think about moving forward in our future to a connected Buy system that is much more data as a service or people as a service oriented and the margin profile will certainly approve overall for the Buy business."

And we see a pattern in terms of which parts are performing better versus which ones are struggling in the current environment. And here's the characteristics of the things that are doing well. If the analytics capability is connected to our core measurement data, that's a positive. Second, if it is more focused on activation or these everyday analytics kind of questions, that's a positive. And third, if the talent required in that analytics area is similar to the talent that helps us to be successful in our core measurement business, that also tends to do better within the Nielsen portfolio. So we have a number of analytics capabilities that perfectly fit that profile surprise those are the parts that are performing really well. And then we have a number of others that don't fit that profile, and those are the ones where we have some decisions to make, and we've already started to take those decision as Jamere recounted. One of the things that I'll add to this picture, which I hope will be helpful, Todd, is why you might be wondering, what is the showing up or the U.S. than it is in other places? Well, the fact is the U.S. revenues, a bigger percentage of our U.S. revenues are these discretionary services. In fact, there's about twice as much, slightly more than twice as much of our U.S. revenues come from the discretionary services as compared to Europe we're much smaller percentage. So that's why you see it showing up in the U.S., and that's why our focus is currently centered on the U.S., but we're transforming our Buy portfolio really for the entire developed market wheel, then ultimately, a lot of these moves that we're making in particular with a connected system will benefit our business in the key emerging markets as well."

The timeline I described in my opening comments, I think it's exactly the right way to think about it, which is -- first of all, let me start with we already have the initial version of this system built and in the hands of 5 initial clients. So I want you to just realize that this is real, and it's something we've been working on now for the better part of the year and even before Analyst Day last December when we first talked about this with our investors and analysts. We already have it in the hands of 5 initial clients. We have live modules that are already usable. We demonstrated those for our clients. And we have great feedback so far. In fact, our clients are already thinking through what it's going to mean in terms of implementation on their side, that's the kind of reaction we've received so far. We'll roll it out to 20 to 30 additional clients by the middle of 2017. And by the end of the year is when we think we'll be prepared for a more full rollout to all clients who want to start to make the shift and transition to this connected system. So we are certainly hopeful that it'll start to have some impact on our business in 2017, but I think the better way to think about it is it'll start to show up meaningfully, significantly in our business, especially the financial results in the 2018 timeframe. One more thing to add to that, just to put maybe a reference point on that. I mentioned in my opening comments, but I think it's exactly the right way to think about it. While it's a slightly different system that we're building and a slightly different set of client needs that we are addressing, the magnitude of this and the execution required to do it properly, to do it in a way that really fits with what our clients need, it's very similar to what we've seen us work successfully through on the Watch side of our business to develop the Total Audience Measurement framework and roll that out to our clients over the past couple of years. So look, we know how to do this. We have the teams in place, and they're very focused and excited about the task in front of them. And we have a huge opportunity to drive this stronger, higher-margin business for our future, to take cost out of our clients business on their side of the table, and we give them a lot more value and a lot more speed."

First of all, if you're looking back to the third quarter last year, you saw our developed markets business grow 4.8% constant currency. And as part of that discussion, we said that we saw a pretty strong discretionary environment. We have not seen that since then, as we look at our results in our developed Buy business sequentially been going in the other direction. And part of that is because that's stable or I would say the environment in the third quarter last year actually ran a little hot. I'd say that environment has slowly started to erode, and we're starting to see the dynamics that Mitch and I have discussed in the call today. From a margin standpoint, again, you have a couple of dynamics there. One is you have sort of the mix shift between our developed markets revenue and our emerging markets revenue, that certainly plays into the numbers. And the second thing as I said, we continue to invest in our growth initiatives and a softer revenue environment is going to feel that margin pressure. More importantly, we've taken the actions, if you will, that will put us on the right trajectory from a cost standpoint, first of all, as I said, a couple of rounds of restructuring that you saw in the second and the third quarter numbers, continue to work on our productivity initiatives, we're investing and actually emphasizing the faster-growing higher-margin pieces of the Buy portfolio. And so we have a lot of confidence around that story and what that will mean for us going forward."

I think what it comes down to is we're just not thinking of it so much that way. Some of these characteristics, we're not viewing as lumpiness. We are, as I said, seeing more secular shifts. And so we've just reached that conclusion that it's not viable for the long term to keep running after these short-term revenue opportunities and keep trying to chase these and work our way through the lumpy nature of this part of our business. Instead, a much better future is about investing in something that transforms our product portfolio, that takes some of the lumpiness out of this part of our business, that benefits with what our clients need and where their needs are evolving toward, and that's what connected system is designed to do. And so we're not running after the short-term revenue opportunities as much in the quarter and that will continue going forward, and that allows us to reallocate, enables us to reallocate resources to build faster and do more as we develop this connected system in this. And so you see all of that reflected in the results in the quarter and outlook going forward."

Just to give you a little bit of color on our Marketing Effective business is up 31.8% in the quarter. As you know, we did have a couple of inorganic beings in there with Nielsen sports and Nielsen Catalina Solutions that is growing probably closer to an 18% organic number. The things that we're really excited about in Marketing Effectiveness, first of all, is the Nielsen Marketing Cloud or eXelate is up double digits. Nielsen viral Insights is up double digits, as clients continue to look for our data sets to help them build ROI solutions. And Nielsen Catalina Solutions is up about 18% organically as well. So we continue to be impressed with the growth that we are seeing in Marketing Effectiveness, and it's provided a nice tailwind for our business. In terms of the free cash flow outlook for the year, so just a couple of things. One is, as you alluded to, most of the sort of revenue shortfall actually is within our Buy business, so that's a big driver of it. So you've got a couple of things [indiscernible] to the numbers. One is reduced EBITDA outlook, particularly for the developed Buy regions. The second thing is that we are continuing to invest, and actually our investment profile is slightly higher than what we began at the beginning of the year, and that is a both a Watch and a Buy story. So on the Watch side, you'll see us acquire and begin integrate set-top box data for all the things that we're doing with our Total Audience Measurement initiatives. We've talked about moving away from the paper diaries and bringing more electronic measurement to the marketplace. That certainly roll into the numbers. And we have a big year front of us in terms of bringing DCR and DAR to the marketplace and growing that piece of the business. And then the last piece is growing the investment profile associated with our connected system and our total consumer initiatives. So combination of lower EBITDA expectations and the slightly higher investment profile for some of the key growth initiatives in the future is driving it. And then one other thing I'd add to that is we're probably going to be at the upper end of what we gave as sort of a cash restructuring number, and that's focused on the fact that in the second quarter and the third quarter, we've taken a couple of actions in our Buy business to set us on the right trajectory for the future. So those are the things that are driving the number from a free cash flow standpoint."

We're bringing that forward to the marketplace. And by the end of this year, that will be in the hands of a growing number of our clients and start to roll through our business in a more full way in 2017, that's the U.S and we have similar solutions that play basically the same, design depends on the country, in 11 other markets, where e-commerce sales are significant around the world. With regard to Amazon, they -- no change really in their status. In terms of their willingness to share their sales data, like retailers typically do with us, as we measure fast-moving consumer goods, they still prefer to remain on the outside of that collaboration model, cooperation model that advise our retail measurement service. So like we've done with Netflix on the Watch side of the business, we find other ways to measure the activity on those kinds of platforms. We've done that very successfully on the Watch side covering Netflix and other subscription video-on-demand platforms, and we are able to do it on the Buy said as well to measure what's happening on Amazon's platform. With regard to Alibaba, we continue to be very closely in touch and active with Alibaba in the China market as well as Tencent and Sina and [indiscernible] and a lot of the other really big players. In U.S., we have [indiscernible], Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google in China, they have their similar 4 or 5 major players and we're active with all of them. I was in China last month with our teams, and part of that also included a meeting with the most senior leaders at [indiscernible] and talking about how we're going to continue to broaden our relationship there. And Alibaba continues to be very active and a key focus for our business in the China market. On your -- on Part B of your 1 question, Dan, with regard to audio and the competitive situation in the industry, first, on audio, we are still thrilled with that business. It's exactly what we expected, low single-digit growth, strong free cash flows, you see us scheme leverage from audio business in a new way, leveraging the PPM measurement capability to add more effective sample size to our local TV measurement over on the video side of the equation. And then we are continuing to pursue international wins in the radio audience measurement business through the capabilities we have. We have some of those in our history, and there's a few more opportunities in front of us. And the other thing we're doing there is obviously continuing to bring our analytics portfolio to the radio industry to help them better tell their ROI and penetrations in the marketplace. On the cooperative industry collaboration that's going on, try to prop up a competitive alternative, uses ACR technology, automated content recognition technology, I think that's the one you're probably referring to. Look, we're very familiar with that kind of technology. We have it ourselves already in our tool bag. We know what it's good for and how -- what it's work well for and we also know quite a bit about limitations. And so we're staying focused on our strategy on audience measurement. And currency grade measurement that the marketplace trades on, it has representative panels that represent all the key segments of the marketplace in a manner that's always been important currently is and will remain important, that's what Nielsen is about, and that's easier said than done, we know that from experience."

On the currency definition, I commented on that earlier, maybe just the thing to add, we've had a series of meetings with the industry most recent one was last week, we continue to narrow in on the definition, and there's a lot of reasons for us to be confident that our Total Audience Measurement system's going to play a big role in the 2017 upfront. Let me tell you what we're doing also, not just what Nielsen thinks, but what are some of the key industry players think. One example is Rino Scanzoni, he's the Chief Investment Officer at GroupM. He was quoted a few weeks ago saying something like, we're looking for to making the Total Audience the currency in the next upfront. And then what he said was we have to go there. There's 10% to 12% more audience if you factor in the viewing on these other devices. his voice is really important because, well, he was central to the C3 metric 10 years ago when that was converged on by the industry and has since served as the definition of the currency. So that's what -- how we know he's thinking about Total Audience new definition of the currency for the 2017 upfront. David [indiscernible], Chief Research officer at CBS, he was just more direct, he just said, ""We're definitely moving forward."" That was his attitude toward it. And so I think the keys to this way of thinking for these key industry influencers are the fact that we passed the syndication point for digital content ratings at the end of September. We are on the path to fully syndicate Total Content Ratings by the early part of 2017, already in full syndication for the participating publishers. We're just going to add agencies and other members of the ecosystem in the early part of the year. Those are the last key pieces of the puzzle. And so we've delivered on those, and that's why I think everybody's pretty confident in terms of this measurement system. And some sense of what that new currency definition is going to be, playing an important role in the 2017 upfront-s."

In our Watch business, our momentum continued with our Total Audience Measurement system. Client adoption continued to grow as Digital Content Ratings moved to syndicated reporting, Digital Ad Ratings expanded to new markets and the industry further narrowed in on a new currency definition. We also announced upgrade to our local TV measurement. So we feel great about our progress here. 
For our Buy business, emerging markets continued to produce solid top line growth as our investments in coverage and granularity and our balanced strength with both local and global clients continued to pay off. But regarding developed markets, while Europe made good progress in the quarter, our U.S. results were down versus the prior year as clients looked for more efficiency and productivity in the face of an increasingly difficult growth environment.  Earlier this year, as we saw these more challenging trends unfolding, we realigned our Buy business to be more focused in our product development and more efficient in our overhead. More recently, as the trends continued for our clients, we stepped up our efforts to reduce our cost base, reallocate resources and accelerate our investments and initiatives that will help our clients and better position our business for the future. We've been hard at work on these initiatives, and you'll hear more about them in a few minutes. But for now, let me say that our Buy business is working through a process of change that's similar to what we've been executing on successfully in our Watch business, and we're confident that our Buy initiatives will produce similar results. 
Let's look at the financials for the third quarter. 
At a total company level, revenue grew 3.6% on a constant currency basis. Revenues in our Watch segment increased 6.7% on a constant currency basis, including an 8.5% increase in Audience Measurement of Video and Text. Buy segment revenues grew just under 1% on a constant currency basis as emerging markets growth of nearly 9% was offset by a decline in developed markets driven by the U.S. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 4% constant currency, supported by ongoing productivity and operating leverage, offset in part by our accelerated investments in key initiatives. 
Adjusted net income per share grew almost 6% constant currency to $0.74. 
Free cash flow was a record $353 million in the quarter, up slightly compared to a year ago. 
We remain committed to driving shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy, and we do this by investing consistently in our future growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back approximately $90 million in shares, and as of September 30, we had approximately $450 million remaining under our existing authorization. 
Lastly, in light of our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're updating our guidance for the full year, and Jamere will provide detail on this in a few minutes. 
Let's look at the segments. First, Watch. If we turn back the clock a bit, it was just a few years ago when the market was still thinking of Nielsen as the television measurement company. As viewing fragmented across screens and digital platforms, we responded with measurement capabilities that followed the consumer. Over time, this developed into what we know today as our Total Audience Measurement system. The progress we've made is reflected in our Watch business performance. But it didn't happen overnight. It's been a multiyear evolution, and our teams have diligently executed on each step, bringing this whole framework to life. And while we've made very good progress, we continue to work alongside our clients every day, adding new features as clients explore all potential use cases for the data. It's an exciting time for the industry and for Nielsen. 
Let's look at some specific highlights from the quarter. 
In September, Digital Content Ratings became available in full syndication on schedule. This was a tremendous milestone. Publishers, agencies and advertisers are now equipped with powerful daily data that helps them understand the value of content across digital platforms. Adoption is growing daily. 
For Total Content Ratings, at the direct request of our clients, we made some changes to our original release schedule. Initial step of this schedule occurred on August 1, making Total Content Ratings available on a syndicated basis to all participating publishers. We'll broaden that to include agencies at the start of 2017 before making the data available to the entire industry by the end of the first quarter. In the meantime, we continue to work closely with our clients to help them gain comfort with the comparable metrics in advance of full syndication. Just a reminder, Total Content Ratings includes measurement of subscription video-on-demand, now covering over 15,000 different program episodes, nearly double the number from about 6 months ago. 
On Digital Ad Ratings, we continue to grow and expand. Campaigns in the third quarter were up 45%, reflecting growing volumes with existing large clients as well as very strong adoption from new, smaller advertisers. Across the board, we're seeing growing use of Digital Ad Ratings for guarantees. 
We've also made good progress with Digital Ad Ratings internationally. For example, in Canada, our penetration among the top 25 advertisers is now comparable to the U.S. We also recently announced Digital Ad Ratings in Taiwan, our 24th market. In 2017, we'll add 8 to 10 additional markets, and we'll also help create some existing markets to include Total Ad Ratings. 
Overall, client adoption in support of our Total Audience Measurement system is steadily growing. As we look out to 2017, our clients remain highly engaged in the effort to move the industry toward a new ratings standard. While the definition of a new currency is not up for Nielsen alone to decide, we're confident that with the clarity and momentum we built with Total Audience Measurement, it'll play an important role in the 2017 upfronts . 
In local TV, we recently announced some important new initiatives that will substantially enhance our offerings in the U.S. by leveraging our investments in Return Path Data from DISH and Charter as well as our currency-grade panel data. We'll introduce full electronic measurement across all 210 designated market areas by mid-2017, paving the way for the retirement of paper diaries in early 2018. 
Starting in 2017, we'll also integrate Portable People Meter, or PPM, data, for both in-home and out-of-home viewing in the top 44 markets. This will lead to increased stability, a decrease in 0 sells and richer analytics of local viewing habits. By including out-of-home viewing in the ratings, we'll help our local TV clients more fully capture the value of this portion of the TV audience that was previously unmeasured. And by the way, just yesterday, we announced to our clients that out-of-home viewing will also soon be credited to the national ratings. 
We also recently upgraded Social Content Ratings, now covering both Facebook and Twitter in a unified fashion. This upgraded service will replace Nielsen Twitter TV Ratings in all markets, including Australia, Italy, Mexico and the U.S. With social media playing a growing role in consumers' lives and TV experiences, its value for the media industry will also continue to grow. 
Turning to Marketing Effectiveness. We had another strong quarter with constant currency revenues up over 30%. As a reminder, this is the part of our business where we bring together our Watch and Buy assets to help marketers improve their return on investment in advertising. A large part of this is enabled by the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, which provides our clients with faster access to data and analytics, helping them make more informed marketing and media decisions. One recent example of this is our advanced marketing optimization solution made available in partnership with RevTrax, a one-to-one digital promotions company. Kimberly-Clark is one of the lead clients leveraging this new application to continuously update their promotions content based on real-time changes in consumer behavior, all with the name of increasing the ROI of their digital promotions. 
Also notable is Nielsen Catalina's recently announced collaboration with Facebook. This deal enables marketers to directly connect their advertising activity to its impact on sales as well as deliver more relevant advertising to target consumers. By combining the largest, most representative purchase dataset in the fast-moving consumer goods industry with ad exposure information from Facebook, we get a deep understanding of how these ads are driving consumers to purchase. 
Turning to the Buy business. In emerging markets, our business continues to deliver solid, broad-based growth, including double-digit growth across several key markets in Latin America, South East Asia, Eastern Europe and India. As a group, these markets do have a lot of runway for continued growth via added coverage, granularity and increasing penetration of the related analytics that help our clients drive progress in their business. Our investments in coverage and granularity and our balanced strength with both local and global clients continue to pay off. 
In developed markets, specifically the U.S., the environment which we operate has become more challenging. Large global manufacturers are the strength of our client base. And as I'm sure you've seen in the recent press, they found it increasingly difficult to achieve growth in markets with growing fragmentation in consumer demand, more competition from smaller and local players and increased commodity pricing. Together, these factors have led them to seek efficiencies and productivity in their business, and our business has not been immune. Our clients continue to value our core measurement services, especially given the growing product and retail fragmentation in the market. But when it comes to analytics, their needs have been shifting. Clients are shifting away from custom insights delivered via deep-dive projects, and they're shifting toward everyday analytics, often called activation, delivered directly to multiple end users. Our view is that this is a secular shift, not a passing phase or a cycle that'll swing back. Clients want analytics that'll help them answer the question of what do I need to do this week or tomorrow or even today to drive sales, protect market share or improve my competitive position. In today's challenging growth environment, that's what's most valuable to them. 
Now let me walk you through what we're doing to respond to this. First, you'll see us aggressively moving away from slower-growing noncore services. These moves are enabling us to accelerate and increase our investments in our key initiatives that will better position our business for the future. The most important of these initiatives are Total Consumer measurement and our connected system. 
Total Consumer measurement is about following consumers across all retail formats to ensure full coverage of sales. In a changing and fragmenting retail environment, this requires ongoing effort to help our clients understand emerging channels like specialty retailers, hard discounters, direct-to-consumer models and, of course, e-commerce. Speaking of e-commerce, we've made good progress on our hybrid solution announced earlier this year. It combines high-quality panels with big data to provide broad and granular coverage of e-commerce sales, including on the largest platforms. 
Our second initiative, our connected system, is the bigger of the 2. This open system connects Nielsen, client and third-party data, including our core Watch and Buy measurement data, with applications designed for decision makers in our clients' marketing, sales, R&D and finance functions. This means faster, data-driven decisions on everyday questions related to pricing, promotion, distribution, new product innovation, assortment and marketing mix optimization, all in one connected system. And this is the key because many of these capabilities already exist as stand-alone point solutions. But connecting them all in one system, one that delivers these capabilities continuously every day and directly to end users, that's what will help our clients reduce their internal costs while also driving a big step-up in value and speed for their business. And just as importantly, it'll significantly reduce costs and improve margins for Nielsen. 
Since we first talked with you about the connected system at our Analyst Day last December, we've been hard at work. Today, it's in the hands of 5 initial clients who are working with us to refine the system's design. We've also demonstrated live modules for our client advisory board and others. And the positive feedback from our clients, coupled with the changes we see unfolding in the market, have encouraged us to accelerate our development schedule and investments. We'll expand the availability of the system to 20 to 30 additional clients in mid-2017, followed by a further rollout late in the year. And as that rollout unfolds, you'll see -- you'll also see the ongoing development of our Connected Partner Program that we announced last week. Connected partners are third-party analytics companies who build apps, and those apps run on our connected system's open platform, providing more usefulness and value for our clients. These apps amplify the value of the underlying measurement data that is the core of our business. A recent Forbes article referred to this as Nielsen opening its big data treasure chest. We'll go into a deep dive on all this at our upcoming Analyst Day in December. 
Regarding the time line, one way to think about this is that our Buy business is working through a process similar to what we've been executing on successfully in our Watch business. We'll work through most of 2017 bringing additional components of the connected system to market. It will likely not be until 2018 until the fuller version begins to contribute meaningfully to the performance of our Buy business. 
Through this process, we're truly transforming the core of our Buy business: comprehensive measurement coverage, integrated data and analytics embedded in our clients workflows with data as a service and software as a service solutions, directly accessed by our client teams in marketing, sales, R&D and finance. And for Nielsen, a stronger, higher-margin business better positioned for the future. 
It's important to note that these benefits will reach beyond our U.S. business. We'll leverage this system across the developed world on roughly the same schedule. And longer term, it'll also add value to our business in key emerging markets. In the meantime, we'll continue to realign our cost base, prune our portfolio and reallocate resources to enable us to accelerate our progress and better position this part of our business for the future. 
We have a lot of work to do, but it's exciting. And because we're guided by our clients, we have a high level of confidence in our strategy and the key bets we're placing. Because I know the Nielsen team behind this work,  I have a high level of confidence in our ability to execute. We look forward to updating you at our Analyst Day in December. 
Over to you, Jamere."

Overall, as Mitch mentioned, our business grew in a much more challenging environment than we have seen in the past few quarters, highlighting the strength of our balanced portfolio.

Overall, as Mitch mentioned, our business grew in a much more challenging environment than we have seen in the past few quarters, highlighting the strength of our balanced portfolio. First, let me cover our total company results for the third quarter. 
On the left side of the page, our results on a U.S. GAAP basis, revenue was just under $1.6 billion, up 2.5% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment, partially offset by softness in the developed markets in our Buy segment. Net income was $132 million, and net income per share was $0.36, which was down $0.02 a share versus the third quarter of 2015. Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and our share buyback program, offset by higher restructuring charges related to further restructuring in our Buy segment. 
Moving to the right side of the page. On a non-GAAP basis, revenue was up 3.6% constant currency. Despite a more challenging environment, we still delivered revenue growth, driven by strength in our subscription-based recurring revenue and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 6.7% on a constant currency basis, driven by our investments, continued momentum in Audience Measurement of Video and Text and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew just under 1% constant currency led by continued strength in the emerging markets, which was partially offset by a decline in the developed markets. Adjusted EBITDA was $498 million, up 4% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.7%, up 10 basis points on a constant currency basis. 
In the quarter, we continued disciplined investments in growth and productivity initiatives that will generate top line growth and margin expansion in 2017 and beyond. Adjusted net income was $266 million, up 3.1% constant currency, and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.74, up 5.7% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
Finally, we generated record free cash flow of $353 million, which was up 2% versus a strong third quarter in 2015. 
Next, I'll move to the segments and provide a little more color. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $761 million, up 6.7% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 8.5% on a constant currency basis. As expected, Audio was down 2.8% on a constant currency basis against the tough comp in 3Q '15 that grew 11%, driven by timing of deliveries. The business is performing in line with our expectations and generating strong earnings and cash flow. 
Marketing Effectiveness was up 31.8% constant currency behind strong results from the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, Nielsen Catalina Solutions and Repucom, which is now branded as Nielsen Sports. The investments we have made in Marketing Effectiveness continue to drive Watch segment growth, and we continue to see strong demand from a broad array of clients. 
As expected, Other Watch was about a 2-points drag on Watch revenue on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Watch adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, up 7.5% constant currency. Watch margins expanded 33 basis points on a constant currency business basis as we continue to drive operating leverage while investing in the business. 
Let me say a few words about a couple of our key initiatives in Watch. First, Total Audience's strong momentum. Digital Ad Ratings have been widely adopted by the industry as a way of measuring reach and frequency on ad campaigns. In the third quarter, Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 45%, led by strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners. We have added nearly 100 new Digital Ad Ratings clients this year and experienced strong renewals with good pricing from existing clients. 
Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, continues to gain traction with key clients for both video and text measurement. In the quarter, DCR was fully syndicated, and we continue to add networks and digital players to an already strong roster of previously signed clients. In fact, we have over 90 brands being measured in DCR, and syndicated clients include A+E, ABC, AOL, Buzzfeed, Discovery and Vice, among many others. Digital Content Ratings is a key piece of our Total Audience capabilities and will be a future growth driver for our business. 
Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy, and Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth. We remain confident in our 2016 Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis. 
Turning to Buy. Third quarter total Buy revenue was $809 million, up just under 1% on a constant currency basis. On a total segment basis, our syndicated recurring revenue business remains solid. However, our ad hoc discretionary revenue declined. Our business in the developed markets was $542 million, down 2.5% on a constant currency basis as we continue to see softness in discretionary spend, especially in the U.S. Additionally, we are taking steps to future-proof our business by pruning and sunsetting slow-growth, noncore services in developed markets. These actions, along with further restructuring in our Buy segment and accelerating the development of our connected system, will strengthen our business. 
As you've often heard me say, we are clearly operating in a 2-speed world with significantly higher growth rates in the emerging markets versus developed markets. In the third quarter, our business in the emerging markets was $267 million, up 8.5% on a constant currency basis. As Mitch mentioned, growth was broad based across a number of markets. In addition, we saw double-digit growth from multinationals that gives us more confidence that emerging markets will continue to be a tailwind for our Buy segment revenue into 2017. 
Buy EBITDA was $150 million, down 3.8% constant currency. In this environment, we continue to invest in a disciplined way in coverage and building out the connected system, which will drive future growth and profitability in our Buy business. The early read from our initial pilot clients is promising, and we are confident that our investment will further strengthen our competitive position. These key investments, along with an unfavorable mix between our developed and emerging markets revenue, are the key drivers for our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins being down 91 basis points versus the prior year. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter outlook in developed Buy, we now expect our Buy revenue to grow approximately 1.5% to 2% for 2016. 
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. 
In the quarter, foreign currency was more than 110 basis points drag on revenue. If current spot rates held constant in 2016, then we expect a 170 basis points drag on revenue and a 70 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is in line with the forecasts we gave last quarter. 
Moving to 2016 guidance. In light of our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook in developed Buy, we are updating our full year guidance, highlighted by revenue growth of approximately 3.5% to 4% on a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA margin growth of 30 basis points, adjusted net income per share of $2.73 to $2.79 and free cash flow of approximately $850 million. 
So to wrap up, our third quarter was highlighted by revenue growth and margin expansion in a more challenging environment. First, our Watch business has tremendous momentum behind our Total Audience initiatives; and Buy, our subscription-based recurring revenue business remains solid; and emerging market growth remains robust while our developed market business in the U.S. has declined. But importantly, across both Watch and Buy, we continue to invest in a disciplined way to build a stronger, higher-margin business. In addition, we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Yaeni ."

So you've mentioned the secular shift away from custom insights to everyday analytics. And so I was hoping you could give a little more color on the drivers behind sort of the reduced spending. Are you losing share? Is the competitive environment changing? Or are customers just tightening budgets? And is there any way to quantify that?

First, with regard to Buy developed, yes, that is the challenging spot for our business in the quarter. But I would even narrow it further for you, because within Buy developed, Europe grew, the Pacific grew, Canada grew. It's really the U.S. where the problem is focused at the moment. And so just to sharpen the focus a little bit, focus on U.S. What we're seeing in the U.S. market -- let me give you a couple of examples in terms of the external environment that our clients are dealing with. First, if you just focus in on food and beverage manufacturers, 2015, we saw this trend starting to emerge where the small- and medium-sized manufacturers accounted for about half of the growth in the categories and private label accounted for about 1/4 of the growth. And the big -- the top 25 players, they accounted collectively for only 3% of the growth in food and beverage categories in 2015, and that situation really hasn't changed that much in 2016. The reason why that's especially noteworthy for our business is the strength of our business just so happens to be the biggest global companies, the biggest global players. And so you see that reflected in our U.S. results. What all these companies are dealing with, both food and beverage and others, is a combination of things: product segmentation, where consumers are increasingly shifting their purchasing to smaller, specialty, more niche products, moving away a little bit from the bigger brands; you see retail fragmentation to purchases moving across additional channels. You, of course, see the 3G effect sweeping through the fast-moving consumer goods industry, where companies, whether 3G is a factor or not, are practicing zero-based budgeting. They're running the their own internal 3G play. And you add up all these things together, and that's the situation that our clients are contending with, and you see that reflected back in our results. Now for us, what that means in terms of their discretionary spend, as I said, we're -- they're shifting from these more deep-dive projects that help them think about what they're going to do next year and focus much more on these everyday analytics that help them with activation. What should I do today or tomorrow or this week? And that's where the shift is happening in the marketplace. And so we're realigning our portfolio to better serve those client interests and those client needs. And so as I mentioned, we don't see this as just a passing phase that the marketplace is going through. We see this as a trend that will continue on more of a secular basis over the long run. As we make this shift and as we build out this connected system, you see us building a very different business, really, frankly. Right now, it's very much a professional services model for Nielsen. As that connected system starts to unfold more in the marketplace, it helps us to move from a professional service or people-as-a-service business model to much more as data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service business model, and that all results in us, as Jamere said in his opening comments, having a stronger, higher-margin business. Jamere, what would you add?"

So you did see our margins dip in the quarter. I would say that the key drivers, as I said in my comments, were a little bit of a mix issue as the emerging markets revenue grew 8.5% and the higher-margin developed markets revenue actually declined. I'd say the second thing, as Mitch said, we're continuing to invest in the connected system and our Total Consumer initiatives to future-proof the business. And so in the short term, with a softer revenue profile, this obviously puts pressure on margins. But in terms of our long-term productivity drivers, I would say 3 things. One is, we're continuing to see scale benefits in the emerging markets, and there's a focus on profitability. We're running the place with intensity around cost and productivity. I mentioned before that we have over 4,000 projects that are running inside the company. We're invested in our products, our higher-margin products. And I'd say the last thing is you've seen us take a couple of rounds of restructuring in the second quarter and the third quarter to put us on the right trajectory going forward. So we have confidence, again, that we will expand margins on a total company basis, and we're running all the right plays inside the company to be able to achieve that."

Let me take a shot and see if you'll comment anything to help us size this a little bit. You used to disclose the Insights line item or analytics line item in the Buy segment, I  think the last you did that was 2014. And at that point in time, it -- I think it was about 25% of Buy segment revenue. So I guess a question is, is that any reason to think that it's not sort of similar to that today? Any comment you'd make on so the relative margin profile of that part of the business compared to the segment overall margin profile? And then as we think about what part of it is at risk, can you help us through is all of that revenue pool at risk? Is some of that at risk as you transition to replacing it with this other shape of revenue? And just helping size it in that way, whatever you help us say would be really helpful."

So in terms of the size of what I will call our analytics or discretionary business, it is probably in the 30%-ish kind of range in terms of our total portfolio, sometimes a little bit more or a little bit less on a quarter basis just depending on what the project pipeline is. I would say a couple of things. First of all, from a -- in terms of what the focus area is -- in our portfolio is, there's probably 3% to 4% of the Buy revenue that is, as Mitch mentioned, slow growing or becoming noncore. And just a couple of examples. If you look at a year ago, we were providing data and analytics for things like helping retailers optimize store locations in a world where bricks and mortar is under pressure and e-commerce is actually growing. We were providing data and analytics around video sales and retail channels in an environment where consumers are moving to more screen and digital consumption, providing data and analytics around alcoholic beverages moving through wholesaler channels. So these are some examples of a very broad portfolio in Buy. And as we look at our resource allocation, as we look at the discretionary nature of some of those datasets and those analytics, we're actually going to move away from some of those. So it's 3% to 4% of the portfolio, and we're going to be aggressive about that and replace that with things that are more future-proof and things that are actually in our connected Buy system platform,  if you will. Now in terms of the margin profile, the analytics or ad hoc or discretionary projects have tended to be a lower-margin profile than the overall business. And so as we think about moving forward in our future to a connected Buy system that is much more data as a service or people as a service oriented, the margin profile will certainly improve overall for the Buy business, so."

And we see a pattern in terms of which parts are performing better versus which ones are struggling in the current environment. And here's the characteristics of the things that are doing well. If the analytics capability is connected to our core measurement data, that's a positive. Second, if it is more focused on activation or these everyday analytics kinds of questions, that's a positive. And third, if the talent required in that analytics area is similar to the talent that helps us to be successful in our core measurement business, that also tends to do better within the Nielsen portfolio. So we have a number of analytics capabilities that perfectly fit that profile. And no surprise, those are the parts that are performing really well. And then we have a number of others that don't fit that profile, and those are the ones where we have some decisions to make. And we've already started to take those decisions, as Jamere recounted. One other thing that I'll add to this picture, which I hope will be helpful, Todd, is, why -- you might be wondering, why is this showing up more in the U.S. than it is in other places? Well, fact is the U.S. revenues -- a bigger percentage of our U.S. revenues are these discretionary services. In fact, there's about twice as much -- slightly more than twice as much of our U.S. revenues come from the discretionary services as compared to Europe, where they're the much smaller percentage. So that's why you see it showing up in the U.S., and that's why our focus is currently centered on the U.S. But we're transforming our Buy portfolio really for the entire developed market wheel. Then ultimately, a lot of these moves that we're making in particular with the connected system will benefit our business in the key emerging markets as well."

The time line I described in my opening comments, I think, is exactly the right way to think about it, which is -- well, first of all, let me start with we already have an initial version of this system built and in the hands of 5 initial clients. So I want you to just realize that this is real, and it's something we've been working on now for the better part of the year and even before Analyst Day last December when we first talked about this with our investors and analysts. So we already have it in the hands of 5 initial clients. We have live modules that are already usable. We demonstrated those for our clients, and we have great feedback so far. In fact, our clients are already thinking through what it's going to mean in terms of implementation on their side. That's the kind of reaction we've received so far. We'll roll it out to 20 to 30 additional clients by the middle of 2017. And by the end of the year is when we think we'll be prepared for a more full rollout to all clients who want to start to make the shift, the transition to this connected system. So yes, we're certainly hopeful that it'll start to have some impact on our business in 2017, but I think the better way to think about it is it'll start to show up meaningfully, significantly in our business, especially the financial results in the 2018 time frame. Todd, one other thing to add to that, just to put maybe a reference point on that. I mentioned in my opening comments that I think it's exactly the right way to think about it. While it's a slightly different system that we're building and a slightly different set of client needs that we're addressing, the magnitude of this and the execution required to do it properly, to do it in a way that really fits with what our clients need is very similar to what you've seen us work successfully through on the Watch side of our business as we developed the Total Audience Measurement framework and rolled that out to our clients over the past couple of years. So look, we know how to do this. We have the teams in place, and they're very focused and excited about the task in front of them. And we have a huge opportunity to drive this stronger, higher-margin business for our future, to take costs out of our clients' business, on their side of the table, and we give them a lot more value and a lot more speed."

First of all, if you're looking back to the third quarter last year, you saw our developed markets business grow 4.8% constant currency. And as part of that discussion, we said that we saw a pretty strong discretionary environment. We have not seen that since then. And if you look at our results in our developed Buy business, they've sequentially been going in the other direction. And part of that is because that stable or, I would say, the environment in the third quarter last year actually ran a little hot. I'd say that environment has slowly started to erode and we're starting to see the dynamics that Mitch and I have discussed in the call today. From a margin standpoint, again, you have a couple of dynamics there. One is, you have sort of the mix shift between our developed markets revenue and our emerging markets revenue that certainly plays into the numbers. And then the second thing, as I said, we'll continue to invest in our growth initiatives. And in a softer revenue environment, we're going to feel that margin pressure. But more importantly, we've taken the actions, if you will, that will put us on the right trajectory from a cost standpoint: first of all, as I said, a couple of rounds of restructuring that you saw in the second and the third quarter numbers; we'll continue to work on our productivity initiatives; we're investing and actually emphasizing the faster-growing, higher-margin pieces of the Buy portfolio. And so we have a lot of confidence around that story and what that will mean for us going forward."

And so some quarters up, some quarters down. I think what it comes down to is we're just not thinking of it so much that way. This -- some of these characteristics we're not viewing as lumpiness. We're, as I said, seeing it more as secular shifts. And so we just reached the conclusion that it's not viable for the long term to keep running after these short-term revenue opportunities and keep trying to chase these and work our way through the lumpy nature of this part of our business. Instead, a much better future is about investing in something that transforms our product portfolio, that takes some of the lumpiness out of this part of our business, that better fits with what our clients need and where their needs are evolving toward, and that's what that connected system is designed to do. And so we're not running after those short-term revenue opportunities as much in the quarter, and we're -- and that'll continue going forward. And that allows us to reallocate, enables us to reallocate resources to build faster and do more as we develop this connected system initiative. And yes -- so you see all of that reflected in the results in the quarter and our outlook going forward."

So just to give you a little bit of color on our Marketing Effectiveness business, it's up 31.8% in the quarter. As you know, we did have a couple of inorganic beings in there with Nielsen Sports and Nielsen Catalina Solutions. That is growing probably closer to an 18% organic number. The things that we're really excited about in Marketing Effectiveness, first of all, is the Nielsen Marketing Cloud or eXelate is up double digits. Nielsen Buyer Insights is up double digits as clients continue to look for our datasets to help them build ROI solutions. And Nielsen Catalina Solutions is up about 18% organically as well. So we continue to be impressed with the growth that we're seeing in Marketing Effectiveness, and it's provided a nice tailwind for our business. In terms of the free cash flow outlook for the year, so just a couple of things. One is, as you alluded to, most of the sort of revenue shortfall actually is within our Buy business. And so that's a big driver of it. So you got a couple of things thrown into the numbers. One is just the reduced EBITDA outlook, particularly for the developed Buy regions. The second thing is that we're continuing to invest, and actually our investment profile is slightly higher than what we began in at the beginning of the year. And that is a -- both a Watch and a Buy story. So on the Watch side, you've seen us acquire and begin to integrate set-top box data for all the things that we're doing with our Total Audience Measurement initiatives. We've talked about moving away from the paper diaries and bringing more electronic measurement to the marketplace. That certainly roll into the numbers. And then we got a big year in front of us in terms of bringing DCR and DAR the to marketplace and growing that piece of the business. And then the last piece is growing the investment profile associated with our connected system and our Total Consumer initiatives. So combination of lower EBITDA expectations and the -- a slightly higher investment profile for some of the key growth initiatives in the future is driving it. And then one other thing I'd add to that is we're probably going to be at the upper end of what we gave as sort of a cash restructuring number, and that's focused on the fact that in the second quarter and the third quarter, we've taken a couple of actions in our Buy business to set us on the right trajectory for the future. So those are the things that are driving the number from a free cash flow standpoint."

Thanks, Dan. First, on your first question related to Buy and e-commerce, we continued the development of our e-commerce solution for the U.S., where we're bringing together some of our panel data, some other third-party data and big data sources all together in a hybrid solution that allows us to cover the rapidly growing e-commerce channels, both the extensions of the brick-and-mortar players and the pure-play e-commerce platforms, including the largest players out there. We're bringing that forward to the marketplace. And by the end of this year, that'll be in the hands of a growing number of our clients and start to roll through our business in a more full way in 2017. That's the U.S. And we have similar solutions in play, basically the same design, depends on the country, in 11 other markets where e-commerce sales are significant around the world. With regard to Amazon, they -- no change really in their status. In terms of their willingness to share their sales data, like retailers typically do with us as we measure fast-moving consumer goods, they still prefer to remain on the outside of that collaboration model, cooperation model. That typifies our retail measurement service. And so like we've done with Netflix on the Watch side of the business, we find other ways to measure the activity on those kinds of platforms. We've done that very successfully on the Watch side covering Netflix and other subscription video-on-demand platforms, and we're able to do it on the Buy said as well to measure what's happening on Amazon's platform. With regard to Alibaba, we continue to be very closely in touch and active with Alibaba in the China market as well as TenCent and Sina and Baidu, a lot of the really big players. In U.S., we have FANG: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. In China, they have their similar 4 or 5 major players, and we're active with all of them. I was in China last month and -- with our teams, and part of that also included a meeting with the most senior leaders at Baidu and talking about how we're going to continue to broaden our relationship there. And Alibaba continues to be very active and a key focus for our business in the China market. On your -- on part B of your one question, Dan, with regard to Audio and the competitive situation in the industry, first, on Audio, we're still thrilled with that business. It's exactly what we expected: low single-digit growth, strong free cash flows. You're now seeing us gain some leverage from the Audio business in a new way, leveraging the PPM measurement capability to add more effective sample size to our local TV measurement over on the video side of the equation. And then we're continuing to pursue international wins in the radio audience measurement business through the capabilities we have. We have some of those in our history, and there's a few more opportunities in front of us. And the other thing we're doing there is obviously continuing to bring our analytics portfolio to the radio industry to help them better tell their ROI and penetrations, too, in the marketplace. And the cooperative -- industry collaboration that's going on to try to prop up a competitive alternative uses ACR technology, automated content recognition technology. I think that's the one you're probably referring to. Look, we're very familiar with that kind of technology. We have it ourselves already in our toolbag. We know what it's good for and how -- what it's work well for, and we also know quite a bit about its limitations. And so we're staying focused on our strategy in -- on audience measurement. And currency-grade measurement that the marketplace trades on, it has representative panels that represent all the key segments of the marketplace in a manner that's always been important, currently is and will remain important. That's what Nielsen is about. And that's easier said than done. We know that from experience."

On the currency definition, I commented on that earlier. Maybe just a thing to add. We've had a series of meetings with the industry. The most recent one was last week. It continue -- we continue to narrow in on the definition, and there's a lot of reasons for us to be confident that our Total Audience Measurement system is going to play a big role in the 2017 upfront. Let me tell you what we're hearing there also, not just what Nielsen thinks but what's some of the key industry players think. One example is Rino Scanzoni. He's the Chief Investment Officer at GroupM. He was quoted a few weeks ago saying something like, ""We're looking forward to making the Total Audience the currency in the next upfront."" And then what he said was, ""We have to go there."" There's 10% to 12% more audience if you factor in the viewing on these other devices. His voice is really important because, well, he was central to the C3 metric 10 years ago when that was converged on by the industry and has since served as the definition of the currency. So that's what -- that's how Rino was thinking about Total Audience and new definition of the currency for the 2017 upfront. David Poltrack, Chief Research officer at CBS, he was just more direct. He just said, ""We're definitely moving forward."" That was his attitude toward it. And so I think the keys to this way of thinking for these key industry influencers are the fact that we passed the syndication point for Digital Content Ratings at the end of September. We are on the path to fully syndicate Total Content Ratings by the early part of 2017. Already in full syndication for the participating publishers. We're just going to add agencies and other members of the ecosystem in the early part of the year. Those are the last key pieces in the puzzle. And so we've delivered on those, and that's why I think everybody's pretty confident in terms of this measurement system. And some sense of what that new currency definition is going to be, playing an important role in the 2017 upfronts."

I think your characterization of our business is exactly right. What the connected system does is it transitions our Buy business to look a little bit more like an info services business than it does today. Currently, for a lot of the things that we've been talking about, we have more of a people-as-a-service business mix than a typical info services company. And so the implication is that we'll have a higher-margin business close to transition as we'll have more opportunities to sell data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service business. And as Mitch said, there's a tremendous value, reduced cost on the client side. And it should help us be more efficient and more productive in terms of how we deliver that service to our clients. And so it's an exciting transition for us."

As our system, connected system, it's a hugely important initiative that we're focused on, is developed, it will be connected directly to our clients' business processes and systems, whereas right now, there's a lot of manual intervention required, both on our side and on our clients' side in order to draw the full value out of these data resources that we provide to our clients. So it creates a lot of efficiencies, both on our side and on our clients' side, and that's back to our point about this is a stronger, higher-margin business, more valuable to Nielsen and more valuable to our clients. So that's a transition. More work to do. It's not a flip-the-switch kind of impact, though. It's a gradual transition. It'll evolve over time. We've done some restructuring already.

Europe, the Pacific, Canada all turned in solid quarters of growth. The U.S. is where we have the decline, a tough environment we've talked about. We're judging these to be secular shifts, and we're responding accordingly in terms of the magnitude and the pace of the changes we're making in our business to reduce our cost base, reallocate our resources, accelerate our investments in particular in this connected system that helps us move from what today is much of a people-as-a-service business model to being much more of a data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service business model in the future. All of it adds up to stronger, higher-margin business for Nielsen going forward.

On last quarter's call, we talked about the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve. And, as you all know, change is a source of both challenge and opportunity, and we saw both in this quarter. 
In our Watch business, our momentum continued with our Total Audience Measurement system. Client adoption continued to grow as Digital Content Ratings moved to syndicated reporting, Digital Ad Ratings expanded to new markets and the industry further narrowed in on a new currency definition. We also announced upgrades to our local TV measurement. So we feel great about our progress here. 
For our Buy business, emerging markets continued to produce solid top line growth as our investments in coverage and granularity and our balanced strength with both local and global clients continued to pay off. But regarding developed markets, while Europe made good progress in the quarter, our U.S. results were down versus the prior year as clients looked for more efficiency and productivity in the face of an increasingly difficult growth environment. 
Earlier this year, as we saw these more challenging trends unfolding, we realigned our Buy business to be more focused in our product development and more efficient in our overhead. More recently, as the trends continued for our clients, we stepped up our efforts to reduce our cost base, reallocate resources and accelerate our investments and initiatives that will help our clients and better position our business for the future. 
We've been hard at work on these initiatives, and you'll hear more about them in a few minutes. But for now, let me say that our Buy business is working through a process of change that's similar to what we've been executing on successfully in our Watch business, and we're confident that our Buy initiatives will produce similar results. 
Let's look at the financials for the third quarter. At a total company level, revenue grew 3.6% on a constant-currency basis. Revenues in our Watch segment increased 6.7% on a constant-currency basis, including an 8.5% increase in Audience Measurement of Video and Text. Buy segment revenues grew just under 1% on a constant-currency basis as emerging markets growth of nearly 9% was offset by a decline in developed markets driven by the U.S. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 4% constant currency, supported by ongoing productivity and operating leverage, offset in part by our accelerated investments in key initiatives. 
Adjusted net income per share grew almost 6% constant currency to $0.74. 
Free cash flow was a record $353 million in the quarter, up slightly compared to a year ago. 
We remain committed to driving shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy, and we do this by investing consistently in our future growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back approximately $90 million in shares, and as of September 30, we had approximately $460 million remaining under our existing authorization. 
Lastly, in light of our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're updating our guidance for the full year, and Jamere will provide detail on this in a few minutes. 
Let's look at the segments. First, Watch. If we turn back the clock a bit, it was just a few years ago when the market was still thinking of Nielsen as the television measurement company. As viewing fragmented across screens and digital platforms, we responded with measurement capabilities that followed the consumer. Over time, this developed into what we know today as our Total Audience Measurement system. The progress we've made is reflected in our Watch business performance. But it didn't happen overnight. It's been a multiyear evolution, and our teams have diligently executed on each step, bringing this whole framework to life. And while we've made very good progress, we continue to work alongside our clients every day, adding new features as clients explore all potential use cases for the data. It's an exciting time for the industry and for Nielsen. 
Let's look at some specific highlights from the quarter. In September, Digital Content Ratings became available in full syndication on schedule. This was a tremendous milestone. Publishers, agencies and advertisers are now equipped with powerful daily data that helps them understand the value of content across digital platforms. Adoption is growing daily. 
For Total Content Ratings, at the direct request of our clients, we made some changes to our original release schedule. The initial step of this schedule occurred on August 1, making Total Content Ratings available on a syndicated basis to all participating publishers. We'll broaden that to include agencies at the start of 2017 before making the data available to the entire industry by the end of the first quarter. In the meantime, we continue to work closely with our clients to help them gain comfort with the comparable metrics in advance of full syndication. Just a reminder, Total Content Ratings includes measurement of subscription video-on-demand, now covering over 15,000 different program episodes, nearly double the number from about 6 months ago. 
On Digital Ad Ratings, we continue to grow and expand. Campaigns in the third quarter were up 45%, reflecting growing volumes with existing large clients as well as very strong adoption from new, smaller advertisers. Across the board, we're seeing growing use of Digital Ad Ratings for guarantees. 
We've also made good progress with Digital Ad Ratings internationally. For example, in Canada, our penetration among the top 25 advertisers is now comparable to the U.S. We also recently announced Digital Ad Ratings in Taiwan, our 24th market. In 2017, we'll add 8 to 10 additional markets, and we'll also upgrade some existing markets to include Total Ad Ratings. 
Overall, client adoption in support of our Total Audience Measurement system is steadily growing. As we look out to 2017, our clients remain highly engaged in the effort to move the industry toward a new ratings standard. While the definition of a new currency is not up for Nielsen alone to decide, we're confident that with the clarity and momentum we built with Total Audience Measurement, it'll play an important role in the 2017 upfronts. 
In local TV, we recently announced some important new initiatives that will substantially enhance our offerings in the U.S. by leveraging our investments in Return Path Data from DISH and Charter as well as our currency-grade panel data. We'll introduce full electronic measurement across all 210 designated market areas by mid-2017, paving the way for the retirement of paper diaries in early 2018. 
Starting in 2017, we'll also integrate Portable People Meter, or PPM, data, for both in-home and out-of-home viewing in the top 44 markets. This will lead to increased stability, a decrease in 0 sells and richer analytics of local viewing habits. By including out-of-home viewing in the ratings, we'll help our local TV clients more fully capture the value of this portion of the TV audience that was previously unmeasured. And by the way, just yesterday, we announced to our clients that out-of-home viewing will also soon be credited to the national ratings. 
We also recently upgraded Social Content Ratings, now covering both Facebook and Twitter in a unified fashion. This upgraded service will replace Nielsen Twitter TV Ratings in all markets, including Australia, Italy, Mexico and the U.S. With social media playing a growing role in consumers' lives and TV experiences, its value for the media industry will also continue to grow. 
Turning to Marketing Effectiveness. We had another strong quarter with constant-currency revenues up over 30%. As a reminder, this is the part of our business where we bring together our Watch and Buy assets to help marketers improve their return on investment in advertising. A large part of this is enabled by the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, which provides our clients with faster access to data and analytics, helping them make more informed marketing and media decisions. 
One recent example of this is our advanced marketing optimization solution made available in partnership with RevTrax, a one-to-one digital promotions company. Kimberly-Clark is one of the lead clients leveraging this new application to continuously update their promotions content based on real-time changes in consumer behavior, all with the name of increasing the ROI of their digital promotions. 
Also notable is Nielsen Catalina's recently announced collaboration with Facebook. This deal enables marketers to directly connect their advertising activity to its impact on sales as well as deliver more relevant advertising to target consumers. By combining the largest, most representative purchase dataset in the fast-moving consumer goods industry with ad exposure information from Facebook, we get a deep understanding of how these ads are driving consumers to purchase. 
Turning to the Buy business. In emerging markets, our business continues to deliver solid, broad-based growth, including double-digit growth across several key markets in Latin America, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and India. As a group, these markets do have a lot of runway for continued growth via added coverage, granularity and increasing penetration of the related analytics that help our clients drive progress in their business. Our investments in coverage and granularity and our balanced strength with both local and global clients continue to pay off. 
In developed markets, specifically the U.S., the environment in which we operate has become more challenging. Large global manufacturers are the strength of our client base. And as I'm sure you've seen in the recent press, they've found it increasingly difficult to achieve growth in markets with growing fragmentation in consumer demand, more competition from smaller and local players and increased commodity pricing. Together, these factors have led them to seek efficiencies and productivity in their business, and our business has not been immune. 
Our clients continue to value our core measurement services, especially given the growing product and retail fragmentation in the market. But when it comes to analytics, their needs have been shifting. Clients are shifting away from custom insights delivered via deep-dive projects, and they're shifting toward everyday analytics, often called activation, delivered directly to multiple end users. Our view is that this is a secular shift, not a passing phase or a cycle that'll swing back. Clients want analytics that'll help them answer the question of what do I need to do this week or tomorrow or even today to drive sales, protect market share or improve my competitive position. In today's challenging growth environment, that's what's most valuable to them. 
Now let me walk you through what we are doing to respond to this. First, you'll see us aggressively moving away from slower-growing noncore services. These moves are enabling us to accelerate and increase our investments in our key initiatives that will better position our business for the future. The most important of these initiatives are Total Consumer measurement and our connected system. 
Total Consumer measurement is about following consumers across all retail formats to ensure full coverage of sales. In a changing and fragmenting retail environment, this requires ongoing effort to help our clients understand emerging channels like specialty retailers, hard discounters, direct-to-consumer models and, of course, e-commerce. Speaking of e-commerce, we've made good progress on our hybrid solution announced earlier this year. It combines high-quality panels with big data to provide broad and granular coverage of e-commerce sales, including on the largest platforms. 
Our second initiative, our connected system, is the bigger of the 2. This open system connects Nielsen, client and third-party data, including our core Watch and Buy measurement data, with applications designed for decision makers in our clients' marketing, sales, R&D and finance functions. This means faster, data-driven decisions on everyday questions related to pricing, promotion, distribution, new product innovation, assortment and marketing mix optimization, all in one connected system. And this is the key because many of these capabilities already exist as stand-alone point solutions. But connecting them all in one system, one that delivers these capabilities continuously every day and directly to end users, that's what will help our clients reduce their internal costs while also driving a big step-up in value and speed for their business. And just as importantly, it'll significantly reduce costs and improve margins for Nielsen. 
Since we first talked with you about the connected system at our Analyst Day last December, we've been hard at work. Today, it's in the hands of 5 initial clients who are working with us to refine the system's design. We've also demonstrated live modules for our client advisory board and others. And the positive feedback from our clients, coupled with the changes we see unfolding in the market, have encouraged us to accelerate our development schedule and investments. 
We'll expand the availability of the system to 20 to 30 additional clients in mid-2017, followed by a further rollout late in the year. And as that rollout unfolds, you'll see -- you'll also see the ongoing development of our Connected Partner Program that we announced last week. 
Connected partners are third-party analytics companies who build apps, and those apps run on our connected system's open platform, providing more usefulness and value for our clients. These apps amplify the value of the underlying measurement data that is the core of our business. A recent Forbes article referred to this as Nielsen opening its big data treasure chest. We'll go into a deep dive on all this at our upcoming Analyst Day in December. 
Regarding the time line, one way to think about this is that our Buy business is working through a process similar to what we've been executing on successfully in our Watch business. We'll work through most of 2017 bringing additional components of the connected system to market. It will likely not be until 2018 until the fuller version begins to contribute meaningfully to the performance of our Buy business. 
Through this process, we're truly transforming the core of our Buy business: comprehensive measurement coverage, integrated data and analytics embedded in our clients workflows with data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service solutions, directly accessed by our client teams in marketing, sales, R&D and finance. And for Nielsen, a stronger, higher-margin business better positioned for the future. 
It's important to note that these benefits will reach beyond our U.S. business. We'll leverage this system across the developed world on roughly the same schedule. And longer term, it'll also add value to our business in key emerging markets. In the meantime, we'll continue to realign our cost base, prune our portfolio and reallocate resources to enable us to accelerate our progress and better position this part of our business for the future. 
We have a lot of work to do, but it's exciting. And because we're guided by our clients, we have a high level of confidence in our strategy and the key bets we're placing. And because I know the Nielsen team behind this work, I have a high level of confidence in our ability to execute. We look forward to updating you at our Analyst Day in December. 
Over to you, Jamere."

Overall, as Mitch mentioned, our business grew in a much more challenging environment than we have seen in the past few quarters, highlighting the strength of our balanced portfolio. 
First, let me cover our total company results for the third quarter. On the left side of the page, are our results on a U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just under $1.6 billion, up 2.5% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment, partially offset by softness in the developed markets in our Buy segment. 
Net income was $132 million, and net income per share was $0.36, which was down $0.02 a share versus the third quarter of 2015. Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and our share buyback program, offset by higher restructuring charges related to further restructuring in our Buy segment. 
Moving to the right side of the page, on a non-GAAP basis.  Revenue was up 3.6% constant currency. Despite a more challenging environment, we still delivered revenue growth, driven by strength in our subscription-based recurring revenue and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 6.7% on a constant-currency basis, driven by our investments, continued momentum in Audience Measurement of Video and Text and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew just under 1% constant currency, led by continued strength in the emerging markets, which was partially offset by a decline in the developed markets. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $498 million, up 4% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.7%, up 10 basis points on a constant-currency basis. 
In the quarter, we continued disciplined investments in growth and productivity initiatives that will generate top line growth and margin expansion in 2017 and beyond. Adjusted net income was $266 million, up 3.1% constant currency; and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.74, up 5.7% versus prior year on a constant-currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
Finally, we generated record free cash flow of $353 million, which was up 2% versus a strong third quarter in 2015. 
Next, I'll move to the segments and provide a little more color. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $761 million, up 6.7% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 8.5% on a constant-currency basis. As expected, Audio was down 2.8% on a constant-currency basis against the tough comp in 3Q '15 that grew 11%, driven by timing of deliveries. The business is performing in line with our expectations and generating strong earnings and cash flow. 
Marketing Effectiveness was up 31.8% constant currency behind strong results from the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, Nielsen Catalina Solutions and Repucom, which is now branded as Nielsen Sports. The investments we have made in Marketing Effectiveness continue to drive Watch segment growth, and we continue to see strong demand from a broad array of clients. 
As expected, Other Watch was about a 2-points drag on Watch revenue on a constant-currency basis, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Watch adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, up 7.5% constant currency. Watch margins expanded 33 basis points on a constant-currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage while investing in the business. 
Let me say a few words about a couple of our key initiatives in Watch. First, Total Audience's strong momentum. Digital Ad Ratings have been widely adopted by the industry as a way of measuring reach and frequency on ad campaigns. In the third quarter, Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 45%, led by strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners. We have added nearly 100 new Digital Ad Ratings clients this year and experienced strong renewals, with good pricing from existing clients. 
Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, continues to gain traction with key clients for both video and text measurement. In the quarter, DCR was fully syndicated, and we continue to add networks and digital players to an already strong roster of previously signed clients. In fact, we have over 90 brands being measured in DCR, and syndicated clients include A+E, ABC, AOL, Buzzfeed, Discovery and Vice, among many others. Digital Content Ratings is a key piece of our Total Audience capabilities and will be a future growth driver for our business. 
Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy, and Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth. We remain confident in our 2016 Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth on a constant-currency basis. 
Turning to Buy. Third quarter total Buy revenue was $809 million, up just under 1% on a constant-currency basis. On a total segment basis, our syndicated recurring revenue business remains solid. However, our ad hoc discretionary revenue declined. Our business in the developed markets was $542 million, down 2.5% on a constant-currency basis as we continue to see softness in discretionary spend, especially in the U.S. Additionally, we are taking steps to future-proof our business by pruning and sunsetting slow-growth, noncore services in developed markets. These actions, along with further restructuring in our Buy segment and accelerating the development of our connected system, will strengthen our business. 
As you've often heard me say, we are clearly operating in a 2-speed world with significantly higher growth rates in the emerging markets versus developed markets. In the third quarter, our business in the emerging markets was $267 million, up 8.5% on a constant-currency basis. As Mitch mentioned, growth was broad based across a number of markets. In addition, we saw double-digit growth from multinationals that gives us more confidence that emerging markets will continue to be a tailwind for our Buy segment revenue into 2017. 
Buy EBITDA was $150 million, down 3.8% constant currency. In this environment, we continue to invest in a disciplined way in coverage and building out the connected system, which will drive future growth and profitability in our Buy business. The early read from our initial pilot clients is promising, and we are confident that our investment will further strengthen our competitive position. 
These key investments, along with an unfavorable mix between our developed and emerging markets revenue, are the key drivers for our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins being down 91 basis points versus the prior year. 
Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter outlook in developed Buy, we now expect our Buy revenue to grow approximately 1.5% to 2% for 2016. 
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant-currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. 
In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 110-basis-points drag on revenue. If current spot rates held constant in 2016, then we expect a 170-basis-points drag on revenue and a 70-basis-points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is in line with the forecasts we gave last quarter. 
Moving to 2016 guidance. In light of our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook in developed Buy, we are updating our full year guidance, highlighted by revenue growth of approximately 3.5% to 4% on a constant-currency basis; adjusted EBITDA margin growth of 30 basis points; adjusted net income per share of $2.73 to $2.79; and free cash flow of approximately $850 million. 
So to wrap up, our third quarter was highlighted by revenue growth and margin expansion in a more challenging environment. First, our Watch business has tremendous momentum behind our Total Audience initiatives; and Buy, our subscription-based recurring revenue business, remains solid; and emerging market growth remains robust while our developed market business in the U.S. has declined. 
But importantly, across both Watch and Buy, we continue to invest in a disciplined way to build a stronger, higher-margin business. In addition, we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Yaeni."

First, with regard to Buy developed, yes, that is the challenging spot for our business in the quarter. But I would even narrow it further for you, because within Buy developed, Europe grew, the Pacific grew, Canada grew. It's really the U.S. where the problem is focused at the moment. And so just to sharpen the focus a little bit, focus on the U.S., what we're seeing in the U.S. market, let me give you a couple of examples in terms of the external environment that our clients are dealing with. First, if you just focus in on food and beverage manufacturers, 2015, we saw this trend starting to emerge where the small- and medium-sized manufacturers accounted for about half of the growth in the categories and private label accounted for about 1/4 of the growth. And the big -- the top 25 players, they accounted collectively for only 3% of the growth in food and beverage categories in 2015, and that situation really hasn't changed that much in 2016. The reason why that's especially noteworthy for our business is the strength of our business just so happens to be the biggest global companies, the biggest global players. And so you see that reflected in our U.S. results. What all these companies are dealing with, both food and beverage and others, is a combination of things: product fragmentation, where consumers are increasingly shifting their purchasing to smaller specialty, more niche products, moving away a little bit from the bigger brands; you see retail fragmentation to purchases moving across additional channels; you, of course, see the 3G effect sweeping through the fast-moving consumer goods industry, where companies, whether 3G is a factor or not, are practicing zero-based budgeting. They're running their own internal 3G play. And so you add up all these things together, and that's the situation that our clients are contending with, and you see that reflected back in our results. Now, for us, what that means in terms of their discretionary spend, as I said, we're -- they're shifting from these more deep-dive projects that help them think about what they're going to do next year and focus much more on these everyday analytics that help them with activation; what should I do today or tomorrow or this week? And that's where the shift is happening in the marketplace. And so we're realigning our portfolio to better serve those client interests and those client needs. And so as I mentioned, we don't see this as just a passing phase that the marketplace is going through. We see this as a trend that will continue on more of a secular basis over the long run. As we make this shift and as we build out this connected system, you see us building a very different business, really, frankly. Right now, it's very much a professional services model for Nielsen. As that connected system starts to unfold in the marketplace, it helps us to move from a professional service or a people-as-a-service business model to much more as a data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service business model, and that all results in us, as Jamere said in his opening comments, having a stronger, higher-margin business. Jamere, what would you add?"

So you did see our margins dip in the quarter. I would say that the key drivers, as I said in my comments, were there was a bit of a mix issue as emerging markets revenue grew 8.5% and the higher-margin developed markets revenue actually declined. I'd say the second thing, as Mitch said, we're continuing to invest in the connected system and our Total Consumer initiatives to future-proof the business. And so in the short term, with a softer revenue profile, this obviously puts pressure on margins. But in terms of our long-term productivity drivers, I would say 3 things. One is we're continuing to see scale benefits in the emerging markets, and there's a focus on profitability. We're running the plays with intensity around cost and productivity. I mentioned before that we have over 4,000 projects that are running inside the company. We're invested in our products, our higher-margin products. And I'd say the last thing is you've seen us take a couple of rounds of restructuring in the second quarter and the third quarter to put us on the right trajectory going forward. So we have confidence, again, that we will expand margins on a total company basis, and we're running all the right plays inside of the company to be able to achieve that."

Let me take a shot at seeing if you'll comment anything to help us size this a little bit. When you used to disclose the Insights line item or analytics line item in the Buy segment, I think the last you did that was 2014. And at that point in time, it -- I think it was about 25% of Buy segment revenue. So I guess a question is, is that any reason to think that it's not sort of similar to that today? Any comment you'd make on sort of the relative margin profile of that part of the business compared to the segment overall margin profile? And then, as we think about what part of it is at risk, can you help us through is all of that revenue pool at risk? Is some of that at risk as you transition to replacing it with this other shape of revenue? And just helping us size it in that way, whatever you help us say would be really helpful."

So in terms of the size of what I will call our analytics or discretionary business, it is probably in the 30%-ish kind of range in terms of our total portfolio, sometimes a little bit more or a little bit less on a quarter basis just depending on what the project pipeline is. I would say a couple of things. First of all, from a -- in terms of what the focus area is -- in our portfolio is, there's probably 3% to 4% of the Buy revenue that is, as Mitch mentioned, slow growing or becoming noncore. And just a couple of examples: if you look at a year ago, we were providing data and analytics for things like helping retailers optimize store locations in a world where bricks and mortar is under pressure and e-commerce is actually growing; we were providing data and analytics around video sales and retail channels in an environment where consumers are moving to more screen and digital consumption; providing data and analytics around alcoholic beverages moving through wholesaler channels. So these are some examples of a very broad portfolio in Buy. And as we look at our resource allocation, as we look at the discretionary nature of some of those datasets and those analytics, we're actually going to move away from some of those. So it's 3% to 4% of the portfolio, and we're going to be aggressive about that and replace that with things that are more future-proof and things that are actually in our connected Buy system platform, if you will. Now, in terms of the margin profile, the analytics or ad hoc or discretionary projects have tended to be a lower-margin profile than the overall business. And so as we think about moving forward in our future to a connected Buy system that is much more data as a service or people as a service oriented, the margin profile will certainly improve overall for the Buy business, so."

And we see a pattern in terms of which parts are performing better versus which ones are struggling in the current environment. And here are the -- here's the characteristics of the things that are doing well. If the analytics capability is connected to our core measurement data, that's a positive. Second, if it is more focused on activation or these everyday analytics kinds of questions, that's a positive. And third, if the talent required in that analytics area is similar to the talent that helps us be successful in our core measurement business, that also tends to do better within the Nielsen portfolio. So we have a number of analytics capabilities that perfectly fit that profile. And no surprise, those are the parts that are performing really well. And then we have a number of others that don't fit that profile, and those are the ones where we have some decisions to make. And we've already started to take those decisions, as Jamere recounted. One other thing that I'll add to this picture, which I hope will be helpful, Todd, is, why -- you might be wondering, why is this showing up more in the U.S. than it is in other places? Well, fact is the U.S. revenues -- a bigger percentage of our U.S. revenues are these discretionary services. In fact, there's about twice as much -- slightly more than twice as much of our U.S. revenues come from these discretionary services as compared to Europe, where it's a much smaller percentage. So that's why you see it showing up in the U.S., and that's why our focus is currently centered on the U.S. But we're transforming our Buy portfolio really for the entire developed market wheel. Then ultimately, a lot of these moves that we're making in particular with the connected system will benefit our business in the key emerging markets as well."

The time line I described in my opening comments, I think is exactly the right way to think about it, which is -- well, first of all, let me start with we already have an initial version of this system built and in the hands of 5 initial clients. So I want you to just realize that this is real, and it's something we've been working on now for the better part of a year and even before Analyst Day last December when we first talked about this with our investors and analysts. So we already have it in the hands of 5 initial clients. We have live modules that are already usable. We demonstrated those for our clients, and we have great feedback so far. In fact, our clients are already thinking through what it's going to mean in terms of implementation on their side. That's the kind of reaction we've received so far. We'll roll it out to 20 to 30 additional clients by the middle of 2017. And by the end of the year is when we think we'll be prepared for a more full rollout to all clients who want to start to make the shift, the transition to this connected system. So yes, we're certainly hopeful that it'll start to have some impact on our business in 2017, but I think the better way to think about it is it'll start to show up meaningfully, significantly in our business, especially the financial results, in the 2018 time frame. There's one other thing to add to that, just to put maybe a reference point on that. I mentioned in my opening comments that I think it's exactly the right way to think about it. While it's a slightly different system that we're building and a slightly different set of client needs that we're addressing, the magnitude of this and the execution required to do it properly, to do it in a way that really fits with what our clients need is very similar to what you've seen us work successfully through on the Watch side of our business as we developed the Total Audience Measurement framework and rolled that out to our clients over the past couple of years. So look, we know how to do this. We have the teams in place, and they're very focused and excited about the task in front of them. And we have a huge opportunity to drive this stronger, higher-margin business for our future, to take costs out of our clients' business, on their side of the table, and to give them a lot more value and a lot more speed."

And if you look at our results in our developed Buy business, they've sequentially been going in the other direction. And part of that is because that stable or, I would say, the environment in the third quarter last year actually ran a little hot. I'd say that environment has slowly started to erode and we're starting to see the dynamics that Mitch and I have discussed in the call today. From a margin standpoint, again, you have a couple of dynamics there. One is you have sort of the mix shift between our developed markets revenue and our emerging markets revenue that certainly plays into the numbers. And then the second thing, as I said, is we'll continue to invest in our growth initiatives. And in a softer revenue environment, we're going to feel that margin pressure. But more importantly, we've taken the actions, if you will, that will put us on the right trajectory from a cost standpoint: first of all, as I said, a couple of rounds of restructuring that you saw in the second and the third quarter numbers; we'll continue to work on our productivity initiatives; we're investing and actually emphasizing the faster-growing, higher-margin pieces of the Buy portfolio.

And so we just reached the conclusion that it's not viable for the long term to keep running after these short-term revenue opportunities and keep trying to chase these and work our way through the lumpy nature of this part of our business. Instead, a much better future is about investing in something that transforms our product portfolio, that takes some of the lumpiness out of this part of our business, that better fits with what our clients need and where their needs are evolving toward, and that's what that connected system is designed to do. And so we're not running after those short-term revenue opportunities as much in the quarter, and we're -- and that'll continue going forward.

Nielsen Buyer Insights is up double digits as clients continue to look for our datasets to help them build ROI solutions. And Nielsen Catalina Solutions is up about 18% organically as well. So we continue to be impressed with the growth that we're seeing in Marketing Effectiveness, and it's provided a nice tailwind for our business. In terms of the free cash flow outlook for the year, so just a couple of things. One is, as you alluded to, most of the sort of revenue shortfall actually is within our Buy business. And so that's a big driver of it. So you got a couple of things growing through the numbers. One is just reduced EBITDA outlook, particularly for the developed Buy regions. The second thing is that we're continuing to invest, and actually, our investment profile is slightly higher than what we began in at the beginning of the year. And that is a -- both a Watch and a Buy story. So on the Watch side, you've seen us acquire and begin to integrate set-top box data for all the things that we're doing with our Total Audience Measurement initiatives. We've talked about moving away from the paper diaries and bringing more electronic measurement to the marketplace. That certainly roll into the numbers. And then we got a big year in front of us in terms of bringing DCR and DAR to the marketplace and growing that piece of the business. And then the last piece is growing the investment profile associated with our connected system and our Total Consumer initiatives. So combination of lower EBITDA expectations and the -- a slightly higher investment profile for some of the key growth initiatives in the future is driving it. And then one other thing I'd add to that is we're probably going to be at the upper end of what we gave as sort of a cash restructuring number, and that's focused on the fact that in the second quarter and the third quarter, we've taken a couple of actions in our Buy business to set us on the right trajectory for the future. So those are the things that are driving the number from a free cash flow standpoint."

Thanks, Dan. First, on your first question related to Buy and e-commerce, we continued the development of our e-commerce solution for the U.S., where we're bringing together some of our panel data, some other third-party data and big data sources all together in a hybrid solution that allows us to cover the rapidly growing e-commerce channels, both the extensions of the brick-and-mortar players and the pure-play e-commerce platforms, including the largest players out there. We're bringing that forward to the marketplace. And by the end of this year, that'll be in the hands of a growing number of our clients and start to roll through our business in a more full way in 2017. That's the U.S. And we have similar solutions that employ basically the same design, depends on the country, in 11 other markets where e-commerce sales are significant around the world. With regard to Amazon, they -- no change really in their status. In terms of their willingness to share their sales data, like retailers typically do with us as we measure fast-moving consumer goods, they still prefer to remain on the outside of that collaboration model, cooperation model that typifies our retail measurement service. And so like we've done with Netflix on the Watch side of the business, we find other ways to measure the activity on those kinds of platforms. We've done that very successfully on the Watch side covering Netflix and other subscription video-on-demand platforms, and we're able to do it on the Buy side as well to measure what's happening on Amazon's platform. With regard to Alibaba, we continue to be very closely in touch and active with Alibaba in the China market as well as Tencent and Sina and Baidu, a lot of the other really big players. In U.S., we have FANG: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. In China, they have their similar 4 or 5 major players, and we're active with all of them. I was in China last month and -- with our teams, and part of that also included meeting with the most senior leaders at Baidu and talking about how we're going to continue to broaden our relationship there. And Alibaba continues to be very active and a key focus for our business in the China market. On your -- on part B of your one question, Dan, with regard to Audio and the competitive situation in the industry, first, on Audio, we're still thrilled with that business. It's exactly what we expected: low single-digit growth, strong free cash flows. You're now seeing us gain some leverage from the Audio business in a new way, leveraging the PPM measurement capability to add more effective sample size to our local TV measurement over on the video side of the equation. And then we're continuing to pursue international wins in the radio audience measurement business through the capabilities we have. We have some of those in our history, and there's a few more opportunities in front of us. And the other thing we're doing there is obviously continuing to bring our analytics portfolio to the radio industry to help them better tell their ROI and penetration story in the marketplace. And the cooperative -- industry collaboration that's going on to try to prop up a competitive alternative uses ACR technology, automated content recognition technology. I think that's the one you're probably referring to. Look, we're very familiar with that kind of technology. We have it ourselves already in our tool bag. We know what it's good for and how -- what it's work well for, and we also know quite a bit about its limitations. And so we're staying focused on our strategy and on audience measurement. And currency-grade measurement that the marketplace trades on, it has representative panels that represent all the key segments of the marketplace in a manner that's always been important, currently is and will remain important. That's what Nielsen is about. And that's easier said than done. We know that from experience."

On the currency definition, I commented on that earlier. Maybe just a thing to add. We've had a series of meetings with the industry. The most recent one was last week. It continue -- we continue to narrow in on the definition, and there's a lot of reasons for us to be confident that our Total Audience Measurement system is going to play a big role in the 2017 upfronts. Let me tell you what we're hearing though also, not just what Nielsen thinks, but what's some of the key industry players think. One example is Rino Scanzoni. He's the Chief Investment Officer at GroupM. He was quoted a few weeks ago saying something like, ""We're looking forward to making the Total Audience the currency in the next upfront."" And then what he said was, ""We have to go there."" There's 10% to 12% more audience if you factor in the viewing on these other devices. His voice is really important because, well, he was central to the C3 metric 10 years ago when that was converged on by the industry and has since served as the definition of the currency. So that's what -- that's how Rino was thinking about Total Audience and new definition of the currency for the 2017 upfront. David Poltrack, Chief Research officer at CBS, he was just more direct. He just said, ""We're definitely moving forward."" That was his attitude toward it. And so I think the keys to this way of thinking for these key industry influencers are the fact that we passed the syndication point for Digital Content Ratings at the end of September. We are on the path to fully syndicate Total Content Ratings by the early part of 2017; already in full syndication for the participating publishers. We're just going to add agencies and other members of the ecosystem in the early part of the year. Those are the last key pieces in the puzzle. And so we've delivered on those, and that's why I think everybody's pretty confident in terms of this measurement system. And some sense of what that new currency definition is going to be, playing an important role in the 2017 upfronts."

I think your characterization of our business is exactly right. What the connected system does is it transitions our Buy business to look a little bit more like an info services business than it does today. Currently, for a lot of the things that we've been talking about, we have more of a people-as-a-service business mix than a typical info services company. And so the implication is that we'll have a higher-margin business post the transition as we'll have more opportunities to sell data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service business. And as Mitch said, there's a tremendous value, reduced cost on the client side. And it should help us be more efficient and more productive in terms of how we deliver that service to our clients. And so it's an exciting transition for us."

What it will mean is a different mix of people, a slightly different set of skills and different roles inside the business. As our system, connected system, this hugely important initiative that we're focused on, is developed, it will be connected directly to our clients' business processes and systems; whereas right now, there's a lot of manual intervention required, both on our side and on our clients' side in order to draw full value out of these data resources that we provide to our clients. So it creates a lot of efficiencies, both on our side and on our clients' side, and that's back to our point about this is a stronger, higher-margin business, more valuable to Nielsen and more valuable to our clients. So that's the transition we'll work to. It's not a flip-the-switch kind of impact, though. It's a gradual transition. It'll evolve over time. We've done some restructuring already. And if we get to the point where we see the next move that needs to be made on that front, of course, you'll see us do it."

All of it adds up to stronger, higher-margin business for Nielsen going forward.

On last quarter's call, we talked about the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve. And, as you all know, change is a source of both challenge and opportunity, and we saw both in this quarter. 
In our Watch business, our momentum continued with our Total Audience Measurement system. Client adoption continued to grow as Digital Content Ratings moved to syndicated reporting, Digital Ad Ratings expanded to new markets and the industry further narrowed in on a new currency definition. We also announced upgrades to our local TV measurement. So we feel great about our progress here. 
For our Buy business, emerging markets continued to produce solid top line growth as our investments in coverage and granularity and our balanced strength with both local and global clients continued to pay off. But regarding developed markets, while Europe made good progress in the quarter, our U.S. results were down versus the prior year as clients looked for more efficiency and productivity in the face of an increasingly difficult growth environment. 
Earlier this year, as we saw these more challenging trends unfolding, we realigned our Buy business to be more focused in our product development and more efficient in our overhead. More recently, as the trends continued for our clients, we stepped up our efforts to reduce our cost base, reallocate resources and accelerate our investments and initiatives that will help our clients and better position our business for the future. 
We've been hard at work on these initiatives, and you'll hear more about them in a few minutes. But for now, let me say that our Buy business is working through a process of change that's similar to what we've been executing on successfully in our Watch business, and we're confident that our Buy initiatives will produce similar results. 
Let's look at the financials for the third quarter. At a total company level, revenue grew 3.6% on a constant-currency basis. Revenues in our Watch segment increased 6.7% on a constant-currency basis, including an 8.5% increase in Audience Measurement of Video and Text. Buy segment revenues grew just under 1% on a constant-currency basis as emerging markets growth of nearly 9% was offset by a decline in developed markets driven by the U.S. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 4% constant currency, supported by ongoing productivity and operating leverage, offset in part by our accelerated investments in key initiatives. 
Adjusted net income per share grew almost 6% constant currency to $0.74. 
Free cash flow was a record $353 million in the quarter, up slightly compared to a year ago. 
We remain committed to driving shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy, and we do this by investing consistently in our future growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back approximately $90 million in shares, and as of September 30, we had approximately $460 million remaining under our existing authorization. 
Lastly, in light of our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're updating our guidance for the full year, and Jamere will provide detail on this in a few minutes. 
Let's look at the segments. First, Watch. If we turn back the clock a bit, it was just a few years ago when the market was still thinking of Nielsen as the television measurement company. As viewing fragmented across screens and digital platforms, we responded with measurement capabilities that followed the consumer. Over time, this developed into what we know today as our Total Audience Measurement system. The progress we've made is reflected in our Watch business performance. But it didn't happen overnight. It's been a multiyear evolution, and our teams have diligently executed on each step, bringing this whole framework to life. And while we've made very good progress, we continue to work alongside our clients every day, adding new features as clients explore all potential use cases for the data. It's an exciting time for the industry and for Nielsen. 
Let's look at some specific highlights from the quarter. In September, Digital Content Ratings became available in full syndication on schedule. This was a tremendous milestone. Publishers, agencies and advertisers are now equipped with powerful daily data that helps them understand the value of content across digital platforms. Adoption is growing daily. 
For Total Content Ratings, at the direct request of our clients, we made some changes to our original release schedule. The initial step of this schedule occurred on August 1, making Total Content Ratings available on a syndicated basis to all participating publishers. We'll broaden that to include agencies at the start of 2017 before making the data available to the entire industry by the end of the first quarter. In the meantime, we continue to work closely with our clients to help them gain comfort with the comparable metrics in advance of full syndication. Just a reminder, Total Content Ratings includes measurement of subscription video-on-demand, now covering over 15,000 different program episodes, nearly double the number from about 6 months ago. 
On Digital Ad Ratings, we continue to grow and expand. Campaigns in the third quarter were up 45%, reflecting growing volumes with existing large clients as well as very strong adoption from new, smaller advertisers. Across the board, we're seeing growing use of Digital Ad Ratings for guarantees. 
We've also made good progress with Digital Ad Ratings internationally. For example, in Canada, our penetration among the top 25 advertisers is now comparable to the U.S. We also recently announced Digital Ad Ratings in Taiwan, our 24th market. In 2017, we'll add 8 to 10 additional markets, and we'll also upgrade some existing markets to include Total Ad Ratings. 
Overall, client adoption in support of our Total Audience Measurement system is steadily growing. As we look out to 2017, our clients remain highly engaged in the effort to move the industry toward a new ratings standard. While the definition of a new currency is not up for Nielsen alone to decide, we're confident that with the clarity and momentum we built with Total Audience Measurement, it'll play an important role in the 2017 upfronts. 
In local TV, we recently announced some important new initiatives that will substantially enhance our offerings in the U.S. by leveraging our investments in Return Path Data from DISH and Charter as well as our currency-grade panel data. We'll introduce full electronic measurement across all 210 designated market areas by mid-2017, paving the way for the retirement of paper diaries in early 2018. 
Starting in 2017, we'll also integrate Portable People Meter, or PPM, data, for both in-home and out-of-home viewing in the top 44 markets. This will lead to increased stability, a decrease in 0 sells and richer analytics of local viewing habits. By including out-of-home viewing in the ratings, we'll help our local TV clients more fully capture the value of this portion of the TV audience that was previously unmeasured. And by the way, just yesterday, we announced to our clients that out-of-home viewing will also soon be credited to the national ratings. 
We also recently upgraded Social Content Ratings, now covering both Facebook and Twitter in a unified fashion. This upgraded service will replace Nielsen Twitter TV Ratings in all markets, including Australia, Italy, Mexico and the U.S. With social media playing a growing role in consumers' lives and TV experiences, its value for the media industry will also continue to grow. 
Turning to Marketing Effectiveness. We had another strong quarter with constant-currency revenues up over 30%. As a reminder, this is the part of our business where we bring together our Watch and Buy assets to help marketers improve their return on investment in advertising. A large part of this is enabled by the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, which provides our clients with faster access to data and analytics, helping them make more informed marketing and media decisions. 
One recent example of this is our advanced marketing optimization solution made available in partnership with RevTrax, a one-to-one digital promotions company. Kimberly-Clark is one of the lead clients leveraging this new application to continuously update their promotions content based on real-time changes in consumer behavior, all with the name of increasing the ROI of their digital promotions. 
Also notable is Nielsen Catalina's recently announced collaboration with Facebook. This deal enables marketers to directly connect their advertising activity to its impact on sales as well as deliver more relevant advertising to target consumers. By combining the largest, most representative purchase dataset in the fast-moving consumer goods industry with ad exposure information from Facebook, we get a deep understanding of how these ads are driving consumers to purchase. 
Turning to the Buy business. In emerging markets, our business continues to deliver solid, broad-based growth, including double-digit growth across several key markets in Latin America, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and India. As a group, these markets do have a lot of runway for continued growth via added coverage, granularity and increasing penetration of the related analytics that help our clients drive progress in their business. Our investments in coverage and granularity and our balanced strength with both local and global clients continue to pay off. 
In developed markets, specifically the U.S., the environment in which we operate has become more challenging. Large global manufacturers are the strength of our client base. And as I'm sure you've seen in the recent press, they've found it increasingly difficult to achieve growth in markets with growing fragmentation in consumer demand, more competition from smaller and local players and increased commodity pricing. Together, these factors have led them to seek efficiencies and productivity in their business, and our business has not been immune. 
Our clients continue to value our core measurement services, especially given the growing product and retail fragmentation in the market. But when it comes to analytics, their needs have been shifting. Clients are shifting away from custom insights delivered via deep-dive projects, and they're shifting toward everyday analytics, often called activation, delivered directly to multiple end users. Our view is that this is a secular shift, not a passing phase or a cycle that'll swing back. Clients want analytics that'll help them answer the question of what do I need to do this week or tomorrow or even today to drive sales, protect market share or improve my competitive position. In today's challenging growth environment, that's what's most valuable to them. 
Now let me walk you through what we are doing to respond to this. First, you'll see us aggressively moving away from slower-growing noncore services. These moves are enabling us to accelerate and increase our investments in our key initiatives that will better position our business for the future. The most important of these initiatives are Total Consumer measurement and our connected system. 
Total Consumer measurement is about following consumers across all retail formats to ensure full coverage of sales. In a changing and fragmenting retail environment, this requires ongoing effort to help our clients understand emerging channels like specialty retailers, hard discounters, direct-to-consumer models and, of course, e-commerce. Speaking of e-commerce, we've made good progress on our hybrid solution announced earlier this year. It combines high-quality panels with big data to provide broad and granular coverage of e-commerce sales, including on the largest platforms. 
Our second initiative, our connected system, is the bigger of the 2. This open system connects Nielsen, client and third-party data, including our core Watch and Buy measurement data, with applications designed for decision makers in our clients' marketing, sales, R&D and finance functions. This means faster, data-driven decisions on everyday questions related to pricing, promotion, distribution, new product innovation, assortment and marketing mix optimization, all in one connected system. And this is the key because many of these capabilities already exist as stand-alone point solutions. But connecting them all in one system, one that delivers these capabilities continuously every day and directly to end users, that's what will help our clients reduce their internal costs while also driving a big step-up in value and speed for their business. And just as importantly, it'll significantly reduce costs and improve margins for Nielsen. 
Since we first talked with you about the connected system at our Analyst Day last December, we've been hard at work. Today, it's in the hands of 5 initial clients who are working with us to refine the system's design. We've also demonstrated live modules for our client advisory board and others. And the positive feedback from our clients, coupled with the changes we see unfolding in the market, have encouraged us to accelerate our development schedule and investments. 
We'll expand the availability of the system to 20 to 30 additional clients in mid-2017, followed by a further rollout late in the year. And as that rollout unfolds, you'll see -- you'll also see the ongoing development of our Connected Partner Program that we announced last week. 
Connected partners are third-party analytics companies who build apps, and those apps run on our connected system's open platform, providing more usefulness and value for our clients. These apps amplify the value of the underlying measurement data that is the core of our business. A recent Forbes article referred to this as Nielsen opening its big data treasure chest. We'll go into a deep dive on all this at our upcoming Analyst Day in December. 
Regarding the time line, one way to think about this is that our Buy business is working through a process similar to what we've been executing on successfully in our Watch business. We'll work through most of 2017 bringing additional components of the connected system to market. It will likely not be until 2018 until the fuller version begins to contribute meaningfully to the performance of our Buy business. 
Through this process, we're truly transforming the core of our Buy business: comprehensive measurement coverage, integrated data and analytics embedded in our clients workflows with data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service solutions, directly accessed by our client teams in marketing, sales, R&D and finance. And for Nielsen, a stronger, higher-margin business better positioned for the future. 
It's important to note that these benefits will reach beyond our U.S. business. We'll leverage this system across the developed world on roughly the same schedule. And longer term, it'll also add value to our business in key emerging markets. In the meantime, we'll continue to realign our cost base, prune our portfolio and reallocate resources to enable us to accelerate our progress and better position this part of our business for the future. 
We have a lot of work to do, but it's exciting. And because we're guided by our clients, we have a high level of confidence in our strategy and the key bets we're placing. And because I know the Nielsen team behind this work, I have a high level of confidence in our ability to execute. We look forward to updating you at our Analyst Day in December. 
Over to you, Jamere."

Overall, as Mitch mentioned, our business grew in a much more challenging environment than we have seen in the past few quarters, highlighting the strength of our balanced portfolio. First, let me cover our total company results for th",1390,"Thank you, Mitch. Overall, as Mitch mentioned, our business grew in a much more challenging environment than we have seen in the past few quarters, highlighting the strength of our balanced portfolio. 
First, let me cover our total company results for the third quarter. On the left side of the page, are our results on a U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just under $1.6 billion, up 2.5% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment, partially offset by softness in the developed markets in our Buy segment. 
Net income was $132 million, and net income per share was $0.36, which was down $0.02 a share versus the third quarter of 2015. Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and our share buyback program, offset by higher restructuring charges related to further restructuring in our Buy segment. 
Moving to the right side of the page, on a non-GAAP basis.  Revenue was up 3.6% constant currency. Despite a more challenging environment, we still delivered revenue growth, driven by strength in our subscription-based recurring revenue and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 6.7% on a constant-currency basis, driven by our investments, continued momentum in Audience Measurement of Video and Text and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew just under 1% constant currency, led by continued strength in the emerging markets, which was partially offset by a decline in the developed markets. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $498 million, up 4% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.7%, up 10 basis points on a constant-currency basis. 
In the quarter, we continued disciplined investments in growth and productivity initiatives that will generate top line growth and margin expansion in 2017 and beyond. Adjusted net income was $266 million, up 3.1% constant currency; and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.74, up 5.7% versus prior year on a constant-currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
Finally, we generated record free cash flow of $353 million, which was up 2% versus a strong third quarter in 2015. 
Next, I'll move to the segments and provide a little more color. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $761 million, up 6.7% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 8.5% on a constant-currency basis. As expected, Audio was down 2.8% on a constant-currency basis against the tough comp in 3Q '15 that grew 11%, driven by timing of deliveries. The business is performing in line with our expectations and generating strong earnings and cash flow. 
Marketing Effectiveness was up 31.8% constant currency behind strong results from the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, Nielsen Catalina Solutions and Repucom, which is now branded as Nielsen Sports. The investments we have made in Marketing Effectiveness continue to drive Watch segment growth, and we continue to see strong demand from a broad array of clients. 
As expected, Other Watch was about a 2-points drag on Watch revenue on a constant-currency basis, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Watch adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, up 7.5% constant currency. Watch margins expanded 33 basis points on a constant-currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage while investing in the business. 
Let me say a few words about a couple of our key initiatives in Watch. First, Total Audience's strong momentum. Digital Ad Ratings have been widely adopted by the industry as a way of measuring reach and frequency on ad campaigns. In the third quarter, Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 45%, led by strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners. We have added nearly 100 new Digital Ad Ratings clients this year and experienced strong renewals, with good pricing from existing clients. 
Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, continues to gain traction with key clients for both video and text measurement. In the quarter, DCR was fully syndicated, and we continue to add networks and digital players to an already strong roster of previously signed clients. In fact, we have over 90 brands being measured in DCR, and syndicated clients include A+E, ABC, AOL, Buzzfeed, Discovery and Vice, among many others. Digital Content Ratings is a key piece of our Total Audience capabilities and will be a future growth driver for our business. 
Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy, and Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth. We remain confident in our 2016 Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth on a constant-currency basis. 
Turning to Buy. Third quarter total Buy revenue was $809 million, up just under 1% on a constant-currency basis. On a total segment basis, our syndicated recurring revenue business remains solid. However, our ad hoc discretionary revenue declined. Our business in the developed markets was $542 million, down 2.5% on a constant-currency basis as we continue to see softness in discretionary spend, especially in the U.S. Additionally, we are taking steps to future-proof our business by pruning and sunsetting slow-growth, noncore services in developed markets. These actions, along with further restructuring in our Buy segment and accelerating the development of our connected system, will strengthen our business. 
As you've often heard me say, we are clearly operating in a 2-speed world with significantly higher growth rates in the emerging markets versus developed markets. In the third quarter, our business in the emerging markets was $267 million, up 8.5% on a constant-currency basis. As Mitch mentioned, growth was broad based across a number of markets. In addition, we saw double-digit growth from multinationals that gives us more confidence that emerging markets will continue to be a tailwind for our Buy segment revenue into 2017. 
Buy EBITDA was $150 million, down 3.8% constant currency. In this environment, we continue to invest in a disciplined way in coverage and building out the connected system, which will drive future growth and profitability in our Buy business. The early read from our initial pilot clients is promising, and we are confident that our investment will further strengthen our competitive position. 
These key investments, along with an unfavorable mix between our developed and emerging markets revenue, are the key drivers for our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins being down 91 basis points versus the prior year. 
Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter outlook in developed Buy, we now expect our Buy revenue to grow approximately 1.5% to 2% for 2016. 
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant-currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. 
In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 110-basis-points drag on revenue. If current spot rates held constant in 2016, then we expect a 170-basis-points drag on revenue and a 70-basis-points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is in line with the forecasts we gave last quarter. 
Moving to 2016 guidance. In light of our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook in developed Buy, we are updating our full year guidance, highlighted by revenue growth of approximately 3.5% to 4% on a constant-currency basis; adjusted EBITDA margin growth of 30 basis points; adjusted net income per share of $2.73 to $2.79; and free cash flow of approximately $850 million. 
So to wrap up, our third quarter was highlighted by revenue growth and margin expansion in a more challenging environment. First, our Watch business has tremendous momentum behind our Total Audience initiatives; and Buy, our subscription-based recurring revenue business, remains solid; and emerging market growth remains robust while our developed market business in the U.S. has declined. 
But importantly, across both Watch and Buy, we continue to invest in a disciplined way to build a stronger, higher-margin business. In addition, we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Yaeni."

So you've mentioned the secular shift away from custom insights to everyday analytics. And so I was hoping you could give a little more color on the drivers behind sort of the reduced spending. Are you losing share? Is the competitive environment changing? Or are customers just tightening budgets? And is there any way to quantify that? And basically, in terms of the investments that you're going to be making in Buy to address the shift, how much would this impact Buy margins?"

First, with regard to Buy developed, yes, that is the challenging spot for our business in the quarter. But I would even narrow it further for you, because within Buy developed, Europe grew, the Pacific grew, Canada grew. It's really the U.S. where the problem is focused at the moment. And so just to sharpen the focus a little bit, focus on the U.S., what we're seeing in the U.S. market, let me give you a couple of examples in terms of the external environment that our clients are dealing with. First, if you just focus in on food and beverage manufacturers, 2015, we saw this trend starting to emerge where the small- and medium-sized manufacturers accounted for about half of the growth in the categories and private label accounted for about 1/4 of the growth. And the big -- the top 25 players, they accounted collectively for only 3% of the growth in food and beverage categories in 2015, and that situation really hasn't changed that much in 2016. The reason why that's especially noteworthy for our business is the strength of our business just so happens to be the biggest global companies, the biggest global players. And so you see that reflected in our U.S. results. What all these companies are dealing with, both food and beverage and others, is a combination of things: product fragmentation, where consumers are increasingly shifting their purchasing to smaller specialty, more niche products, moving away a little bit from the bigger brands; you see retail fragmentation to purchases moving across additional channels; you, of course, see the 3G effect sweeping through the fast-moving consumer goods industry, where companies, whether 3G is a factor or not, are practicing zero-based budgeting. They're running their own internal 3G play. And so you add up all these things together, and that's the situation that our clients are contending with, and you see that reflected back in our results. Now, for us, what that means in terms of their discretionary spend, as I said, we're -- they're shifting from these more deep-dive projects that help them think about what they're going to do next year and focus much more on these everyday analytics that help them with activation; what should I do today or tomorrow or this week? And that's where the shift is happening in the marketplace. And so we're realigning our portfolio to better serve those client interests and those client needs. And so as I mentioned, we don't see this as just a passing phase that the marketplace is going through. We see this as a trend that will continue on more of a secular basis over the long run. As we make this shift and as we build out this connected system, you see us building a very different business, really, frankly. Right now, it's very much a professional services model for Nielsen. As that connected system starts to unfold in the marketplace, it helps us to move from a professional service or a people-as-a-service business model to much more as a data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service business model, and that all results in us, as Jamere said in his opening comments, having a stronger, higher-margin business. Jamere, what would you add?"

So you did see our margins dip in the quarter. I would say that the key drivers, as I said in my comments, were there was a bit of a mix issue as emerging markets revenue grew 8.5% and the higher-margin developed markets revenue actually declined. I'd say the second thing, as Mitch said, we're continuing to invest in the connected system and our Total Consumer initiatives to future-proof the business. And so in the short term, with a softer revenue profile, this obviously puts pressure on margins. But in terms of our long-term productivity drivers, I would say 3 things. One is we're continuing to see scale benefits in the emerging markets, and there's a focus on profitability. We're running the plays with intensity around cost and productivity. I mentioned before that we have over 4,000 projects that are running inside the company. We're invested in our products, our higher-margin products. And I'd say the last thing is you've seen us take a couple of rounds of restructuring in the second quarter and the third quarter to put us on the right trajectory going forward. So we have confidence, again, that we will expand margins on a total company basis, and we're running all the right plays inside of the company to be able to achieve that."

Let me take a shot at seeing if you'll comment anything to help us size this a little bit. When you used to disclose the Insights line item or analytics line item in the Buy segment, I think the last you did that was 2014. And at that point in time, it -- I think it was about 25% of Buy segment revenue. So I guess a question is, is that any reason to think that it's not sort of similar to that today? Any comment you'd make on sort of the relative margin profile of that part of the business compared to the segment overall margin profile? And then, as we think about what part of it is at risk, can you help us through is all of that revenue pool at risk? Is some of that at risk as you transition to replacing it with this other shape of revenue? And just helping us size it in that way, whatever you help us say would be really helpful."

So in terms of the size of what I will call our analytics or discretionary business, it is probably in the 30%-ish kind of range in terms of our total portfolio, sometimes a little bit more or a little bit less on a quarter basis just depending on what the project pipeline is. I would say a couple of things. First of all, from a -- in terms of what the focus area is -- in our portfolio is, there's probably 3% to 4% of the Buy revenue that is, as Mitch mentioned, slow growing or becoming noncore. And just a couple of examples: if you look at a year ago, we were providing data and analytics for things like helping retailers optimize store locations in a world where bricks and mortar is under pressure and e-commerce is actually growing; we were providing data and analytics around video sales and retail channels in an environment where consumers are moving to more screen and digital consumption; providing data and analytics around alcoholic beverages moving through wholesaler channels. So these are some examples of a very broad portfolio in Buy. And as we look at our resource allocation, as we look at the discretionary nature of some of those datasets and those analytics, we're actually going to move away from some of those. So it's 3% to 4% of the portfolio, and we're going to be aggressive about that and replace that with things that are more future-proof and things that are actually in our connected Buy system platform, if you will. Now, in terms of the margin profile, the analytics or ad hoc or discretionary projects have tended to be a lower-margin profile than the overall business. And so as we think about moving forward in our future to a connected Buy system that is much more data as a service or people as a service oriented, the margin profile will certainly improve overall for the Buy business, so."

And we see a pattern in terms of which parts are performing better versus which ones are struggling in the current environment. And here are the -- here's the characteristics of the things that are doing well. If the analytics capability is connected to our core measurement data, that's a positive. Second, if it is more focused on activation or these everyday analytics kinds of questions, that's a positive. And third, if the talent required in that analytics area is similar to the talent that helps us be successful in our core measurement business, that also tends to do better within the Nielsen portfolio. So we have a number of analytics capabilities that perfectly fit that profile. And no surprise, those are the parts that are performing really well. And then we have a number of others that don't fit that profile, and those are the ones where we have some decisions to make. And we've already started to take those decisions, as Jamere recounted. One other thing that I'll add to this picture, which I hope will be helpful, Todd, is, why -- you might be wondering, why is this showing up more in the U.S. than it is in other places? Well, fact is the U.S. revenues -- a bigger percentage of our U.S. revenues are these discretionary services. In fact, there's about twice as much -- slightly more than twice as much of our U.S. revenues come from these discretionary services as compared to Europe, where it's a much smaller percentage. So that's why you see it showing up in the U.S., and that's why our focus is currently centered on the U.S. But we're transforming our Buy portfolio really for the entire developed market wheel. Then ultimately, a lot of these moves that we're making in particular with the connected system will benefit our business in the key emerging markets as well."

The time line I described in my opening comments, I think is exactly the right way to think about it, which is -- well, first of all, let me start with we already have an initial version of this system built and in the hands of 5 initial clients. So I want you to just realize that this is real, and it's something we've been working on now for the better part of a year and even before Analyst Day last December when we first talked about this with our investors and analysts. So we already have it in the hands of 5 initial clients. We have live modules that are already usable. We demonstrated those for our clients, and we have great feedback so far. In fact, our clients are already thinking through what it's going to mean in terms of implementation on their side. That's the kind of reaction we've received so far. We'll roll it out to 20 to 30 additional clients by the middle of 2017. And by the end of the year is when we think we'll be prepared for a more full rollout to all clients who want to start to make the shift, the transition to this connected system. So yes, we're certainly hopeful that it'll start to have some impact on our business in 2017, but I think the better way to think about it is it'll start to show up meaningfully, significantly in our business, especially the financial results, in the 2018 time frame. There's one other thing to add to that, just to put maybe a reference point on that. I mentioned in my opening comments that I think it's exactly the right way to think about it. While it's a slightly different system that we're building and a slightly different set of client needs that we're addressing, the magnitude of this and the execution required to do it properly, to do it in a way that really fits with what our clients need is very similar to what you've seen us work successfully through on the Watch side of our business as we developed the Total Audience Measurement framework and rolled that out to our clients over the past couple of years. So look, we know how to do this. We have the teams in place, and they're very focused and excited about the task in front of them. And we have a huge opportunity to drive this stronger, higher-margin business for our future, to take costs out of our clients' business, on their side of the table, and to give them a lot more value and a lot more speed."

First of all, if you're looking back to the third quarter last year, you saw our developed markets business grow 4.8% constant currency. And as part of that discussion, we said that we saw a pretty strong discretionary environment. We have not seen that since then. And if you look at our results in our developed Buy business, they've sequentially been going in the other direction. And part of that is because that stable or, I would say, the environment in the third quarter last year actually ran a little hot. I'd say that environment has slowly started to erode and we're starting to see the dynamics that Mitch and I have discussed in the call today. From a margin standpoint, again, you have a couple of dynamics there. One is you have sort of the mix shift between our developed markets revenue and our emerging markets revenue that certainly plays into the numbers. And then the second thing, as I said, is we'll continue to invest in our growth initiatives. And in a softer revenue environment, we're going to feel that margin pressure. But more importantly, we've taken the actions, if you will, that will put us on the right trajectory from a cost standpoint: first of all, as I said, a couple of rounds of restructuring that you saw in the second and the third quarter numbers; we'll continue to work on our productivity initiatives; we're investing and actually emphasizing the faster-growing, higher-margin pieces of the Buy portfolio. And so we have a lot of confidence around that story and what that will mean for us going forward."

We're, as I said, seeing it more as secular shifts. And so we just reached the conclusion that it's not viable for the long term to keep running after these short-term revenue opportunities and keep trying to chase these and work our way through the lumpy nature of this part of our business. Instead, a much better future is about investing in something that transforms our product portfolio, that takes some of the lumpiness out of this part of our business, that better fits with what our clients need and where their needs are evolving toward, and that's what that connected system is designed to do. And so we're not running after those short-term revenue opportunities as much in the quarter, and we're -- and that'll continue going forward. And that allows us to reallocate, enables us to reallocate resources to build faster and do more as we develop this connected system initiative.

So just to give you a little bit of color on our Marketing Effectiveness business, it was up 31.8% in the quarter. As you know, we did have a couple of inorganic things in there with Nielsen Sports and Nielsen Catalina Solutions. That had us growing probably closer to an 18% organic number. The things that we're really excited about in Marketing Effectiveness, first of all, is the Nielsen Marketing Cloud or eXelate, it's up double digits. Nielsen Buyer Insights is up double digits as clients continue to look for our datasets to help them build ROI solutions. And Nielsen Catalina Solutions is up about 18% organically as well. So we continue to be impressed with the growth that we're seeing in Marketing Effectiveness, and it's provided a nice tailwind for our business. In terms of the free cash flow outlook for the year, so just a couple of things. One is, as you alluded to, most of the sort of revenue shortfall actually is within our Buy business. And so that's a big driver of it. So you got a couple of things growing through the numbers. One is just reduced EBITDA outlook, particularly for the developed Buy regions. The second thing is that we're continuing to invest, and actually, our investment profile is slightly higher than what we began in at the beginning of the year. And that is a -- both a Watch and a Buy story. So on the Watch side, you've seen us acquire and begin to integrate set-top box data for all the things that we're doing with our Total Audience Measurement initiatives. We've talked about moving away from the paper diaries and bringing more electronic measurement to the marketplace. That certainly roll into the numbers. And then we got a big year in front of us in terms of bringing DCR and DAR to the marketplace and growing that piece of the business. And then the last piece is growing the investment profile associated with our connected system and our Total Consumer initiatives. So combination of lower EBITDA expectations and the -- a slightly higher investment profile for some of the key growth initiatives in the future is driving it. And then one other thing I'd add to that is we're probably going to be at the upper end of what we gave as sort of a cash restructuring number, and that's focused on the fact that in the second quarter and the third quarter, we've taken a couple of actions in our Buy business to set us on the right trajectory for the future. So those are the things that are driving the number from a free cash flow standpoint."

Thanks, Dan. First, on your first question related to Buy and e-commerce, we continued the development of our e-commerce solution for the U.S., where we're bringing together some of our panel data, some other third-party data and big data sources all together in a hybrid solution that allows us to cover the rapidly growing e-commerce channels, both the extensions of the brick-and-mortar players and the pure-play e-commerce platforms, including the largest players out there. We're bringing that forward to the marketplace. And by the end of this year, that'll be in the hands of a growing number of our clients and start to roll through our business in a more full way in 2017. That's the U.S. And we have similar solutions that employ basically the same design, depends on the country, in 11 other markets where e-commerce sales are significant around the world. With regard to Amazon, they -- no change really in their status. In terms of their willingness to share their sales data, like retailers typically do with us as we measure fast-moving consumer goods, they still prefer to remain on the outside of that collaboration model, cooperation model that typifies our retail measurement service. And so like we've done with Netflix on the Watch side of the business, we find other ways to measure the activity on those kinds of platforms. We've done that very successfully on the Watch side covering Netflix and other subscription video-on-demand platforms, and we're able to do it on the Buy side as well to measure what's happening on Amazon's platform. With regard to Alibaba, we continue to be very closely in touch and active with Alibaba in the China market as well as Tencent and Sina and Baidu, a lot of the other really big players. In U.S., we have FANG: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. In China, they have their similar 4 or 5 major players, and we're active with all of them. I was in China last month and -- with our teams, and part of that also included meeting with the most senior leaders at Baidu and talking about how we're going to continue to broaden our relationship there. And Alibaba continues to be very active and a key focus for our business in the China market. On your -- on part B of your one question, Dan, with regard to Audio and the competitive situation in the industry, first, on Audio, we're still thrilled with that business. It's exactly what we expected: low single-digit growth, strong free cash flows. You're now seeing us gain some leverage from the Audio business in a new way, leveraging the PPM measurement capability to add more effective sample size to our local TV measurement over on the video side of the equation. And then we're continuing to pursue international wins in the radio audience measurement business through the capabilities we have. We have some of those in our history, and there's a few more opportunities in front of us. And the other thing we're doing there is obviously continuing to bring our analytics portfolio to the radio industry to help them better tell their ROI and penetration story in the marketplace. And the cooperative -- industry collaboration that's going on to try to prop up a competitive alternative uses ACR technology, automated content recognition technology. I think that's the one you're probably referring to. Look, we're very familiar with that kind of technology. We have it ourselves already in our tool bag. We know what it's good for and how -- what it's work well for, and we also know quite a bit about its limitations. And so we're staying focused on our strategy and on audience measurement. And currency-grade measurement that the marketplace trades on, it has representative panels that represent all the key segments of the marketplace in a manner that's always been important, currently is and will remain important. That's what Nielsen is about. And that's easier said than done. We know that from experience."

On the currency definition, I commented on that earlier. Maybe just a thing to add. We've had a series of meetings with the industry. The most recent one was last week. It continue -- we continue to narrow in on the definition, and there's a lot of reasons for us to be confident that our Total Audience Measurement system is going to play a big role in the 2017 upfronts. Let me tell you what we're hearing though also, not just what Nielsen thinks, but what's some of the key industry players think. One example is Rino Scanzoni. He's the Chief Investment Officer at GroupM. He was quoted a few weeks ago saying something like, ""We're looking forward to making the Total Audience the currency in the next upfront."" And then what he said was, ""We have to go there."" There's 10% to 12% more audience if you factor in the viewing on these other devices. His voice is really important because, well, he was central to the C3 metric 10 years ago when that was converged on by the industry and has since served as the definition of the currency. So that's what -- that's how Rino was thinking about Total Audience and new definition of the currency for the 2017 upfront. David Poltrack, Chief Research officer at CBS, he was just more direct. He just said, ""We're definitely moving forward."" That was his attitude toward it. And so I think the keys to this way of thinking for these key industry influencers are the fact that we passed the syndication point for Digital Content Ratings at the end of September. We are on the path to fully syndicate Total Content Ratings by the early part of 2017; already in full syndication for the participating publishers. We're just going to add agencies and other members of the ecosystem in the early part of the year. Those are the last key pieces in the puzzle. And so we've delivered on those, and that's why I think everybody's pretty confident in terms of this measurement system. And some sense of what that new currency definition is going to be, playing an important role in the 2017 upfronts."

I think your characterization of our business is exactly right. What the connected system does is it transitions our Buy business to look a little bit more like an info services business than it does today. Currently, for a lot of the things that we've been talking about, we have more of a people-as-a-service business mix than a typical info services company. And so the implication is that we'll have a higher-margin business post the transition as we'll have more opportunities to sell data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service business. And as Mitch said, there's a tremendous value, reduced cost on the client side. And it should help us be more efficient and more productive in terms of how we deliver that service to our clients.

As our system, connected system, this hugely important initiative that we're focused on, is developed, it will be connected directly to our clients' business processes and systems; whereas right now, there's a lot of manual intervention required, both on our side and on our clients' side in order to draw full value out of these data resources that we provide to our clients. So it creates a lot of efficiencies, both on our side and on our clients' side, and that's back to our point about this is a stronger, higher-margin business, more valuable to Nielsen and more valuable to our clients. So that's the transition we'll work to. It's not a flip-the-switch kind of impact, though. It's a gradual transition. It'll evolve over time. We've done some restructuring already.

Watch business, again, we continue to be thrilled with the progress, the syndication of Digital Content Ratings and the path we're on for full syndication of Total Content Ratings, the overall Total Audience Measurement system gaining adoption and well positioned for the 2017 upfronts; on top of that, the improvements that we're rolling out for our local TV ratings business, our Watch business really on a roll. Marketing Effectiveness, strong growth, more than 30% in the quarter. Our Buy business, merging remains solid even within developed. Europe, the Pacific, Canada all turned in solid quarters of growth. The U.S. is where we had the decline, a tough environment we've talked about. We're judging these to be secular shifts, and we're responding accordingly in terms of the magnitude and the pace of the changes we're making in our business to reduce our cost base, reallocate our resources, accelerate our investments, in particular in this connected system, that helps us move from what today is much of a people-as-a-service business model to being much more of a data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service business model in the future. All of it adds up to stronger, higher-margin business for Nielsen going forward. And we're going to continue to update you on our progress on the connected system front on future calls and, of course, at our December Analyst Day, much like we have done with Total Audience and its development over the past many quarters.

On last quarter's call, we talked about the ongoing changes occurring in the markets we serve. And, as you all know, change is a source of both challenge and opportunity, and we saw both in this quarter. 
In our Watch business, our momentum continued with our Total Audience Measurement system. Client adoption continued to grow as Digital Content Ratings moved to syndicated reporting, Digital Ad Ratings expanded to new markets and the industry further narrowed in on a new currency definition. We also announced upgrades to our local TV measurement. So we feel great about our progress here. 
For our Buy business, emerging markets continued to produce solid top line growth as our investments in coverage and granularity and our balanced strength with both local and global clients continued to pay off. But regarding developed markets, while Europe made good progress in the quarter, our U.S. results were down versus the prior year as clients looked for more efficiency and productivity in the face of an increasingly difficult growth environment. 
Earlier this year, as we saw these more challenging trends unfolding, we realigned our Buy business to be more focused in our product development and more efficient in our overhead. More recently, as the trends continued for our clients, we stepped up our efforts to reduce our cost base, reallocate resources and accelerate our investments and initiatives that will help our clients and better position our business for the future. 
We've been hard at work on these initiatives, and you'll hear more about them in a few minutes. But for now, let me say that our Buy business is working through a process of change that's similar to what we've been executing on successfully in our Watch business, and we're confident that our Buy initiatives will produce similar results. 
Let's look at the financials for the third quarter. At a total company level, revenue grew 3.6% on a constant currency basis. Revenues in our Watch segment increased 6.7% on a constant currency basis, including an 8.5% increase in Audience Measurement of Video and Text. Buy segment revenues grew just under 1% on a constant currency basis as emerging markets growth of nearly 9% was offset by a decline in developed markets driven by the U.S. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 4% constant currency, supported by ongoing productivity and operating leverage, offset in part by our accelerated investments in key initiatives. 
Adjusted net income per share grew almost 6% constant currency to $0.74. 
Free cash flow was a record $353 million in the quarter, up slightly compared to a year ago. 
We remain committed to driving shareholder value through our balanced capital allocation strategy, and we do this by investing consistently in our future growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back approximately $90 million in shares, and as of September 30, we had approximately $460 million remaining under our existing authorization. 
Lastly, in light of our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're updating our guidance for the full year, and Jamere will provide detail on this in a few minutes. 
Let's look at the segments. First, Watch. If we turn back the clock a bit, it was just a few years ago when the market was still thinking of Nielsen as the television measurement company. As viewing fragmented across screens and digital platforms, we responded with measurement capabilities that followed the consumer. Over time, this developed into what we know today as our Total Audience Measurement system. The progress we've made is reflected in our Watch business performance. But it didn't happen overnight. It's been a multiyear evolution, and our teams have diligently executed on each step, bringing this whole framework to life. And while we've made very good progress, we continue to work alongside our clients every day, adding new features as clients explore all potential use cases for the data. It's an exciting time for the industry and for Nielsen. 
Let's look at some specific highlights from the quarter. In September, Digital Content Ratings became available in full syndication on schedule. This was a tremendous milestone. Publishers, agencies and advertisers are now equipped with powerful daily data that helps them understand the value of content across digital platforms. Adoption is growing daily. 
For Total Content Ratings, at the direct request of our clients, we made some changes to our original release schedule. The initial step of this schedule occurred on August 1, making Total Content Ratings available on a syndicated basis to all participating publishers. We'll broaden that to include agencies at the start of 2017 before making the data available to the entire industry by the end of the first quarter. In the meantime, we continue to work closely with our clients to help them gain comfort with the comparable metrics in advance of full syndication. Just a reminder, Total Content Ratings includes measurement of subscription video-on-demand, now covering over 15,000 different program episodes, nearly double the number from about 6 months ago. 
On Digital Ad Ratings, we continue to grow and expand. Campaigns in the third quarter were up 45%, reflecting growing volumes with existing large clients as well as very strong adoption from new, smaller advertisers. Across the board, we're seeing growing use of Digital Ad Ratings for guarantees. 
We've also made good progress with Digital Ad Ratings internationally. For example, in Canada, our penetration among the top 25 advertisers is now comparable to the U.S. We also recently announced Digital Ad Ratings in Taiwan, our 24th market. In 2017, we'll add 8 to 10 additional markets, and we'll also upgrade some existing markets to include Total Ad Ratings. 
Overall, client adoption in support of our Total Audience Measurement system is steadily growing. As we look out to 2017, our clients remain highly engaged in the effort to move the industry toward a new ratings standard. While the definition of a new currency is not up for Nielsen alone to decide, we're confident that with the clarity and momentum we built with Total Audience Measurement, it'll play an important role in the 2017 upfronts. 
In local TV, we recently announced some important new initiatives that will substantially enhance our offerings in the U.S. by leveraging our investments in Return Path Data from DISH and Charter as well as our currency-grade panel data. We'll introduce full electronic measurement across all 210 designated market areas by mid-2017, paving the way for the retirement of paper diaries in early 2018. 
Starting in 2017, we'll also integrate Portable People Meter, or PPM, data, for both in-home and out-of-home viewing in the top 44 markets. This will lead to increased stability, a decrease in 0 sells and richer analytics of local viewing habits. By including out-of-home viewing in the ratings, we'll help our local TV clients more fully capture the value of this portion of the TV audience that was previously unmeasured. And by the way, just yesterday, we announced to our clients that out-of-home viewing will also soon be credited to the national ratings. 
We also recently upgraded Social Content Ratings, now covering both Facebook and Twitter in a unified fashion. This upgraded service will replace Nielsen Twitter TV Ratings in all markets, including Australia, Italy, Mexico and the U.S. With social media playing a growing role in consumers' lives and TV experiences, its value for the media industry will also continue to grow. 
Turning to Marketing Effectiveness. We had another strong quarter with constant currency revenues up over 30%. As a reminder, this is the part of our business where we bring together our Watch and Buy assets to help marketers improve their return on investment in advertising. A large part of this is enabled by the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, which provides our clients with faster access to data and analytics, helping them make more informed marketing and media decisions. 
One recent example of this is our advanced marketing optimization solution made available in partnership with RevTrax, a one-to-one digital promotions company. Kimberly-Clark is one of the lead clients leveraging this new application to continuously update their promotions content based on real-time changes in consumer behavior, all with the name of increasing the ROI of their digital promotions. 
Also notable is Nielsen Catalina's recently announced collaboration with Facebook. This deal enables marketers to directly connect their advertising activity to its impact on sales as well as deliver more relevant advertising to target consumers. By combining the largest, most representative purchase dataset in the fast-moving consumer goods industry with ad exposure information from Facebook, we get a deep understanding of how these ads are driving consumers to purchase. 
Turning to the Buy business. In emerging markets, our business continues to deliver solid, broad-based growth, including double-digit growth across several key markets in Latin America, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and India. As a group, these markets do have a lot of runway for continued growth via added coverage, granularity and increasing penetration of the related analytics that help our clients drive progress in their business. Our investments in coverage and granularity and our balanced strength with both local and global clients continue to pay off. 
In developed markets, specifically the U.S., the environment in which we operate has become more challenging. Large global manufacturers are the strength of our client base. And as I'm sure you've seen in the recent press, they found it increasingly difficult to achieve growth in markets with growing fragmentation in consumer demand, more competition from smaller and local players and increased commodity pricing. Together, these factors have led them to seek efficiencies and productivity in their business, and our business has not been immune. 
Our clients continue to value our core measurement services, especially given the growing product and retail fragmentation in the market. But when it comes to analytics, their needs have been shifting. Clients are shifting away from custom insights delivered via deep-dive projects, and they're shifting toward everyday analytics, often called activation, delivered directly to multiple end users. Our view is that this is a secular shift, not a passing phase or a cycle that'll swing back. Clients want analytics that'll help them answer the question of what do I need to do this week or tomorrow or even today to drive sales, protect market share or improve my competitive position. In today's challenging growth environment, that's what's most valuable to them. 
Now let me walk you through what we are doing to respond to this. First, you'll see us aggressively moving away from slower-growing noncore services. These moves are enabling us to accelerate and increase our investments in our key initiatives that will better position our business for the future. The most important of these initiatives are Total Consumer measurement and our connected system. 
Total Consumer measurement is about following consumers across all retail formats to ensure full coverage of sales. In a changing and fragmenting retail environment, this requires ongoing effort to help our clients understand emerging channels like specialty retailers, hard discounters, direct-to-consumer models and, of course, e-commerce. Speaking of e-commerce, we've made good progress on our hybrid solution announced earlier this year. It combines high-quality panels with big data to provide broad and granular coverage of e-commerce sales, including on the largest platforms. 
Our second initiative, our connected system, is the bigger of the 2. This open system connects Nielsen, client and third-party data, including our core Watch and Buy measurement data, with applications designed for decision makers in our clients' marketing, sales, R&D and finance functions. This means faster, data-driven decisions on everyday questions related to pricing, promotion, distribution, new product innovation, assortment and marketing mix optimization, all in one connected system. And this is the key because many of these capabilities already exist as stand-alone point solutions. But connecting them all in one system, one that delivers these capabilities continuously every day and directly to end users, that's what will help our clients reduce their internal costs while also driving a big step-up in value and speed for their business. And just as importantly, it'll significantly reduce costs and improve margins for Nielsen. 
Since we first talked with you about the connected system at our Analyst Day last December, we've been hard at work. Today, it's in the hands of 5 initial clients who are working with us to refine the system's design. We've also demonstrated live modules for our client advisory board and others. And the positive feedback from our clients, coupled with the changes we see unfolding in the market, have encouraged us to accelerate our development schedule and investments. 
We'll expand the availability of the system to 20 to 30 additional clients in mid-2017, followed by a further rollout late in the year. And as that rollout unfolds, you'll see -- you'll also see the ongoing development of our Connected Partner Program that we announced last week. 
Connected partners are third-party analytics companies who build apps, and those apps run on our connected system's open platform, providing more usefulness and value for our clients. These apps amplify the value of the underlying measurement data that is the core of our business. A recent Forbes article referred to this as Nielsen opening its big data treasure chest. We'll go into a deep dive on all this at our upcoming Analyst Day in December. 
Regarding the time line, one way to think about this is that our Buy business is working through a process similar to what we've been executing on successfully in our Watch business. We'll work through most of 2017 bringing additional components of the connected system to market. It will likely not be until 2018 until the fuller version begins to contribute meaningfully to the performance of our Buy business. 
Through this process, we're truly transforming the core of our Buy business: comprehensive measurement coverage, integrated data and analytics embedded in our clients workflows with data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service solutions, directly accessed by our client teams in marketing, sales, R&D and finance. And for Nielsen, a stronger, higher-margin business better positioned for the future. 
It's important to note that these benefits will reach beyond our U.S. business. We'll leverage this system across the developed world on roughly the same schedule. And longer term, it'll also add value to our business in key emerging markets. In the meantime, we'll continue to realign our cost base, prune our portfolio and reallocate resources to enable us to accelerate our progress and better position this part of our business for the future. 
We have a lot of work to do, but it's exciting. And because we're guided by our clients, we have a high level of confidence in our strategy and the key bets we're placing. Because I know the Nielsen team behind this work, I have a high level of confidence in our ability to execute. We look forward to updating you at our Analyst Day in December. 
Over to you, Jamere."

Overall, as Mitch mentioned, our business grew in a much more challenging environment than we have seen in the past few quarters, highlighting the strength of our balanced portfolio. First, let me cover our total company results for th",1409,"Thank you, Mitch. Overall, as Mitch mentioned, our business grew in a much more challenging environment than we have seen in the past few quarters, highlighting the strength of our balanced portfolio. 
First, let me cover our total company results for the third quarter. On the left side of the page, are our results on a U.S. GAAP basis. Revenue was just under $1.6 billion, up 2.5% on a reported basis, driven by solid growth in our Watch segment, partially offset by softness in the developed markets in our Buy segment. 
Net income was $132 million, and net income per share was $0.36, which was down $0.02 a share versus the third quarter of 2015. Our net income per share results were driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and our share buyback program, offset by higher restructuring charges related to further restructuring in our Buy segment. 
Moving to the right side of the page. On a non-GAAP basis, revenue was up 3.6% constant currency. Despite a more challenging environment, we still delivered revenue growth, driven by strength in our subscription-based recurring revenue and solid execution on our growth initiatives. Our Watch business grew 6.7% on a constant currency basis, driven by our investments, continued momentum in Audience Measurement of Video and Text and impressive growth in Marketing Effectiveness. Our Buy business grew just under 1% constant currency, led by continued strength in the emerging markets, which was partially offset by a decline in the developed markets. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $498 million, up 4% constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.7%, up 10 basis points on a constant currency basis. 
In the quarter, we continued disciplined investments in growth and productivity initiatives that will generate top line growth and margin expansion in 2017 and beyond. Adjusted net income was $266 million, up 3.1% constant currency; and diluted adjusted net income per share was $0.74, up 5.7% versus prior year on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted net income per share growth was driven by solid operating earnings and execution of our share buyback program. 
Finally, we generated record free cash flow of $353 million, which was up 2% versus a strong third quarter in 2015. 
Next, I'll move to the segments and provide a little more color. First is our Watch segment. Our Watch segment had another great quarter. Revenue was $761 million, up 6.7% constant currency. Our growth initiatives performed well as Audience Measurement of Video and Text was up 8.5% on a constant currency basis. As expected, Audio was down 2.8% on a constant currency basis against the tough comp in 3Q '15 that grew 11%, driven by timing of deliveries. The business is performing in line with our expectations and generating strong earnings and cash flow. 
Marketing Effectiveness was up 31.8% constant currency behind strong results from the Nielsen Marketing Cloud, Nielsen Catalina Solutions and Repucom, which is now branded as Nielsen Sports. The investments we have made in Marketing Effectiveness continue to drive Watch segment growth, and we continue to see strong demand from a broad array of clients. 
As expected, Other Watch was about a 2-points drag on Watch revenue on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of our divestiture of the NRG business late in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Watch adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, up 7.5% constant currency. Watch margins expanded 33 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to drive operating leverage while investing in the business. 
Let me say a few words about a couple of our key initiatives in Watch. First, Total Audience's strong momentum. Digital Ad Ratings have been widely adopted by the industry as a way of measuring reach and frequency on ad campaigns. In the third quarter, Digital Ad Ratings campaigns were up 45%, led by strong demand from advertisers, agencies, platforms and content owners. We have added nearly 100 new Digital Ad Ratings clients this year and experienced strong renewals with good pricing from existing clients. 
Digital Content Ratings, which provides daily measurement of audiences across all digital content types and platforms with metrics comparable to TV, continues to gain traction with key clients for both video and text measurement. In the quarter, DCR was fully syndicated, and we continue to add networks and digital players to an already strong roster of previously signed clients. In fact, we have over 90 brands being measured in DCR, and syndicated clients include A+E, ABC, AOL, Buzzfeed, Discovery and Vice, among many others. Digital Content Ratings is a key piece of our Total Audience capabilities and will be a future growth driver for our business. 
Our Watch segment remains strong. We are executing on our Total Audience Measurement growth strategy, and Marketing Effectiveness continues to deliver impressive growth. We remain confident in our 2016 Watch guidance of 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis. 
Turning to Buy. Third quarter total Buy revenue was $809 million, up just under 1% on a constant currency basis. On a total segment basis, our syndicated recurring revenue business remains solid. However, our ad hoc discretionary revenue declined. Our business in the developed markets was $542 million, down 2.5% on a constant currency basis as we continue to see softness in discretionary spend, especially in the U.S. Additionally, we are taking steps to future-proof our business by pruning and sunsetting slow-growth, noncore services in developed markets. These actions, along with further restructuring in our Buy segment and accelerating the development of our connected system, will strengthen our business. 
As you've often heard me say, we are clearly operating in a 2-speed world with significantly higher growth rates in the emerging markets versus developed markets. In the third quarter, our business in the emerging markets was $267 million, up 8.5% on a constant currency basis. As Mitch mentioned, growth was broad based across a number of markets. In addition, we saw double-digit growth from multinationals that gives us more confidence that emerging markets will continue to be a tailwind for our Buy segment revenue into 2017. 
Buy EBITDA was $150 million, down 3.8% constant currency. In this environment, we continue to invest in a disciplined way in coverage and building out the connected system, which will drive future growth and profitability in our Buy business. The early read from our initial pilot clients is promising, and we are confident that our investment will further strengthen our competitive position. 
These key investments, along with an unfavorable mix between our developed and emerging markets revenue, are the key drivers for our Buy adjusted EBITDA margins being down 91 basis points versus the prior year. 
Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter outlook in developed Buy, we now expect our Buy revenue to grow approximately 1.5% to 2% for 2016. 
Moving to foreign currency impact. I want to remind you that we report revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so this slide focuses strictly on the translation impact for reporting purposes. 
In the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a 110 basis points drag on revenue. If current spot rates held constant in 2016, then we expect a 170 basis points drag on revenue and a 70 basis points drag on EBITDA for the full year in 2016, which is in line with the forecasts we gave last quarter. 
Moving to 2016 guidance. In light of our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook in developed Buy, we are updating our full year guidance, highlighted by revenue growth of approximately 3.5% to 4% on a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA margin growth of 30 basis points, adjusted net income per share of $2.73 to $2.79 and free cash flow of approximately $850 million. 
So to wrap up, our third quarter was highlighted by revenue growth and margin expansion in a more challenging environment. First, our Watch business has tremendous momentum behind our Total Audience initiatives; and Buy, our subscription-based recurring revenue business, remains solid; and emerging market growth remains robust while our developed market business in the U.S. has declined. 
But importantly, across both Watch and Buy, we continue to invest in a disciplined way to build a stronger, higher-margin business. In addition, we remain on track to return over $800 million in cash back to shareholders in 2016 in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Yaeni."

First, with regard to Buy developed, yes, that is the challenging spot for our business in the quarter. But I would even narrow it further for you, because within Buy developed, Europe grew, the Pacific grew, Canada grew. It's really the U.S. where the problem is focused at the moment. And so just to sharpen the focus a little bit, focus on the U.S., what we're seeing in the U.S. market, let me give you a couple of examples in terms of the external environment that our clients are dealing with. First, if you just focus in on food and beverage manufacturers, 2015, we saw this trend starting to emerge where the small- and medium-sized manufacturers accounted for about half of the growth in the categories and private label accounted for about 1/4 of the growth. And the big -- the top 25 players, they accounted collectively for only 3% of the growth in food and beverage categories in 2015, and that situation really hasn't changed that much in 2016. The reason why that's especially noteworthy for our business is the strength of our business just so happens to be the biggest global companies, the biggest global players. And so you see that reflected in our U.S. results. What all these companies are dealing with, both food and beverage and others, is a combination of things: product fragmentation, where consumers are increasingly shifting their purchasing to smaller specialty, more niche products, moving away a little bit from the bigger brands; you see retail fragmentation to purchases moving across additional channels. You, of course, see the 3G effect sweeping through the fast-moving consumer goods industry, where companies, whether 3G is a factor or not, are practicing zero-based budgeting. They're running their own internal 3G play. And so you add up all these things together, and that's the situation that our clients are contending with, and you see that reflected back in our results. Now for us, what that means in terms of their discretionary spend, as I said, we're -- they're shifting from these more deep-dive projects that help them think about what they're going to do next year and focus much more on these everyday analytics that help them with activation; what should I do today or tomorrow or this week? And that's where the shift is happening in the marketplace. And so we're realigning our portfolio to better serve those client interests and those client needs. And so as I mentioned, we don't see this as just a passing phase that the marketplace is going through. We see this as a trend that will continue on more of a secular basis over the long run. As we make this shift and as we build out this connected system, you see us building a very different business, really, frankly. Right now, it's very much a professional services model for Nielsen. As that connected system starts to unfold in the marketplace, it helps us to move from a professional service or a people-as-a-service business model to much more as a data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service business model, and that all results in us, as Jamere said in his opening comments, having a stronger, higher-margin business. Jamere, what would you add?"

So you did see our margins dip in the quarter. I would say that the key drivers, as I said in my comments, were there's a bit of a mix issue as emerging markets revenue grew 8.5% and the higher-margin developed markets revenue actually declined. I'd say the second thing, as Mitch said, we're continuing to invest in the connected system and our Total Consumer initiatives to future-proof the business. And so in the short term, with a softer revenue profile, this obviously puts pressure on margins. But in terms of our long-term productivity drivers, I would say 3 things. One is we're continuing to see scale benefits in the emerging markets, and there's a focus on profitability. We're running the plays with intensity around cost and productivity. I mentioned before that we have over 4,000 projects that are running inside the company. We're invested in our products, our higher-margin products. And I'd say the last thing is you've seen us take a couple of rounds of restructuring in the second quarter and the third quarter to put us on the right trajectory going forward. So we have confidence, again, that we will expand margins on a total company basis, and we're running all the right plays inside of the company to be able to achieve that."

Let me take a shot at seeing if you'll comment anything to help us size this a little bit. When you used to disclose the Insights line item or analytics line item in the Buy segment, I think the last you did that was 2014. And at that point in time, it -- I think it was about 25% of Buy segment revenue. So I guess a question is, is that any reason to think that it's not sort of similar to that today? Any comment you'd make on -- so the relative margin profile of that part of the business compared to the segment overall margin profile? And then, as we think about what part of it is at risk, can you help us through is all of that revenue pool at risk? Is some of that at risk as you transition to replacing it with this other shape of revenue? And just helping us size it in that way, whatever you help us say would be really helpful."

So in terms of the size of what I will call our analytics or discretionary business, it is probably in the 30%-ish kind of range in terms of our total portfolio, sometimes a little bit more or a little bit less on a quarter basis just depending on what the project pipeline is. I would say a couple of things. First of all, from a -- in terms of what the focus area is -- in our portfolio is, there's probably 3% to 4% of the Buy revenue that is, as Mitch mentioned, slow growing or becoming noncore. And just a couple of examples. If you look at a year ago, we were providing data and analytics for things like helping retailers optimize store locations in a world where bricks and mortar is under pressure and e-commerce is actually growing. We were providing data and analytics around video sales and retail channels in an environment where consumers are moving to more screen and digital consumption; providing data and analytics around alcoholic beverages moving through wholesaler channels. So these are some examples of a very broad portfolio in Buy. And as we look at our resource allocation, as we look at the discretionary nature of some of those datasets and those analytics, we're actually going to move away from some of those. So it's 3% to 4% of the portfolio, and we're going to be aggressive about that and replace that with things that are more future-proof and things that are actually in our connected Buy system platform, if you will. Now in terms of the margin profile, the analytics or ad hoc or discretionary projects have tended to be a lower-margin profile than the overall business. And so as we think about moving forward in our future to a connected Buy system that is much more data as a service or people as a service oriented, the margin profile will certainly improve overall for the Buy business, so."

And we see a pattern in terms of which parts are performing better versus which ones are struggling in the current environment. And here are the -- here's the characteristics of the things that are doing well. If the analytics capability is connected to our core measurement data, that's a positive. Second, if it is more focused on activation or these everyday analytics kinds of questions, that's a positive. And third, if the talent required in that analytics area is similar to the talent that helps us be successful in our core measurement business, that also tends to do better within the Nielsen portfolio. So we have a number of analytics capabilities that perfectly fit that profile. And no surprise, those are the parts that are performing really well. And then we have a number of others that don't fit that profile, and those are the ones where we have some decisions to make. And we've already started to take those decisions, as Jamere recounted. One other thing that I'll add to this picture, which I hope will be helpful, Todd, is, why -- you might be wondering, why is this showing up more in the U.S. than it is in other places? Well, fact is the U.S. revenues -- a bigger percentage of our U.S. revenues are these discretionary services. In fact, there's about twice as much -- slightly more than twice as much of our U.S. revenues come from these discretionary services as compared to Europe, where it's a much smaller percentage. So that's why you see it showing up in the U.S., and that's why our focus is currently centered on the U.S. But we're transforming our Buy portfolio really for the entire developed market wheel. Then ultimately, a lot of these moves that we're making in particular with the connected system will benefit our business in the key emerging markets as well."

The time line I described in my opening comments, I think is exactly the right way to think about it, which is -- well, first of all, let me start with we already have an initial version of this system built and in the hands of 5 initial clients. So I want you to just realize that this is real, and it's something we've been working on now for the better part of the year and even before Analyst Day last December when we first talked about this with our investors and analysts. So we already have it in the hands of 5 initial clients. We have live modules that are already usable. We demonstrated those for our clients, and we have great feedback so far. In fact, our clients are already thinking through what it's going to mean in terms of implementation on their side. That's the kind of reaction we've received so far. We'll roll it out to 20 to 30 additional clients by the middle of 2017. And by the end of the year is when we think we'll be prepared for a more full rollout to all clients who want to start to make the shift, the transition to this connected system. So yes, we're certainly hopeful that it'll start to have some impact on our business in 2017, but I think the better way to think about it is it'll start to show up meaningfully, significantly in our business, especially the financial results, in the 2018 time frame. There's one other thing to add to that, just to put maybe a reference point on that. I mentioned in my opening comments that I think it's exactly the right way to think about it. While it's a slightly different system that we're building and a slightly different set of client needs that we're addressing, the magnitude of this and the execution required to do it properly, to do it in a way that really fits with what our clients need is very similar to what you've seen us work successfully through on the Watch side of our business as we developed the Total Audience Measurement framework and rolled that out to our clients over the past couple of years. So look, we know how to do this. We have the teams in place, and they're very focused and excited about the task in front of them. And we have a huge opportunity to drive this stronger, higher-margin business for our future, to take costs out of our clients' business, on their side of the table, and to give them a lot more value and a lot more speed."

First of all, if you're looking back to the third quarter last year, you saw our developed markets business grow 4.8% constant currency. And as part of that discussion, we said that we saw a pretty strong discretionary environment. We have not seen that since then. And if you look at our results in our developed Buy business, they've sequentially been going in the other direction. And part of that is because that stable or, I would say, the environment in the third quarter last year actually ran a little hot. I'd say that environment has slowly started to erode and we're starting to see the dynamics that Mitch and I have discussed in the call today. From a margin standpoint, again, you have a couple of dynamics there. One is you have sort of the mix shift between our developed markets revenue and our emerging markets revenue that certainly plays into the numbers. And then the second thing, as I said, is we'll continue to invest in our growth initiatives. And in a softer revenue environment, we're going to feel that margin pressure. But more importantly, we've taken the actions, if you will, that will put us on the right trajectory from a cost standpoint: first of all, as I said, a couple of rounds of restructuring that you saw in the second and the third quarter numbers; we'll continue to work on our productivity initiatives; we're investing and actually emphasizing the faster-growing, higher-margin pieces of the Buy portfolio. And so we have a lot of confidence around that story and what that will mean for us going forward."

We're, as I said, seeing it more as secular shifts. And so we just reached the conclusion that it's not viable for the long term to keep running after these short-term revenue opportunities and keep trying to chase these and work our way through the lumpy nature of this part of our business. Instead, a much better future is about investing in something that transforms our product portfolio, that takes some of the lumpiness out of this part of our business, that better fits with what our clients need and where their needs are evolving toward, and that's what that connected system is designed to do. And so we're not running after those short-term revenue opportunities as much in the quarter, and we're -- and that'll continue going forward. And that allows us to reallocate, enables us to reallocate resources to build faster and do more as we develop this connected system initiative.

So just to give you a little bit of color on our Marketing Effectiveness business, it was up 31.8% in the quarter. As you know, we did have a couple of inorganic things in there with Nielsen Sports and Nielsen Catalina Solutions. That had us growing probably closer to an 18% organic number. The things that we're really excited about in Marketing Effectiveness, first of all, is the Nielsen Marketing Cloud or eXelate, it's up double digits. Nielsen Buyer Insights is up double digits as clients continue to look for our datasets to help them build ROI solutions. And Nielsen Catalina Solutions is up about 18% organically as well. So we continue to be impressed with the growth that we're seeing in Marketing Effectiveness, and it's provided a nice tailwind for our business. In terms of the free cash flow outlook for the year, so just a couple of things. One is, as you alluded to, most of the sort of revenue shortfall actually is within our Buy business. And so that's a big driver of it. So you got a couple of things thrown into the numbers. One is just reduced EBITDA outlook, particularly for the developed Buy regions. The second thing is that we're continuing to invest, and actually, our investment profile is slightly higher than what we began in at the beginning of the year. And that is a -- both a Watch and a Buy story. So on the Watch side, you've seen us acquire and begin to integrate set-top box data for all the things that we're doing with our Total Audience Measurement initiatives. We've talked about moving away from the paper diaries and bringing more electronic measurement to the marketplace. That certainly roll into the numbers. And then we got a big year in front of us in terms of bringing DCR and DAR to the marketplace and growing that piece of the business. And then the last piece is growing the investment profile associated with our connected system and our Total Consumer initiatives. So combination of lower EBITDA expectations and the -- a slightly higher investment profile for some of the key growth initiatives in the future is driving it. And then one other thing I'd add to that is we're probably going to be at the upper end of what we gave as sort of a cash restructuring number, and that's focused on the fact that in the second quarter and the third quarter, we've taken a couple of actions in our Buy business to set us on the right trajectory for the future. So those are the things that are driving the number from a free cash flow standpoint."

First, on your first question related to Buy and e-commerce, we continued the development of our e-commerce solution for the U.S., where we're bringing together some of our panel data, some other third-party data and big data sources all together in a hybrid solution that allows us to cover the rapidly growing e-commerce channels, both the extensions of the brick-and-mortar players and the pure-play e-commerce platforms, including the largest players out there. We're bringing that forward to the marketplace. And by the end of this year, that'll be in the hands of a growing number of our clients and start to roll through our business in a more full way in 2017. That's the U.S. And we have similar solutions that employ basically the same design, depends on the country, in 11 other markets where e-commerce sales are significant around the world. With regard to Amazon, they -- no change really in their status. In terms of their willingness to share their sales data, like retailers typically do with us as we measure fast-moving consumer goods, they still prefer to remain on the outside of that collaboration model, cooperation model that typifies our retail measurement service. And so like we've done with Netflix on the Watch side of the business, we find other ways to measure the activity on those kinds of platforms. We've done that very successfully on the Watch side covering Netflix and other subscription video-on-demand platforms, and we're able to do it on the Buy side as well to measure what's happening on Amazon's platform. With regard to Alibaba, we continue to be very closely in touch and active with Alibaba in the China market as well as Tencent and Sina and Baidu, a lot of the other really big players. In U.S., we have FANG: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. In China, they have their similar 4 or 5 major players, and we're active with all of them. I was in China last month and -- with our teams, and part of that also included a meeting with the most senior leaders at Baidu and talking about how we're going to continue to broaden our relationship there. And Alibaba continues to be very active and a key focus for our business in the China market. On your -- on part B of your one question, Dan, with regard to Audio and the competitive situation in the industry, first, on Audio, we're still thrilled with that business. It's exactly what we expected: low single-digit growth, strong free cash flows. You're now seeing us gain some leverage from the Audio business in a new way, leveraging the PPM measurement capability to add more effective sample size to our local TV measurement over on the video side of the equation. And then we're continuing to pursue international wins in the radio audience measurement business through the capabilities we have. We have some of those in our history, and there's a few more opportunities in front of us. And the other thing we're doing there is obviously continuing to bring our analytics portfolio to the radio industry to help them better tell their ROI and penetration story in the marketplace. And the cooperative -- industry collaboration that's going on to try to prop up a competitive alternative uses ACR technology, automated content recognition technology. I think that's the one you're probably referring to. Look, we're very familiar with that kind of technology. We have it ourselves already in our tool bag. We know what it's good for and how -- what it's work well for, and we also know quite a bit about its limitations. And so we're staying focused on our strategy in -- on audience measurement. And currency-grade measurement that the marketplace trades on, it has representative panels that represent all the key segments of the marketplace in a manner that's always been important, currently is and will remain important. That's what Nielsen is about. And that's easier said than done. We know that from experience."

On the currency definition, I commented on that earlier. Maybe just a thing to add. We've had a series of meetings with the industry. The most recent one was last week. It continue -- we continue to narrow in on the definition, and there's a lot of reasons for us to be confident that our Total Audience Measurement system is going to play a big role in the 2017 upfronts. Let me tell you what we're hearing though also, not just what Nielsen thinks, but what's some of the key industry players think. One example is Rino Scanzoni. He's the Chief Investment Officer at GroupM. He was quoted a few weeks ago saying something like, ""We're looking forward to making the Total Audience the currency in the next upfront."" And then what he said was, ""We have to go there."" There's 10% to 12% more audience if you factor in the viewing on these other devices. His voice is really important because, well, he was central to the C3 metric 10 years ago when that was converged on by the industry and has since served as the definition of the currency. So that's what -- that's how Rino was thinking about Total Audience and new definition of the currency for the 2017 upfront. David Poltrack, Chief Research officer at CBS, he was just more direct. He just said, ""We're definitely moving forward."" That was his attitude toward it. And so I think the keys to this way of thinking for these key industry influencers are the fact that we passed the syndication point for Digital Content Ratings at the end of September. We are on the path to fully syndicate Total Content Ratings by the early part of 2017; already in full syndication for the participating publishers. We're just going to add agencies and other members of the ecosystem in the early part of the year. Those are the last key pieces in the puzzle. And so we've delivered on those, and that's why I think everybody's pretty confident in terms of this measurement system. And some sense of what that new currency definition is going to be, playing an important role in the 2017 upfronts."

I think your characterization of our business is exactly right. What the connected system does is it transitions our Buy business to look a little bit more like an info services business than it does today. Currently, for a lot of the things that we've been talking about, we have more of a people-as-a-service business mix than a typical info services company. And so the implication is that we'll have a higher-margin business post the transition as we'll have more opportunities to sell data-as-a-service and Software-as-a-Service business. And as Mitch said, there's a tremendous value, reduced cost on the client side. And it should help us be more efficient and more productive in terms of how we deliver that service to our clients.

As our system, connected system, this hugely important initiative that we're focused on, is developed, it will be connected directly to our clients' business processes and systems; whereas right now, there's a lot of manual intervention required, both on our side and on our clients' side in order to draw full value out of these data resources that we provide to our clients. So it creates a lot of efficiencies, both on our side and on our clients' side, and that's back to our point about this is a stronger, higher-margin business, more valuable to Nielsen and more valuable to our clients. So that's a transition we'll work to. It's not a flip-the-switch kind of impact, though. It's a gradual transition. It'll evolve over time. We've done some restructuring already.
