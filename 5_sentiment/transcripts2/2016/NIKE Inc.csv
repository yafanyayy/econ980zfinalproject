Getting back to the results. NIKE delivered another strong quarter in Q3 with balanced growth across our expansive, powerful portfolio. 
By the numbers, here are the highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8% to $8 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin was 45.9%, flat to prior year. And earnings per share increased to [ph] 22% to $0.55. 
The foundation for NIKE's success and one of our greatest competitive advantages is our complete offense. It's what gives us the power to use our size and scale to accelerate growth and the flexibility to stay nimble and fast. Through our complete offense, we serve a wide range of athletes personally across 13 categories, 6  geographies, men's, women's and young athletes, up and down the price points, in wholesale, owned retail and online. Our complete offense also creates a culture of shared innovation within NIKE where we turn insights from 1 sport into breakthroughs for all athletes as we are doing with footwear platforms like Flyknit, Lunarlon and Air, or apparel with Dri-FIT and Tech Pack. It allows us to create and curate a targeted mix of products, services and environments into amazing retail experiences for consumers. We develop new concepts and collaborate with our wholesale partners to bring them to life in completely new ways around the world. 
The complete offense is our proven game plan to drive long-term profitable growth and it's never been as powerful as it is today. For example, we are seeing strong growth in China and Western Europe, as well as in our global women's business in the Running category. We are creating deeper and more meaningful connections with our consumers through all of our dimensions, from competition to training to sportswear. 
At the same time, the complete offense also allows us to manage through volatility and take important actions to sustain the momentum in our business. It's how we ensure a healthy marketplace so we can continue to deliver all of the amazing products we have on the horizon to our consumers.
Our relentless flow of innovation is one of the reasons I remain so confident in NIKE's future. You know I like to talk about the innovation pipeline. And often, all I can say is stay tuned. Well, last week, we gave the world a view into just some of what we have in that pipeline for 2016 and beyond. 
Let me take you through some of the concepts that will redefine how NIKE serves the athlete.
In Running, the Air Vapor Max gives runners an amazing lightweight, high performance ride with the most complete and visually stunning Nike Air sole cushioning system ever. 
The Lunar Epic creates a new fit and sensation with a mid-height stretched Flyknit color, laser cut Lunarlon sidewalls and cushioning pods, creating a whole new look and feel for performance running. Launched earlier this month, runners are giving us great feedback and consumer response has been very strong. 
The Free Run Motion delivers our most natural ride yet with a new outsole design that expand in multiple directions when the foot strikes the ground. 
And in Football, anti-clog traction solves a major problem athletes have always faced and that's mud sticking to their cleats. It removes weight and provides premium traction no matter the conditions.
The new Mercurial Superfly is the boot for the fastest players. With the new lightweight plate for better power transfer and texture mapping across the forefoot for enhanced ball control. 
And in Basketball, the Air Zoom KD 9 features a new Flyknit technology that combines lock down fit with enhanced natural movement. And a full length Zoom Air is more responsive than ever from one of the game's most explosive players, Kevin Durand. 
And we brought Flyknit to one of basketball's greatest icons with the Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit. A design that's half the weight of the original with added cushioning for incredible comfort.
We unveiled auto adaptive lacing with the NIKE Hyperadapt 1.0, the first step into the future of adaptive performance. It's a concept that embodies one of NIKE's most ambitious dreams and just a glimpse of what's to come with products that sense and adapt with the body.
And finally, we took off the incredible sports moments ahead of us this summer by unveiling bold national Olympic uniforms across track and field, basketball and football. Each features our new Aeroswift technology and breaks new ground in lightweight breathability, mobility and comfort. 
All told, the two-day event was NIKE's most powerful display of innovation yet. The greatest sports moments are when we deliver our best for the athlete. We turn their insights into amazing breakthroughs and scale them across our diverse portfolio of categories. It's how we turn the energy of sport into momentum for our business for years to come.
We also now finding new ways to serve the athlete is key to our future growth. Today, our consumers are more connected than ever before. They're demanding and their needs change everyday. Last week we introduced the solution with a new Nike+ app, a personal service for athletes. The Nike+ app brings together on-demand coaching, a personal store and amazing experiences all through one mobile access point. Through Nike+, we offer training programs that adapts to your changing schedule and performance. Syncing performance data directly from the Nike+ app in a range of partner devices. And we send reserve invitations guaranteeing our most coveted sneakers and we have gear up packs tailored just for you that gets you started in a new goal or in a new sport. The new Nike+ app makes it all easy and personal and puts it all at your fingertips. It's the key to building deep and rich relationships with the athlete in this new era of personalized performance.
Not only does digital create connections with the athlete, it also accelerates our business end-to-end. For Q3, nike.com delivered another impressive quarter with growth of 56%, fueled by growth in both traffic and conversion. Nike.com allows us to expand our brand and deepen our relationships in new markets. We continue to add new countries every quarter to our nike.com platform and it's driving growth around.
It's so energizing to see all we are delivering to make the athlete better and last week was more than just one moment in time, it's the blueprint for how NIKE will serve the athlete into the future. NIKE is built for growth for the long term. We have a winning strategy that puts the consumer in the center of everything we do, an unmatched global footprint that is fueling a growing movement of sports around the world and the imagination and creative power that could deliver real innovation at unprecedented scale. NIKE has never been in a better position to deliver against our long-term goals. I'm inspired by the work that we're doing. The management team and the people they lead are the best in the industry. And that's critical because the changes we're seeing in the world are fast and massive and so are the opportunities. And that's what's making me as confident as ever in NIKE's future. 
Thanks, and here's Trevor."

The NIKE Brand delivered another strong quarter of growth and profitability as our innovative products and compelling consumer connections continued to drive growth. On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand reven",1676,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another strong quarter of growth and profitability as our innovative products and compelling consumer connections continued to drive growth. On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue increased 15%, with double-digit growth across all geographies and nearly all key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue grew 29%, driven by 56% growth in online sales, 10% comp store growth and new store growth. And finally, global futures grew 17%. These strong results are driven, as always, by our relentless focus on the consumer. 
Consumers worldwide expect and demand cutting-edge products, engaging experiences and powerful retail presentations. NIKE's ability to deliver on all 3 strengthens our position as the brand of choice and builds our business around the world. 
To view how all of these 3 come to life, you have to look no further than Basketball where we run a 2-category offense across NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand.
Our long history of success in NIKE Basketball comes from creating the most innovative and exciting products thanks to the insights and inspiration from our great athletes. We saw tremendous sellthrough of the Kyrie 2 which features a first of its kind contoured midsole and outsole designed to enhance banking and cutting on the court. And the KOBE 11 was incredibly popular, offering high performance and lightweight design in a progressive low-top that distills Kobe's signature legacy to its very essence.
Looking forward, I am very excited about what's to come in NIKE Basketball. As we gear up for Kobe's retirement, he will continue to inspire innovative products for years to come. We have already started celebrating his career with a monochromatic, retro collection called the Black Mambo Pack. 
I'm also most incredibly excited about the signature basketball performance products that are coming, including the new KD 9 that we introduced last week. The KD 9 is just one example of the new signature basketball designed in our pipeline that we are bringing to the markets to continue to drive this important and vibrant category. And as always, we will amplify the category with innovative sport, new sports wear style like the reimagined Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit.
All these products come to life in powerful retail experiences from our own DTC doors to key partner executions like Footlockers House of Hoops and these stores express a deep love of basketball, serving those who share and fuel that passion for the game.
As the Jordan Brand expands as a standalone category, it's global revenues remain incredibly strong, up double digits again this quarter. The Air Jordan 30 continues to fulfill its promise of offering the next frontier of flight and we're seeing strong sellthrough in the market. The shoe offers the apex of Jordan's evolution both as a player and a design collaborator, as the shoe features performance insights and design inspirations from Michael. And impressively, the 7210 call away of the Air Jordan 11 was the largest launch ever in history of nike.com, breaking sales and traffic records. With this launch, we doubled nike.com's previous largest launch ever. 
This was also a quarter that proves yet again how powerful the energy is when the NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand team team-up. The NBA All-Star Weekend in Toronto was a full of a kind of superior executions that only NIKE and the Jordan Brand can do. That includes exclusive experiences for basketball fans, premium product launches and a massive roster of the game's best players, highlighted that weekend by the awe-inspiring dunk contest featuring Zach Levine and Eric Gordon, 2 of Nike's young and exciting players. Overall through that weekend, as I walk through Toronto, I was blown away by the visible excitement for the game as NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand helped ignite the culture of basketball around the world.
As we continue to experience the excitement of March Madness and await the NBA Playoffs and the Rio Olympics, that enthusiasm for the game will just continue to build. 
Next. Nike Women's, which has seen its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, as the business continues to outpace our men's business. We've seen consistent growth in our women's business because we know this athlete is demanding more from brands across products, across services and across experiences, and we are there every step of the way throughout that journey, serving her completely through her run, train and live lifestyle. But we also know that these are no longer separate categories for athletes. More and more, women are blending Running, Fitness and Sports style in their lives and this shift is fundamental to how this business operates. So expanding our focus on product to include services and experiences. 
With new silhouettes, fabrics and styling, we have elevated the quality and the technical innovation of our products. For example, our Power Speed Running Tight and our Zone and Sculpt Training Tight provides compressive feel with every move to support her key muscle groups. And in Footwear, our popular Met [indiscernible] is designed for high intensity training with just the right amount of stability and flexibility as she works out.
This quarter also saw the acceleration of our highly successful Better For It campaign, in which we invite each athlete to push herself out of her comfort zone by providing personal motivation and rich community to help her meet her goals. And we released the Margot vs Lily web series, inviting women to challenge themselves and celebrate their victories. The response has been extraordinary, with 18 [ph] million views to date. We've also seen a considerable increase in downloads of the Nike+ Run Club and the Nike+ Training Club, with members becoming more active and buying more, thanks, in part to the links in each episode to the product worn by the characters. 
As Mark mentioned, these services are still just the tip of the iceberg, given the incredible promise of the new Nike+ app and the expanding digital services.
Let me now turn to a few of our key geographies. First, North America which delivered strong growth in the quarter, with revenues up 14%, driven by Sportswear, Jordan, Running and Men's Training. We are seeing positive consumer response to our executions with wholesale partners such as Dick's Sporting Goods and Footlocker. 
Our own DTC business also had another strong quarter, up 25%, led by ongoing strength in nike.com. As we discussed last quarter, we've been working to efficiently clear excess inventory in North America and we've made good progress in Q3. The flow of products through our newly expanded North American distribution network is normalizing. We prioritized liquidation through our factory stores and we are selectively utilizing third-party value channels. And as always, we are actively managing the flow of product into the in-line marketplace to ensure a healthy pull market as we end fiscal year '16. 
We remain focused on what is most important to our long-term strategy, serving the consumer. The NIKE Brand and it's deep connection to consumers remains incredibly strong and we are confident that the actions we are taking will ensure that we have the capacity to deliver new, innovative products into the marketplace, innovations like those Mark talked about.
We see tremendous long-term potential for North America and we look forward to delivering even more innovative products and services to best serve our consumers in this important geography.
Next. Western Europe, our second-largest geography, which delivered 12% revenue growth in the quarter. It's clear the decisions we made to accelerate the category offense in Western Europe are paying off as we continue to see momentum, driven by Sportswear, Jordan, as well as young athletes. This growth was led by Footwear where we're seeing the great sellthrough in some of Nike's iconic remastered styles such as the Roshe Run Ultra and the Evergreen classics like the Cortez. We're also seeing great momentum in apparel as we fuel sports style innovation through the newly launched TechNet Collection throughout our end -- throughout our broader Tech Fleece product line. We continue to see tremendous growth potential in Western Europe and look forward to the excitement created this summer with the 2016 European Championships. 
Let's now take a look at the emerging markets which delivered revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. Strong growth was led by double-digit growth in SoCo and growth in our key categories such as Sportswear, Running, Global Football and Women's Training.
In Brazil, the work we've done to reset the marketplace is paying dividends. We're seeing strong results in retail concepts that we developed with our strategic wholesale partners. And our own DTC business continues to accelerate. Despite the macroeconomic trends in the territory, we are heading into the Rio Olympics with plenty of brand momentum. Inventory levels are healthy, our market share is increasing and we have the pipeline of innovative products coming in this Olympics year.
Finally. Greater China, which continue to see strong market price momentum and very healthy growth despite macroeconomic uncertainty. China grew an incredible 27% this quarter, fueled in part by the continued strength of the NIKE Brand. The success we're seeing in China today stems from decisions we made to align our teams against the biggest opportunities, driving growth in key categories of Sportswear, Running, Jordan and NIKE Basketball. We're seeing incredibly strong growth in DTC with nike.com leading the way. 
Demand during the Chinese New Year surpassed anything we've ever seen before and we operated with sharp precision to drive conversion to capitalize on that demand across all of our DTC dimensions. And successes by our key partners such as ByLee and Powell Shen continue to reflect the consumer demand with the reprofiled doors outpacing the rest of the fleet. Ultimately, Greater China demonstrates our ability to execute our strategies and operationalize them at world-class levels. 
Looking forward, I am confident in what the NIKE Brand is bringing to consumers and the connections we're making with them. I like where we are, and better yet, I like where we're headed. Thanks. Now here's Andy."

Our strong third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate: First, the power of NIKE's uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses; and second, the virtuous cycle of growth and in",1986,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor. And good afternoon to everyone on the call. Our strong third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate: First, the power of NIKE's uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses; and second, the virtuous cycle of growth and investment that fuels NIKE's long-term financial model. As Mark said, Running a complete offense is one of NIKE's many competitive advantages. We continually to push ourselves to sharpen our game and better serve consumers in every dimension of our business around the world. 
That said, not every dimension of our portfolio will have the same level of momentum in each and every period. But as we relentlessly strive to run a complete offense, we do sustain strong momentum in the vast majority of our businesses while also acting quickly turn challenges into opportunities in other dimensions. That portfolio dynamic is how NIKE, Inc consistently delivers strong top line growth year after year.
In the third quarter, we again delivered strong growth, with revenue up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. All geographies grew double digits with Greater China continuing to set the pace. 
On that note, I was just in China 3 weeks ago and I can sum up my visit in 1 word, amazing. Our brand and business in China have never been stronger and we continue to build momentum. That's not by accident. Our focus in China has been on fueling greater sport participation and love for sport while also transforming the consumer experience along category lines, both in-store and online.
We are now seeing increasingly deeper passion for sport in China and that is translating into strong demand for our products across multiple categories, from NIKE Basketball, to Jordan, to Running, to Men's and Women's Training. To serve that fast-growing demand, our team in China has already created some of the most compelling new NIKE retail experiences in the world, both owned and partnered. We see tremendous opportunity ahead of China and we will continue investing to sustain our strong momentum in this important geography.
That brings me to my second point, the virtuous cycle of growth and investment that fuels NIKE's financial model. Growth creates the capacity to invest. As we prioritize our investments, innovation will always be at the top of NIKE's list. 
At last week's Innovation Summit, we showcased what we mean when we say NIKE will bring a relentless flow of innovation to serve the athlete and consumer. As Mark detailed, we revealed a series of innovations that we expect to fuel growth across our global portfolio over the long term, ranging from adaptive and other new footwear technologies, to new systems of performance in apparel, to the new Nike+ application, which will deliver the best of NIKE, personalized at your fingertips.
While investing in innovation is our top priority, we also use our investment capacity to surgically edit and shift within our portfolio to ensure that we remain on the offense with consumers. For example, as we noted last quarter, our inventory levels in North America are somewhat elevated, primarily due to protracted challenges we have experienced in our supply chain dating back to the West Coast port congestion and as we expanded distribution center capacity in Memphis. So we are taking action to ensure appropriate capacity in our full price in-line channels for fresh, new product, including the innovation we shared last week. 
The investments associated with those actions include: One, investing in our supply chain to ramp up capacity and enhance the flow of product to consumers; and 2, absorbing a negative mix impact on gross margin that comes with expeditiously clearing excess inventory. In short, our consistently strong top line growth expands our capacity to invest for the long term while also delivering appropriate financial performance in the short term. That is the virtuous cycle that fuels NIKE's long-term financial model. 
And with that, I'll turn to a more detailed review of our Q3 financial results.
Q3 revenue for NIKE, Inc. grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis. And after taking into account significant currency headwinds, revenue grew 8% on a reported basis. On a currency-neutral basis, the NIKE Brand grew 15% while Converse revenue declined 5%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 17%, reflecting continued strong demand for the NIKE Brand around the world, driven by a 10% increase in units, with increases in average selling prices contributing 7 percentage points of growth. Futures in all geographies grew at a double-digit rate.
On a reported basis, futures grew 12%, taking into account the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies. Q3 diluted EPS grew 22% to $0.55 despite significant headwinds from FX. EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth, a lower tax rate and a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding.
Gross margin was flat to prior year at 45.9% as higher average selling prices and continued growth in our higher-margin DTC business was offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, higher warehousing costs and a mix impact associated with inventory management in North America.
Q3 gross margin was somewhat better than we expected 90 days ago as a result of higher full price gross margin and also slightly better-than-expected off-price gross margin, as our inventory management efforts in North America were more weighted toward NIKE Factory Stores as compared to lower margin third-party  channels in the quarter.
Q3 demand creation increased 10% for the quarter in support of key brand initiatives such as Super Bowl 50 and our women's Better For It and Margot vs Lily campaigns. Operating overhead leveraged for the quarter at 7%, driven by strong operational and financial discipline, focusing our investments on our highest priorities while preserving capacity to invest in the opportunities that lie ahead. Our effective tax rate was 16.3% for Q3, lower than the prior year, primarily due to a higher mix of non-U.S. earnings which are generally subject a lower tax rate, the accelerated recognition of foreign tax credits, adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions in the prior year and the retroactive and permanent reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit.
As of February 29, our inventories were up 8%, driven by a 4% increase in NIKE Brand wholesaling units, growth in our DTC business and increases in average cost -- product cost per unit, partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Now let's turn to a review of our performance by segment. 
North America revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, with strong revenue growth across nearly all categories and continued strong growth in our DTC businesses, led by nike.com. Futures also grew 10% in North America, reflecting strong consumer demand for the new innovative products that we're bringing to market. On a reported basis, North America revenue grew 13% and EBIT increased 9% as revenue growth and operating overhead leverage were partially offset by higher demand creation spending and a decline in gross margin as the impact of our inventory management actions offset full price gross margin expansion.
In Western Europe, revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in all territories, reflecting continued expansion of the category offense. Nearly all key categories grew led by strong growth in Sportswear and Jordan. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 2% and EBIT remained flat due to significant foreign currency headwinds. 
In Central & Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue grew 29% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit growth in nearly all territories. Most key categories also grew double digits, led by Sportswear, Running and Global Football. Revenue growth in the quarter also benefited from a comparison to the prior year when import delays in Turkey resulted in product planned for sale in Q3 actually being sold in Q4. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 12%, reflecting weaker foreign currencies. EBIT increased 33%, driven by double-digit revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Greater China, again, we continued to deliver extraordinary growth, with Q3 revenue up 27% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was strong across nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Jordan and NIKE Basketball. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 23% and EBIT grew 43% due to very strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
Moving on to the emerging markets. Q3 revenue increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis as most territories delivered growth in the quarter, driven by SoCo and Pacific. Every key category grew in the quarter, led by Sportswear, Running, Global Football and Women's Training. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue declined 8% and EBIT decreased 14%, reflecting weaker foreign currencies. Looking forward, the emerging markets strong currency-neutral futures growth reflects strong demand in nearly all territories. And as Trevor noted, while macroeconomics in Brazil are challenging, a reset of that marketplace is on track as we approach the Olympics in Rio.
At Converse, Q3 revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by comparisons to a prior year shift in the timing of shipments out of Q4 and into Q3 fiscal year '15 to ensure Converse's smooth transition to a new ERP system. On a reported basis, Converse revenue decreased 9% and EBIT decreased 22% versus prior year, driven primarily by the revenue shift, lower gross margin and weakness in the euro.
NIKE, Inc.'s powerful, global portfolio of businesses has delivered strong results year-to-date and we expect momentum to continue into Q4 and beyond. For the full year fiscal year '16, we continue to expect financial performance in line with the expectations that we shared with you 90 days ago. Specifically, for both Q4 and the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, roughly in line with our year-to-date rate of growth. 
For gross margin, we continue to expect expansion of about 50 basis points for the full year, with Q4 gross margin flat to slightly expanding versus prior year. We also continued to expect fiscal year '16 full year SG&A to grow at a high single-digit rate, with Q4 SG&A growing at a high single to low double-digit rate.
Other income will continue to have a meaningful impact on our full year results due to the impact of hedges captured in this line item. For Q4, we expect other income of approximately $40 million. And finally, we now expect our full year fiscal year '16 effective tax rate will be approximately 19%.
Looking ahead to fiscal year '17. Our planning is not yet finalized. However, we have strong momentum in our business around the world. And we expect that strong momentum to continue. Accordingly, we anticipate currency-neutral revenue to grow in the high single to low double-digit range in fiscal year '17, and we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single digit rate due to continued strength of the U.S. dollar.
We currently expect EPS to grow at a low teens rate, reflecting continued strong operational performance, partially offset by unfavorable FX related impacts. Further, we expect that our EPS growth will be more heavily weighted toward the back half of fiscal year '17, as we invest in significant brand initiatives early in the fiscal year, including the Rio Olympics and the European Football Championships and also due to unfavorable FX comparisons being more pronounced in the first half of the fiscal year.
The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic, creating both headwinds and opportunities. Accordingly, we'll provide an updated look at our fiscal year '17 guidance during our Q4 earnings call.
As we look ahead, we have broad-based momentum across our uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses and we'll continue to leverage that momentum to deliver appropriate financial performance in the short term while also investing and taking action to sustain strong, profitable growth over the long term. 
Having shared that context of our performance and our outlook, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

At the same time, the inventory is relatively fresh, it's all very fresh product and so we feel good about where we are today in terms of making progress and we don't see any increase in areas.

I won't hit all of them. We do report them, but just to touch on a few of them, the difference between seasons and quarterly reporting windows, seasons in our industry are about a month off of our quarterly reporting windows. The weighting of the futures by month, both of those things, seasons and weighting by month, can be impact by a number of different factors ranging from shipping timing to consumers to events like the European Football Championships, the Olympics et cetera so those are certainly impacts. And you touched on one of the 2 other dimensions. One is the lag between the futures order date for our DTC business and the timing of sellthrough to DTC and consumers, and that is a dynamic as we have a fast-growing DTC business, particularly led by nike.com. The other dimension is that while futures represent the vast majority of our revenue, there are some pretty significant items that aren't reflected in futures and can be growing at various rates. That will always be available. NIKE Factory Store revenue, Converse, for example, so there are a lot of factors what we try to do for you guys is give you a sense for demand again for the NIKE Brand at full price, that's futures, and then do that reconciliation for you and give you the revenue guidance."

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q.

I know I speak for everyone on this end of the call when I say our hearts go out to the victims and the families of those impacted by today's attacks.
Getting back to the results. NIKE delivered another strong quarter in Q3 with balanced growth across our expansive, powerful portfolio. By the numbers, here are the highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8% to $8 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin was 45.9%, flat to prior year. And earnings per share increased 22% to $0.55. 
The foundation for NIKE's success and one of our greatest competitive advantages is our complete offense. It's what gives us the power to use our size and scale to accelerate growth and the flexibility to stay nimble and fast. Through our complete offense, we serve a wide range of athletes personally across 13 categories, 6 geographies, men's, women's and young athletes, up and down the price points in wholesale, owned retail and online. 
Our complete offense also creates a culture of shared innovation within NIKE where we turn insights from 1 sport into breakthroughs for all athletes as we are doing with footwear platforms like Flyknit, Lunarlon and Air, or apparel with Dri-FIT and Tech Pack. And it allows us to create and curate a targeted mix of products, services and environments into amazing retail experiences for consumers. We develop new concepts and collaborate with our wholesale partners to bring them to life in completely new ways around the world. 
The complete offense is our proven game plan to drive long-term profitable growth, and it's never been as powerful as it is today. For example, we're seeing strong growth in China and Western Europe as well as in our global women's business in the Running category. We're creating deeper and more meaningful connections with our consumers through all of our dimensions, from competition to training to sportswear. 
At the same time, the complete offense also allows us to manage through volatility and take important actions to sustain the momentum in our business. It's how we ensure a healthy marketplace so we can continue to deliver all of the amazing products we have on the horizon to our consumers.
Our relentless flow of innovation is one of the reasons I remain so confident in NIKE's future. You know I like to talk about the innovation pipeline. And often, all I can say is stay tuned. Well, last week, we gave the world a view into just some of what we have in that pipeline for 2016 and beyond. 
Let me take you through some of the concepts that will redefine how NIKE serves the athlete.
In Running, the Air VaporMax gives runners an amazing lightweight, high-performance ride with the most complete and visually stunning Nike Air sole cushioning system ever. 
The LunarEpic creates a new fit and sensation with a mid-height stretched Flyknit color, laser-cut Lunarlon sidewalls and cushioning pods, creating a whole new look and feel for performance running. Launched earlier this month, runners are giving us great feedback and consumer response has been very strong. 
The Free RN Motion delivers our most natural ride yet with the new outsole design that expands in multiple directions when the foot strikes the ground. 
And in Football, anti-clog traction solves a major problem athletes have always faced, and that's mud sticking to their cleats. It removes weight and provides premium traction no matter the conditions.
The new Mercurial Superfly is the boot for the fastest players, with the new lightweight plate for better power transfer and texture mapping across the forefoot for enhanced ball control. 
And in Basketball, the Air Zoom KD9 features a new Flyknit technology that combines lockdown fit with enhanced natural movement. And a full length Zoom Air is more responsive than ever for one of the game's most explosive players, Kevin Durant. 
And we brought Flyknit to one of basketball's greatest icons with the Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit. A design that's half the weight of the original with added cushioning for incredible comfort.
We unveiled auto-adaptive lacing with the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0, the first step into the future of adaptive performance. It's a concept that embodies one of NIKE's most ambitious dreams and just a glimpse of what's to come with products that sense and adapt with the body.
And finally, we kicked off the incredible sports moments ahead of us this summer by unveiling bold national Olympic uniforms across track and field, basketball and football. Each features our new AeroSwift technology and breaks new ground in lightweight breathability, mobility and comfort. 
All told, the 2-day event was NIKE's most powerful display of innovation yet. The greatest sports moments are when we deliver our best for the athlete. We turn their insights into amazing breakthroughs and scale them across our diverse portfolio of categories. It's how we turn the energy of sport into momentum for our business for years to come.
We also know finding new ways to serve the athlete is key to our future growth. Today, our consumers are more connected than ever before. They're demanding and their needs change every day. Last week we introduced the solution with a new Nike+ app, a personal service for athletes. The Nike+ app brings together on-demand coaching, a personal store and amazing experiences all through one mobile access point. Through Nike+, we offer training programs that adapt to your changing schedule and performance. Syncing performance data directly from the Nike+ app in a range of partner devices. And we send reserve invitations guaranteeing our most coveted sneakers and we have gear-up packs tailored just for you to get you started on a new goal or in a new sport. 
The new Nike+ app makes it all easy and personal and puts it all at your fingertips. It's the key to building deep and rich relationships with the athlete in this new era of personalized performance.
Not only does digital create connections with the athlete, it also accelerates our business end-to-end. For Q3, Nike.com delivered another impressive quarter with growth of 56%, fueled by growth in both traffic and conversion. Nike.com allows us to expand our brand and deepen our relationships in new markets. We continue to add new countries every quarter to our Nike.com platform, and it's driving growth around.
It's so energizing to see all we are delivering to make the athlete better. And last week was more than just one moment in time, it's the blueprint for how NIKE will serve the athlete into the future. NIKE is built for growth for the long term. We have a winning strategy that puts the consumer in the center of everything we do, an unmatched global footprint that is fueling a growing movement of sports around the world and the imagination and creative power that can deliver real innovation at unprecedented scale. NIKE has never been in a better position to deliver against our long-term goals. I'm inspired by the work that we're doing. The management team and the people they lead are the best in the industry. And that's critical because the changes we're seeing in the world are fast and massive and so are the opportunities. And that's what's making me as confident as ever in NIKE's future. 
Thanks, and here's Trevor."

The NIKE Brand delivered another strong quarter of growth and profitability as our innovative products and compelling consumer connections continued to drive growth. On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand reve",1683,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another strong quarter of growth and profitability as our innovative products and compelling consumer connections continued to drive growth. On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue increased 15%, with double-digit growth across all geographies and nearly all key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue grew 29%, driven by 56% growth in online sales, 10% comp store growth and new store growth. And finally, global futures grew 17%. These strong results are driven, as always, by our relentless focus on the consumer. 
Consumers worldwide expect and demand cutting-edge products, engaging experiences and powerful retail presentations. NIKE's ability to deliver on all 3 strengthens our position as the brand of choice and builds our business around the world. 
To view how all of these 3 come to life, you have to look no further than Basketball, where we run a 2-category offense across NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand.
 
Our long history of success in NIKE Basketball comes from creating the most innovative and exciting products, thanks to the insights and inspiration from our great athletes. We saw tremendous sell-through of the KYRIE 2, which features a first of its kind contoured midsole and outsole designed to enhance banking and cutting on the court. And the KOBE 11 was incredibly popular, offering high performance and lightweight design in a progressive low-top that distills Kobe's signature legacy to its very essence.
Looking forward, I am very excited about what's to come in NIKE Basketball. As we gear up for Kobe's retirement, he will continue to inspire innovative products for years to come. We have already started celebrating his career with a monochromatic, retro collection called the Black Mamba Pack. 
I'm also most incredibly excited about the signature basketball performance products that are coming, including the new KD9 that we introduced last week. The KD9 is just one example of the new signature basketball designed in our pipeline that we are bringing to the markets to continue to drive this important and vibrant category. And as always, we will amplify the category with innovative sport, new sportswear styles like the reimagined Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit.
All these products come to life in powerful retail experiences from our own DTC doors to key partner executions like Foot Locker's House of Hoops. And these stores express a deep love of basketball, serving those who share and fuel that passion for the game.
As the Jordan Brand expands as a standalone category, it's global revenues remain incredibly strong, up double digits again this quarter. The Air Jordan XXX continues to fulfill its promise of offering the next frontier of flight and we're seeing strong sell-through in the market. The shoe offers the apex of Jordan's evolution both as a player and a design collaborator, as the shoe features performance insights and design inspirations from Michael. And impressively, the 7210 call-away of the Air Jordan XI was the largest launch ever in the history of Nike.com, breaking sales and traffic records. With this launch, we doubled Nike.com's previous largest launch ever. 
This also -- this was also a quarter that proves yet again how powerful the energy is when the NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand team, team up. The NBA All-Star Weekend in Toronto was a full of a kind of -- was full of kind of superior executions that only NIKE and the Jordan Brand can do. That includes exclusive experiences for basketball fans, premium product launches and a massive roster of the game's best players, highlighted that weekend by the awe-inspiring dunk contest featuring Zach LaVine and Aaron Gordon, 2 of Nike's young and exciting players. 
 
Overall through that weekend, as I walk through Toronto, I was blown away by the visible excitement for the game as NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand helped ignite the culture of basketball around the world.
As we continue to experience the excitement of March Madness and await the NBA Playoffs and the Rio Olympics, that enthusiasm for the game will just continue to build. 
Next. Nike Women's, which has seen its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, as the business continues to outpace our men's business. We've seen consistent growth in our women's business because we know this athlete is demanding more from brands across products, across services and across experiences, and we are there every step of the way throughout that journey, serving her completely through her run, train and live lifestyle. But we also know that these are no longer separate categories for athletes. More and more, women are blending running, fitness and sports style in their lives and this shift is fundamental to how this business operates. So expanding our focus on product to include services and experiences. 
With new silhouettes, fabrics and styling, we have elevated the quality and the technical innovation of our products. For example, our Power Speed running tight and our Zoned Sculpt training tight provide compressive feel with every move to support her key muscle groups. And in Footwear, our popular Metcon 2 is designed for high-intensity training with just the right amount of stability and flexibility as she works out.
This quarter also saw the acceleration of our highly successful Better For It campaign, in which we invite each athlete to push herself out of her comfort zone by providing personal motivation and rich community to help her meet her goals. And we released the Margot vs Lily web series, inviting women to challenge themselves and celebrate their victories. The response has been extraordinary with 18 million views to date. We've also seen a considerable increase in downloads of the Nike+ Run Club and the Nike+ Training Club, with members becoming more active and buying more, thanks in part to the links in each episode to the product worn by the characters. 
As Mark mentioned, these services are still just the tip of the iceberg, given the incredible promise of the new Nike+ app and the expanded digital services.
Let me now turn to a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered strong growth in the quarter, with revenues up 14%, driven by Sportswear, Jordan, Running and Men's Training. We are seeing positive consumer response to our executions with wholesale partners such as DICK'S Sporting Goods and Foot Locker. 
Our own DTC business also had another strong quarter, up 25%, led by ongoing strength in Nike.com. As we discussed last quarter, we have been working to efficiently clear excess inventory in North America and we've made good progress in Q3. The flow of products through our newly expanded North American distribution network is normalizing. We prioritized liquidation through our factory stores and we are selectively utilizing third-party value channels. And as always, we are actively managing the flow of product into the in-line marketplace to ensure a healthy pull market as we end fiscal year '16. 
We remain focused on what is most important to our long-term strategy, serving the consumer. The NIKE Brand and it's deep connection to consumers remains incredibly strong and we are confident that the actions we are taking will ensure that we have the capacity to deliver new, innovative products into the marketplace, innovations like those Mark talked about.
We see tremendous long-term potential for North America and we look forward to delivering even more innovative products and services to best serve our consumers in this important geography.
Next. Western Europe, our second-largest geography, which delivered 12% revenue growth in the quarter. It's clear the decisions we made to accelerate the category offense in Western Europe are paying off as we continue to see momentum driven by Sportswear, Jordan as well as young athletes. This growth was led by Footwear where we're seeing great sell-through in some of Nike's iconic remastered styles such as the Roshe Run, Ultra and the evergreen classics like the Cortez. We're also seeing great momentum in apparel as we fuel sports style innovation through the newly launched Tech Knit collection throughout our end -- throughout our broader Tech Fleece product line. We continue to see tremendous growth potential in Western Europe and look forward to the excitement created this summer with the 2016 European Championships. 
Let's now take a look at the emerging markets, which delivered revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. Strong growth was led by double-digit growth in SoCo and growth in our key categories such as Sportswear, Running, Global Football and Women's Training.
In Brazil, the work we've done to reset the marketplace is paying dividends. We're seeing strong results in retail concepts that we developed with our strategic wholesale partners. And our own DTC business continues to accelerate. Despite the macroeconomic trends in the territory, we are headed into the Rio Olympics with plenty of brand momentum. Inventory levels are healthy, our market share is increasing and we have the pipeline of innovative products coming in this Olympics year.
Finally. Greater China, which continues to see strong marketplace momentum and very healthy growth despite macroeconomic uncertainty. China grew an incredible 27% this quarter, fueled in part by the continued strength of the NIKE Brand. The success we're seeing in China today stems from decisions we made to align our teams against the biggest opportunities, driving growth in key categories of Sportswear, Running, Jordan and NIKE Basketball. We're seeing incredibly strong growth in DTC with Nike.com leading the way. 
Demand during the Chinese New Year surpassed anything we've ever seen before and we operated with sharp precision to drive conversion to capitalize on that demand across all of our DTC dimensions. And successes by our key partners such as ByLee and Pao Shen [ph] continue to reflect the consumer demand with the reprofiled doors outpacing the rest of the fleet. Ultimately, Greater China demonstrates our ability to execute our strategies and operationalize them at world-class levels. 
Looking forward, I am confident in what the NIKE Brand is bringing to consumers and the connections we're making with them. I like where we are and better yet, I like where we're headed. Thanks. Now here's Andy."

Our strong third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate: first, the power of NIKE's uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses; and second, the virtuous cycle of growth and in",1986,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor. And good afternoon to everyone on the call. Our strong third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate: first, the power of NIKE's uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses; and second, the virtuous cycle of growth and investment that fuels NIKE's long-term financial model. As Mark said, Running a complete offense is one of NIKE's many competitive advantages. We continually push ourselves to sharpen our game and better serve consumers in every dimension of our business around the world. 
That said, not every dimension of our portfolio will have the same level of momentum in each and every period. But as we relentlessly strive to run a complete offense, we do sustain strong momentum in the vast majority of our businesses while also acting quickly to turn challenges into opportunities in other dimensions. That portfolio dynamic is how NIKE, Inc. consistently delivers strong top line growth year after year.
In the third quarter, we again delivered strong growth, with revenue up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. All geographies grew double digits with Greater China continuing to set the pace. 
On that note, I was just in China 3 weeks ago and I can sum up my visit in 1 word, amazing. Our brand and business in China have never been stronger and we continue to build momentum. That's not by accident. Our focus in China has been on fueling greater sport participation and love for sport while also transforming the consumer experience along category lines, both in-store and online.
We are now seeing increasingly deeper passion for sport in China and that is translating into strong demand for our products across multiple categories, from NIKE Basketball, to Jordan, to Running, to Men's and Women's Training. To serve that fast-growing demand, our team in China has already created some of the most compelling new NIKE retail experiences in the world, both owned and partnered. We see tremendous opportunity ahead in China and we will continue investing to sustain our strong momentum in this important geography.
That brings me to my second point, the virtuous cycle of growth and investment that fuels NIKE's financial model. Growth creates the capacity to invest. And as we prioritize our investments, innovation will always be at the top of NIKE's list. 
At last week's Innovation Summit, we showcased what we mean when we say NIKE will bring a relentless flow of innovation to serve the athlete and consumer. As Mark detailed, we revealed a series of innovations that we expect to fuel growth across our global portfolio over the long term, ranging from adaptive and other new footwear technologies, to new systems of performance in apparel, to the new Nike+ application, which will deliver the best of NIKE, personalized at your fingertips.
While investing in innovation is our top priority, we also use our investment capacity to surgically edit and shift within our portfolio to ensure that we remain on the offense with consumers. For example, as we noted last quarter, our inventory levels in North America are somewhat elevated, primarily due to protracted challenges we have experienced in our supply chain dating back to the West Coast port congestion and as we expanded distribution center capacity in Memphis. So we are taking action to ensure appropriate capacity in our full price in-line channels for fresh, new product, including the innovation we shared last week. 
The investments associated with those actions include: one, investing in our supply chain to ramp up capacity and enhance the flow of product to consumers; and two, absorbing the negative mix impact on gross margin that comes with expeditiously clearing excess inventory. In short, our consistently strong top line growth expands our capacity to invest for the long term while also delivering appropriate financial performance in the short term. That is the virtuous cycle that fuels NIKE's long-term financial model. 
And with that, I'll turn to a more detailed review of our Q3 financial results.
Q3 revenue for NIKE, Inc. grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis. And after taking into account significant currency headwinds, revenue grew 8% on a reported basis. On a currency-neutral basis, the NIKE Brand grew 15% while Converse revenue declined 5%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 17%, reflecting continued strong demand for the NIKE Brand around the world, driven by a 10% increase in units, with increases in average selling prices contributing 7 percentage points of growth. Futures in all geographies grew at a double-digit rate.
On a reported basis, futures grew 12%, taking into account the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies. Q3 diluted EPS grew 22% to $0.55 despite significant headwinds from FX. EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth, a lower tax rate and a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding.
Gross margin was flat to prior year at 45.9% as higher average selling prices and continued growth in our higher-margin DTC business was offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, higher warehousing costs and a mix impact associated with inventory management in North America.
Q3 gross margin was somewhat better than we expected 90 days ago as a result of higher full price gross margin and also slightly better-than-expected off-price gross margin, as our inventory management efforts in North America were more weighted toward Nike Factory Stores as compared to lower margin third-party  channels in the quarter.
Q3 demand creation increased 10% for the quarter in support of key brand initiatives such as Super Bowl 50 and our women's Better For It and Margot vs Lily campaigns. Operating overhead leveraged for the quarter at 7%, driven by strong operational and financial discipline, focusing our investments on our highest priorities while preserving capacity to invest in the opportunities that lie ahead. 
Our effective tax rate was 16.3% for Q3, lower than the prior year, primarily due to a higher mix of non-U.S. earnings, which are generally subject a lower tax rate, the accelerated recognition of foreign tax credits, adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions in the prior year and the retroactive and permanent reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit.
As of February 29, our inventories were up 8%, driven by a 4% increase in NIKE Brand wholesaling units, growth in our DTC business and increases in average cost -- product cost per unit, partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Now let's turn to a review of our performance by segment. 
North America revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, with strong revenue growth across nearly all categories and continued strong growth in our DTC businesses, led by NIKE.com. Futures also grew 10% in North America, reflecting strong consumer demand for the new, innovative products that we're bringing to market. 
On a reported basis, North America revenue grew 13% and EBIT increased 9% as revenue growth and operating overhead leverage were partially offset by higher demand creation spending and a decline in gross margin as the impact of our inventory management actions offset full price gross margin expansion.
In Western Europe, revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in all territories, reflecting continued expansion of the category offense. Nearly all key categories grew, led by strong growth in Sportswear and Jordan. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 2% and EBIT remained flat due to significant foreign currency headwinds. 
In Central & Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue grew 29% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit growth in nearly all territories. Most key categories also grew double digits, led by Sportswear, Running and Global Football. 
Revenue growth in the quarter also benefited from a comparison to the prior year when import delays in Turkey resulted in product planned for sale in Q3 actually being sold in Q4. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 12%, reflecting weaker foreign currencies. EBIT increased 33%, driven by double-digit revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Greater China, again, we continued to deliver extraordinary growth, with Q3 revenue up 27% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was strong across nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Jordan and Nike Basketball. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 23% and EBIT grew 43% due to a very strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
Moving on to the emerging markets. Q3 revenue increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis as most territories delivered growth in the quarter, driven by SoCo and Pacific. Every key category grew in the quarter, led by Sportswear, Running, Global Football and Women's Training. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue declined 8% and EBIT decreased 14%, reflecting weaker foreign currencies. Looking forward, the emerging markets' strong currency-neutral futures growth reflects strong demand in nearly all territories. And as Trevor noted, while macroeconomics in Brazil are challenging, a reset of that marketplace is on track as we approach the Olympics in Rio.
At Converse, Q3 revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by comparisons to a prior year shift in the timing of shipments out of Q4 and into Q3 fiscal year '15 to ensure Converse's smooth transition to a new ERP system. On a reported basis, Converse revenue decreased 9% and EBIT decreased 22% versus prior year, driven primarily by the revenue shift, lower gross margin and weakness in the euro.
NIKE, Inc.'s powerful, global portfolio of businesses has delivered strong results year-to-date and we expect momentum to continue into Q4 and beyond. For the full year fiscal year '16, we continue to expect financial performance in line with the expectations that we shared with you 90 days ago. Specifically, for both Q4 and the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, roughly in line with our year-to-date rate of growth. 
For gross margin, we continue to expect expansion of about 50 basis points for the full year, with Q4 gross margin flat to slightly expanding versus prior year. We also continued to expect fiscal year '16 full year SG&A to grow at a high single-digit rate, with Q4 SG&A growing at a high single to low double-digit rate.,
Other income will continue to have a meaningful impact on our full year results due to the impact of hedges captured in this line item. For Q4, we expect other income of approximately $40 million. And finally, we now expect our full year fiscal year '16 effective tax rate will be approximately 19%.
Looking ahead to fiscal year '17. Our planning is not yet finalized. However, we have strong momentum in our business around the world, and we expect that strong momentum to continue. Accordingly, we anticipate currency-neutral revenue to grow in the high single to low double-digit range in fiscal year '17, and we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate due to continued strength of the U.S. dollar.
We currently expect EPS to grow at a low teens rate, reflecting continued strong operational performance, partially offset by unfavorable FX-related impacts. Further, we expect that our EPS growth will be more heavily weighted toward the back half of fiscal year '17, as we invest in significant brand initiatives early in the fiscal year, including the Rio Olympics and the European Football Championships, and also due to unfavorable FX comparisons being more pronounced in the first half of the fiscal year.
The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic, creating both headwinds and opportunities. Accordingly, we'll provide an updated look at our fiscal year '17 guidance during our Q4 earnings call.
As we look ahead, we have broad-based momentum across our uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses and we'll continue to leverage that momentum to deliver appropriate financial performance in the short term while also investing and taking action to sustain strong, profitable growth over the long term. 
Having shared that context on our performance and our outlook, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

We also give you revenue guidance so that you get a sense for all of the items that sort of reconcile from gross futures to the total revenue for NIKE, Inc. There are several dimensions of that. I won't hit all of them. We do report them. But just to touch on a few of them, the difference between seasons and quarterly reporting windows, seasons in our industry are about a month off of our quarterly reporting windows; the weighting of futures by month. Both of those things, seasons and weighting by month, can be impact by a number of different factors ranging from shipping timing to consumers to events like the European Football Championships, the Olympics, et cetera. So those are certainly impacts. And then you touched on one of the 2 other dimensions. One is the lag between the futures order date for our DTC business and the timing of sell-through to DTC and consumers, and that is a dynamic as we have a fast-growing DTC business, particularly led by NIKE.com. The other dimension is that while futures represent the vast majority of our revenue, there are some pretty significant items that aren't reflected in futures and can be growing at various rates. That would be always available. NIKE Factory Store revenue, Converse, for example. So there are a lot of factors. What we try to do for you guys is give you a sense for demand again for the NIKE Brand at full price, that's futures, and then do that reconciliation for you and give you the revenue guidance."

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. 
In addition, it is important to remember that significant portions of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including Equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley, are not included in these futures numbers. 
Finally participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results.

I know I speak for everyone on this end of the call when I say our hearts go out to the victims and the families of those impacted by today's attacks.
Getting back to the results. NIKE delivered another strong quarter in Q3 with balanced growth across our expansive, powerful portfolio. By the numbers, here are the highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8% to $8 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin was 45.9%, flat to prior year. And earnings per share increased 22% to $0.55. 
The foundation for NIKE's success and one of our greatest competitive advantages is our complete offense. It's what gives us the power to use our size and scale to accelerate growth and the flexibility to stay nimble and fast. Through our complete offense, we serve a wide range of athletes personally across 13 categories, 6 geographies, men's, women's and young athletes, up and down the price points in wholesale, owned retail and online. 
Our complete offense also creates a culture of shared innovation within NIKE where we turn insights from 1 sport into breakthroughs for all athletes as we are doing with footwear platforms like Flyknit, Lunarlon and Air, or apparel with Dri-FIT and Tech Pack. It allows us to create and curate a targeted mix of products, services and environments into amazing retail experiences for consumers. We develop new concepts and collaborate with our wholesale partners to bring them to life in completely new ways around the world. 
The complete offense is our proven game plan to drive long-term profitable growth, and it's never been as powerful as it is today. For example, we're seeing strong growth in China and Western Europe as well as in our global women's business in the Running category. We're creating deeper and more meaningful connections with our consumers through all of our dimensions, from competition to training to sportswear. 
At the same time, the complete offense also allows us to manage through volatility and take important actions to sustain the momentum in our business. It's how we ensure a healthy marketplace so we can continue to deliver all of the amazing products we have on the horizon to our consumers.
Our relentless flow of innovation is one of the reasons I remain so confident in NIKE's future. You know I like to talk about the innovation pipeline. And often, all I can say is stay tuned. Well, last week, we gave the world a view into just some of what we have in that pipeline for 2016 and beyond. 
Let me take you through some of the concepts that will redefine how NIKE serves the athlete.
In Running, the Air VaporMax gives runners an amazing lightweight, high-performance ride with the most complete and visually stunning Nike Air sole cushioning system ever. 
The LunarEpic creates a new fit and sensation with a mid-height stretched Flyknit color, laser-cut Lunarlon sidewalls and cushioning pods, creating a whole new look and feel for performance running. Launched earlier this month, runners are giving us great feedback and consumer response has been very strong. 
The Free RN Motion delivers our most natural ride yet with a new outsole design that expands in multiple directions when the foot strikes the ground. 
And in Football, anti-clog traction solves a major problem athletes have always faced, and that's mud sticking to their cleats. It removes weight and provides premium traction no matter the conditions.
The new Mercurial Superfly is the boot for the fastest players, with a new lightweight plate for better power transfer and texture mapping across the forefoot for enhanced ball control. 
And in Basketball, the Air Zoom KD9 features a new Flyknit technology that combines lockdown fit with enhanced natural movement. And a full length Zoom Air is more responsive than ever for one of the game's most explosive players, Kevin Durant. 
And we brought Flyknit to one of basketball's greatest icons with the Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit. A design that's half the weight of the original with added cushioning for incredible comfort.
We unveiled auto-adaptive lacing with the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0, the first step into the future of adaptive performance. It's a concept that embodies one of NIKE's most ambitious dreams and just a glimpse of what's to come with products that sense and adapt with the body.
And finally, we kicked off the incredible sports moments ahead of us this summer by unveiling bold national Olympic uniforms across track and field, basketball and football. Each features our new AeroSwift technology and breaks new ground in lightweight breathability, mobility and comfort. 
All told, the 2-day event was NIKE's most powerful display of innovation yet. The greatest sports moments are when we deliver our best for the athlete. We turn their insights into amazing breakthroughs and scale them across our diverse portfolio of categories. It's how we turn the energy of sport into momentum for our business for years to come.
We also know finding new ways to serve the athlete is key to our future growth. Today, our consumers are more connected than ever before. They're demanding and their needs change every day. Last week we introduced a solution with the new Nike+ app, a personal service for athletes. The Nike+ app brings together on-demand coaching, a personal store and amazing experiences all through one mobile access point. Through Nike+, we offer training programs that adapt to your changing schedule and performance. Syncing performance data directly from the Nike+ app in a range of partner devices. And we send reserve invitations guaranteeing our most coveted sneakers and we have gear-up packs tailored just for you to get you started on a new goal or in a new sport. 
The new Nike+ app makes it all easy and personal and puts it all at your fingertips. It's the key to building deep and rich relationships with the athlete in this new era of personalized performance.
Not only does digital create connections with the athlete, it also accelerates our business end-to-end. For Q3, Nike.com delivered another impressive quarter with growth of 56%, fueled by growth in both traffic and conversion. Nike.com allows us to expand our brand and deepen our relationships in new markets. We continue to add new countries every quarter to our Nike.com platform, and it's driving growth around the globe.
It's so energizing to see all we are delivering to make the athlete better. And last week was more than just one moment in time, it's the blueprint for how NIKE will serve the athlete into the future. NIKE is built for growth for the long term. We have a winning strategy that puts the consumer in the center of everything we do, an unmatched global footprint that is fueling a growing movement of sports around the world and the imagination and creative power that can deliver real innovation at unprecedented scale. NIKE has never been in a better position to deliver against our long-term goals. I'm inspired by the work that we're doing. The management team and the people they lead are the best in the industry. And that's critical because the changes we're seeing in the world are fast and massive and so are the opportunities. And that's what's making me as confident as ever in NIKE's future. 
Thanks, and here's Trevor."

The NIKE Brand delivered another strong quarter of growth and profitability as our innovative products and compelling consumer connections continued to drive growth. On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue increased 15%, with double-digit growth across all geographies and nearly all key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue grew 29%, driven by 56% growth in online sales, 10% comp store growth and new store growth. And finally, global futures grew 17%. These strong results are driven, as always, by our relentless focus on the consumer. 
Consumers worldwide expect and demand cutting-edge products, engaging experiences and powerful retail presentations. NIKE's ability to deliver on all 3 strengthens our position as the brand of choice and builds our business around the world. 
To view how all these 3 come to life, you have to look no further than Basketball, where we run a 2-category offense across NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand.
 
Our long history of success in NIKE Basketball comes from creating the most innovative and exciting products, thanks to the insights and inspiration from our great athletes. We saw tremendous sell-through of the KYRIE 2, which features a first of its kind contoured midsole and outsole designed to enhance banking and cutting on the court. And the KOBE 11 was incredibly popular, offering high performance and lightweight design in a progressive low-top that distills Kobe's signature legacy to its very essence.
Looking forward, I am very excited about what's to come in NIKE Basketball. As we gear up for Kobe's retirement, he will continue to inspire innovative products for years to come. We have already started celebrating his career with a monochromatic, retro collection called the Black Mamba Pack. 
I'm also most incredibly excited about the signature basketball performance products that are coming, including the new KD9 that we introduced last week. The KD9 is just one example of the new signature basketball designs in our pipeline that we are bringing to the markets to continue to drive this important and vibrant category. And as always, we will amplify the category with innovative sport -- new sportswear styles like the reimagined Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit.
All of these products come to life in powerful retail experiences from our own DTC stores to key partner executions like Foot Locker's House of Hoops. And these stores express a deep love of basketball, serving those who share and fuel that passion for the game.
As the Jordan Brand expands as a standalone category, its global revenues remain incredibly strong, up double digits again this quarter. The Air Jordan XXX continues to fulfill its promise of offering the next frontier of flight and we're seeing strong sell-through in the market. The shoe offers the apex of Jordan's evolution both as a player and a design collaborator, as the shoe features performance insights and design inspirations from Michael. And impressively, the 7210 call-away of the Air Jordan XI was the largest launch ever in the history of Nike.com, breaking sales and traffic records. With this launch, we doubled Nike.com's previous largest launch ever. 
This also -- this was also a quarter that proves yet again how powerful the energy is when the NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand team, team up. The NBA All-Star Weekend in Toronto was a full of a kind of -- was full of kind of superior executions that only NIKE and the Jordan Brand can do. That includes exclusive experiences for basketball fans, premium product launches and a massive roster of the game's best players, highlighted that weekend by the awe-inspiring dunk contest featuring Zach LaVine and Aaron Gordon, 2 of Nike's young and exciting players. 
 
Overall through that weekend, as I walked through Toronto, I was blown away by the visible excitement for the game as NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand helped ignite the culture of basketball around the world.
As we continue to experience the excitement of March Madness and await the NBA Playoffs and the Rio Olympics, that enthusiasm for the game will just continue to build. 
Next. Nike Women's, which has seen its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, as the business continues to outpace our men's business. We've seen consistent growth in our women's business because we know this athlete is demanding more from brands across products, across services and across experiences, and we are there every step of the way throughout that journey, serving her completely through her run, train and live lifestyle. But we also know that these are no longer separate categories for athletes. More and more, women are blending running, fitness and sports style in their lives and this shift is fundamental to how this business operates. So expanding our focus on product to include services and experiences. 
With new silhouettes, fabrics and styling, we have elevated the quality and the technical innovation of our products. For example, our Power Speed running tight and our Zoned Sculpt training tight provide compressive feel with every move to support her key muscle groups. And in Footwear, our popular Metcon 2 is designed for high-intensity training with just the right amount of stability and flexibility as she works out.
This quarter also saw the acceleration of our highly successful Better For It campaign, in which we invite each athlete to push herself out of her comfort zone by providing personal motivation and rich community to help her meet her goals. And we released the Margot vs Lily web series, inviting women to challenge themselves and celebrate their victories. The response has been extraordinary with 18 million views to date. We've also seen a considerable increase in downloads of the Nike+ Run Club and the Nike+ Training Club, with members becoming more active and buying more, thanks in part to the links in each episode to the products worn by the characters. 
As Mark mentioned, these services are still just the tip of the iceberg, given the incredible promise of the new Nike+ app and the expanded digital services.
Let me now turn to a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered strong growth in the quarter, with revenues up 14%, driven by Sportswear, Jordan, Running and Men's Training. We are seeing positive consumer response to our executions with wholesale partners such as DICK'S Sporting Goods and Foot Locker. 
Our own DTC business also had another strong quarter, up 25%, led by ongoing strength in Nike.com. As we discussed last quarter, we have been working to efficiently clear excess inventory in North America and we've made good progress in Q3. The flow of products through our newly expanded North American distribution network is normalizing. We've prioritized liquidation through our factory stores and we are selectively utilizing third-party value channels. And as always, we are actively managing the flow of product into the in-line marketplace to ensure a healthy pull market as we end fiscal year '16. 
We remain focused on what is most important to our long-term strategy, serving the consumer. The NIKE Brand and its deep connection to consumers remains incredibly strong and we are confident that the actions we are taking will ensure that we have the capacity to deliver new, innovative products into the marketplace, innovations like those Mark talked about.
We see tremendous long-term potential for North America and we look forward to delivering even more innovative products and services to best serve our consumers in this important geography.
Next. Western Europe, our second-largest geography, which delivered 12% revenue growth in the quarter. It's clear the decisions we made to accelerate the category offense in Western Europe are paying off as we continue to see momentum driven by Sportswear, Jordan as well as young athletes. This growth was led by Footwear where we're seeing great sell-through in some of Nike's iconic remastered styles such as the Roshe Run Ultra and the evergreen classics like the Cortez. We're also seeing great momentum in apparel as we fuel sports style innovation through the newly launched Tech Knit collection throughout our -- and throughout our broader Tech Fleece product line. We continue to see tremendous growth potential in Western Europe and look forward to the excitement created this summer with the 2016 European Championships. 
Let's now take a look at the emerging markets, which delivered revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. Strong growth was led by double-digit growth in SoCo and growth in our key categories such as Sportswear, Running, Global Football and Women's Training.
In Brazil, the work we've done to reset the marketplace is paying dividends. We're seeing strong results in retail concepts that we developed with our strategic wholesale partners. And our own DTC business continues to accelerate. Despite the macroeconomic trends in the territory, we are headed into the Rio Olympics with plenty of brand momentum. Inventory levels are healthy, our market share is increasing and we have the pipeline of innovative products coming in this Olympics year.
Finally Greater China, which continued to see strong marketplace momentum and very healthy growth despite macroeconomic uncertainty. China grew an incredible 27% this quarter, fueled in part by the continued strength of the NIKE Brand. The success we're seeing in China today stems from decisions we made to align our teams against the biggest opportunities, driving growth in key categories of Sportswear, Running, Jordan and NIKE Basketball. We're seeing incredibly strong growth in DTC with Nike.com leading the way. 
Demand during the Chinese New Year surpassed anything we've ever seen before and we operated with sharp precision to drive conversion to capitalize on that demand across all of our DTC dimensions. And successes by our key partners such as ByLee and Baoshen continue to reflect the consumer demand with the reprofiled doors outpacing the rest of the fleet. Ultimately, Greater China demonstrates our ability to execute our strategies and operationalize them at world-class levels. 
Looking forward, I am confident in what the NIKE Brand is bringing to consumers and the connections we're making with them. I like where we are and better yet, I like where we're headed. Thanks. Now here's Andy."

Our strong third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate: first, the power of NIKE's uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses; and second, the virtuous cycle of growth and in",1986,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor. And good afternoon to everyone on the call. Our strong third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate: first, the power of NIKE's uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses; and second, the virtuous cycle of growth and investment that fuels NIKE's long-term financial model. As Mark said, Running a complete offense is one of NIKE's many competitive advantages. We continually push ourselves to sharpen our game and better serve consumers in every dimension of our business around the world. 
That said, not every dimension of our portfolio will have the same level of momentum in each and every period. But as we relentlessly strive to run a complete offense, we do sustain strong momentum in the vast majority of our businesses while also acting quickly to turn challenges into opportunities in other dimensions. That portfolio dynamic is how NIKE, Inc. consistently delivers strong top line growth year after year.
In the third quarter, we again delivered strong growth, with revenue up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. All geographies grew double digits with Greater China continuing to set the pace. 
On that note, I was just in China 3 weeks ago and I can sum up my visit in 1 word, amazing. Our brand and business in China have never been stronger and we continue to build momentum. That's not by accident. Our focus in China has been on fueling greater sport participation and love for sport while also transforming the consumer experience along category lines, both in-store and online.
We are now seeing increasingly deeper passion for sport in China and that is translating into strong demand for our products across multiple categories, from NIKE Basketball, to Jordan, to Running, to Men's and Women's Training. To serve that fast-growing demand, our team in China has already created some of the most compelling new NIKE retail experiences in the world, both owned and partnered. We see tremendous opportunity ahead in China and we will continue investing to sustain our strong momentum in this important geography.
That brings me to my second point, the virtuous cycle of growth and investment that fuels NIKE's financial model. Growth creates the capacity to invest. And as we prioritize our investments, innovation will always be at the top of NIKE's list. 
At last week's Innovation Summit, we showcased what we mean when we say NIKE will bring a relentless flow of innovation to serve the athlete and consumer. As Mark detailed, we revealed a series of innovations that we expect to fuel growth across our global portfolio over the long term, ranging from adaptive and other new footwear technologies, to new systems of performance in apparel, to the new Nike+ application, which will deliver the best of NIKE, personalized at your fingertips.
While investing in innovation is our top priority, we also use our investment capacity to surgically edit and shift within our portfolio to ensure that we remain on the offense with consumers. For example, as we noted last quarter, our inventory levels in North America are somewhat elevated, primarily due to protracted challenges we have experienced in our supply chain dating back to the West Coast port congestion and as we expanded distribution center capacity in Memphis. So we are taking action to ensure appropriate capacity in our full price in-line channels for fresh, new product, including the innovation we shared last week. 
The investments associated with those actions include: one, investing in our supply chain to ramp up capacity and enhance the flow of product to consumers; and two, absorbing the negative mix impact on gross margin that comes with expeditiously clearing excess inventory. In short, our consistently strong top line growth expands our capacity to invest for the long term while also delivering appropriate financial performance in the short term. That is the virtuous cycle that fuels NIKE's long-term financial model. 
And with that, I'll turn to a more detailed review of our Q3 financial results.
Q3 revenue for NIKE, Inc. grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis. And after taking into account significant currency headwinds, revenue grew 8% on a reported basis. On a currency-neutral basis, the NIKE Brand grew 15% while Converse revenue declined 5%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 17%, reflecting continued strong demand for the NIKE Brand around the world, driven by a 10% increase in units, with increases in average selling prices contributing 7 percentage points of growth. Futures in all geographies grew at a double-digit rate.
On a reported basis, futures grew 12%, taking into account the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies. Q3 diluted EPS grew 22% to $0.55 despite significant headwinds from FX. EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth, a lower tax rate and a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding.
Gross margin was flat to prior year at 45.9% as higher average selling prices and continued growth in our higher-margin DTC business was offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, higher warehousing costs and a mix impact associated with inventory management in North America.
Q3 gross margin was somewhat better than we expected 90 days ago as a result of higher full price gross margin and also slightly better-than-expected off-price gross margin, as our inventory management efforts in North America were more weighted toward Nike Factory Stores as compared to lower margin third-party channels in the quarter.
Q3 demand creation increased 10% for the quarter in support of key brand initiatives such as Super Bowl 50 and our women's Better For It and Margot vs Lily campaigns. Operating overhead leveraged for the quarter at 7%, driven by strong operational and financial discipline, focusing our investments on our highest priorities while preserving capacity to invest in the opportunities that lie ahead. 
Our effective tax rate was 16.3% for Q3, lower than the prior year, primarily due to a higher mix of non-U.S. earnings, which are generally subject a lower tax rate, the accelerated recognition of foreign tax credits, adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions in the prior year and the retroactive and permanent reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit.
As of February 29, our inventories were up 8%, driven by a 4% increase in NIKE Brand wholesaling units, growth in our DTC business and increases in average cost -- product cost per unit, partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Now let's turn to a review of our performance by segment. 
North America revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, with strong revenue growth across nearly all categories and continued strong growth in our DTC businesses, led by NIKE.com. Futures also grew 10% in North America, reflecting strong consumer demand for the new, innovative products that we're bringing to market. 
On a reported basis, North America revenue grew 13% and EBIT increased 9% as revenue growth and operating overhead leverage were partially offset by higher demand creation spending and a decline in gross margin as the impact of our inventory management actions offset full price gross margin expansion.
In Western Europe, revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in all territories, reflecting continued expansion of the category offense. Nearly all key categories grew, led by strong growth in Sportswear and Jordan. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 2% and EBIT remained flat due to significant foreign currency headwinds. 
In Central & Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue grew 29% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit growth in nearly all territories. Most key categories also grew double digits, led by Sportswear, Running and Global Football. 
Revenue growth in the quarter also benefited from a comparison to the prior year when import delays in Turkey resulted in product planned for sale in Q3 actually being sold in Q4. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 12%, reflecting weaker foreign currencies. EBIT increased 33%, driven by double-digit revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Greater China, again, we continued to deliver extraordinary growth, with Q3 revenue up 27% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was strong across nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Jordan and Nike Basketball. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 23% and EBIT grew 43% due to very strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
Moving on to the emerging markets. Q3 revenue increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis as most territories delivered growth in the quarter, driven by SoCo and Pacific. Every key category grew in the quarter, led by Sportswear, Running, Global Football and Women's Training. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue declined 8% and EBIT decreased 14%, reflecting weaker foreign currencies. Looking forward, the emerging markets' strong currency-neutral futures growth reflects strong demand in nearly all territories. And as Trevor noted, while macroeconomics in Brazil are challenging, a reset of that marketplace is on track as we approach the Olympics in Rio.
At Converse, Q3 revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by comparisons to a prior year shift in the timing of shipments out of Q4 and into Q3 fiscal year '15 to ensure Converse's smooth transition to a new ERP system. On a reported basis, Converse revenue decreased 9% and EBIT decreased 22% versus prior year, driven primarily by the revenue shift, lower gross margin and weakness in the euro.
NIKE, Inc.'s powerful, global portfolio of businesses has delivered strong results year-to-date and we expect momentum to continue into Q4 and beyond. For the full year fiscal year '16, we continue to expect financial performance in line with the expectations that we shared with you 90 days ago. Specifically, for both Q4 and the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, roughly in line with our year-to-date rate of growth. 
For gross margin, we continue to expect expansion of about 50 basis points for the full year, with Q4 gross margin flat to slightly expanding versus prior year. We also continue to expect fiscal year '16 full year SG&A to grow at a high single-digit rate, with Q4 SG&A growing at a high single to low double-digit rate.
Other income will continue to have a meaningful impact on our full year results due to the impact of hedges captured in this line item. For Q4, we expect other income of approximately $40 million. And finally, we now expect our full year fiscal year '16 effective tax rate will be approximately 19%.
Looking ahead to fiscal year '17. Our planning is not yet finalized. However, we have strong momentum in our business around the world, and we expect that strong momentum to continue. Accordingly, we anticipate currency-neutral revenue to grow in the high single to low double-digit range in fiscal year '17, and we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar.
We currently expect EPS to grow at a low teens rate, reflecting continued strong operational performance partially offset by unfavorable FX-related impacts. Further, we expect that our EPS growth will be more heavily weighted toward the back half of fiscal year '17, as we invest in significant brand initiatives early in the fiscal year, including the Rio Olympics and the European Football Championships, and also due to unfavorable FX comparisons being more pronounced in the first half of the fiscal year.
The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic, creating both headwinds and opportunities. Accordingly, we'll provide an updated look at our fiscal year '17 guidance during our Q4 earnings call.
As we look ahead, we have broad-based momentum across our uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses and we'll continue to leverage that momentum to deliver appropriate financial performance in the short term while also investing and taking action to sustain strong, profitable growth over the long term. 
Having shared that context on our performance and our outlook, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

We've actually edited that. There's more innovation than what we showed in New York, both in product and on the digital front. That said, we're incredibly proud of the spectrum, the scope of innovation that we had in footwear and apparel, competitively in Sportswear, really much across the spectrum, the complete offense that I talked about. And then in digital, obviously, that continues to be incredibly important for us. I think you'll see a stream of innovation coming from NIKE in that area. It continues to be a high priority for the company and obviously important to the consumer and the athletes that we're here to serve. So that'll be the norm, I think, to see that kind of steady stream with innovation. And this is what fuels our growth in the end, is the scope and the power of the innovation we have, not just in terms of any one product, but the influence that those products have on all the categories and, in some cases, the brands within the portfolio.

I mean, I'll tell you, at the beginning part of your question, I'll kind of give you a big yes, yes, yes on all those dimensions in the sense that our Sportswear -- as we always talk about, our Sportswear strategy is aligned with our Amplify strategy. So we always drive a performance business and then amplify our Sportswear from that. Right now, we have incredible great products that are coming through on Sportswear, and that really hits on the multiple dimensions of that business, whether that's footwear, looking at the items like the Air Force 1 Flyknit Ultra or the Huarache styles or the Roshe styles, all doing really well, the Air Max that we're launching right now. So those are the great items in footwear. On the apparel side, we just launched the new Tech Knit collection, which is doing phenomenally well in the marketplace, and so -- and which is a continuation of the Tech Pack. So we've seen that. And we're also hitting at really multiple price zones, so whether it's the most premium to the most premium value, kind of all the way through. So it's hitting on every single dimension. But what is true also that you are you seeing some strong growth in the Jordan Brand, so it isn't one versus the other. We believe that the complete offense allows us to really drive and continue to drive all those dimensions of those businesses, both in performance to Sportswear from the NIKE Brand to the Jordan Brand, and that really represents the complete offense."

We also give you revenue guidance so that you get a sense for all of the items that sort of reconcile from gross futures to the total revenue for NIKE, Inc. There are several dimensions of that. I won't hit all of them. We do report them. But just to touch on a few of them, the difference between seasons and quarterly reporting windows, seasons in our industry are about a month off of our quarterly reporting windows; the weighting of futures by month. Both of those things, seasons and weighting by month, can be impacted by a number of different factors ranging from shipping timing to consumers to events like the European Football Championships, the Olympics, et cetera. So those are certainly impacts. And then you touched on one of the 2 other dimensions. One is the lag between the futures order date for our DTC business and the timing of sell-through to DTC and consumers, and that is a dynamic as we have a fast-growing DTC business, particularly led by NIKE.com. The other dimension is that while futures represent the vast majority of our revenue, there are some pretty significant items that aren't reflected in futures and can be growing at various rates. That would be Always Available, NIKE Factory Store revenue, Converse, for example. So there are a lot of factors. What we try to do for you guys is give you a sense for demand again for the NIKE Brand at full price, that's futures, and then do that reconciliation for you and give you the revenue guidance."

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changing in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprints of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results.

On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Inc. revenues grew 12",1334,"Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Fiscal year '16 was a strong year for NIKE. Let's take a look at the highlights.
NIKE Inc. revenues grew 6% to $32.4 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Inc. revenues grew 12%. Gross margin expanded 20 basis points to 46.2%. Earnings per share rose 17% to $2.16. And we delivered ROIC of 29.7%.
Year-end is when we reflect on our successes over the last 12 months, and I'm pride to say that there were many for NIKE. But more importantly, this is a key moment to look ahead, to focus on the opportunities in front of us. We just kicked off an amazing summer of sport. LeBron, KYRIE and the Cavs made basketball history of going back from an unprecedented 3-to-1 deficit in the finals to win the NBA Championship. It was a total team effort to be sure that the storyline of LeBron bringing the championship back to his hometown, Cleveland, will be down as one of the greatest in recent history.
In Global Football, we saw a monumental win for Chile taking the Copa América title for the second time in a row. In the European championships after some remarkable moments, we're now down to the final 8. And we can't wait for Rio to watch the best athletes in the world under the brightest lights.
As you know, the backdrop of our business is more dynamic than it's ever been. But NIKE wins because we just don't adapt to these forces, we create and shape the change. We lead. For example, we're all seeing the growing power of sports. Participation is increasing all over the world. People are leading healthier, more active lives. At the same time, the rise of sport culture is bringing fitness and style together profoundly influencing what we all wear every day. It's clear our amplify category offense is a model that works. We're growing the business across the entire lifestyle sports from performance to sportswear.
And in retail, our industry is in the early stages of unprecedented transformation. Mobile innovation and personal services are dominating the landscape. That's why we invest in integrating digital and physical retail seamlessly, giving our consumers better access to the products they want and while we're working even closer with our best wholesale partners, we share our vision for the future of retail.
Manufacturing too is undergoing its own revolution. We're rethinking the fundamentals across our business in how we make products, how fast to deliver them and what kind of impact they leave behind. With other innovators like flex or HP, we're deploying projects across our source base to reduce cost and delivery time, improve quality, explore customization and enhance performance. As a global leader, this is what we do. Through the power of sport, the transformation of our industry and the shifts in consumer preferences and expectations, we build the foundation for tremendous long-term growth for NIKE.
In the near term, we know there are certain areas where we have work to do but nobody is more demanding of our business than we are internally. And while outside of NIKE, we face macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility, our complete offense gives us our greatest competitive advantage. It's how we drive profitable, sustainable growth in the near and long term.
The complete offense puts the consumer at the center of our business, aligned by sport in the most important markets across multiple channels. This diversity is unique to NIKE and it's our competitive strength. We have the ability to leverage our portfolio and dial-up or dial down the many dimensions of our business depending on the need. And in fiscal year '16, we did just that, putting a special focus on the areas that will make the biggest impact in the years ahead: performance innovation, sports style innovation and digital.
Let's start with performance innovation, with just a few of the highlights. The LunarEpic Flyknit, a revolutionary mid-height running shoe; Free Run Motion, with our most natural ride ever; the KOBE 11, a low-top that pushes what's possible with Flyknit; the KYRIE 2, a shoe to match the speed and cutting of KYRIE; the Mercurial Superfly 5, our fastest football boot ever; adaptive lacing, our first step into personalized performance; our anti-clog traction system, which prevents the age old problem of mud sticking to cleats; Therma-Sphere Max, which regulates temperature and cold-weather; and our vapor kits with AeroSwift technology, the lightest, fastest and most sustainable football kits ever. These are just a few of the highlights to show the breadth and depth of what NIKE delivers over the course of the year. Heading into fiscal year '17, we have a full pipeline of innovation on the way. We've never delivered such relentless flow of breakthrough products across all sports. What you saw in March is just beginning to deliver to consumers and will continue throughout the year.
Now while our innovative products change the rules of performance, they also create a new aesthetic, a new look. NIKE has a way of inspiring an athlete even before they've laced up their shoes. And as athletes have always told us, when they look faster and stronger, they play better. We know that creating an emotional connection through product doesn't just happen by accident. It takes a steady flow of investment, inspiration and talent. Time and again, the consumer votes for NIKE because we represent authenticity and thoughtful storytelling. We obsess finishing, materials and color and we understand the power for both function and form. At the same time, we bring performance benefits to Sportswear, what we call sports style innovation. We deliver lightweight, breathability and comfort to products for everyday life, and it drives a significant business for NIKE. And we see great potential for innovation and growth ahead with Sportswear.
Finally, I'll turn to digital services and experiences. More than any year before it, fiscal '16 saw NIKE deepen our commitment to serving athletes personally at scale. And that means more in-person experiences through one-to-one appointments at retail or support through run clubs and training sessions. And of course, it also means leveraging the power of our family of apps. This quarter, the new Nike+ app is in beta testing with a select audience as we prepare for the full launch later this summer. So far we've received very positive feedback on its simplicity and tailored features. We're excited about the enormous potential for Nike+ to unite our digital platform and deliver personalized performance at tremendous scale through products, coaching and experiences.
The investments we make in mobile and online experiences are paying off, with our NIKE.com business growing 46% in fiscal '16. And we've continued to expand our global reach with NIKE.com going live in 20 new countries this year, now totaling over 40 markets around the world. We're still in the early stages of digital services but we continue to show that building meaningful relationships with consumers drives growth and strengthens our brand in unlimited ways.
So how will NIKE continue to lead in fiscal '17? Within our complete offense, where do we see the greatest opportunities for growth? Our focus will be to continue to drive our potential across North America and Western Europe; to expand our leadership in China and across our emerging markets; to unleash the power of the Jordan Brand across multiple categories; to accelerate our complete women's business; and to grow the young athletes business globally through premium products; and extend our leading position in Running, Basketball and Sportswear.
And specifically, how will we get there? We invest in the transformation of the marketplace through NIKE.com and stronger executions with our best wholesale partners. We turn the energy of style and performance into long-term business momentum, and we drive a continuous cycle of innovation.
We've never seen as much opportunity as we do today and I've never been more confident in the future NIKE is creating. With that, I'll turn it over to Trevor."

I feel great about the results we delivered for the year, once again illustrating the power of the NIKE Brand portfolio from our geographies and categories, from wholesale to DTC and across men's, women's and young athletes. In fiscal year '",1765,"Thanks, Mark. I feel great about the results we delivered for the year, once again illustrating the power of the NIKE Brand portfolio from our geographies and categories, from wholesale to DTC and across men's, women's and young athletes. In fiscal year '16, NIKE proved, yet again, that the diversity of our business is one of our greatest competitive advantages. Let's take a look at the numbers.
On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 8% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 13%, with double-digit growth in nearly all geographies. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 23% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 25%, driven by online growth of 51%, new stores and comp store growth of 10%. And finally, global futures are up 11%.
The growth throughout fiscal year '16 is a direct result of the deep relationships we have built with consumers. Our relentless focus on individual athletes around the world bolsters those connections year in and year out whether at retail, online or at live experiences. NIKE's unique ability to serve the global consumer through the lens of their favorite sport is what drives such a consistent growth for the NIKE Brand. To see this growth in action, let's take a look at a few of our key categories.
In Running, we delivered 10% growth for the year, with the category reaching $5.3 billion in revenue on a constant currency basis. Contributing to this growth was our Pegasus franchise and statement apparel, including the Dri-FIT cool top, the AeroSwift short and the Power Speed tight. Q4 was also highlighted by key innovative footwear launches led by the LunarEpic, a disruptive style that offers an amazingly smooth ride and a remarkable soft-like fit. Excitement is building for the LunarEpic mid and the LunarEpic low which will launch in a couple of days.
We also extended our NIKE Free platform with the launch of the Free Run, the Free 1 Flyknit and the Free Run Motion, which saw a strong sell-through for both men and women. At the same time, there was incredible momentum with our NIKE inspired Sportswear in Q4. This was highlighted by our global activation of the Air Max Day, where we engaged hundreds of millions of consumers, creating massive scale and impact. By celebrating classic silhouettes and updating them with new technologies, print and patterns, we fueled the culture of sneakers around the world.
Finally, Q4 underscored the success of our Running inspired apparel. Our NIKE Tech Hypermesh line, including the Windrunner and the Bomber, saw strong sell-through, thanks to its extra-light, ventilated fabric that keeps athletes warm as the weather changes. By taking an iconic product and remixing it with groundbreaking innovation, the Hypermesh Windrunner is the perfect embodiment of how NIKE drives leadership in Sportswear.
Next, let's take a look at Basketball, which is increasingly its own portfolio with NIKE Basketball, NIKE Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. No matter of the landscape, this complete offense is our foundation that keeps us well positioned to always inspire and serve basketball fans across the globe through innovative products both performance and Sportswear. As Mark said, we are thrilled for LeBron, KYRIE and the rest of the Cavs team for bringing home a championship for Cleveland. LeBron's MVP performance, in which he was the first player in the NBA history to lead all players in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks for an entire finals, that want to be forgotten soon. And consumers have responded, the shoe he wore in the finals, the LeBron Soldier 10 has seen incredible sell-through in the week since it was released.
And, of course, KYRIE, who hit the series winning shot in game 7, continue to cement his place as one of the game's best players and a fan favorite. The KYRIE 2 has seen strong sell-through across multiple color waves [ph] and we are excited about the future of the KYRIE signature line.
And I'd be remiss if I didn't also give a shout out to Kevin Durant, who had an amazing playoff himself. The initial launch last week of the KD9 with its Flyknit Upper atop a full Zoom airbag, sold out completely.
In Jordan footwear, we see continued momentum as the Air Jordan 30 and the Jordan Ultra Fly drive excitement in the U.S. and around the world. And on the Sportswear side, the Air Jordan Retro 12 celebrating Jordan's epic playoff performance in 1997, was one of the largest launches in the quarter. Also incredibly successful was the launch of the Air Force 1 Flyknit low, which weighs 50% less than the original thanks to an all new, ultra-breathable NIKE Flyknit upper.
Before I close Basketball, I have to mention an unforgettable moment from the quarter. LeBron's last game, the one of the game's greatest, went out in storybook style with 60 points and a dominant final stretch. The KOBE 11 -- ID shoe, was the most successful ID launch ever, with incredible demand in North America and Greater China. While the end of Kobe's playing career closes one chapter, we are excited for with the future holds for Kobe and NIKE together. Ultimately, no brand can provide what we bring to the sport of basketball, the power of performance and sportswear, true global reach, the world's best roster of athletes and an incredible pipeline of products to come over the next year and beyond.
Finally, to appreciate how our entire portfolio of categories comes to life, let's take a look at the key growth driver for us, our Sportswear category. NIKE Sportswear takes the nice style of sport and amplifies it across all our performance categories. For the year, Sportswear grew 22% and reached $8.1 billion, adding nearly $1.5 billion in revenue in this category alone. Our strong Sportswear category puts us in a unique position to fuel passion for sport around the world from the Roshe, to the Huarache, to the Foamposite and to many more. We have the innovative and stylish products that consumers continue to love. While consumer preferences can shift over time, no brand is better positioned to serve the consumer across our globally diversified portfolio from performance to lifestyle through our category amplified offense. This is the unique power of the NIKE Brand.
Let's now turn to out a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered strong growth in the year, with revenues up 8% driven by Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. We continue to work more closely with our key wholesale partners such as DICK'S Sporting Goods and the Foot Locker, to deliver compelling retail experiences for our consumers. And our DTC business also had another strong year, up 17% including ongoing strength in NIKE.com.
For Q4, North America revenue was flat to prior year due to timing shifts related to delayed deliveries in fiscal year '15 from the West Coast port congestion. As of the end of Q4, inventory levels in our full price in-line channels are clear clean, consistent with the goal we shared last quarter.
Looking ahead to Q1, we will continue to clear excess inventory through our factory stores and select third-party channels. At the same time, we remain focused on sustaining a healthy full market in the in-line channel and we are proactively managing the flow of products into the marketplace with a focus on new, innovative products for our consumers.
As always, we continue to focus on serving the consumer in this critical geography, with our brand proven time and time again it remains incredibly strong in North America. We are confident that the actions we are taking will ensure that we are set up to deliver long-term, profitable growth.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we're seeing broad-based demand with growth of 19% in the quarter and 14% for the year. Growth in the quarter and throughout the year was fueled by our continued efforts to transform the marketplace along the category offense. In Q4, all territories grew double digits and all key categories grew, led by Sportswear, Global Football, Jordan Brand and Running. And our DTC business continues to perform well, growing 26% in the quarter.
In Q4, we also extended our partnership with one of the world's most storied football clubs, FC Barcelona, and with the European championships currently in force, we are excited about our line of national team athletes, which offer groundbreaking performance innovation such as engineered knit zones, enhanced fit and breathability. The momentum we have seen in fiscal '16 in Western Europe, combined with the strength of the NIKE Brand, reinforces our view that there is tremendous growth potential in this geography. Our focus on this consumer will continue to build on that momentum as we head into the fiscal year '17 and beyond.
And finally, in Greater China, we had a truly incredible year. Q4 revenue grew 23%, and we posted full year growth of 27%, with strong growth in nearly every category in across footwear and apparel. Full year growth was driven primarily by Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand. In DTC, we saw growth of 44%, with continued strong growth online as well as in our stores. For our wholesale partners stores that have been reprofiled, they continue to outperform the rest of the fleet.
As we continue to transform the marketplace, we are starting to reach scale with our door that we reprofiled along the category offense. We work with our partners to tailor everything from concept to environment, from assortment to service and throughout the must-win trade zones to deliver the best experience for our consumers. A great example of this is the opening of our Running door in Chengdu, a new concept in the marketplace that we plan to scale. This door significantly exceeded our expectations within the first few weeks, further illustrating how consumers respond when you relentlessly obsess serving the athlete. Ultimately, we get to close out of the fiscal year and start a new one in the best possible way for the Summer Olympics. I can't wait for August and how powerful a moment it will be around the globe. The power of the world's greatest athletes coming together, the power of the reveal of the world's most innovative products and the power of connecting with consumers in even more personal ways to celebrate their passion and love for sport. It's the kind of global experience that promises to further accelerate our momentum and it makes me incredibly excited about what's in store.
Thanks, and here's Andy."
291981,346738414,1003044,"NIKE, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2016",2016-06-28,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call. As we close fiscal year '16, NIKE is better positioned than ever to continue delivering strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital. While we a",2093,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call. As we close fiscal year '16, NIKE is better positioned than ever to continue delivering strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital. While we are in an increasingly dynamic macroeconomic environment, we have a management team with experience and a proven track record of working all of the levers within our business to deliver a strong financial performance under a wide range of circumstances. Even more importantly, NIKE is the #1 rated brand by consumers in every major market and every key city around the world, from China to Europe and, of course, here in North America. That is perhaps the most important metric that I will speak to you on this call because it is bestowed upon us by the consumers that we serve and it must be earned. NIKE's brand leadership with consumers is fueled by our authentic and relentless obsession with bringing inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.
In fiscal year '16, we brought that to life by executing our category offense like never before, and that drove strong double-digit growth on a currency-neutral basis. We execute our offense through 3 primary dimensions: brand, product and marketplace.
As Mark and Trevor noted, from a brand perspective, we are more deeply connecting with and inspiring consumers, leveraging the most iconic moments in sports. And from a product perspective, our groundbreaking, innovative footwear and apparel is enabling the world's best athletes to perform at unprecedented levels and make history in those moments.
We then bring those innovative products to our billions of consumers around the world from the LeBron Soldier 10 and the KYRIE 2 to the LunarEpic in Running, to Cristiano Ronaldo's Mercurial Superfly CR7 boot. 
At NIKE, we always start with performance innovation. But with even more is how we are redefining sports culture and leading a global shift in how people express themselves at work and at play. We do that by bringing what Mark referred to as sports style innovation to NIKE's unrivaled portfolio of iconic products such as the Air Force 1, Cortez and Huarache, as well as to the creation of new icons like the Roshe and Air Max Via. And instant classics from performance like Kobe's signature product and the Flyknit Racer. That is something that only NIKE can do on such a global scale, as evidenced by 22% currency neutral growth in NIKE Sportswear, our largest category.
While brand and product fuel our growth, we capture that growth in the marketplace. Globally, consumer demand for athletic footwear and apparel is outpacing broader consumption. At the same time, the retail landscape is rapidly evolving. For other brands, the speed of change in retail may be challenging and create uncertainty. But at NIKE, we have always believed that the best way to predict the future is to create it. That's why, as we shared in our Investor Day last October, we have been leading a transformation of the marketplace, not simply reacting to trends. Over the past year, we made significant investments in NIKE.com, and the results have been extraordinary. NIKE.com grew double to triple digits in all 6 of our geographies, led by Greater China, as we made great progress toward our goal of $7 billion in revenue by 2020. We are also investing to more seamlessly integrate digital and physical retail and working more strategically with our strongest wholesale partners to shape the future of retail.
Our brand, product and marketplace strategies underscore NIKE's relentless focus on creating extraordinary value for consumers and that allows us to continue delivering sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth and value creation for shareholders.
In fiscal year '16, we once again delivered strong top line growth, growing revenue 12% on a currency-neutral basis. We also expanded profitability, growing earnings per share by 17%, outpacing our midteens goal despite significant FX headwinds. And we delivered returns on invested capital of 29.7%, up 160 basis points versus the prior year.
That powerful combination of growth, expanding profitability and strong returns is what sets NIKE apart in terms of shareholder value creation. And while there were areas in which we did not execute as precisely as we had planned in fiscal year '16, those areas represent opportunities to further elevate our game and deliver growth in fiscal year '17. But before I share plans for fiscal year '17, let's first reflect on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal year '16 financial results in a bit more detail.
NIKE Inc. Q4 revenue increased 6%, up 9% on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, NIKE Inc. revenue increased 6% to $32.4 billion, up 12% on a currency-neutral basis. All of our international geographies grew double digits, with North America growing at a high single-digit rate, in line with our long-term targeted rate of growth for that geography. NIKE Brand futures orders reflect continued strong demand across our global portfolio, growing 11% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by a 4% increase in units with increases in average selling price contributing 7 percentage points of growth. On a reported basis, futures grew 8%, reflecting the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies and in particular, developing market currencies.
Fourth quarter diluted EPS was flat to prior year at $0.49. Full year diluted EPS grew 17% to $2.16, driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate.
Gross margin contracted 30 basis points in Q4 while expanding 20 basis points for the full year. For the quarter, margin contraction was driven primarily by inventory management in North America, higher labor cost and foreign exchange, which offset sustained increases in average selling price and the benefits of lower oil on materials cost.
Fourth quarter demand creation increased 7%. For the full year, demand creation increased 2% as we strategically invested in digital consumer engagement and sports marketing while gaining efficiencies in traditional advertising.
Operating overhead increased 7% for the quarter and 8% for the full year. This reflected cost associated with our fast-growing DTC business, as well as strategic investments in consumer facing digital capabilities and operational infrastructure. The effective tax rate for fiscal year '16 was 18.7%, 350 basis points lower than last year's rate, primarily due to a higher mix of non-U.S. earnings, which are generally subject a lower tax rate. As of May 31, inventories were up 12%, including a 6% increase in NIKE Brand wholesaling units, reflecting continued strong global demand.
Now let's turn to performance for a few of our largest operating segments. For the full year, North America revenue grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was led by Sportswear, Jordan and Running. Growth also reflected continued momentum in our DTC business led by NIKE.com growing at 39%. For the quarter, North America revenue growth on a reported basis was flat to the prior year, due in part to an unfavorable comparison to the timing of shipments across Q3 and Q4 in fiscal year '15. Many of the orders planned for shipment in Q3 of fiscal year '15 were delayed due to the West Coast port congestion and instead shipped in Q4. Excluding the impact of this timing shift, we estimate Q4 fiscal year '16 North America revenue growth would have been in the mid-single-digit range.
North America EBIT increased 3% for the full year as revenue growth and full price gross margin expansion were mostly offset by the lower off-price margin associated with clearing excess inventory.
As Trevor discussed, NIKE inventory in the full-priced, in-line channels in North America is now clean. And as reflected in our futures orders, we are also keeping in-line supply tight to ensure a strong pull market. Accordingly, we expect that North America revenue will return to growth in Q1, with growth accelerating over the balance of the fiscal year. North America's gross margin will contract in Q1 as we complete the clearance of excess inventory, with a return to gross margin expansion over the course of fiscal year '17.
Looking to Western Europe, where NIKE's portfolio of categories is becoming increasingly unrivaled, from Global Football to Running, to Sportswear, to Women's Training as well as fast emerging categories such as Basketball and Jordan. In fiscal year '16, every category delivered growth, resulting in double-digit growth in every territory. As a result, Western Europe revenue grew to nearly $6 billion, up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. For the quarter, currency-neutral revenue grew 19%, led by Sportswear and Global Football as we approached the European championships. On a reported basis, fiscal year '16 revenue increased 3%, reflecting FX headwinds, while EBIT expanded 12% driven by SG&A leverage.
In our emerging markets geography, our brand momentum continues to build and we created healthy pull markets. On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal year '16 revenue increased 13%, led by Soco, Mexico and Pacific, fueled by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Jordan and Women's Training. Revenue in Brazil declined due to challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our brand is strong in Brazil, our inventories are healthy and we continue to take share.
For Q4, currency-neutral revenue was up 12%, with double-digit growth in Soco, Korea, Pacific, Mexico and Africa. On a reported basis, fiscal year '16 revenue and EBIT were heavily impacted by the significant FX headwinds throughout the geography. As a result, fiscal year '16 reported revenue decreased 5% while EBIT increased 9%, reflecting gross margin expansion.
Fiscal year '16 was another exceptional year for NIKE in Greater China, with currency-neutral revenue growing 27%. China continues to be one of the world's largest and fastest-growing markets in terms of consumption. And NIKE is unequivocally the leading brand in China as we continue to fuel the Chinese consumer's passion for sport. Our category assortment tailored for the Chinese consumer continue to drive growth and increasing productivity and profitability for both our DTC businesses, led by NIKE.com, and our wholesale partners. Nearly all categories grew in fiscal year '16, led by Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and Jordan. For the quarter, currency-neutral revenue grew 23% with double-digit growth in both footwear and apparel in both DTC and wholesale and across nearly all key categories. On a reported basis, fiscal year '16 revenue is up 23% and EBIT expanded 38%. In addition to tremendous revenue growth, China delivered strong gross margin expansion and highly leveraged SG&A.
In fiscal year '16, NIKE once again delivered another year of strong financial performance. While we are in an increasingly dynamic macro environment, particularly with respect to foreign currencies, our outlook for fiscal year '17 is largely in line with the high-level guidance that we shared last quarter. Specifically for fiscal year '17, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting high single-digit to low double-digit growth on a currency-neutral basis. Our rate of reported revenue growth will be more heavily impacted by FX headwinds in the first half of fiscal year '17, primarily due to developing market currencies. For Q1, we expect mid-single-digit reported revenue growth, roughly 3 points below our reported rate of futures growth.
We expect gross margin for the full year to expand by 30 to 50 basis points, in line with our long-term financial model guardrails. This reflects higher average selling prices, ongoing manufacturing productivity initiatives and continued strong growth in our NIKE.com business as well as a favorable impact of lower oil on materials cost. However, these benefits will be partially offset by continued labor cost inflation and FX headwind.
For Q1, we expect gross margin to decline approximately 100 basis points, driven primarily by FX headwinds, including year-over-year changes in our hedge rates. For total SG&A, we expect full year growth in the high single-digit range, in line with our reported fiscal year '17 revenue guidance.
For Q1, we expect mid to high teens SG&A growth, significantly higher than the full year rate as we make strategic investments in demand creation around key sporting events such as the Olympics and the European Football Championships. We expect other income to be approximately $20 million to $30 million on average for each quarter. For fiscal year '17, we expect the effective tax rate will be between 19% and 21%.
As we look ahead to fiscal year '17, NIKE is the leading brand in every major market; we have the most talented teams; we have strong momentum across our diverse global portfolio of businesses; and we are on the offense as always.
And now, we'll open up the call for your questions."

We continue to see strong underlying momentum in the fundamentals that drive our growth and profitability as you see in our futures orders, our futures orders are reflective of some of that. Dimensions, leading indicators in terms of consumers demand for the NIKE Brand such as NIKE.com, grew 39% as I mentioned over the full year and actually north of 40% in Q4 so accelerated to some extent. So we continue to feel great about where we're going in terms of the transformation of our marketplace including through NIKE.com as well as through the relationship with our strategic wholesale partners.

So that would be our manufacturing initiative, which are beginning to have an impact. We saw an impact from those in fiscal year '16. That's increasingly material. Obviously our long-term perspective is where we're most bullish. But we have shifted from plans and pilot programs to more proliferation of automation in our manufacturing in Asia, as well as we've actually begun production on in line Running product with Flex. So those initiatives, and then coupled with impact such as lower oil on our input cost, particularly materials, those are the drivers of expansion in Western Europe."

Fiscal year '16 was a strong year for NIKE. Let's take a look at the highlights.NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 6% to $32.4 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew",1335,"Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Fiscal year '16 was a strong year for NIKE. Let's take a look at the highlights.
NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 6% to $32.4 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 12%. Gross margin expanded 20 basis points to 46.2%. Earnings per share rose 17% to $2.16. And we delivered ROIC of 29.7%.
Year-end is when we reflect on our successes over the last 12 months, and I'm proud to say that there were many for NIKE. But more importantly, this is a key moment to look ahead, to focus on the opportunities in front of us. We just kicked off an amazing summer of sport. LeBron, Kyrie and the Cavs made basketball history of going back from an unprecedented 3-to-1 deficit in the finals to win the NBA championship. It was a total team effort to be sure, but the storyline of LeBron bringing a championship back to his hometown, Cleveland, will be down as one of the greatest in recent history.
In Global Football, we saw a monumental win for Chile taking the Copa América title for the second time in a row. In the European championships, after some remarkable moments, we're now down to the final 8. And we can't wait for Rio to watch the best athletes in the world under the brightest lights.
As you know, the backdrop of our business is more dynamic than it's ever been. But NIKE wins because we just don't adapt to these forces, we create and shape the change. We lead. For example, we're all seeing the growing power of sports. Participation is increasing all over the world. People are leading healthier, more active lives. At the same time, the rise in sport culture is bringing fitness and style together profoundly influencing what we all wear every day. It's clear our amplified category offense is a model that works. We're growing the business across the entire lifestyle of sports from performance to sportswear.
And in retail, our industry is in the early stages of unprecedented transformation. Mobile innovation and personal services are dominating the landscape. That's why we invest in integrating digital and physical retail seamlessly, giving our consumers better access to the products they want. And while we're working even closer with our best wholesale partners, we share our vision for the future of retail.
Manufacturing, too, is undergoing its own revolution. We're rethinking the fundamentals across our business in how we make products, how fast we deliver them and what kind of impact they leave behind. With other innovators like Flex or HP, we're deploying projects across our source base to reduce cost and delivery time, improve quality, explore customization and enhance performance. As the global leader, this is what we do. Through the power of sports, the transformation of our industry and the shifts in consumer preferences and expectations, we build a foundation for tremendous long-term growth for NIKE.
In the near term, we know there are certain areas where we have work to do, but nobody is more demanding of our business than we are internally. And while outside of NIKE we face macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility, our complete offense gives us our greatest competitive advantage. It's how we drive profitable, sustainable growth in the near and long term.
The complete offense puts the consumer at the center of our business aligned by sport in the most important markets across multiple channels. This diversity is unique to NIKE, and it's our competitive strength. We have the ability to leverage our portfolio and dial up or dial down the many dimensions of our business depending on the need. And in fiscal year '16, we did just that, putting a special focus on the areas that will make the biggest impact in the years ahead: performance innovation, sports style innovation and digital.
Let's start with performance innovation, with just a few of the highlights. The LunarEpic Flyknit, a revolutionary mid-height running shoe; Free RN Motion, with our most natural ride ever; the KOBE 11, a low-top that pushes what's possible with Flyknit; the KYRIE 2, a shoe to match the speed and cutting of Kyrie; the Mercurial Superfly 5, our fastest football boot ever; adaptive lacing, our first step into personalized performance; our anti-clog traction system, which prevents the age-old problem of mud sticking to cleats; Therma-Sphere Max, which regulates temperature and cold-weather; and our Vapor kits with AeroSwift technology, the lightest, fastest and most sustainable football kits ever. These are just a few of the highlights to show the breadth and depth of what NIKE delivers over the course of the year. Heading into fiscal year '17, we have a full pipeline of innovation on the way. We've never delivered such relentless flow of breakthrough products across all sports. What you saw in March is just beginning to deliver to consumers and will continue throughout the year.
Now while our innovative products change the rules of performance, they also create a new esthetic, a new look. NIKE has a way of inspiring an athlete even before they've laced up their shoes. And as athletes have always told us, when they look faster and stronger, they play better. We know that creating an emotional connection through product doesn't just happen by accident. It takes a steady flow of investment, inspiration and talent. Time and again, the consumer votes for NIKE because we represent authenticity and thoughtful storytelling. We obsess finishing and materials and color, and we understand the power for both function and form. At the same time, we bring performance benefits to Sportswear, what we call sports style innovation. We deliver lightweight, breathability and comfort to products for everyday life, and it drives a significant business for NIKE. We see great potential for innovation and growth ahead with Sportswear.
Finally, I'll turn to digital services and experiences. More than any year before it, fiscal '16 saw NIKE deepen our commitment to serving athletes personally at scale. And that means more in-person experiences through one-to-one appointments at retail or support through run clubs and training sessions. And of course, it also means leveraging the power of our family of apps. This quarter, the new Nike+ app is in beta testing with a select audience as we prepare for the full launch later this summer. So far we've received very positive feedback on its simplicity and tailored features. We're excited about the enormous potential for Nike+ to unite our digital platform and deliver personalized performance at tremendous scale through products, coachings and experiences.
The investments we make in mobile and online experiences are paying off, with our NIKE.com business growing 46% in fiscal '16. And we've continued to expand our global reach, with NIKE.com going live in 20 new countries this year, now totaling over 40 markets around the world. We're still in the early stages of digital services, but we continue to show that building meaningful relationships with consumers drives growth and strengthens our brand in unlimited ways.
So how will NIKE continue to lead in fiscal '17? Within our complete offense, where do we see the greatest opportunities for growth? Our focus will be to continue to drive our potential across North America and Western Europe; to expand our leadership in China and across our emerging markets; to unleash the power of the Jordan Brand across multiple categories; to accelerate our complete Women's business; and to grow the young athletes business globally through premium products; and extend our leading position in Running, Basketball and Sportswear.
And specifically, how will we get there? We invest in the transformation of the marketplace through NIKE.com and stronger executions with our best wholesale partners. We turn the energy of style and performance into long-term business momentum, and we drive a continuous cycle of innovation.
We've never seen as much opportunity as we do today, and I've never been more confident in the future NIKE is creating. With that, I'll turn it over to Trevor."

I feel great about the results we delivered for the year, once again illustrating the power of the NIKE Brand portfolio from our geographies and categories, from wholesale to DTC and across men's, women's and young Athletes. In fiscal year '",1757,"Thanks, Mark. I feel great about the results we delivered for the year, once again illustrating the power of the NIKE Brand portfolio from our geographies and categories, from wholesale to DTC and across men's, women's and young Athletes. In fiscal year '16, NIKE proved, yet again, that the diversity of our business is one of our greatest competitive advantages. Let's take a look at the numbers.
On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 8% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 13%, with double-digit growth in nearly all geographies. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 23% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 25% driven by online growth of 51%, new stores and comp store growth of 10%. And finally, global futures are up 11%.
The growth throughout fiscal year '16 is a direct result of the deep relationships we have built with consumers. Our relentless focus on individual athletes around the world bolsters those connections year in and year out. Whether at retail, online or at live experiences, NIKE's unique ability to serve the global consumer through the lens of their favorite sport is what drives such consistent growth for the NIKE Brand. To see this growth in action, let's take a look at a few of our key categories.
In Running, we delivered 10% growth for the year, with the category reaching $5.3 billion in revenue on a constant currency basis. Contributing to this growth was our Pegasus franchise and statement apparel, including the Dri-FIT cool top, the AeroSwift short and the Power Speed tight. Q4 was also highlighted by key innovative footwear launches led by the LunarEpic, a disruptive style that offers an amazingly smooth ride and a remarkable sock-like fit. Excitement is building for the LunarEpic Mid and the LunarEpic Low which will launch in a couple of days.
We also extended our NIKE Free platform with the launch of the Free Run, the Free 1 Flyknit and the Free RN Motion, which saw a strong sell-through for both men and women. At the same time, there was incredible momentum with our NIKE-inspired Sportswear in Q4. This was highlighted by our global activation of the Air Max Day, where we engaged hundreds of millions of consumers, creating massive scale and impact. By celebrating classic silhouettes and updating them with new technologies, prints and patterns, we fuel the culture of sneakers around the world.
Finally, Q4 underscored the success of our Running-inspired apparel. Our NIKE Tech Hypermesh line, including the Windrunner and the Bomber, saw strong sell-through, thanks to its extra-light ventilated fabric that keeps athletes warm as the weather changes. By taking an iconic product and remixing it with groundbreaking innovation, the Hypermesh Windrunner is the perfect embodiment of how NIKE drives leadership in sportswear.
Next, let's take a look at Basketball, which is increasingly its own portfolio with NIKE Basketball, NIKE Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. No matter the landscape, this complete offense is our foundation that keeps us well positioned to always inspire and serve basketball fans across the globe through innovative products at both performance and sportswear. As Mark said, we are thrilled for LeBron, Kyrie and the rest of the Cavs team for bringing home a championship for Cleveland. LeBron's MVP performance, in which he was the first player in the NBA history to lead all players in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks for an entire finals, that won't to be forgotten soon. And consumers have responded. The shoe he wore in the finals, the LeBron Soldier 10 has seen incredible sell-through in the week since it was released.
And, of course, Kyrie, who hit the series-winning shot in game 7, continued to cement his place as one of the game's best players and a fan favorite. The KYRIE 2 has seen strong sell-through across multiple color waves, and we are excited about the future of the KYRIE signature line.
And I'd be remiss if I didn't also give a shout out to Kevin Durant, who had an amazing playoff himself. The initial launch last week of the KD9 with its Flyknit Upper atop a full Zoom airbag, sold out completely.
In Jordan footwear, we see continued momentum as the Air Jordan 30 and the Jordan Ultra.Fly drive excitement in the U.S. and around the world. And on the Sportswear side, the Air Jordan Retro 12, celebrating Jordan's epic playoff performance in 1997, was one of the largest launches in the quarter. Also, incredibly successful was the launch of the Air Force 1 Flyknit low, which weighs 50% less than the original, thanks to an all-new, ultra-breathable NIKE Flyknit upper.
Before I close Basketball, I have to mention an unforgettable moment from the quarter. LeBron's last game were one of the game's greatest, went out in storybook style with 60 points and a dominant final stretch. The KOBE 11 Mamba Day iD shoe was the most successful ID launch ever, with incredible demand in North America and Greater China. While the end of Kobe's playing career closes one chapter, we are excited for what the future holds for Kobe and NIKE together. Ultimately, no brand can provide what we bring to the sport of basketball: the power of performance and sportswear, true global reach, the world's best roster of athletes and an incredible pipeline of products to come over the next year and beyond.
Finally, to appreciate how our entire portfolio of categories comes to life, let's take a look at a key growth driver for us, our Sportswear category. NIKE Sportswear takes the lifestyle of sport and amplifies it across all our performance categories. For the year, Sportswear grew 22% and reached $8.1 billion, adding nearly $1.5 billion in revenue in this category alone. Our strong Sportswear category puts us in a unique position to fuel passion for sport around the world from the Roshe, to the Huarache, to the Foamposite and to many more. We have the innovative and stylish products that consumers continue to love. While consumer preferences can shift over time, no brand is better positioned to serve the consumer across our globally diversified portfolio from performance to lifestyle through our category amplified offense. This is the unique power of the NIKE Brand.
Let's now turn to a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered strong growth for the year, with revenues up 8% driven by Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. We continue to work more closely with our key wholesale partners such as DICK'S Sporting Goods and the Foot Locker, to deliver compelling retail experiences for our consumers. And our DTC business also had another strong year, up 17%, including ongoing strength in NIKE.com.
For Q4, North America revenue was flat to prior year due to timing shifts related to delayed deliveries in fiscal year '15 from the West Coast port congestion. As of the end of Q4, inventory levels in our full-price in-line channels are clean, consistent with the goal we shared last quarter.
Looking ahead to Q1, we will continue to clear excess inventory through our factory stores and select third-party value channels. At the same time, we remain focused on sustaining a healthy pull market in the in-line channel, and we are proactively managing the flow of products into the marketplace with a focus on new, innovative products for our consumers.
As always, we continue to focus on serving the consumer in this critical geography. With our brand proven time and time again, it remains incredibly strong in North America. We are confident that the actions we are taking will ensure that we are set up to deliver long-term, profitable growth.
Now let's turn to Western Europe where we're seeing broad-based demand with growth of 19% in the quarter and 14% for the year. Growth in the quarter and throughout the year was fueled by our continued efforts to transform the marketplace along the category offense. In Q4, all territories grew double digits and all key categories grew led by Sportswear, Global Football, Jordan Brand and Running. And our DTC business continues to perform well, growing 26% in the quarter.
In Q4, we also extended our partnership with one of the world's most storied football clubs, FC Barcelona. And with the European championships currently in force, we are excited about our line of national team fits, which offer groundbreaking performance innovations such as engineered knit zones to enhance fit and breathability. The momentum we have seen in fiscal '16 in Western Europe, combined with the strength of the NIKE Brand, reinforces our view that there is tremendous growth potential in this geography. Our focus on the consumer will continue to build on that momentum as we head into the fiscal year '17 and beyond.
And finally, in Greater China, we had a truly incredible year. Q4 revenue grew 23%, and we posted full year growth of 27%, with strong growth in nearly every category and across footwear and apparel. Full year growth was driven primarily by Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand. In DTC, we saw growth of 44%, with continued strong growth online as well as in our stores. For our wholesale partners stores that have been reprofiled, they continue to outperform the rest of the fleet.
As we continue to transform the marketplace, we are starting to reach scale with our doors that we reprofiled along the category offense. We work with our partners to tailor everything from concept to environment, from assortment to service and throughout the must-win trade zones to deliver the best experience for our consumers. A great example of this is the opening of our Running door in Chengdu, a new concept in the marketplace that we plan to scale. This door significantly exceeded our expectations within the first few weeks, further illustrating how consumers respond when you relentlessly obsess serving the athlete. Ultimately, we get to close out of our fiscal year and start a new one in the best possible way with the Summer Olympics. I can't wait for August and how powerful a moment it will be around the globe. The power of the world's greatest athletes coming together, the power of the reveal of the world's most innovative products and the power of connecting with consumers in even more personal ways to celebrate their passion and love for sport. It's the kind of global experience that promises to further accelerate our momentum, and it makes me incredibly excited about what's in store.
Thanks, and here's Andy."
291981,346738414,1003077,"NIKE, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2016",2016-06-28,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call. As we close fiscal year '16, NIKE is better positioned than ever to continue delivering strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital. While we a",2089,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call. As we close fiscal year '16, NIKE is better positioned than ever to continue delivering strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital. While we are in an increasingly dynamic macroeconomic environment, we have a management team with experience and a proven track record of working all of the levers within our business to deliver strong financial performance under a wide range of circumstances. Even more importantly, NIKE is the #1-rated brand by consumers in every major market and every key city around the world from China to Europe and, of course, here in North America. That is perhaps the most important metric that I will speak to you on this call because it is bestowed upon us by the consumers that we serve and it must be earned. NIKE's brand leadership with consumers is fueled by our authentic and relentless obsession with bringing inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.
In fiscal year '16, we brought that to life by executing our category offense like never before, and that drove strong double-digit growth on a currency-neutral basis. We execute our offense through 3 primary dimensions: brand, product and marketplace.
As Mark and Trevor noted, from a brand perspective, we are more deeply connecting with and inspiring consumers, leveraging the most iconic moments in sports. And from a product perspective, our groundbreaking, innovative footwear and apparel is enabling the world's best athletes to perform at unprecedented levels and make history in those moments.
We then bring those innovative products to our billions of consumers around the world from the LeBron Soldier 10 and the KYRIE 2 to the LunarEpic in Running to Cristiano Ronaldo's Mercurial Superfly CR7 boot. 
At NIKE, we always start with performance innovation. But what's even more is how we are redefining sports culture and leading a global shift in how people express themselves at work and at play. We do that by bringing what Mark referred to as sports style innovation to NIKE's unrivaled portfolio of iconic products such as the Air Force 1, Cortez and Huarache, as well as to the creation of new icons like the Roshe and Air Max Thea, and instant classics from performance like KOBE signature product and the Flyknit Racer. That is something that only NIKE can do on such a global scale, as evidenced by 22% currency-neutral growth in NIKE Sportswear, our largest category.
While brand and product fuel our growth, we capture that growth in the marketplace. Globally, consumer demand for athletic footwear and apparel is outpacing broader consumption. At the same time, the retail landscape is rapidly evolving. For other brands, the speed of change in retail may be challenging and create uncertainty. But at NIKE, we have always believed that the best way to predict the future is to create it. That's why, as we shared in our Investor Day last October, we have been leading a transformation of the marketplace, not simply reacting to trends. Over the past year, we made significant investments in NIKE.com, and the results have been extraordinary. NIKE.com grew double to triple digits in all 6 of our geographies led by Greater China, as we made great progress toward our goal of $7 billion in revenue by 2020. We are also investing to more seamlessly integrate digital and physical retail and working more strategically with our strongest wholesale partners to shape the future of retail.
Our brand, product and marketplace strategies underscore NIKE's relentless focus on creating extraordinary value for consumers. And that allows us to continue delivering sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth and value creation for shareholders.
In fiscal year '16, we once again delivered strong top line growth, growing revenue 12% on a currency-neutral basis. We also expanded profitability, growing earnings per share by 17%, outpacing our midteens goal despite significant FX headwinds. And we delivered returns on invested capital of 29.7%, up 160 basis points versus the prior year.
That powerful combination of growth, expanding profitability and strong returns is what sets NIKE apart in terms of shareholder value creation. And while there were areas in which we did not execute as precisely as we had planned in fiscal year '16, those areas now represent opportunities to further elevate our game and deliver growth in fiscal year '17. But before I share plans for fiscal year '17, let's first reflect on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal year '16 financial results in a bit more detail.
NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue increased 6%, up 9% on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 6% to $32.4 billion, up 12% on a currency-neutral basis. All of our international geographies grew double digits, with North America growing at a high single-digit rate, in line with our long-term targeted rate of growth for that geography. NIKE Brand futures orders reflect continued strong demand across our global portfolio, growing 11% on a currency-neutral basis driven by a 4% increase in units, with increases in average selling price contributing 7 percentage points of growth. On a reported basis, futures grew 8%, reflecting the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies and, in particular, developing market currencies.
Fourth quarter diluted EPS was flat to prior year at $0.49. Full year diluted EPS grew 17% to $2.16 driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate.
Gross margin contracted 30 basis points in Q4 while expanding 20 basis points for the full year. For the quarter, margin contraction was driven primarily by inventory management in North America, higher labor cost and foreign exchange, which offset sustained increases in average selling price and the benefits of lower oil on materials cost.
Fourth quarter demand creation increased 7%. For the full year, demand creation increased 2% as we strategically invested in digital consumer engagement and sports marketing while gaining efficiencies in traditional advertising.
Operating overhead increased 7% for the quarter and 8% for the full year. This reflected cost associated with our fast-growing DTC business as well as strategic investments in consumer-facing digital capabilities and operational infrastructure. The effective tax rate for fiscal year '16 was 18.7%, 350 basis points lower than last year's rate, primarily due to a higher mix of non-U.S. earnings, which are generally subject a lower tax rate. As of May 31, inventories were up 12%, including a 6% increase in NIKE Brand wholesaling units, reflecting continued strong global demand.
Now let's turn to performance for a few of our largest operating segments. For the full year, North America revenue grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was led by Sportswear, Jordan and Running. Growth also reflected continued momentum in our DTC business led by NIKE.com growing at 39%. For the quarter, North America revenue growth on a reported basis was flat to the prior year due in part to an unfavorable comparison to the timing of shipments across Q3 and Q4 in fiscal year '15. Many of the orders planned for shipment in Q3 of fiscal year '15 were delayed due to the West Coast port congestion and instead shipped in Q4. Excluding the impact of this timing shift, we estimate Q4 fiscal year '16 North America revenue growth would have been in the mid-single-digit range.
North America EBIT increased 3% for the full year as revenue growth and full-price gross margin expansion were mostly offset by the lower off-price margin associated with clearing excess inventory.
As Trevor discussed, NIKE inventory in the full-price in-line channels in North America is now clean. And as reflected in our futures orders, we are also keeping in-line supply tight to ensure a strong pull market. Accordingly, we expect that North America revenue will return to growth in Q1, with growth accelerating over the balance of the fiscal year. North America's gross margin will contract in Q1 as we complete the clearance of excess inventory, with a return to gross margin expansion over the course of fiscal year '17.
Looking to Western Europe, where NIKE's portfolio of categories is becoming increasingly unrivaled, from Global Football to Running, to Sportswear, to Women's Training as well as fast-emerging categories such as Basketball and Jordan. In fiscal year '16, every category delivered growth, resulting in double-digit growth in every territory. As a result, Western Europe revenue grew to nearly $6 billion, up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. For the quarter, currency-neutral revenue grew 19% led by Sportswear and Global Football as we approached the European championships. On a reported basis, fiscal year '16 revenue increased 3%, reflecting FX headwinds, while EBIT expanded 12% driven by SG&A leverage.
In our emerging markets geography, our brand momentum continues to build and we created healthy pull markets. On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal year '16 revenue increased 13%, led by Soco, Mexico and Pacific, fueled by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Jordan and Women's Training. Revenue in Brazil declined due to the challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our brand is strong in Brazil, our inventories are healthy and we continue to take share.
For Q4, currency-neutral revenue was up 12%, with double-digit growth in Soco, Korea, Pacific, Mexico and Africa. On a reported basis, fiscal year '16 revenue and EBIT were heavily impacted by the significant FX headwinds throughout the geography. As a result, fiscal year '16 reported revenue decreased 5% while EBIT increased 9%, reflecting gross margin expansion.
Fiscal year '16 was another exceptional year for NIKE in Greater China, with currency-neutral revenue growing 27%. China continues to be one of the world's largest and fastest-growing markets in terms of consumption. And NIKE is unequivocally the leading brand in China as we continue to fuel the Chinese consumer's passion for sport. Our category assortments tailored for the Chinese consumer continue to drive growth and increasing productivity and profitability for both our DTC businesses, led by NIKE.com, and our wholesale partners. Nearly all categories grew in fiscal year '16 led by Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and Jordan. For the quarter, currency-neutral revenue grew 23% with double-digit growth in both footwear and apparel, in both DTC and wholesale and across nearly all key categories. On a reported basis, fiscal year '16 revenue is up 23% and EBIT expanded 38%. In addition to tremendous revenue growth, China delivered strong gross margin expansion and highly leveraged SG&A.
In fiscal year '16, NIKE once again delivered another year of strong financial performance. While we are in an increasingly dynamic macro environment, particularly with respect to foreign currencies, our outlook for fiscal year '17 is largely in line with the high-level guidance that we shared last quarter. Specifically for fiscal year '17, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting high single-digit to low double-digit growth on a currency-neutral basis. Our rate of reported revenue growth will be more heavily impacted by FX headwinds in the first half of fiscal year '17, primarily due to developing market currencies. For Q1, we expect mid-single-digit reported revenue growth, roughly 3 points below our reported rate of futures growth.
We expect gross margin for the full year to expand by 30 to 50 basis points, in line with our long-term financial model guardrails. This reflects higher average selling prices, ongoing manufacturing productivity initiatives and continued strong growth in our NIKE.com business as well as the favorable impact of lower oil on materials cost. However, these benefits will be partially offset by continued labor cost inflation and FX headwinds.
For Q1, we expect gross margin to decline approximately 100 basis points driven primarily by FX headwinds, including year-over-year changes in our hedge rates. For total SG&A, we expect full year growth in the high single-digit range, in line with our reported fiscal year '17 revenue guidance.
For Q1, we expect mid to high teens SG&A growth, significantly higher than the full year rate as we make strategic investments in demand creation around key sporting events such as the Olympics and the European Football Championships. We expect other income to be approximately $20 million to $30 million on average for each quarter. For fiscal year '17, we expect the effective tax rate will be between 19% and 21%.
As we look ahead to fiscal year '17, NIKE is the leading brand in every major market, we have the most talented teams, we have strong momentum across our diverse global portfolio of businesses and we are on the offense as always.
And now, we'll open up the call for your questions."

And also, our Jordan -- because it's a portfolio of performance and Sportswear and also the Jordan business, that has also continued to help to drive our business.

When you reflect on the fourth quarter for North America, I think it is important to note what I mentioned, which is that the flat revenue growth was really more so a result of comparisons to prior year. We continue to see strong underlying momentum in the fundamentals that drive our growth and profitability, as you see in our futures orders, our futures orders are reflective of some of that. Dimensions, leading indicators in terms of consumers' demand for the NIKE Brand such as NIKE.com, grew 39% as I mentioned over the full year and actually north of 40% in Q4, so accelerated to some extent. So we continue to feel great about where we're going in terms of the transformation of our marketplace including through NIKE.com as well as through the relationship with our strategic wholesale partners and, obviously, how those dimensions capture growth relates back to the strong pipeline of product that Trevor and Mark touched on that we feel great about and are bringing to market currently."

We really have viewed that as a factor of the innovation we're bringing and creating increasingly premium value for consumers, running a more complete offense, bringing premium value at every price point versus trading within price points. And then, frankly, one of the things we've been very focused on, as we've discussed, is really that supply-and-demand management.

And so again, we continue to monitor it very carefully, and our pricing strategy always reflects our ability to adjust as we think appropriately.

But we have shifted from plans and pilot programs to more proliferation of automation in our manufacturing in Asia, as well as we've actually begun production on in-line Running product with Flex.

But the good news for us is that we're really well equipped with a very diverse portfolio that goes from clean, classic, authentic styles like the Air Force 1, for example, or the Jordan style. Then we have modern classics on top of that where we bring new innovation into some of those classic styles. New modern performance shoes as well like the LeBron, the KD, the KYRIE, these are all very strong products for us. Particularly, with what's coming in the pipeline, we feel with the recent launches of KD and the upcoming KYRIE and, certainly, the LeBron shoe that we really feel like we're striking that right balance between performance innovation and product that really works well for everyday lifestyle.

Fiscal year '16 was a strong year for NIKE. Let's take a look at the highlights.NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 6% to $32.4 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew",1335,"Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Fiscal year '16 was a strong year for NIKE. Let's take a look at the highlights.
NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 6% to $32.4 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 12%. Gross margin expanded 20 basis points to 46.2%. Earnings per share rose 17% to $2.16. And we delivered ROIC of 29.7%.
Year-end is when we reflect on our successes over the last 12 months, and I'm proud to say that there were many for NIKE. But more importantly, this is a key moment to look ahead, to focus on the opportunities in front of us. We just kicked off an amazing summer of sport. LeBron, Kyrie and the Cavs made basketball history of going back from an unprecedented 3-to-1 deficit in the finals to win the NBA championship. It was a total team effort to be sure, but the storyline of LeBron bringing a championship back to his hometown, Cleveland, will be down as one of the greatest in recent history.
In Global Football, we saw a monumental win for Chile taking the Copa América title for the second time in a row. In the European championships, after some remarkable moments, we're now down to the final 8. And we can't wait for Rio to watch the best athletes in the world under the brightest lights.
As you know, the backdrop of our business is more dynamic than it's ever been. But NIKE wins because we just don't adapt to these forces, we create and shape the change. We lead. For example, we're all seeing the growing power of sport. Participation is increasing all over the world. People are leading healthier, more active lives. At the same time, the rise in sport culture is bringing fitness and style together profoundly influencing what we all wear every day. It's clear our Amplify category offense is a model that works. We're growing the business across the entire lifestyle of sports from performance to sportswear.
And in retail, our industry is in the early stages of unprecedented transformation. Mobile innovation and personal services are dominating the landscape. That's why we invest in integrating digital and physical retail seamlessly, giving our consumers better access to the products they want. And while we're working even closer with our best wholesale partners, we share our vision for the future of retail.
Manufacturing, too, is undergoing its own revolution. We're rethinking the fundamentals across our business in how we make products, how fast we deliver them and what kind of impact they leave behind. With other innovators like Flex or HP, we're deploying projects across our source base to reduce cost and delivery time, improve quality, explore customization and enhance performance. As the global leader, this is what we do. Through the power of sport, the transformation of our industry and the shifts in consumer preferences and expectations, we build a foundation for tremendous long-term growth for NIKE.
In the near term, we know there are certain areas where we have work to do, but nobody is more demanding of our business than we are internally. And while outside of NIKE we face macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility, our complete offense gives us our greatest competitive advantage. It's how we drive profitable, sustainable growth in the near and long term.
The complete offense puts the consumer at the center of our business aligned by sport in the most important markets across multiple channels. This diversity is unique to NIKE, and it's our competitive strength. We have the ability to leverage our portfolio and dial up or dial down the many dimensions of our business depending on the need. And in fiscal year '16, we did just that, putting a special focus on the areas that will make the biggest impact in the years ahead: performance innovation, sports style innovation and digital.
Let's start with performance innovation, with just a few of the highlights. The LunarEpic Flyknit, a revolutionary mid-height running shoe; Free RN Motion, with our most natural ride ever; the KOBE 11, a low-top that pushes what's possible with Flyknit; the KYRIE 2, a shoe to match the speed and cutting of Kyrie; the Mercurial Superfly 5, our fastest football boot ever; adaptive lacing, our first step into personalized performance; our anti-clog traction system, which prevents the age-old problem of mud sticking to cleats; Therma-Sphere Max, which regulates temperature and cold-weather; and our Vapor kits with AeroSwift technology, the lightest, fastest and most sustainable football kits ever. These are just a few of the highlights to show the breadth and depth of what NIKE delivers over the course of the year. Heading into fiscal year '17, we have a full pipeline of innovation on the way. We've never delivered such relentless flow of breakthrough products across all sports. What you saw in March is just beginning to deliver to consumers and will continue throughout the year.
Now while our innovative products change the rules of performance, they also create a new esthetic, a new look. NIKE has a way of inspiring an athlete even before they've laced up their shoes. And as athletes have always told us, when they look faster and stronger, they play better. We know that creating an emotional connection through product doesn't just happen by accident. It takes a steady flow of investment, inspiration and talent. Time and again, the consumer votes for NIKE because we represent authenticity and thoughtful storytelling. We obsess finishing and materials and color, and we understand the power for both function and form. At the same time, we bring performance benefits to Sportswear, what we call sports style innovation. We deliver lightweight, breathability and comfort to products for everyday life, and it drives a significant business for NIKE. We see great potential for innovation and growth ahead with Sportswear.
Finally, I'll turn to digital services and experiences. More than any year before it, fiscal '16 saw NIKE deepen our commitment to serving athletes personally at scale. And that means more in-person experiences through one-to-one appointments at retail or support through run clubs and training sessions. And of course, it also means leveraging the power of our family of apps. This quarter, the new Nike+ app is in beta testing with a select audience as we prepare for the full launch later this summer. So far we've received very positive feedback on its simplicity and tailored features. We're excited about the enormous potential for Nike+ to unite our digital platform and deliver personalized performance at tremendous scale through products, coachings and experiences.
The investments we make in mobile and online experiences are paying off, with our NIKE.com business growing 46% in fiscal '16. And we've continued to expand our global reach, with NIKE.com going live in 20 new countries this year, now totaling over 40 markets around the world. We're still in the early stages of digital services, but we continue to show that building meaningful relationships with consumers drives growth and strengthens our brand in unlimited ways.
So how will NIKE continue to lead in fiscal '17? Within our complete offense, where do we see the greatest opportunities for growth? Our focus will be to continue to drive our potential across North America and Western Europe; to expand our leadership in China and across our emerging markets; to unleash the power of the Jordan Brand across multiple categories; to accelerate our complete Women's business; and to grow the young athletes business globally through premium products; and extend our leading position in Running, Basketball and Sportswear.
And specifically, how will we get there? We invest in the transformation of the marketplace through NIKE.com and stronger executions with our best wholesale partners. We turn the energy of style and performance into long-term business momentum, and we drive a continuous cycle of innovation.
We've never seen as much opportunity as we do today, and I've never been more confident in the future NIKE is creating. With that, I'll turn it over to Trevor."
291981,346738414,1003091,"NIKE, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2016",2016-06-28,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. I feel great about the results we delivered for the year, once again illustrating the power of the NIKE Brand portfolio from our geographies and categories, from wholesale to DTC and across men's, women's and young Athletes. In fiscal year '",1758,"Thanks, Mark. I feel great about the results we delivered for the year, once again illustrating the power of the NIKE Brand portfolio from our geographies and categories, from wholesale to DTC and across men's, women's and young Athletes. In fiscal year '16, NIKE proved, yet again, that the diversity of our business is one of our greatest competitive advantages. Let's take a look at the numbers.
On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 8% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 13%, with double-digit growth in nearly all geographies. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 23% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 25% driven by online growth of 51%, new stores and comp store growth of 10%. And finally, global futures are up 11%.
The growth throughout fiscal year '16 is a direct result of the deep relationships we have built with consumers. Our relentless focus on individual athletes around the world bolsters those connections year in and year out. Whether at retail, online or at live experiences, NIKE's unique ability to serve the global consumer through the lens of their favorite sport is what drives such consistent growth for the NIKE Brand. To see this growth in action, let's take a look at a few of our key categories.
In Running, we delivered 10% growth for the year, with the category reaching $5.3 billion in revenue on a constant currency basis. Contributing to this growth was our Pegasus franchise and statement apparel, including the Dri-FIT cool top, the AeroSwift short and the Power Speed tight. Q4 was also highlighted by key innovative footwear launches led by the LunarEpic, a disruptive style that offers an amazingly smooth ride and a remarkable sock-like fit. Excitement is building for the LunarEpic Mid and the LunarEpic Low which will launch in a couple of days.
We also extended our NIKE Free platform with the launch of the Free Run, the Free 1 Flyknit and the Free RN Motion, which saw a strong sell-through for both men and women. At the same time, there was incredible momentum with our NIKE-inspired Sportswear in Q4. This was highlighted by our global activation of the Air Max Day, where we engaged hundreds of millions of consumers, creating massive scale and impact. By celebrating classic silhouettes and updating them with new technologies, prints and patterns, we fuel the culture of sneakers around the world.
Finally, Q4 underscored the success of our Running-inspired apparel. Our NIKE Tech Hypermesh line, including the Windrunner and the Bomber, saw strong sell-through, thanks to its extra-light ventilated fabric that keeps athletes warm as the weather changes. By taking an iconic product and remixing it with groundbreaking innovation, the Hypermesh Windrunner is the perfect embodiment of how NIKE drives leadership in sportswear.
Next, let's take a look at Basketball, which is increasingly its own portfolio with NIKE Basketball, NIKE Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. No matter the landscape, this complete offense is our foundation that keeps us well positioned to always inspire and serve basketball fans across the globe through innovative products at both performance and sportswear. As Mark said, we are thrilled for LeBron, Kyrie and the rest of the Cavs team for bringing home a championship for Cleveland. LeBron's MVP performance, in which he was the first player in the NBA history to lead all players in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks for an entire finals, that won't to be forgotten soon. And consumers have responded. The shoe he wore in the finals, the LeBron Soldier 10 has seen incredible sell-through in the week since it was released.
And, of course, Kyrie, who hit the series-winning shot in game 7, continued to cement his place as one of the game's best players and a fan favorite. The KYRIE 2 has seen strong sell-through across multiple color waves, and we are excited about the future of the KYRIE signature line.
And I'd be remiss if I didn't also give a shout out to Kevin Durant, who had an amazing playoff himself. The initial launch last week of the KD9 with its Flyknit Upper atop a full Zoom airbag, sold out completely.
In Jordan footwear, we see continued momentum as the Air Jordan 30 and the Jordan Ultra.Fly drive excitement in the U.S. and around the world. And on the Sportswear side, the Air Jordan Retro 12, celebrating Jordan's epic playoff performance in 1997, was one of the largest launches in the quarter. Also incredibly successful was the launch of the Air Force 1 Flyknit low, which weighs 50% less than the original, thanks to an all-new, ultra-breathable NIKE Flyknit upper.
Before I close Basketball, I have to mention an unforgettable moment from the quarter. LeBron's last game were one of the game's greatest, went out in storybook style with 60 points and a dominant final stretch. The KOBE 11 Mamba Day iD shoe was the most successful ID launch ever, with incredible demand in North America and Greater China. While the end of Kobe's playing career closes one chapter, we are excited for what the future holds for Kobe and NIKE together. Ultimately, no brand can provide what we bring to the sport of basketball: the power of performance and sportswear, true global reach, the world's best roster of athletes and an incredible pipeline of products to come over the next year and beyond.
Finally, to appreciate how our entire portfolio of categories comes to life, let's take a look at a key growth driver for us, our Sportswear category. NIKE Sportswear takes the lifestyle of sport and amplifies it across all our performance categories. For the year, Sportswear grew 22% and reached $8.1 billion, adding nearly $1.5 billion in revenue in this category alone. Our strong Sportswear category puts us in a unique position to fuel passion for sport around the world from the Roshe, to the Huarache, to the Foamposite and to many more. We have the innovative and stylish products that consumers continue to love. While consumer preferences can shift over time, no brand is better positioned to serve the consumer across our globally diversified portfolio from performance to lifestyle through our category Amplify offense. This is the unique power of the NIKE Brand.
Let's now turn to a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered strong growth for the year, with revenues up 8% driven by Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. We continue to work more closely with our key wholesale partners such as DICK'S Sporting Goods and the Foot Locker, to deliver compelling retail experiences for our consumers. And our DTC business also had another strong year, up 17%, including ongoing strength in NIKE.com.
For Q4, North America revenue was flat to prior year due to timing shifts related to delayed deliveries in fiscal year '15 from the West Coast port congestion. As of the end of Q4, inventory levels in our full-price in-line channels are clean, consistent with the goal we shared last quarter.
Looking ahead to Q1, we will continue to clear excess inventory through our factory stores and select third-party value channels. At the same time, we remain focused on sustaining a healthy pull market in the in-line channel, and we are proactively managing the flow of products into the marketplace with a focus on new, innovative products for our consumers.
As always, we continue to focus on serving the consumer in this critical geography. With our brand proven time and time again, it remains incredibly strong in North America. We are confident that the actions we are taking will ensure that we are set up to deliver long-term, profitable growth.
Now let's turn to Western Europe where we're seeing broad-based demand with growth of 19% in the quarter and 14% for the year. Growth in the quarter and throughout the year was fueled by our continued efforts to transform the marketplace along the category offense. In Q4, all territories grew double digits and all key categories grew led by Sportswear, Global Football, Jordan Brand and Running. And our DTC business continues to perform well, growing 26% in the quarter.
In Q4, we also extended our partnership with one of the world's most storied football clubs, FC Barcelona. And with the European championships currently in force, we are excited about our line of national team fits [ph], which offer groundbreaking performance innovations such as engineered knit zones to enhance fit and breathability. The momentum we have seen in fiscal '16 in Western Europe, combined with the strength of the NIKE Brand, reinforces our view that there is tremendous growth potential in this geography. Our focus on the consumer will continue to build on that momentum as we head into the fiscal year '17 and beyond.
And finally, in Greater China, we had a truly incredible year. Q4 revenue grew 23%, and we posted full year growth of 27%, with strong growth in nearly every category and across footwear and apparel. Full year growth was driven primarily by Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand. In DTC, we saw growth of 44%, with continued strong growth online as well as in our stores. For our wholesale partners stores that have been reprofiled, they continue to outperform the rest of the fleet.
As we continue to transform the marketplace, we are starting to reach scale with our doors that we reprofiled along the category offense. We work with our partners to tailor everything from concept to environment, from assortment to service and throughout the must-win trade zones to deliver the best experience for our consumers. A great example of this is the opening of our Running door in Chengdu, a new concept in the marketplace that we plan to scale. This door significantly exceeded our expectations within the first few weeks, further illustrating how consumers respond when you relentlessly obsess serving the athlete. 
Ultimately, we get to close out of our fiscal year and start a new one in the best possible way with the Summer Olympics. I can't wait for August and how powerful a moment it will be around the globe. The power of the world's greatest athletes coming together, the power of the reveal of the world's most innovative products and the power of connecting with consumers in even more personal ways to celebrate their passion and love for sport. It's the kind of global experience that promises to further accelerate our momentum, and it makes me incredibly excited about what's in store.
Thanks, and here's Andy."
291981,346738414,1003091,"NIKE, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2016",2016-06-28,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call. As we close fiscal year '16, NIKE is better positioned than ever to continue delivering strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital. While we a",2089,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call. As we close fiscal year '16, NIKE is better positioned than ever to continue delivering strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital. While we are in an increasingly dynamic macroeconomic environment, we have a management team with experience and a proven track record of working all of the levers within our business to deliver strong financial performance under a wide range of circumstances. Even more importantly, NIKE is the #1-rated brand by consumers in every major market and every key city around the world from China to Europe and, of course, here in North America. That is perhaps the most important metric that I will speak to you on this call because it is bestowed upon us by the consumers that we serve and it must be earned. NIKE's brand leadership with consumers is fueled by our authentic and relentless obsession with bringing inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.
In fiscal year '16, we brought that to life by executing our category offense like never before, and that drove strong double-digit growth on a currency-neutral basis. We execute our offense through 3 primary dimensions: brand, product and marketplace.
As Mark and Trevor noted, from a brand perspective, we are more deeply connecting with and inspiring consumers, leveraging the most iconic moments in sport. And from a product perspective, our groundbreaking, innovative footwear and apparel is enabling the world's best athletes to perform at unprecedented levels and make history in those moments.
We then bring those innovative products to our billions of consumers around the world from the LeBron Soldier 10 and the KYRIE 2 to the LunarEpic in Running to Cristiano Ronaldo's Mercurial Superfly CR7 boot. 
At NIKE, we always start with performance innovation. But what's even more is how we are redefining sports culture and leading a global shift in how people express themselves at work and at play. We do that by bringing what Mark referred to as sports style innovation to NIKE's unrivaled portfolio of iconic products such as the Air Force 1, Cortez and Huarache, as well as to the creation of new icons like the Roshe and Air Max Thea, and instant classics from performance like KOBE signature product and the Flyknit Racer. That is something that only NIKE can do on such a global scale, as evidenced by 22% currency-neutral growth in NIKE Sportswear, our largest category.
While brand and product fuel our growth, we capture that growth in the marketplace. Globally, consumer demand for athletic footwear and apparel is outpacing broader consumption. At the same time, the retail landscape is rapidly evolving. For other brands, the speed of change in retail may be challenging and create uncertainty. But at NIKE, we have always believed that the best way to predict the future is to create it. That's why, as we shared in our Investor Day last October, we have been leading a transformation of the marketplace, not simply reacting to trends. Over the past year, we made significant investments in NIKE.com, and the results have been extraordinary. NIKE.com grew double to triple digits in all 6 of our geographies led by Greater China, as we made great progress toward our goal of $7 billion in revenue by 2020. We are also investing to more seamlessly integrate digital and physical retail and working more strategically with our strongest wholesale partners to shape the future of retail.
Our brand, product and marketplace strategies underscore NIKE's relentless focus on creating extraordinary value for consumers. And that allows us to continue delivering sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth and value creation for shareholders.
In fiscal year '16, we once again delivered strong top line growth, growing revenue 12% on a currency-neutral basis. We also expanded profitability, growing earnings per share by 17%, outpacing our midteens goal despite significant FX headwinds. And we delivered returns on invested capital of 29.7%, up 160 basis points versus the prior year.
That powerful combination of growth, expanding profitability and strong returns is what sets NIKE apart in terms of shareholder value creation. And while there were areas in which we did not execute as precisely as we had planned in fiscal year '16, those areas now represent opportunities to further elevate our game and deliver growth in fiscal year '17. But before I share plans for fiscal year '17, let's first reflect on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal year '16 financial results in a bit more detail.
NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue increased 6%, up 9% on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 6% to $32.4 billion, up 12% on a currency-neutral basis. All of our international geographies grew double digits, with North America growing at a high single-digit rate, in line with our long-term targeted rate of growth for that geography. NIKE Brand futures orders reflect continued strong demand across our global portfolio, growing 11% on a currency-neutral basis driven by a 4% increase in units, with increases in average selling price contributing 7 percentage points of growth. On a reported basis, futures grew 8%, reflecting the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies and, in particular, developing market currencies.
Fourth quarter diluted EPS was flat to prior year at $0.49. Full year diluted EPS grew 17% to $2.16 driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate.
Gross margin contracted 30 basis points in Q4 while expanding 20 basis points for the full year. For the quarter, margin contraction was driven primarily by inventory management in North America, higher labor cost and foreign exchange, which offset sustained increases in average selling price and the benefits of lower oil on materials cost.
Fourth quarter demand creation increased 7%. For the full year, demand creation increased 2% as we strategically invested in digital consumer engagement and sports marketing while gaining efficiencies in traditional advertising.
Operating overhead increased 7% for the quarter and 8% for the full year. This reflected cost associated with our fast-growing DTC business as well as strategic investments in consumer-facing digital capabilities and operational infrastructure. The effective tax rate for fiscal year '16 was 18.7%, 350 basis points lower than last year's rate, primarily due to a higher mix of non-U.S. earnings, which are generally subject a lower tax rate. As of May 31, inventories were up 12%, including a 6% increase in NIKE Brand wholesaling units, reflecting continued strong global demand.
Now let's turn to performance for a few of our largest operating segments. For the full year, North America revenue grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was led by Sportswear, Jordan and Running. Growth also reflected continued momentum in our DTC business led by NIKE.com growing at 39%. For the quarter, North America revenue growth on a reported basis was flat to the prior year due in part to an unfavorable comparison to the timing of shipments across Q3 and Q4 in fiscal year '15. Many of the orders planned for shipment in Q3 of fiscal year '15 were delayed due to the West Coast port congestion and instead shipped in Q4. Excluding the impact of this timing shift, we estimate Q4 fiscal year '16 North America revenue growth would have been in the mid-single-digit range.
North America EBIT increased 3% for the full year as revenue growth and full-price gross margin expansion were mostly offset by the lower off-price margin associated with clearing excess inventory.
As Trevor discussed, NIKE inventory in the full-price in-line channels in North America is now clean. And as reflected in our futures orders, we are also keeping in-line supply tight to ensure a strong pull market. Accordingly, we expect that North America revenue will return to growth in Q1, with growth accelerating over the balance of the fiscal year. North America's gross margin will contract in Q1 as we complete the clearance of excess inventory, with a return to gross margin expansion over the course of fiscal year '17.
Looking to Western Europe, where NIKE's portfolio of categories is becoming increasingly unrivaled, from Global Football to Running, to Sportswear, to Women's Training as well as fast-emerging categories such as Basketball and Jordan. In fiscal year '16, every category delivered growth, resulting in double-digit growth in every territory. As a result, Western Europe revenue grew to nearly $6 billion, up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. For the quarter, currency-neutral revenue grew 19% led by Sportswear and Global Football as we approached the European championships. On a reported basis, fiscal year '16 revenue increased 3%, reflecting FX headwinds, while EBIT expanded 12% driven by SG&A leverage.
In our emerging markets geography, our brand momentum continues to build and we've created healthy pull markets. On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal year '16 revenue increased 13%, led by Soco, Mexico and Pacific, fueled by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Jordan and Women's Training. Revenue in Brazil declined due to the challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our brand is strong in Brazil, our inventories are healthy and we continue to take share.
For Q4, currency-neutral revenue was up 12%, with double-digit growth in Soco, Korea, Pacific, Mexico and Africa. On a reported basis, fiscal year '16 revenue and EBIT were heavily impacted by the significant FX headwinds throughout the geography. As a result, fiscal year '16 reported revenue decreased 5% while EBIT increased 9%, reflecting gross margin expansion.
Fiscal year '16 was another exceptional year for NIKE in Greater China, with currency-neutral revenue growing 27%. China continues to be one of the world's largest and fastest-growing markets in terms of consumption. And NIKE is unequivocally the leading brand in China as we continue to fuel the Chinese consumer's passion for sport. Our category assortments tailored for the Chinese consumer continue to drive growth and increasing productivity and profitability for both our DTC businesses, led by NIKE.com, and our wholesale partners. Nearly all categories grew in fiscal year '16 led by Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and Jordan. For the quarter, currency-neutral revenue grew 23% with double-digit growth in both footwear and apparel, in both DTC and wholesale and across nearly all key categories. On a reported basis, fiscal year '16 revenue is up 23% and EBIT expanded 38%. In addition to tremendous revenue growth, China delivered strong gross margin expansion and highly leveraged SG&A.
In fiscal year '16, NIKE once again delivered another year of strong financial performance. While we are in an increasingly dynamic macro environment, particularly with respect to foreign currencies, our outlook for fiscal year '17 is largely in line with the high-level guidance that we shared last quarter. Specifically for fiscal year '17, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting high single-digit to low double-digit growth on a currency-neutral basis. Our rate of reported revenue growth will be more heavily impacted by FX headwinds in the first half of fiscal year '17, primarily due to developing market currencies. For Q1, we expect mid-single-digit reported revenue growth, roughly 3 points below our reported rate of futures growth.
We expect gross margin for the full year to expand by 30 to 50 basis points, in line with our long-term financial model guardrails. This reflects higher average selling prices, ongoing manufacturing productivity initiatives and continued strong growth in our NIKE.com business as well as the favorable impact of lower oil on materials cost. However, these benefits will be partially offset by continued labor cost inflation and FX headwinds.
For Q1, we expect gross margin to decline approximately 100 basis points driven primarily by FX headwinds, including year-over-year changes in our hedge rates. For total SG&A, we expect full year growth in the high single-digit range, in line with our reported fiscal year '17 revenue guidance.
For Q1, we expect mid to high teens SG&A growth, significantly higher than the full year rate as we make strategic investments in demand creation around key sporting events such as the Olympics and the European Football Championships. We expect other income to be approximately $20 million to $30 million on average for each quarter. For fiscal year '17, we expect the effective tax rate will be between 19% and 21%.
As we look ahead to fiscal year '17, NIKE is the leading brand in every major market, we have the most talented teams, we have strong momentum across our diverse global portfolio of businesses and we are on the offense as always.
And now, we'll open up the call for your questions."

When you reflect on the fourth quarter for North America, I think it is important to note what I mentioned, which is that the flat revenue growth was really more so a result of comparisons to prior year. We continue to see strong underlying momentum in the fundamentals that drive our growth and profitability, as you see in our futures orders, our futures orders are reflective of some of that. Dimensions, leading indicators in terms of consumers' demand for the NIKE Brand such as NIKE.com, grew 39% as I mentioned over the full year and actually north of 40% in Q4, so accelerated to some extent. So we continue to feel great about where we're going in terms of the transformation of our marketplace including through NIKE.com as well as through the relationship with our strategic wholesale partners and, obviously, how those dimensions capture growth relates back to the strong pipeline of product that Trevor and Mark touched on that we feel great about and are bringing to market currently."

Going forward, we continue to feel very strong about the marketplace. The consumer demand in the marketplace and the consumers' connection with the brand continues to be very strong. And we feel confident about the pipeline of products that we have coming through. And as I touched on Basketball, that's a key area where we continue to see just great energy in North America, and we're looking forward to actually the products that are coming through and how they will sell through and connect with our consumers."

As I touched on, in our futures, we're actually seeing 7 percentage points of the growth coming from average gross selling price increases. Now that's obviously an aggregated number. Average gross selling price continues to expand -- full-price average gross selling price in the mid-single-digits in North America. We really have viewed that as a factor of the innovation we're bringing and creating increasingly premium value for consumers, running a more complete offense, bringing premium value at every price point versus trading within price points. And then, frankly, one of the things we've been very focused on, as we've discussed, is really that supply-and-demand management. At the intersection of those is merchandising with assortments that are increasingly selling through at full-price."

And certainly, the strength of the brand and the ability of some of the technologies that we bring allow us the opportunity to charge the premium price. And we're certainly seeing strong take-up from that from our consumers. So if you look across the categories from Sportswear to Basketball to Running, we're certainly seeing the consumer have really strong appetite for those products. You could take the KOBE 11 as a great example of when you give the right value to that consumer, they're clearly willing to pay the price. And so again, we continue to monitor it very carefully, and our pricing strategy always reflects our ability to adjust as we think appropriately. But certainly, we feel that the pricing continues to be a strong opportunity for the brand."

So that would be our manufacturing initiatives, which are beginning to have an impact. We saw an impact from those in fiscal year '16 that's increasingly material. Obviously, our long-term perspective is where we're most bullish. But we have shifted from plans and pilot programs to more proliferation of automation in our manufacturing in Asia, as well as we've actually begun production on in-line Running product with Flex.

It's not so much a shift from one end of the spectrum to the other but more of a shift by style preferences across that spectrum. But the good news for us is that we're really well equipped with a very diverse portfolio that goes from clean, classic, authentic styles like the Air Force 1, for example, or the Jordan style. Then we have modern classics on top of that where we bring new innovation into some of those classic styles. New modern performance shoes as well like the LeBron, the KD, the KYRIE, these are all very strong products for us.

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results.

Fiscal year '16 was a strong year for NIKE. Let's take a look at the highlights.NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 6% to $32.4 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew",1335,"Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Fiscal year '16 was a strong year for NIKE. Let's take a look at the highlights.
NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 6% to $32.4 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 12%. Gross margin expanded 20 basis points to 46.2%. Earnings per share rose 17% to $2.16. And we delivered ROIC of 29.7%.
Year-end is when we reflect on our successes over the last 12 months, and I'm proud to say that there were many for NIKE. But more importantly, this is a key moment to look ahead, to focus on the opportunities in front of us. We just kicked off an amazing summer of sport. LeBron, Kyrie and the Cavs made basketball history of going back from an unprecedented 3-to-1 deficit in the finals to win the NBA championship. It was a total team effort to be sure, but the storyline of LeBron bringing a championship back to his hometown, Cleveland, will be down as one of the greatest in recent history.
In Global Football, we saw a monumental win for Chile taking the Copa América title for the second time in a row. In the European championships, after some remarkable moments, we're now down to the final 8. And we can't wait for Rio to watch the best athletes in the world under the brightest lights.
As you know, the backdrop of our business is more dynamic than it's ever been. But NIKE wins because we just don't adapt to these forces, we create and shape the change. We lead. For example, we're all seeing the growing power of sport. Participation is increasing all over the world. People are leading healthier, more active lives. At the same time, the rise in sport culture is bringing fitness and style together profoundly influencing what we all wear every day. It's clear our Amplify category offense is a model that works. We're growing the business across the entire lifestyle of sports from performance to sportswear.
And in retail, our industry is in the early stages of unprecedented transformation. Mobile innovation and personal services are dominating the landscape. That's why we invest in integrating digital and physical retail seamlessly, giving our consumers better access to the products they want. And while we're working even closer with our best wholesale partners, we share our vision for the future of retail.
Manufacturing, too, is undergoing its own revolution. We're rethinking the fundamentals across our business in how we make products, how fast we deliver them and what kind of impact they leave behind. With other innovators like Flex or HP, we're deploying projects across our source base to reduce cost and delivery time, improve quality, explore customization and enhance performance. As the global leader, this is what we do. Through the power of sport, the transformation of our industry and the shifts in consumer preferences and expectations, we build a foundation for tremendous long-term growth for NIKE.
In the near term, we know there are certain areas where we have work to do, but nobody is more demanding of our business than we are internally. And while outside of NIKE we face macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility, our complete offense gives us our greatest competitive advantage. It's how we drive profitable, sustainable growth in the near and long term.
The complete offense puts the consumer at the center of our business aligned by sport in the most important markets across multiple channels. This diversity is unique to NIKE, and it's our competitive strength. We have the ability to leverage our portfolio and dial up or dial down the many dimensions of our business depending on the need. And in fiscal year '16, we did just that, putting a special focus on the areas that will make the biggest impact in the years ahead: performance innovation, sports style innovation and digital.
Let's start with performance innovation, with just a few of the highlights. The LunarEpic Flyknit, a revolutionary mid-height running shoe; Free RN Motion, with our most natural ride ever; the KOBE 11, a low-top that pushes what's possible with Flyknit; the KYRIE 2, a shoe to match the speed and cutting of Kyrie; the Mercurial Superfly 5, our fastest football boot ever; adaptive lacing, our first step into personalized performance; our anti-clog traction system, which prevents the age-old problem of mud sticking to cleats; Therma-Sphere Max, which regulates temperature and cold-weather; and our Vapor kits with AeroSwift technology, the lightest, fastest and most sustainable football kits ever. These are just a few of the highlights to show the breadth and depth of what NIKE delivers over the course of the year. Heading into fiscal year '17, we have a full pipeline of innovation on the way. We've never delivered such relentless flow of breakthrough products across all sports. What you saw in March is just beginning to deliver to consumers and will continue throughout the year.
Now while our innovative products change the rules of performance, they also create a new esthetic, a new look. NIKE has a way of inspiring an athlete even before they've laced up their shoes. And as athletes have always told us, when they look faster and stronger, they play better. We know that creating an emotional connection through product doesn't just happen by accident. It takes a steady flow of investment, inspiration and talent. Time and again, the consumer votes for NIKE because we represent authenticity and thoughtful storytelling. We obsess finishing and materials and color, and we understand the power for both function and form. At the same time, we bring performance benefits to Sportswear, what we call sports style innovation. We deliver lightweight, breathability and comfort to products for everyday life, and it drives a significant business for NIKE. We see great potential for innovation and growth ahead with Sportswear.
Finally, I'll turn to digital services and experiences. More than any year before it, fiscal '16 saw NIKE deepen our commitment to serving athletes personally at scale. And that means more in-person experiences through one-to-one appointments at retail or support through run clubs and training sessions. And of course, it also means leveraging the power of our family of apps. This quarter, the new Nike+ app is in beta testing with a select audience as we prepare for the full launch later this summer. So far we've received very positive feedback on its simplicity and tailored features. We're excited about the enormous potential for Nike+ to unite our digital platform and deliver personalized performance at tremendous scale through products, coachings and experiences.
The investments we make in mobile and online experiences are paying off, with our NIKE.com business growing 46% in fiscal '16. And we've continued to expand our global reach, with NIKE.com going live in 20 new countries this year, now totaling over 40 markets around the world. We're still in the early stages of digital services, but we continue to show that building meaningful relationships with consumers drives growth and strengthens our brand in unlimited ways.
So how will NIKE continue to lead in fiscal '17? Within our complete offense, where do we see the greatest opportunities for growth? Our focus will be to continue to drive our potential across North America and Western Europe; to expand our leadership in China and across our emerging markets; to unleash the power of the Jordan Brand across multiple categories; to accelerate our complete Women's business; and to grow the young athletes business globally through premium products; and extend our leading position in Running, Basketball and Sportswear.
And specifically, how will we get there? We invest in the transformation of the marketplace through NIKE.com and stronger executions with our best wholesale partners. We turn the energy of style and performance into long-term business momentum, and we drive a continuous cycle of innovation.
We've never seen as much opportunity as we do today, and I've never been more confident in the future NIKE is creating. With that, I'll turn it over to Trevor."
291981,346738414,1003312,"NIKE, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2016",2016-06-28,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. I feel great about the results we delivered for the year, once again illustrating the power of the NIKE Brand portfolio from our geographies and categories, from wholesale to DTC and across men's, women's and young Athletes. In fiscal year '",1758,"Thanks, Mark. I feel great about the results we delivered for the year, once again illustrating the power of the NIKE Brand portfolio from our geographies and categories, from wholesale to DTC and across men's, women's and young Athletes. In fiscal year '16, NIKE proved, yet again, that the diversity of our business is one of our greatest competitive advantages. Let's take a look at the numbers.
On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 8% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 13%, with double-digit growth in nearly all geographies. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 23% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 25% driven by online growth of 51%, new stores and comp store growth of 10%. And finally, global futures are up 11%.
The growth throughout fiscal year '16 is a direct result of the deep relationships we have built with consumers. Our relentless focus on individual athletes around the world bolsters those connections year in and year out. Whether at retail, online or at live experiences, NIKE's unique ability to serve the global consumer through the lens of their favorite sport is what drives such consistent growth for the NIKE Brand. To see this growth in action, let's take a look at a few of our key categories.
In Running, we delivered 10% growth for the year, with the category reaching $5.3 billion in revenue on a constant currency basis. Contributing to this growth was our Pegasus franchise and statement apparel, including the Dri-FIT cool top, the AeroSwift short and the Power Speed tight. Q4 was also highlighted by key innovative footwear launches led by the LunarEpic, a disruptive style that offers an amazingly smooth ride and a remarkable sock-like fit. Excitement is building for the LunarEpic Mid and the LunarEpic Low which will launch in a couple of days.
We also extended our NIKE Free platform with the launch of the Free Run, the Free 1 Flyknit and the Free RN Motion, which saw a strong sell-through for both men and women. At the same time, there was incredible momentum with our NIKE-inspired Sportswear in Q4. This was highlighted by our global activation of the Air Max Day, where we engaged hundreds of millions of consumers, creating massive scale and impact. By celebrating classic silhouettes and updating them with new technologies, prints and patterns, we fuel the culture of sneakers around the world.
Finally, Q4 underscored the success of our Running-inspired apparel. Our NIKE Tech Hypermesh line, including the Windrunner and the Bomber, saw strong sell-through, thanks to its extra-light ventilated fabric that keeps athletes warm as the weather changes. By taking an iconic product and remixing it with groundbreaking innovation, the Hypermesh Windrunner is the perfect embodiment of how NIKE drives leadership in sportswear.
Next, let's take a look at Basketball, which is increasingly its own portfolio with NIKE Basketball, NIKE Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. No matter the landscape, this complete offense is our foundation that keeps us well positioned to always inspire and serve basketball fans across the globe through innovative products at both performance and sportswear. As Mark said, we are thrilled for LeBron, Kyrie and the rest of the Cavs team for bringing home a championship for Cleveland. LeBron's MVP performance, in which he was the first player in the NBA history to lead all players in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks for an entire finals, that won't to be forgotten soon. And consumers have responded. The shoe he wore in the finals, the LeBron Soldier 10 has seen incredible sell-through in the week since it was released.
And, of course, Kyrie, who hit the series-winning shot in game 7, continued to cement his place as one of the game's best players and a fan favorite. The KYRIE 2 has seen strong sell-through across multiple color waves, and we are excited about the future of the KYRIE signature line.
And I'd be remiss if I didn't also give a shout out to Kevin Durant, who had an amazing playoff himself. The initial launch last week of the KD9 with its Flyknit Upper atop a full Zoom airbag, sold out completely.
In Jordan footwear, we see continued momentum as the Air Jordan 30 and the Jordan Ultra.Fly drive excitement in the U.S. and around the world. And on the Sportswear side, the Air Jordan Retro 12, celebrating Jordan's epic playoff performance in 1997, was one of the largest launches in the quarter. Also incredibly successful was the launch of the Air Force 1 Flyknit low, which weighs 50% less than the original, thanks to an all-new, ultra-breathable NIKE Flyknit upper.
Before I close Basketball, I have to mention an unforgettable moment from the quarter. LeBron's last game were one of the game's greatest, went out in storybook style with 60 points and a dominant final stretch. The KOBE 11 Mamba Day iD shoe was the most successful ID launch ever, with incredible demand in North America and Greater China. While the end of Kobe's playing career closes one chapter, we are excited for what the future holds for Kobe and NIKE together. Ultimately, no brand can provide what we bring to the sport of basketball: the power of performance and sportswear, true global reach, the world's best roster of athletes and an incredible pipeline of products to come over the next year and beyond.
Finally, to appreciate how our entire portfolio of categories comes to life, let's take a look at a key growth driver for us, our Sportswear category. NIKE Sportswear takes the lifestyle of sport and amplifies it across all our performance categories. For the year, Sportswear grew 22% and reached $8.1 billion, adding nearly $1.5 billion in revenue in this category alone. Our strong Sportswear category puts us in a unique position to fuel passion for sport around the world from the Roshe, to the Huarache, to the Foamposite and to many more. We have the innovative and stylish products that consumers continue to love. While consumer preferences can shift over time, no brand is better positioned to serve the consumer across our globally diversified portfolio from performance to lifestyle through our category Amplify offense. This is the unique power of the NIKE Brand.
Let's now turn to a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered strong growth for the year, with revenues up 8% driven by Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. We continue to work more closely with our key wholesale partners such as DICK'S Sporting Goods and the Foot Locker, to deliver compelling retail experiences for our consumers. And our DTC business also had another strong year, up 17%, including ongoing strength in NIKE.com.
For Q4, North America revenue was flat to prior year due to timing shifts related to delayed deliveries in fiscal year '15 from the West Coast port congestion. As of the end of Q4, inventory levels in our full-price in-line channels are clean, consistent with the goal we shared last quarter.
Looking ahead to Q1, we will continue to clear excess inventory through our factory stores and select third-party value channels. At the same time, we remain focused on sustaining a healthy pull market in the in-line channel, and we are proactively managing the flow of products into the marketplace with a focus on new, innovative products for our consumers.
As always, we continue to focus on serving the consumer in this critical geography. With our brand proven time and time again, it remains incredibly strong in North America. We are confident that the actions we are taking will ensure that we are set up to deliver long-term, profitable growth.
Now let's turn to Western Europe where we're seeing broad-based demand with growth of 19% in the quarter and 14% for the year. Growth in the quarter and throughout the year was fueled by our continued efforts to transform the marketplace along the category offense. In Q4, all territories grew double digits and all key categories grew led by Sportswear, Global Football, Jordan Brand and Running. And our DTC business continues to perform well, growing 26% in the quarter.
In Q4, we also extended our partnership with one of the world's most storied football clubs, FC Barcelona. And with the European championships currently in force, we are excited about our line of national team fits [ph], which offer groundbreaking performance innovations such as engineered knit zones to enhance fit and breathability. The momentum we have seen in fiscal '16 in Western Europe, combined with the strength of the NIKE Brand, reinforces our view that there is tremendous growth potential in this geography. Our focus on the consumer will continue to build on that momentum as we head into the fiscal year '17 and beyond.
And finally, in Greater China, we had a truly incredible year. Q4 revenue grew 23%, and we posted full year growth of 27%, with strong growth in nearly every category and across footwear and apparel. Full year growth was driven primarily by Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand. In DTC, we saw growth of 44%, with continued strong growth online as well as in our stores. For our wholesale partners stores that have been reprofiled, they continue to outperform the rest of the fleet.
As we continue to transform the marketplace, we are starting to reach scale with our doors that we reprofiled along the category offense. We work with our partners to tailor everything from concept to environment, from assortment to service and throughout the must-win trade zones to deliver the best experience for our consumers. A great example of this is the opening of our Running door in Chengdu, a new concept in the marketplace that we plan to scale. This door significantly exceeded our expectations within the first few weeks, further illustrating how consumers respond when you relentlessly obsess serving the athlete. 
Ultimately, we get to close out of our fiscal year and start a new one in the best possible way with the Summer Olympics. I can't wait for August and how powerful a moment it will be around the globe. The power of the world's greatest athletes coming together, the power of the reveal of the world's most innovative products and the power of connecting with consumers in even more personal ways to celebrate their passion and love for sport. It's the kind of global experience that promises to further accelerate our momentum, and it makes me incredibly excited about what's in store.
Thanks, and here's Andy."
291981,346738414,1003312,"NIKE, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2016",2016-06-28,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call. As we close fiscal year '16, NIKE is better positioned than ever to continue delivering strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital. While we a",2089,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call. As we close fiscal year '16, NIKE is better positioned than ever to continue delivering strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital. While we are in an increasingly dynamic macroeconomic environment, we have a management team with experience and a proven track record of working all of the levers within our business to deliver strong financial performance under a wide range of circumstances. Even more importantly, NIKE is the #1-rated brand by consumers in every major market and every key city around the world from China to Europe and, of course, here in North America. That is perhaps the most important metric that I will speak to you on this call because it is bestowed upon us by the consumers that we serve and it must be earned. NIKE's brand leadership with consumers is fueled by our authentic and relentless obsession with bringing inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.
In fiscal year '16, we brought that to life by executing our category offense like never before, and that drove strong double-digit growth on a currency-neutral basis. We execute our offense through 3 primary dimensions: brand, product and marketplace.
As Mark and Trevor noted, from a brand perspective, we are more deeply connecting with and inspiring consumers, leveraging the most iconic moments in sport. And from a product perspective, our groundbreaking, innovative footwear and apparel is enabling the world's best athletes to perform at unprecedented levels and make history in those moments.
We then bring those innovative products to our billions of consumers around the world from the LeBron Soldier 10 and the KYRIE 2 to the LunarEpic in Running to Cristiano Ronaldo's Mercurial Superfly CR7 boot. 
At NIKE, we always start with performance innovation. But what's even more is how we are redefining sports culture and leading a global shift in how people express themselves at work and at play. We do that by bringing what Mark referred to as sports style innovation to NIKE's unrivaled portfolio of iconic products such as the Air Force 1, Cortez and Huarache, as well as to the creation of new icons like the Roshe and Air Max Thea, and instant classics from performance like KOBE signature product and the Flyknit Racer. That is something that only NIKE can do on such a global scale, as evidenced by 22% currency-neutral growth in NIKE Sportswear, our largest category.
While brand and product fuel our growth, we capture that growth in the marketplace. Globally, consumer demand for athletic footwear and apparel is outpacing broader consumption. At the same time, the retail landscape is rapidly evolving. For other brands, the speed of change in retail may be challenging and create uncertainty. But at NIKE, we have always believed that the best way to predict the future is to create it. That's why, as we shared in our Investor Day last October, we have been leading a transformation of the marketplace, not simply reacting to trends. Over the past year, we made significant investments in NIKE.com, and the results have been extraordinary. NIKE.com grew double to triple digits in all 6 of our geographies led by Greater China, as we made great progress toward our goal of $7 billion in revenue by 2020. We are also investing to more seamlessly integrate digital and physical retail and working more strategically with our strongest wholesale partners to shape the future of retail.
Our brand, product and marketplace strategies underscore NIKE's relentless focus on creating extraordinary value for consumers. And that allows us to continue delivering sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth and value creation for shareholders.
In fiscal year '16, we once again delivered strong top line growth, growing revenue 12% on a currency-neutral basis. We also expanded profitability, growing earnings per share by 17%, outpacing our midteens goal despite significant FX headwinds. And we delivered returns on invested capital of 29.7%, up 160 basis points versus the prior year.
That powerful combination of growth, expanding profitability and strong returns is what sets NIKE apart in terms of shareholder value creation. And while there were areas in which we did not execute as precisely as we had planned in fiscal year '16, those areas now represent opportunities to further elevate our game and deliver growth in fiscal year '17. But before I share plans for fiscal year '17, let's first reflect on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal year '16 financial results in a bit more detail.
NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue increased 6%, up 9% on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 6% to $32.4 billion, up 12% on a currency-neutral basis. All of our international geographies grew double digits, with North America growing at a high single-digit rate, in line with our long-term targeted rate of growth for that geography. NIKE Brand futures orders reflect continued strong demand across our global portfolio, growing 11% on a currency-neutral basis driven by a 4% increase in units, with increases in average selling price contributing 7 percentage points of growth. On a reported basis, futures grew 8%, reflecting the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies and, in particular, developing market currencies.
Fourth quarter diluted EPS was flat to prior year at $0.49. Full year diluted EPS grew 17% to $2.16 driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate.
Gross margin contracted 30 basis points in Q4 while expanding 20 basis points for the full year. For the quarter, margin contraction was driven primarily by inventory management in North America, higher labor cost and foreign exchange, which offset sustained increases in average selling price and the benefits of lower oil on materials cost.
Fourth quarter demand creation increased 7%. For the full year, demand creation increased 2% as we strategically invested in digital consumer engagement and sports marketing while gaining efficiencies in traditional advertising.
Operating overhead increased 7% for the quarter and 8% for the full year. This reflected cost associated with our fast-growing DTC business as well as strategic investments in consumer-facing digital capabilities and operational infrastructure. The effective tax rate for fiscal year '16 was 18.7%, 350 basis points lower than last year's rate, primarily due to a higher mix of non-U.S. earnings, which are generally subject a lower tax rate. As of May 31, inventories were up 12%, including a 6% increase in NIKE Brand wholesaling units, reflecting continued strong global demand.
Now let's turn to performance for a few of our largest operating segments. For the full year, North America revenue grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was led by Sportswear, Jordan and Running. Growth also reflected continued momentum in our DTC business led by NIKE.com growing at 39%. For the quarter, North America revenue growth on a reported basis was flat to the prior year due in part to an unfavorable comparison to the timing of shipments across Q3 and Q4 in fiscal year '15. Many of the orders planned for shipment in Q3 of fiscal year '15 were delayed due to the West Coast port congestion and instead shipped in Q4. Excluding the impact of this timing shift, we estimate Q4 fiscal year '16 North America revenue growth would have been in the mid-single-digit range.
North America EBIT increased 3% for the full year as revenue growth and full-price gross margin expansion were mostly offset by the lower off-price margin associated with clearing excess inventory.
As Trevor discussed, NIKE inventory in the full-price in-line channels in North America is now clean. And as reflected in our futures orders, we are also keeping in-line supply tight to ensure a strong pull market. Accordingly, we expect that North America revenue will return to growth in Q1, with growth accelerating over the balance of the fiscal year. North America's gross margin will contract in Q1 as we complete the clearance of excess inventory, with a return to gross margin expansion over the course of fiscal year '17.
Looking to Western Europe, where NIKE's portfolio of categories is becoming increasingly unrivaled, from Global Football to Running, to Sportswear, to Women's Training as well as fast-emerging categories such as Basketball and Jordan. In fiscal year '16, every category delivered growth, resulting in double-digit growth in every territory. As a result, Western Europe revenue grew to nearly $6 billion, up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. For the quarter, currency-neutral revenue grew 19% led by Sportswear and Global Football as we approached the European championships. On a reported basis, fiscal year '16 revenue increased 3%, reflecting FX headwinds, while EBIT expanded 12% driven by SG&A leverage.
In our emerging markets geography, our brand momentum continues to build and we've created healthy pull markets. On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal year '16 revenue increased 13%, led by Soco, Mexico and Pacific, fueled by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Jordan and Women's Training. Revenue in Brazil declined due to the challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our brand is strong in Brazil, our inventories are healthy and we continue to take share.
For Q4, currency-neutral revenue was up 12%, with double-digit growth in Soco, Korea, Pacific, Mexico and Africa. On a reported basis, fiscal year '16 revenue and EBIT were heavily impacted by the significant FX headwinds throughout the geography. As a result, fiscal year '16 reported revenue decreased 5% while EBIT increased 9%, reflecting gross margin expansion.
Fiscal year '16 was another exceptional year for NIKE in Greater China, with currency-neutral revenue growing 27%. China continues to be one of the world's largest and fastest-growing markets in terms of consumption. And NIKE is unequivocally the leading brand in China as we continue to fuel the Chinese consumer's passion for sport. Our category assortments tailored for the Chinese consumer continue to drive growth and increasing productivity and profitability for both our DTC businesses, led by NIKE.com, and our wholesale partners. Nearly all categories grew in fiscal year '16 led by Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and Jordan. For the quarter, currency-neutral revenue grew 23% with double-digit growth in both footwear and apparel, in both DTC and wholesale and across nearly all key categories. On a reported basis, fiscal year '16 revenue is up 23% and EBIT expanded 38%. In addition to tremendous revenue growth, China delivered strong gross margin expansion and highly leveraged SG&A.
In fiscal year '16, NIKE once again delivered another year of strong financial performance. While we are in an increasingly dynamic macro environment, particularly with respect to foreign currencies, our outlook for fiscal year '17 is largely in line with the high-level guidance that we shared last quarter. Specifically for fiscal year '17, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting high single-digit to low double-digit growth on a currency-neutral basis. Our rate of reported revenue growth will be more heavily impacted by FX headwinds in the first half of fiscal year '17, primarily due to developing market currencies. For Q1, we expect mid-single-digit reported revenue growth, roughly 3 points below our reported rate of futures growth.
We expect gross margin for the full year to expand by 30 to 50 basis points, in line with our long-term financial model guardrails. This reflects higher average selling prices, ongoing manufacturing productivity initiatives and continued strong growth in our NIKE.com business as well as the favorable impact of lower oil on materials cost. However, these benefits will be partially offset by continued labor cost inflation and FX headwinds.
For Q1, we expect gross margin to decline approximately 100 basis points driven primarily by FX headwinds, including year-over-year changes in our hedge rates. For total SG&A, we expect full year growth in the high single-digit range, in line with our reported fiscal year '17 revenue guidance.
For Q1, we expect mid to high teens SG&A growth, significantly higher than the full year rate as we make strategic investments in demand creation around key sporting events such as the Olympics and the European Football Championships. We expect other income to be approximately $20 million to $30 million on average for each quarter. For fiscal year '17, we expect the effective tax rate will be between 19% and 21%.
As we look ahead to fiscal year '17, NIKE is the leading brand in every major market, we have the most talented teams, we have strong momentum across our diverse global portfolio of businesses and we are on the offense as always.
And now, we'll open up the call for your questions."

So we feel really good about the trajectory of the Basketball business. In particular, when you think about what's happening globally, we're certainly seeing strong results around the world. Certainly, China really delivered some incredible growth. Also coming out of the playoffs, the LeBron 10 -- LeBron Soldier 10 did exceptionally well, also the KYRIE 2. So we're definitely feeling energized about the pipeline of products that we have coming through, and we're certainly excited about the way the players continue to play and our ability to continue to drive connection with our consumers."

Obviously, there -- I can touch on that from a dimension perspective in terms of growth, and Trevor can add some commentary on how he feels from a brand and product and marketplace perspective. When you reflect on the fourth quarter for North America, I think it is important to note what I mentioned, which is that the flat revenue growth was really more so a result of comparisons to prior year. We continue to see strong underlying momentum in the fundamentals that drive our growth and profitability, as you see in our futures orders, our futures orders are reflective of some of that. Dimensions, leading indicators in terms of consumers' demand for the NIKE Brand such as NIKE.com, grew 39% as I mentioned over the full year and actually north of 40% in Q4, so accelerated to some extent. So we continue to feel great about where we're going in terms of the transformation of our marketplace including through NIKE.com as well as through the relationship with our strategic wholesale partners and, obviously, how those dimensions capture growth relates back to the strong pipeline of product that Trevor and Mark touched on that we feel great about and are bringing to market currently."

This summer proved just how powerful sport can be around the world.

This summer proved just how powerful sport can be around the world. Some of the greatest performances of all time entertained us and in the process, inspired a new generation of athletes to get moving. At the same time, the look of sport continues to influence everyday style around the world. As a result, new brands are entering into the athletic landscape. The activewear market continues to outpace the overall apparel and footwear market, which itself continues to outpace global GDP growth. It's a great time to be in the business of sports. And as the market leader, this is a great time to be NIKE.
We are on the front end of all this growth, a driving force behind expanding market. We not only see the upside across the landscape. We have both the scale and the skill to act on it. We believe in our strategy and in our complete offense. It's proven to be NIKE's greatest competitive edge. We win now by attacking [ph] our opportunities aggressively. We sharpen our execution, and we focus on those with the greatest impact and highest return. And we build for the future by intensifying our investments in our brand and innovation. NIKE is on the offense like never before, driving up a global athletic market that holds tremendous potential for growth. Q1 is the start of what's going to be a strong year for our company.
Let's review the financial highlights. NIKE, Inc. first quarter revenues were up 8%, growing to $9.1 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10%. Gross margin was 45.5%, down 200 basis points to prior year. Earnings per share increased 9% to $0.73, and we delivered ROIC of 30.5%. It was a summer of amazing sports moments, and it all began with an historic NBA Finals win, led by LeBron and Kyrie. It continued with Chile taking the Copa American title for the second time in a row. And weeks later at Wimbledon, Serena Williams celebrated her 22nd grand slam, tying her for the most singles titles in the open era. And the next day, the Euro Champs featured the first ever all-NIKE final with Portugal defeating France. 
And of course, we were all captivated by the Rio Olympics last month. Everywhere you looked in Rio, you could feel NIKE's support of the athlete. Over 1,500 Olympians from 60 countries won 189 medals wearing our latest innovations. If NIKE were a country, we would have stood atop the medal count leaderboard. We saw so many inspiring performances. A few of the highlights for me were Neymar scoring the final penalty kick, leading Brazil to their first ever Olympic gold in men's football; Mo Farah becoming the second man to win both the 5,000- and 10,000-meter races in consecutive Olympics; and with 21 of the 2014 USA Basketball players wearing NIKE or Jordan footwear, both the men's and women's teams winning gold. It's moments like these that validate our obsession with the athlete. They serve as the ultimate proving grounds.
I'm happy to say we not only owned the fields of play with performance products like the KD9, but we also set the tone for sports style innovation through new apparel silhouettes like the dynamic reveal jacket worn by all U.S. Olympic medal winners on the medal stand.
What's amazing is that this success covers only 3 months. We absolutely dominated the sports calendar, and we used the power of sport to energize the marketplace and fuel growth. While I'm pleased with our overall momentum, I'm even more excited about what the future holds for our company. 
When we last spoke in June, I outlined our key strategies for growth in fiscal year '17. We talked about driving a continuous cycle of innovation for athletes, about transforming the global marketplace, and then deepening our commitment to lead in this new era of personalized performance. And I'm proud to say we kicked off the year with strong progress in each of those areas.
Starting with innovation, Running is a great example of our complete offense within a category, delivering both performance innovation and sports style innovation in both footwear and apparel. Let's start with the LunarEpic which broke new ground this quarter. Delivering a completely new ride, it doesn't feel or look like any running shoe before it. The LunarEpic Glow is also translating extremely well to a style audience and is selling through well beyond expectations.
Innovation at NIKE can also mean reinterpreting our most successful franchises. For example, the Air [ph] Pegasus 33 has proven to be consistently popular. In fact since its inception, NIKE has sold over 50 million pairs of the Pegasus. 
We also brought new technology to sportswear in Q1, as seen with the Flyknit and the Air Max 1 Ultra Flyknit. These iconic running styles were paired with our groundbreaking digital knitting to maximize flexibility and comfort like only NIKE can. 
And finally on apparel, among the most successful styles of the quarter was the new dynamic reveal jacket that I had mentioned and performance running tops, shorts and tights. Apparel's accelerated growth is bringing great balance to running.  I should also call out the women's sportswear apparel category which continues to be another standout growth category for NIKE. 
Innovation, of course, extends far beyond product at NIKE. It's also about transforming the global marketplace by serving and inspiring consumers in ways that are most meaningful to them. It's about creating ways to keep them coming back. And we do that with our long-standing wholesale partners as well as with our own category focus stores. One of our greatest competitive advantages is our ability to connect physical and digital shopping experiences for our consumers. In more places than ever, NIKE consumers can now shop in store and through mobile at the same time in a single transaction. And it's clear our investments are paying off. On a currency -- constant currency basis, DTC revenue for Q1 was up 22%, with the NIKE.com business leading the way at 49% growth. 
Another critical part of the success of NIKE.com continues to be our seamless integration with Nike+. It was a busy quarter for Nike+ as we delivered all access to the best of NIKE with one single sign-on to connect our running, training and sneaker apps. All 3 apps continue to be refreshed with the new features that are more directly tailored to the user.
We also continue to expand our industry leadership in digital innovation through key partnerships. We got a taste of the combined power of NIKE and Apple again this month. And there's much more to come as we focus on solving problems for athletes together, combining NIKE's deep knowledge of sport with Apple's expertise in digital technology.
We're off to a solid start to the fiscal year, and we're confident we'll reach our near-term goals. At the same time, we are always looking ahead to shape the future of sports. In Q1, we took a major leaps to those long-term goals, especially in the promise of personalized performance. Our connection to the consumer through Nike+ is core to that vision, but equally important is disrupting the business model that supports it, or as we like to call it, our manufacturing revolution or ManRev. Through our acceleration of ManRev, we're currently seeing the benefit of product cost optimization. And at the same time, we're building capabilities for increased speed to market. 
Beyond that, one of the most exciting opportunities for ManRev is within design. We're continuing to scale our transition from cut and saw where precision is at the stitch level, to digital designer where precision is at the pixel level. And we're leveraging the power of computational design that uses algorithms to create highly tunable innovations very quickly. summer in Rio athletes such as Allyson Felix, [ph] Elaine Thompson [ph] and Mo Farah claimed gold wearing our latest track spikes. Each were developed using computational design, 3D printing and selective laser centering, which allowed us to create and refine prototypes in hours instead of months and align with the athletes' specific training programs and competitive needs. Personalized products and services where and when you need them is the future NIKE is building for tomorrow and delivering today.
You've heard me talk before about how NIKE is built for growth. I'm as confident as ever that we are built to win now, to deliver accelerated growth in the near term. And equally, we're built to win for the long term. As we continue to invest surgically and aggressively to create the future of sport and active life, we will continue deliver shareholder value for years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Trevor"

Q1 is always an exciting quarter for the NIKE Brand, but this past summer was something really special. It was full of global sports moments where our ability to deliver new and innovative products and create powerful consumer connections was on full display. And with that, we are off to a good start to the year. 
On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 10% for the quarter, led by double-digit growth in all international geographies. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 22%, driven by online growth of 49% and new store growth of 10% [ph]. And finally, global futures are up 7%. 
At NIKE, we take pride in developing authentic relationships with consumers although all over the world. And this summer of sport highlighted how we take full advantage of the world's best athletes to deepen those connections. Our Unlimited You campaign during the Olympics harbored an excellent example of that power with this message of providing all athletes to push their limits, reaching more than 480 million views online and 1.1 billion TV impressions around the world. For us, this energy is our engine as it continues to drive excitement and momentum for the NIKE Brand. And ultimately, this energy comes to life within our categories and for our geographies.
Let's take a look starting with our categories, first, running. Growing double digits, this was the highest revenue quarter ever for our performance running category with strong growth across footwear and apparel. Leading the way for footwear were key products that translate our rich understanding of runners into groundbreaking performance innovations like the LunarEpic Glow and the Air zoom Pegasus 33. What's more, the reinvention of our Free technology reignited demand for one of the most iconic footwear franchises around the world. 
And with our deep passion for running, we continued to connect products and services. Earlier this month, in partnership with Apple, we announced the Apple Watch Nike+, your perfect running partner. Built seamlessly into the watch is the Nike+ Run Club with motivation through smart run reminders and training data like pace and distance available at a glance. I was excited to help introduce the watch at Apple's keynote, and I's can't wait for runners everywhere to start using it. 
With running, we never rest on our heels. With even more exciting products in the pipeline, our expansive running strategy will continue to drive tremendous energy for both this important category and across our entire portfolio.
Now let's take a look at NIKE Basketball. Mark mentioned what the U.S. men's and women's teams accomplished in Rio. In particular, I want to highlight Kevin Durant's incredible performance, leading the team throughout the tournament and putting up 30 points in the gold medal game. as KD 9 hit the market this summer to a great response, there is one thing I want to call out. To give fans a way to celebrate KD's move to Golden State, we offered a blue and yellow on NIKE on the same day he joined the team. This was a great example of the kind of real-time personalized opportunities you'll see more of as we invest in capability to deliver products to market when and where fans want the most. 
Kyrie had an amazing summer, winning an Olympic gold in the NBA championships, and his signature Kyrie 2 continues to be met with strong consumer response. We see a very bright future for this young star, and we are excited for the years ahead together with him. 
And finally, the energy for Lebron continues to build after his incredible dominance in the playoffs and his very successful visit to China. And the LeBron Soldier 10 [ph] is seeing very strong sell-through in the United States and China, our 2 largest basketball markets. 
We continue to see opportunities these in the power of our relationships in Basketball. We have both the deepest roster of great athletes from LeBron and KD to Russell Westbrook and Paul George to Ben Simmons [ph] and [indiscernible] Don and great universities and clubs around the world. Fueled by these relationships, NIKE Basketball continues to energize passion for the game and inspire future generations worldwide. The products are strong. The pipeline is loaded. And I can't wait for the NBA season to start so we can deliver these amazing innovations to our consumers.
In the Jordan Brand, we continue to see huge opportunities as we expand beyond the sport of basketball. Jordan's entrance into the Men's Training category with the Jordan Trainer 1 has been greeted with strong excitement in the marketplace. to support the launch, we created a new training program, the Jordan Breakfast Club based on Michael's legendary work ethic. And as the college football season began, the Jordan Brand joined forces with University of Michigan to response [ph] real energy. We launched the partnership between these 2 iconic brands with a midnight event attended by thousands of consumers who camped out for the new apparel.
And of course, the Jordan Brand can still lead the world of basketball, as it did with the announcement of the Air Jordan 301, with its first of its kind Flyweave and leather upper and a full zoom lens and a full-length Zoom Air enhancing lateral support and court feel. What's more, earlier this month, we launched the Jordan 1 Retro High with the original band of red and black colorway, and it sold out within an hour. It's clear with continued double-digit revenue growth, the Jordan Brand is more popular than ever.
In both NIKE Basketball and Jordan, we serve the full Lifestyle of Basketball like no other brand, from performance to sports styling innovation to sharing our passion for sport with millions of consumers around the world. And importantly, our sportswear category, which in Q1 saw its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, continues to amplify the power of our performance categories to serve consumers through sports style innovation. As always, NIKE sportswear challenges conventional notions of performance and style by inspiration from our greatest athletes with modern approach to Lifestyle design.
In Q1, consumers continued their love of footwear like the Huarache, the tangent and the Air Force 1, along with running icons we've enhanced with Flyknit, like the Roshe 2 and the Air Max 1 to create a look and feel that only NIKE can offer. And our apparel success was highlighted by the ever popular and improved Tech Fleece and the innovative NIKE dynamic reveal jacket which created the look of victory this summer as athletes wore proudly on the metal stands throughout the Olympics. With both footwear and apparel, our strong sportswear category continues our leadership in fueling passion for sports lifestyle through a global and diverse audience.
Now let's discuss a few of our key geographies, first, North America where the brand remains very strong. In Q1, we returned our largest geography back to growth with revenues up 6%. This growth was fueled in part by record awareness and engagement around the Olympics and our Unlimited campaign. From a category perspective, we saw growth in sportswear, the Jordan Brand in running. And driven by launches of new innovations, we returned signature basketball to a pull market. We also made great progress against clearing excess inventory within the quarter. And we're seeing the benefit of bringing new products into the clean full price in line channels.  Looking forward, we will continue to manage the flow of product into the market as we expand on an already healthy in line marketplace. 
We've always said there is no finish line, and that's as true today as it ever was. We continue to see tremendous opportunity offered by the still untapped potential of our complete offense in women's and in young athletes, across performance and sportswear and up and down the price points. As we look at this considerable upside, we are as excited as we've ever been about our growth opportunities ahead both in the near term and into the future.
Now let's turn to Western Europe where we see broad-based demand with growth of 10% for the quarter, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Excitement in the marketplace was fueled by the European Championships and the kickoff to the football season with the launch of the new kits from Man City to FC Barcelona to [indiscernible] Madrid to Paris Saint Germain, all of which combine advance performance technologies with beautiful design. And the energy from this great summer of sports could be seen across Western Europe's marketplace in Q1 from our elevated execution in Paris with Intersport to the House of Hoops on London's [indiscernible] Street with Foot Locker, we are creating compelling retail experiences for our consumers, and these strong partnerships are paying off. At the same time, our own DTC business continues to perform well, growing 30% in the quarter.  We are rated by consumers as the favored brand in all key cities in Western Europe. The momentum we have seen in Q1 reinforces our view that we have tremendous growth potential in this important geography. 
And finally, in Greater China, we continue to see great results with revenue growing 21% for the quarter. We are leveraging consumer sports moments such as the Olympics and the athlete visits by LeBron, KD and Russell Westbrook this summer. This energy is reflected in our category results with tremendous momentum across running, sportswear, Jordan and Nike Basketball.
Just recently, the China retail market became the world's largest market, eclipsing the United States. And with our impressive growth there, we continue to feel positive with the successful strategies we are executing. We are leading with digital where we are seeing incredible growth in our NIKE.com business as we continue to innovate with a focus on mobile.
And we are leveraging the best practices from China across our global portfolio. Consumers are also responding to our efforts to create more compelling and unique retail experiences. And reprofiled doors with our wholesale partners continue to be more productive. We will continue to raise the bar as we scale the number of reprofiled doors in the fleet. We feel great about the progress of our business in China. And more importantly, we are more confident than ever in our ability to sustain -- to drive sustained growth in this geography.
Q1 was the start of a new fiscal year for the NIKE Brand, but to us it's much more than that. It's the continuation of delivering innovative products to the marketplace, connecting our consumers with more fun and authentic experiences and elevating every aspect of our game to help athletes get better.
Thanks. Now here's Andy."

And our consistent delivery of results across all 3 of those",2054,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone in the call.
Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the 3 pillars of NIKE's financial strategy. And our consistent delivery of results across all 3 of those dimensions over the long-term is what continues to set NIKE apart in terms of creating value for shareholders.
To be clear, first and foremost, NIKE is a growth company. We're obsessed with bringing inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. And with more than 7 billion athletes [ph] on the planet, that's no small feat. We are relentlessly in pursuit of our mission. And our pace and intensity always accelerates around the biggest moments in sport.  So it should come as no surprise that we're off to a great start against our growth agenda for fiscal year '17.
As Mark noted, the past 90 days have been a hit parade for the NIKE Brand and the amazing athletes and teams that we serve, from LeBron and Kyrie winning the NBA Finals in dramatic fashion, all the way through to the unprecedented medal-winning performances of hundreds of NIKE athletes of the Olympic Games in Rio. Those are the moments that bring out the best in NIKE, pushing our brand and our pipeline of innovative, beautifully designed products to new heights. Powered by this inspiring summer of sport, our revenue grew to $9.1 billion in the quarter, up 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a currency-neutral basis.
Expanding profitability is another key pillar of NIKE's financial strategy. While margins contracted in the quarter driven by foreign exchange and several temporary or discrete items, we continue to benefit from our more systemic, long-term drivers of margin expansion, including higher in-line average selling prices and benefits associated with our footwear manufacturing revolution initiatives. In fact, based upon the progress we are making in footwear manufacturing, we announced a new strategic relationship with Apollo Global Management in the quarter aimed at revolutionizing apparel manufacturing. 
SG&A productivity is also increasing the driver of our expanding profitability. In Q1, operating overhead grew just 6% as continued strategic investment was offset by productivity gains. 
Having grown rapidly from a $16 billion enterprise in fiscal year '07 to an over $32 billion enterprise today, we're intensifying our reallocation of the unrivaled resources that we have in our arsenal. Leveraging our approach that we call edit to amplify, we are amplifying what matters most in terms of creating value for consumers and driving growth. That includes the path we've been on to double our investment in innovation and revolutionize our supply chain. At the same time, we are editing and realigning resources in areas where the investment we have today is more than sufficient.
Growth and expanding profitability, along with strategic capital deployment, also continue to yield strong returns on invested capital. In the first quarter, our ROIC expanded 160 basis points compared to prior year and is now over 30% for the first time in our history. 
Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the 3 pillars of our financial strategy. And we continue to build momentum toward delivering in our long-term goals across all 3 dimensions through nimble and strategic management. So on that note, let's reflect in our financial results for Q1.
In Q1, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 8%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 10%, with all international geographies growing double digits and North America returning to growth at 6%. NIKE Brand futures orders are up 5% on a reported basis. Currency-neutral futures orders are growing 7%, driven by a 2% increase in units, with increases in average selling prices contributing 5 percentage points of growth. 
First quarter diluted EPS of $0.73 increased 9% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenue growth, operating overhead leverage, lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count.  
Gross margin contracted 200 basis points in the quarter.  Now let me take a moment to provide greater dimension on the drivers impacting gross margin in the short term and why we remain so confident in our ability to expand margins over the long term. As I previously noted, the primary drivers of the contraction in Q1 were several temporary or discrete items, including for example foreign exchange impacts, our exit from the golf equipment business, a higher mix of off-price sales as compared to Q1 fiscal year '16, and a shift of expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold. Note that cost of goods sold includes our investments in innovation, manufacturing revolution and other product creation related resources, which have expanded significantly to fuel long-term growth.  At the same time, we continue to benefit from higher full price average selling prices, lower oil-based input costs and the favorable impacts on product costs, driven by our manufacturing revolution initiatives.
Turning to SG&A, demand creation increased 25% in the first quarter, primarily driven by investment around the Olympics and the European Football Championships. Operating overhead increased just 6% as continued strategic investment in DTC, operational infrastructure and consumer-facing digital capabilities were partially offset by productivity gains and the shift of certain expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold.
The effective tax rate for Q1 was 2.5%, significantly lower than prior year, primarily due to a onetime benefit related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter. 
As of August 31, inventories were up 11%. NIKE Brand wholesaling units were up just 3%. The remainder of the expansion in inventory was driven by growth to support our fast-growing DTC businesses and a higher average cost of the inventory due to a higher mix of footwear this quarter versus prior year.
Now let's turn to the performance of a few key operating segments. In Q1, North America revenue grew 6% on both a currency-neutral and reported basis. Growth was driven by sportswear and Jordan. As Trevor noted, we're also seeing strong consumer demand for the signature performance basketball styles that we just recently launched as we approach the tip off of the NBA season later in Q2.  On a reported basis, North America EBIT decreased 4% in the first quarter as revenue growth and full priced gross margin expansion were offset by higher demand creation related to the Olympics and a higher mix of off-price liquidation in Q1 versus the same period in the prior year.
Overall, we feel great about the progress we are making to rebalance supply and demand in the North America marketplace, and we will deliberately keep supply tight to maintain a pull market. Accordingly, we expect North America's reported revenue growth over the balance of the year to outpace the rate of futures growth, driven by stronger sell-through to consumers.
Now turning to Western Europe where the NIKE Brand continues to be the leading brand in all 10 key cities and consumer demand for our products remains extremely strong. In Q1, revenue grew to $1.8 billion, up 10% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was primarily driven by sportswear, global football, running and Jordan. We also experienced strong growth across both our DTC businesses and with our wholesale partners. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue increased 7%, while EBIT declined 19%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin and demand creation investments around the European Football Championships and the Olympics.
While NIKE brings the energy of the Olympics to consumers in key cities all around the world, the Olympic Games also offered us the opportunity to more deeply connect with consumers in our Emerging Markets geography and specifically ignite the passion for sport in Brazil. The stars could not have aligned better for the NIKE Brand, culminating with's Neymar gold-medal winning goal in the historic Maracana Stadium. Fueled by inspiration from the games, our Emerging Markets geography grew 11% in a currency-neutral basis. Growth was driven by incredibly strong momentum across sportswear, running and Jordan. And the territories with the highest rates of growth were [indiscernible] and Pacific. We're also very effectively managing supply and demand in the Emerging Markets as reflected in lower inventory unit levels versus prior year. 
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue and EBIT continue to be heavily impacted by FX headwinds. As a result, Q1 reported revenue decreased 2%, while EBIT decreased 34%.
Q1 was another exceptional quarter for NIKE in Greater China, with currency-neutral revenue growth of 21%. Growth was in the double digits in both footwear and apparel, in both DTC and at wholesale and across nearly every category. Our brand leadership and connection with consumers in China is unrivaled and accelerating. Sell-through at retail remains robust and inventories are healthy. And as our focus remains on the long term, we continue to prioritize strategic investment in this important geography to fuel strong and sustainable growth. That includes investments in deepening our connections with consumers, consumer-focused experiences in both owned and partner retail, accelerating digital commerce and new supply chain capabilities that enable us to more personally serve consumers in the world's largest market. Perhaps most importantly, we are also investing in our team and talent. The NIKE Brand is winning in China, and the investments we're making now will continue to drive growth and extend our leadership long term.
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue in China was up 15%, while EBIT expanded 12%. Q1 was a solid start to the year. We have strong brand momentum in a pipeline of innovative performance and sportswear product that is resonating with consumers. Accordingly, our outlook for fiscal year '17 remains largely unchanged in terms of growth and the profitability of our business. 
Specifically for the full year, our revenue expectations remain in line with prior guidance, high-single-digit reported revenue growth, and high single to low double-digit currency-neutral revenue growth. For Q2, we expect reported revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range, at or slightly below our rate of reported futures growth, reflecting FX headwinds.
Futures orders continue to be an important and valuable aspect of our operating model. That said, the relationship between reported futures and reported revenue in a given quarter has become less correlated based on our evolving business mix. Accordingly, over the past several quarters, we have been providing greater dimension on our outlook for the business. Going forward, based upon our own evaluation and taking into account input that we have received from stakeholders, we will change the sequencing of our futures reporting. Futures will first be referenced in the context of the broader guidance that we provide on the earnings conference call, rather than as a stand-alone forward-looking metric in our earnings release. We will also continue to report futures in detail in our quarterly filings with the SEC.
Turning to gross margin, we now expect the full year rate to contract. For Q2, we expect gross margin to contract by approximately 125 basis points, with the rate in the second half of the fiscal year approaching flat versus the prior year. Our underlying fundamental drivers of gross margin expansion remains strong, including higher full price average selling price and product cost optimization. However, those favorable drivers are being offset in the short term by the aforementioned temporary or discrete factors, some of which have a continuing impact on the balance of year. 
For total SG&A, we now expect full year growth in the mid- to high single digits with Q2 growing in the low to mid- single-digit range, as our continued strategic investments are increasingly being funded or offset by SG&A productivity gains as we edit to amplify. 
In Q2, we expect other income or expense to be roughly 0. 
For the full year, our guidance remains unchanged from prior guidance. We now expect our effective tax rate will BE approximately 17% for the full year, taking into account the rate in Q1 and an average rate of about 22% for Q2 through Q4.
We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year. And as we look to the balance of the year and beyond, our level of intensity is high. And we are more obsessed than ever with creating extraordinary value for consumers and translating that into sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth for NIKE and our shareholders.
With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

Let me take that. First of all on a little more macro level, I think as I mentioned, the current environment really plays right into NIKE's strengths, meaning with the athletic footwear and apparel segments being so strong and outpacing the rest of the footwear and apparel industry. We're actually quite well represented in leading product on both the performance and the sportswear side of the business as we talked about. There's many things that we are excited about, including some of the product that's in the market right now that I think is -- has a lot of upside opportunity to more completely leverage things in performance, products and performance. Signature, we talked about. LeBron, soldier, the KD 9, new KYRIE, Paul George signatures shoes, of course the Air Jordan 301, those are great examples. Running, we talked about the LunarEpic Glow really, incredible new cushioning system there for a great ride. Pegasus, the update on that, a real classic apparel. The running performance category, both tops and bottoms, women's and sports bras, I mean those are some examples on the performance side. And then on the sportswear side, we've got classics that we've reissued as well as new updates, including innovation as part of those classics, Air Force 1, Air Max, Presto, Sock Dart, [ph] Roshe 2, Huarache, just to name some of those. In terms of the new upcoming innovation in Q2, we've got more signature basketball coming. You know the LeBron 14 is in the on-deck circle. It's another great signature product for LeBron. And the Air VaporMax, which we talked about in March, which is a phenomenal new modern interpretation of Nike Air cushioning, it's incredible both in how it performs, but how it looks. We have new iterations of Free product in apparel. We've got new Base Layer technology, tech running, hyperwarm apparel collection which we're excited about. Jordan is expanding beyond the basketball category to training and running, including sportswear. We -- Trevor mentioned the new Apple watch, Nike+ version which is the start of, I think, intensifying that relationship between NIKE and Apple. and then we've got some, on the sportswear side, some new innovative interpretations of again some of our sportswear classics. Big anniversaries coming wx the Air Max, 1, the Air Max 97, the Air Force 1 35th anniversary Cortez, modern comfort collection in Jordan category as well as NIKE. So we'll bring some real innovation to both the sportswear category with the classics as well as some new products. So there's an array. I didn't mention the hyperadapt, by the way, that's -- probably should be to at the top of the list. It's gotten a lot of attention, as it should, because it really ushers in a whole new wave of adaptive technology. So we're bringing innovation obviously to performance, but also to sports style innovation. And I think it's interesting that the consumer doesn't necessarily distinguish between the 2. Much of -- many of our performance products are worn in terms of the street and they're quite fashionable. That isn't necessarily our intent out of the box, but we're definitely seeing that be the case as well. So very excited about innovation that's coming obviously in product, and our innovation goes well beyond product. we talked about ManRev. We talked about digital. We talked about personalized performance, Nike+, NIKE.com, innovations in retail. So this has really always been, always will be the engine for growth for the company. And I'll say that we're as aggressive as ever in investing in those biggest opportunities. And I'm not including the things I can't talk about, which we are obviously very excited about as well.

Overall, we feel great about the progress that we're making from inventory, maybe more broadly a supply and demand management perspective. As I noted, our overall enterprise inventory growth was driven by only 3 percentage point increase in units. And actually, we saw a decline in North America in particular in inventory, both in the value of that inventory as well as the units actually declined even greater. So while I noted that in margin, off-price sales had a negative mix impact, that was versus the prior year in the first quarter. we're actually continuing to see those off-price sales tighten up as we make the progress we told you we would in terms of returning to a healthy pull market in North America."

And we're bringing in the new products into the marketplace, and we're seeing the results of that. Going forward, we will continue to manage the supply into the marketplace proactively to make sure that we maintain a pull market. If you look across the Western Europe, the inventory is actually well in line with revenue growth. Maybe the only difference would be on the value side, you're seeing foreign exchange have some impact. then in China, we're certainly seeing inventories are very healthy there. And you've seeing some inventory build as we prepare for Singles Day, which is obviously a big impact and so we're excited about that.

So those items most notably included the shift of operating overhead expenses into cost of goods sold. So that is a movement within our P&L versus a change in trajectory. And as I mentioned, it's not always that evident to those on the call or otherwise, that included in gross margin or in cost of goods sold is not just the product cost, but also the investment in the team and resources that we deploy against innovation and manufacturing revolution and otherwise. Golf, as you highlighted, was another factor within gross margin, some charges that we took as well as the impact of exiting the golf equipment business. Frankly, it's a great example of the edit and amplify project we talked about in the past and we've talked on this call increasingly being applied to operating overhead. That is having an impact on our margin in the short term and will over the balance of the year. It's not reported as a discontinued operation. It's in our numbers. But we're making those decisions because we believe our long-term focus. In other words, what we will amplify is our focus on footwear and apparel and drive greater growth and profitability there.

NIKE's always -- we've always started with the athlete. It's how we crave insights to drive the innovative products. And then we amplify that across the portfolio. Sportswear is really important means of doing that. We see tremendous growth in all areas, specifically in both dimensions of performance and sportswear. We just had our most successful quarter ever for performance running. And our sportswear business at the same time continues to be a massive growth driver for the company. So it's really for us is the balance between the 2 and the relationship between the 2. Now that intersection between performance of style, I think, is stronger than ever. And by the way, innovation is a huge part of creating a new aesthetic and lifestyle product does prioritize, I think, at this stage with the consumer comfort and light weight and breathability. performance is element of sportswear for NIKE, and that helps to separate and distinguish NIKE in the marketplace."

This summer proved just how powerful sport can be around the world. Some of the greatest performances of all time entertained us and, in the process, inspired a new generation of athletes to get moving. At the same time, the look of sport continues to influence everyday style around the world. As a result, new brands are entering into the athletic landscape. The activewear market continues to outpace the overall apparel and footwear market, which itself continues to outpace global GDP growth. It's a great time to be in the business of sports, and as the market leader, this is a great time to be NIKE. We are on the front end of all this growth, a driving force behind the expanding market. We not only see the upside across the landscape, we have both the scale and the skill to act on it. We believe in our strategy and in our complete offense. It's proven to be NIKE's greatest competitive edge. We win now by editing our opportunities aggressively, we sharpen our execution, and we focus on those with the greatest impact and highest return. And we build for the future by intensifying our investments in our brand and innovation. 
NIKE is on the offense like never before, driving up a global athletic market that holds tremendous potential for growth. Q1 is the start of what's going to be a strong year for our company.
Let's review the financial highlights. NIKE, Inc. first quarter revenues were up 8%, growing to $9.1 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10%. Gross margin was 45.5%, down 200 basis points to prior year. Earnings per share increased 9% to $0.73, and we delivered ROIC of 30.5%. 
It was a summer of amazing sports moments, and it all began with an historic NBA Finals win, led by LeBron and Kyrie. It continued with Chile taking the Copa América title for the second time in a row. And weeks later at Wimbledon, Serena Williams celebrated her 22nd grand slam, tying her for the most singles titles in the open era. And the next day, the Euro Champs featured the first-ever all-NIKE final with Portugal defeating France. 
And of course, we were all captivated by the Rio Olympics last month. Everywhere you looked in Rio, you could feel NIKE's support of the athlete. Over 1,500 Olympians from 60 countries won 189 medals wearing our latest innovations. If NIKE were a country, we would have stood atop the medal count leaderboard. 
We saw so many inspiring performances. A few of the highlights for me were Neymar scoring the final penalty kick, leading Brazil to their first-ever Olympic gold in men's football; Mo Farah becoming the second man to win both the 5,000- and 10,000-meter races in consecutive Olympics; and with 21 of the 2014 USA Basketball players wearing NIKE or Jordan footwear, both the men's and women's teams winning gold. It's moments like these that validate our obsession with the athlete. They serve as the ultimate proving grounds.
I'm happy to say we not only owned the fields of play with performance products like the KD9, but we also set the tone for sports style innovation through new apparel silhouettes like the dynamic Reveal Jacket worn by all U.S. Olympic medal winners on the medal stand.
What's amazing is that this success covers only 3 months. We absolutely dominated the sports calendar, and we used the power of sport to energize the marketplace and fuel growth. While I'm pleased with our overall momentum, I'm even more excited about what the future holds for our company. 
When we last spoke in June, I outlined our key strategies for growth in fiscal year '17. We talked about driving a continuous cycle of innovation for athletes, about transforming the global marketplace, and then deepening our commitment to lead in this new era of personalized performance. And I'm proud to say we kicked off the year with strong progress in each of those areas.
Starting with innovation, Running is a great example of our complete offense within a category, delivering both performance innovation and sports style innovation in both footwear and apparel. Let's start with the LunarEpic Low which broke new ground this quarter. Delivering a completely new ride, it doesn't feel or look like any running shoe before it. The LunarEpic Low is also translating extremely well to a style audience and it's selling through well beyond expectations.
Innovation at NIKE can also mean reinterpreting our most successful franchises. For example, the Air Zoom Pegasus 33 has proven to be consistently popular. In fact, since its inception, NIKE has sold over 50 million pairs of the Pegasus. 
We also brought new technology to sportswear in Q1, as seen with the Roshe 2 Flyknit and the Air Max 1 Ultra Flyknit. These iconic running styles were paired with our groundbreaking digital knitting to maximize flexibility and comfort like only NIKE can. 
And finally on apparel, among the most successful styles of the quarter are the new dynamic Reveal Jacket that I had mentioned, and performance running tops, shorts and tights. Apparel's accelerated growth is bringing great balance to running.  
I should also call out the women's sportswear apparel category which continues to be another standout growth category for NIKE. 
Innovation, of course, extends far beyond product at NIKE. It's also about transforming the global marketplace by serving and inspiring consumers in ways that are most meaningful to them. It's about creating ways to keep them coming back. And we do that with our long-standing wholesale partners as well as with our own category-focused stores. One of our greatest competitive advantages is our ability to connect physical and digital shopping experiences for our consumers. In more places than ever, NIKE consumers can now shop in-store and through mobile at the same time in a single transaction. And it's clear our investments are paying off. On a currency -- constant-currency basis, DTC revenue for Q1 was up 22%, with the NIKE.com business leading the way at 49% growth. 
Another critical part of the success of NIKE.com continues to be our seamless integration with Nike+. It was a busy quarter for Nike+ as we delivered all access to the best of NIKE with one single sign-on to connect our running, training and sneaker apps. All 3 apps continue to be refreshed with the new features that are more directly tailored to the user.
We also continue to expand our industry leadership in digital innovation through key partnerships. We got a taste of the combined power of NIKE and Apple again this month. And there's much more to come as we focus on solving problems for athletes together, combining NIKE's deep knowledge of sport with Apple's expertise in digital technology.
We're off to a solid start to the fiscal year, and we're confident we'll reach our near-term goals. At the same time, we're always looking ahead to shape the future of sport. In Q1, we took a major leaps to those long-term goals, especially in the promise of personalized performance. Our connection to the consumer through Nike+ is core to that vision, but equally important is disrupting the business model that supports it, or as we like to call it, our Manufacturing Revolution or ManRev. Through our acceleration of ManRev, we're currently seeing the benefit to product cost optimization. And at the same time, we're building capabilities for increased speed to market. 
Beyond that, one of the most exciting opportunities for ManRev is within design. We're continuing to scale our transition from cut and sew, where precision is at the stitch level, to digital design, where precision is at the pixel level. And we're leveraging the power of computational design that uses algorithms to create highly tunable innovations very quickly. 
This summer in Rio athletes, such as Allyson Felix, Elaine Thompson and Mo Farah claimed gold wearing our latest track spikes. Each were developed using computational design, 3D printing and selective laser centering, which allowed us to create and refine prototypes in hours instead of months and align with the athletes' specific training programs and competitive needs. Personalized products and services where and when you need them is the future NIKE is building for tomorrow and delivering today.
You've heard me talk before about how NIKE is built for growth. I'm as confident as ever that we're built to win now, to deliver accelerated growth in the near term. And equally, we're built to win for the long term. As we continue to invest surgically and aggressively to create the future of sport and active life, we'll continue deliver shareholder value for years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Trevor."

Q1 is always an exciting quarter for the NIKE Brand, but this past summer was something really special. It was full of global sports moments where our ability to deliver new and innovative products and create powerful consumer connections was on full display. And with that, we're off to a good start to the year. 
On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 10% for the quarter, led by double-digit growth in all international geographies. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 22%, driven by online growth of 49%, new store growth of 10% [ph]. And finally, global futures are up 7%. 
At NIKE, we take pride in developing authentic relationships with consumers all over the world. And this summer of sport highlighted how we take full advantage of the world's best athletes to deepen those connections. Our Unlimited You campaign during the Olympics offered an excellent example of that power, with its message of providing all athletes to push their limits, reaching more than 480 million views online and 1.1 billion TV impressions around the world. For us, this energy is our engine as it continues to drive excitement and momentum for the NIKE Brand. And ultimately, this brand energy comes to life within our categories and through our geographies.
Let's take a look, starting with our categories. First, running. Growing double digits, this was the highest revenue quarter ever for our performance running category, with strong growth across footwear and apparel. Leading the way for footwear were key products that translate our rich understanding of runners into groundbreaking performance innovations like the LunarEpic Low and the Air Zoom Pegasus 33. What's more, the reinvention of our Free technology reignited demand for one of the most iconic footwear franchises around the world. 
And with our deep passion for running, we continued to connect products and services. Earlier this month, in partnership with Apple, we announced the Apple Watch Nike+, your perfect running partner. Built seamlessly into the watch is the Nike+ Run Club with motivation through smart run reminders and training data like pace and distance available at a glance. I was excited to help introduce the watch at Apple's keynote, and I can't wait for runners everywhere to start using it. 
With running, we never rest on our heels. With even more exciting products in the pipeline, our expansive running strategy will continue to drive tremendous energy for both this important category and across our entire portfolio.
Now let's take a look at NIKE Basketball. Mark mentioned what the U.S. men's and women's teams accomplished in Rio. In particular, I want to highlight Kevin Durant's incredible performance, leading the team throughout the tournament and putting up 30 points in the gold medal game. And as KD 9 hit the market this summer to a great response, there's one thing I want to call out. To give fans a way to celebrate KD's move to Golden State, we offered a blue and yellow colorway on NIKE KD on the same day he joined the team. This was a great example of the kind of real-time personalized opportunities you'll see more of as we invest in capability to deliver products to market when and where fans want them most. 
Kyrie had an amazing summer, winning an Olympic gold and the NBA championships, and his signature Kyrie 2 continues to be met with strong consumer response. We see a very bright future for this young star, and we are excited for the years ahead together with him. 
And finally, the energy for Lebron continues to build after his incredible dominance in the playoffs and his very successful visit to China. And the LeBron Soldier 10 is seeing very strong sell-through in the United States and China, our 2 largest basketball markets. 
We continue to see great opportunities in the power of our relationships in Basketball. We have both the deepest roster of great athletes, from LeBron and KD, to Russell Westbrook and Paul George, to Ben Simmons and [indiscernible] Dawn, [ph] and great universities and clubs around the world. 
Fueled by these relationships, NIKE Basketball continues to energize passion for the game and inspire future generations worldwide. The products are strong, the pipeline is loaded, and I can't wait for the NBA season to start so we can deliver these amazing innovations to our consumers.
In the Jordan Brand, we continue to see huge opportunities as we expand beyond the sport of basketball. Jordan's entrance into the Men's Training category with the Jordan Trainer 1 has been greeted with strong excitement in the marketplace. To support the launch, we created a new training program, the Jordan Breakfast Club based on Michael's legendary work ethic. And as the college football season began, the Jordan Brand joined forces with University of Michigan through a response of real energy. We launched the partnership between these 2 iconic brands with a midnight event attended by thousands of consumers who camped out for the new apparel.
And of course, the Jordan Brand can still lead the world of basketball, as it did with the announcement of the Air Jordan XXXI, with its first of its kind Flyweave and leather upper and a full zoom lens -- and a full-length Zoom Air, enhancing lateral support and court feel. What's more, earlier this month, we launched the Jordan 1 Retro High with the original band red and black colorway, and it sold out within an hour. 
It's clear with continued double-digit revenue growth, the Jordan Brand is more popular than ever.
In both NIKE Basketball and Jordan, we serve the full Lifestyle of Basketball like no other brand, from performance to sports style innovation to sharing our passion for sport with millions of consumers around the world. 
And importantly, our sportswear category, which in Q1 saw its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, continues to amplify the power of our performance categories to serve consumers through sports style innovation. As always, NIKE sportswear challenges conventional notions of performance and style by remixing inspiration from our greatest athletes with modern approach to Lifestyle design.
In Q1, consumers continued their love of footwear like the Huarache, the Tanjun and the Air Force 1, along with running icons we've enhanced with Flyknit, like the Roshe 2 and the Air Max 1 to create a look and feel that only NIKE can offer. And our apparel success was highlighted by the ever-popular and improved Tech Fleece, and the new innovative NIKE dynamic Reveal Jacket, which created the look of victory this summer as athletes wore it proudly on the medal stands throughout the Olympics. With both footwear and apparel, our strong sportswear category continues our leadership in fueling passion for sports lifestyle to a global and diverse audience.
Now let's discuss a few of our key geographies. First, North America, where the brand remained very strong. In Q1, we returned our largest geography back to growth with revenues up 6%. This growth was fueled in part by record awareness and engagement around the Olympics and our Unlimited (sic) [Unlimited You] campaign. 
From a category perspective, we saw growth in sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. And driven by launches of new innovations, we returned signature basketball to a pull market. We also made great progress against clearing excess inventory within the quarter, and we're seeing the benefit of bringing new product into the clean full-price, in-line channels.  Looking forward, we will continue to manage the flow of product into the market as we expand on an already healthy in-line marketplace. 
We've always said, there is no finish line, and that's as true today as it ever was. We continue to see tremendous opportunity offered by the still-untapped potential of our complete offense in women's and in young athletes, across performance and sportswear, and up and down the price points. As we look at this considerable upside, we are as excited as we've ever been about our growth opportunities ahead, both in the near term and into the future.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we see broad-based demand with growth of 10% for the quarter, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Excitement in the marketplace was fueled by the European Championships and the kickoff to the football season with the launch of the new kits from Man City to FC Barcelona to Atlético de Madrid to Paris Saint-Germain, all of which combined advance performance technologies with beautiful design. 
And the energy from this great summer of sports could be seen across Western Europe's marketplace in Q1 from our elevated execution in Paris with Intersport to the House of Hoops on London's Oxford Street with Foot Locker, we are creating compelling retail experiences for our consumers, and these strong partnerships are paying off. At the same time, our own DTC business continues to perform well, growing 30% in the quarter.  
We are rated by consumers as the favorite brand in all key cities in Western Europe, and the momentum we have seen in Q1 reinforces our view that we have tremendous growth potential in this important geography. 
And finally, in Greater China, we continue to see great results with revenue growing 21% for the quarter. We are leveraging consumer sports moments such as the Olympics and the athlete visits by LeBron, KD and Russell Westbrook this summer. This energy is reflected in our category results with tremendous momentum across running, sportswear, Jordan and Nike Basketball.
Just recently, the China retail market became the world's largest market, eclipsing the United States. And with our impressive growth there, we continue to feel confident about the successful strategies we are executing. We are leading with digital, where we're seeing incredible growth in our NIKE.com business as we continue to innovate with a focus on mobile. And we are leveraging the best practices from China across our global portfolio. 
Consumers are also responding to our efforts to create more compelling and unique retail experiences, and the re-profiled doors with our wholesale partners continue to be more productive. We will continue to raise the bar as we scale the number of re-profiled doors in the fleet. 
We feel great about the progress of our business in China, and more importantly, we are more confident than ever in our ability to sustain -- to drive sustained growth in this geography.
Q1 was the start of a new fiscal year for the NIKE Brand, but to us, it's much more than that. It's the continuation of delivering innovative products to the marketplace, connecting our consumers with more fun and authentic experiences and elevating every aspect of our game to help athletes get better.
Thanks. Now here's Andy."

And our consistent delivery of results across all 3 of those",2049,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone on the call.
Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the 3 pillars of NIKE's financial strategy. And our consistent delivery of results across all 3 of those dimensions over the long term is what continues to set NIKE apart in terms of creating value for shareholders.
To be clear, first and foremost, NIKE is a growth company. We're obsessed with bringing inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. And with more than 7 million [ph] athletes on the planet, that's no small feat. We are relentlessly in pursuit of our mission, and our pace and intensity always accelerates around the biggest moments in sport.  So it should come as no surprise that we're off to a great start against our growth agenda for fiscal year '17.
As Mark noted, the past 90 days have been a hit parade for the NIKE Brand and the amazing athletes and teams that we serve, from LeBron and Kyrie winning the NBA Finals in dramatic fashion, all the way through to the unprecedented medal-winning performances of hundreds of NIKE athletes at the Olympic Games in Rio. Those are the moments that bring out the best in NIKE, pushing our brand and our pipeline of innovative, beautifully designed products to new heights. Powered by this inspiring summer of sport, our revenue grew to $9.1 billion in the quarter, up 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a currency-neutral basis.
Expanding profitability is another key pillar of NIKE's financial strategy. While margins contracted in the quarter, driven by foreign exchange and several temporary or discrete items, we continued to benefit from our more systemic, long-term drivers of margin expansion, including higher in-line average selling prices and benefits associated with our footwear Manufacturing Revolution initiatives. In fact, based upon the progress we're making in footwear manufacturing, we announced a new strategic relationship with Apollo Global Management in the quarter aimed at revolutionizing apparel manufacturing. 
SG&A productivity is also increasing the driver of our expanding profitability. In Q1, operating overhead grew just 6% as continued strategic investment was offset by productivity gains. 
Having grown rapidly from a $16 billion enterprise in fiscal year '07 to an over $32 billion enterprise today, we're intensifying our reallocation of the unrivaled resources that we have in our arsenal. Leveraging an approach that we call Edit to Amplify, we are amplifying what matters most in terms of creating value for consumers and driving growth. That includes the path we've been on to double our investment in innovation and revolutionize our supply chain. At the same time, we are editing and realigning resources in areas where the investment we have today is more than sufficient.
Growth and expanding profitability, along with strategic capital deployment, also continue to yield strong returns on invested capital. In the first quarter, our ROIC expanded 160 basis points compared to prior year and is now over 30% for the first time in our history. 
Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the 3 pillars of our financial strategy, and we continue to build momentum toward delivering on our long-term goals across all 3 dimensions through nimble and strategic management. So on that note, let's reflect on our financial results for Q1.
In Q1, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 8%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 10%, with all international geographies growing double digits, and North America returning to growth at 6%. NIKE Brand futures orders are up 5% on a reported basis. Currency-neutral futures orders are growing 7%, driven by a 2% increase in units, with increases in average selling prices contributing 5 percentage points of growth. 
First quarter diluted EPS of $0.73 increased 9% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenue growth, operating overhead leverage, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted 200 basis points in the quarter.  
Now let me take a moment to provide greater dimension on the drivers impacting gross margin in the short term and why we remain so confident in our ability to expand margins over the long term. As I previously noted, the primary drivers of the contraction in Q1 were several temporary or discrete items, including, for example, foreign exchange impacts, our exit from the golf equipment business, a higher mix of off-price sales as compared to Q1 fiscal year '16, and a shift of expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold. 
Note that cost of goods sold includes our investments in innovation, Manufacturing Revolution and other product creation-related resources, which have expanded significantly to fuel long-term growth.  At the same time, we continue to benefit from higher full-price average selling prices; lower oil-based input costs; and the favorable impacts on product cost, driven by our Manufacturing Revolution initiatives.
Turning to SG&A, demand creation increased 25% in the first quarter, primarily driven by investment around the Olympics and the European Football Championships. Operating overhead increased just 6%, as continued strategic investment in DTC, operational infrastructure and consumer-facing digital capabilities were partially offset by productivity gains and the shift of certain expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold.
The effective tax rate for Q1 was 2.5%, significantly lower than prior year, primarily due to a onetime benefit related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter. 
As of August 31, inventories were up 11%. NIKE Brand wholesale units were up just 3%. The remainder of the expansion in inventory was driven by growth to support our fast-growing DTC businesses and a higher average cost of the inventory due to a higher mix of footwear this quarter versus prior year.
Now let's turn to the performance of a few key operating segments. In Q1, North America revenue grew 6% on both currency-neutral and reported basis. Growth was driven by sportswear and Jordan. As Trevor noted, we're also seeing strong consumer demand for the signature performance basketball styles that we've just recently launched as we approach the tipoff of the NBA season later in Q2.  
On a reported basis, North America EBIT decreased 4% in the first quarter, as revenue growth and full-priced gross margin expansion were offset by higher demand creation related to the Olympics and a higher mix of off-price liquidation in Q1 versus the same period in the prior year.
Overall, we feel great about the progress we are making to rebalance supply and demand in the North America marketplace, and we will deliberately keep supply tight to maintain a pull market. Accordingly, we expect North America's reported revenue growth over the balance of the year to outpace the rate of futures growth, driven by stronger sell-through to consumers.
Now turning to Western Europe, where the NIKE Brand continues to be the leading brand in all 10 key cities, and consumer demand for our products remains extremely strong. In Q1, revenue grew to $1.8 billion, up 10% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was primarily driven by sportswear, global football, running and Jordan. We also experienced strong growth across both our DTC businesses and with our wholesale partners. 
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue increased 7%, while EBIT declined 19%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin and demand creation investments around the European Football Championships and the Olympics.
While NIKE brings the energy of the Olympics to consumers in key cities all around the world, the Olympic Games also offered us the opportunity to more deeply connect with consumers in our Emerging Markets geography and specifically ignite the passion for sport in Brazil. 
The stars could not have aligned better for the NIKE Brand, culminating with Neymar's gold-medal winning goal in the historic Maracanã Stadium. Fueled by inspiration from the games, our Emerging Markets geography grew 11% in a currency-neutral basis. Growth was driven by incredibly strong momentum across sportswear, running and Jordan. And the territories with the highest rates of growth were Soco and Pacific. 
We're also very effectively managing supply and demand in the Emerging Markets as reflected in lower inventory unit levels versus prior year. 
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue and EBIT continued to be heavily impacted by FX headwinds. As a result, Q1 reported revenue decreased 2%, while EBIT decreased 34%.
Q1 was another exceptional quarter for NIKE in Greater China, with currency-neutral revenue growth of 21%. Growth was in the double digits in both footwear and apparel, in both DTC and at wholesale, and across nearly every category. Our brand leadership and connection with consumers in China is unrivaled and accelerating. Sell-through at retail remains robust, and inventories are healthy. And as our focus remains on the long term, we continue to prioritize strategic investment in this important geography to fuel strong and sustainable growth. That includes investments in deepening our connections with consumers, consumer-focused experiences in both owned and partner retail, accelerating digital commerce and new supply chain capabilities that enable us to more personally serve consumers in the world's largest market. 
Perhaps, most importantly, we are also investing in our team and talent. The NIKE Brand is winning in China, and the investments we're making now will continue to drive growth and extend our leadership long term.
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue in China was up 15%, while EBIT expanded 12%. 
Q1 was a solid start to the year. We have strong brand momentum and a pipeline of innovative performance and sportswear product that is resonating with consumers. Accordingly, our outlook for fiscal year '17 remains largely unchanged in terms of growth and the profitability of our business. 
Specifically, for the full year, our revenue expectations remain in line with prior guidance, high single-digit reported revenue growth, and high single to low double-digit currency-neutral revenue growth. 
For Q2, we expect reported revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range, at or slightly below our rate of reported futures growth, reflecting FX headwinds.
Futures orders continue to be an important and valuable aspect of our operating model. That said, the relationship between reported futures and reported revenue in a given quarter has become less correlated based on our evolving business mix. Accordingly, over the past several quarters, we have been providing greater dimension on our outlook for the business. Going forward, based upon our own evaluation and taking into account input that we have received from stakeholders, we will change the sequencing of our futures reporting. Futures will first be referenced in the context of the broader guidance that we provide on the earnings conference call rather than as a standalone forward-looking metric in our earnings release. We will also continue to report futures in detail in our quarterly filings with the SEC.
Turning to gross margin, we now expect the full year rate to contract. For Q2, we expect gross margin to contract by approximately 125 basis points, with the rate in the second half of the fiscal year approaching flat versus the prior year. 
Our underlying fundamental drivers of gross margin expansion remains strong, including higher full-price average selling price and product cost optimization. However, those favorable drivers are being offset in the short term by the aforementioned temporary or discrete factors, some of which have a continuing impact on the balance of year. 
For total SG&A, we now expect full year growth in the mid- to high single digits, with Q2 growing in the low to mid- single-digit range, as our continued strategic investments are increasingly being funded or offset by SG&A productivity gains as we Edit to Amplify. 
In Q2, we expect other income or expense to be roughly 0. 
For the full year, our guidance remains unchanged from prior guidance. 
We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 17% for the full year, taking into account the rate in Q1, and an average rate of about 22% for Q2 through Q4.
We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year, and as we look to the balance of year and beyond, our level of intensity is high.

Actually, that's a good question. Let me take that. First of all, on a little more macro level, I think that as I mentioned, the current environment really plays right into NIKE's strengths, meaning with the athletic footwear and apparel segments being so strong and outpacing the rest of the footwear and apparel industry. We're actually quite well represented in leading product on both the performance and the sportswear side of the business as we talked about. There's many things that we're excited about, including some of the product that's in the market right now that I think is -- has a lot of upside opportunity to more completely leverage things in performance -- products and performance. Signature, we talked about. LeBron Soldier; the KD9; new KYRIE; Paul George signatures shoes; of course, the Air Jordan XXXI. Those are great examples. Running, we talked about the LunarEpic Low, really incredible new cushioning system there for a great ride. Pegasus, the update on that, a real classic apparel. The running performance category, both tops and bottoms, women's sports bras. I mean, those are some examples on the performance side. And then on the sportswear side, we've got classics that we've reissued as well as new updates, including innovation as part of those classics: Air Force 1, Air Max, Presto, Sock Dart, the Roshe 2, Huarache, just to name some of those. In terms of the new upcoming innovation, in Q2, we've got more signature basketball coming. You know the LeBron 14 is in the on-deck circle. It's another great signature product for LeBron. The Air VaporMax, which we talked about in March, which is a phenomenal new modern interpretation of Nike Air cushioning. It's incredible both in how it performs, but how it looks. We have new iterations of Free product. In apparel, we've got new Base Layer technology. Tech running, new Hyperwarm apparel collection, which we're excited about. Jordan is expanding beyond the basketball category to training and running, including sportswear. We -- Trevor mentioned the new Apple Watch Nike+ version, which is the start of, I think, intensifying that relationship between NIKE and Apple. And then we've got some -- on the sportswear side, some new innovative interpretations of, again, some of our sportswear classics. Big anniversaries coming, with the Air Max 1, the Air Max 97, the Air Force 1 35th anniversary Cortez, modern comfort collection in the Jordan category as well as NIKE. So we'll bring some real innovation to both the sportswear category with the classics as well as some new products. So there's an array -- I didn't mention the HyperAdapt, by the way, that's -- probably should be to at the top of the list. It's gotten a lot of attention, as it should, because it really ushers in a whole new wave of adaptive technology. So we're bringing innovation, obviously, to performance, but also to sports style innovation. And I think it's interesting that the consumer doesn't necessarily distinguish between the 2. Much of -- many of our performance products are worn in terms of the street, and they're quite fashionable. That isn't necessarily our intent out of the box, but we're definitely seeing that be the case as well. So very excited about the innovation that's coming, obviously, in product, and our innovation goes well beyond product. We talked about ManRev. We talked about digital. We talked about personalized performance, Nike+, NIKE.com, innovations in retail. So this has really always been, always will be the engine for growth for the company. And I'll just say that we're as aggressive as ever in investing in those biggest opportunities. And I'm not including the things I can't talk about, which we are obviously very excited about as well. So..."

Overall, we feel great about the progress that we're making from an inventory -- or maybe more broadly a supply-and-demand management perspective. As I noted, our overall enterprise inventory growth was driven by only 3 percentage point increase in units. And actually, we saw a decline in North America, in particular, in inventory, both in the value of that inventory as well as the units, actually, declining even greater. So while I noted that in margin, off-price sales had a negative mix impact, that was versus the prior year in the first quarter. We're actually continuing to see those off-price sales tighten up as we make the progress we told you we would in terms of returning to a healthy pull market in North America."

And maybe to give a broader context around the inventory of the marketplace, I would say, really, around the world, our in-line channels are very healthy really across the board. So we feel that we've made great progress in North America to make sure that we have obviously cleared the excess inventory, and we're bringing in new products into the marketplace, and we're seeing the result of that. Going forward, we will continue to manage the supply into the marketplace proactively to make sure that we maintain a pull market. If you look across to Western Europe, the inventory is actually well in line with revenue growth. Maybe the only difference would be on the value side, you're certainly seeing foreign exchange have some impact. Then in China, we're certainly seeing inventories are very healthy there. And you've seeing some inventory build as we prepare for Singles Day, which is obviously a big impact. And so we're excited about that. So across the board, we feel very confident about our -- the marketplace and the inventory position that we're in today, and we're just excited about the pipeline of products that are coming through."

I would say the 2 biggest drivers of the margin contraction versus prior year were the bucket of discrete or temporary items that we referenced and foreign exchange. So those items most notably included the shift of operating overhead expenses into cost of goods sold. So that is a movement within our P&L versus a change in trajectory. And as I mentioned, it's not always that evident to those on the call or otherwise, that included in gross margin or in cost of goods sold is not just the product cost, but also the investments in the team and resources that we deploy against innovation and Manufacturing Revolution and otherwise. Golf, as you highlighted, was another factor within gross margin, both some charges that we took as well as the impact of exiting the golf equipment business. Frankly, it's a great example of the Edit to Amplify approach that we've talked about in the past and we've talked about on this call increasingly being applied to operating overhead. That is having an impact on our margin in the short term and will over the balance of the year. It's not reported as a discontinued operation. It's in our numbers. But we are making those decisions because we believe our long-term focus, in other words, what we will amplify is our focus on footwear and apparel and drive greater growth and profitability there. And we think we'll see the benefits in margin and return on invested capital from the decision we made to edit."

NIKE's always -- we've always started with the athlete. It's how we crave the insights to drive the innovative product, and then we amplify that across the portfolio. And sportswear is a really important means of doing that. We see tremendous growth in all areas, specifically in both dimensions of performance and sportswear. We just had our most successful quarter ever for performance running. And our sportswear business at the same time continues to be a massive growth driver for the company. So it's really, for us, just the balance between the 2 and the relationship between the 2. That intersection between performance and style, I think, is stronger than ever. And by the way, innovation is a huge part of creating a new aesthetic, and lifestyle product does prioritize, I think, at this stage, with the consumer comfort and lightweight and breathability. So performance is element of sportswear for NIKE, and that's what helps to separate and distinguish NIKE in the marketplace."

I think, though, the difference, the inflection point you mentioned is really more about the -- taking it to scale with partners like Flex, but then across our whole manufacturing partner base. So we're really modernizing not just with any one partner, but using that innovation to drive it across the whole base. So we talked about Flex and footwear. Apollo is a more recent focus for us on the apparel side, our investment in the Advanced Product Creation Center here on the NIKE campus, some amazing innovations in -- looking at disruptive methods of make. Obviously, we're aware of Flyknit. 3D printing, is -- I think it's got a lot of potential for scale.

Before I turn the call over to Mr. Sharan, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. 
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including Equipment, Converse Hurley and NIKE Golf are not included in these futures numbers. 
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures including references to wholesale equivalent sales and constant-dollar revenue. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as financial measure of actual results. Similarly, references to constant-dollar revenue are intended to provide context as to the performance of the business eliminating foreign exchange fluctuations. 
Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. Discussion of nonpublic financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, investors.nike.com.

This summer proved just how powerful sport can be around the world. Some of the greatest performances of all time entertained us and, in the process, inspired a new generation of athletes to get moving. At the same time, the look of sport continues to influence everyday style around the world. As a result, new brands are entering into the athletic landscape. The activewear market continues to outpace the overall apparel and footwear market, which itself continues to outpace global GDP growth. 
It's a great time to be in the business of sports, and as the market leader, this is a great time to be NIKE. We are on the front end of all this growth, a driving force behind the expanding market. We not only see the upside across the landscape; we have both the scale and the skill to act on it. We believe in our strategy and in our complete offense. It's proven to be NIKE's greatest competitive edge. We win now by editing our opportunities aggressively, we sharpen our execution, and we focus on those with the greatest impact and highest return. And we build for the future by intensifying our investments in our brand and innovation. 
NIKE is on the offense like never before, driving up a global athletic market that holds tremendous potential for growth. Q1 is the start of what's going to be a strong year for our company.
Let's review the financial highlights. NIKE, Inc. first quarter revenues were up 8%, growing to $9.1 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10%. Gross margin was 45.5%, down 200 basis points to prior year. Earnings per share increased 9% to $0.73, and we delivered ROIC of 30.5%. 
It was a summer of amazing sports moments, and it all began with an historic NBA Finals win, led by LeBron and Kyrie. It continued with Chile taking the Copa América title for the second time in a row. And weeks later at Wimbledon, Serena Williams celebrated her 22nd grand slam, tying her for the most singles titles in the open era. And the next day, the Euro Champs featured the first-ever all-NIKE final with Portugal defeating France. 
And of course, we were all captivated by the Rio Olympics last month. Everywhere you looked in Rio, you could feel NIKE's support of the athlete. Over 1,500 Olympians from 60 countries won 189 medals wearing our latest innovations. If NIKE were a country, we would have stood atop the medal count leaderboard. 
We saw so many inspiring performances. A few of the highlights for me were Neymar scoring the final penalty kick, leading Brazil to their first-ever Olympic gold in men's football; Mo Farah becoming the second man to win both the 5,000- and 10,000-meter races in consecutive Olympics; and with 21 of the 2014 USA basketball players wearing NIKE or Jordan footwear, both the men's and women's teams winning gold. It's moments like these that validate our obsession with the athlete. They serve as the ultimate proving grounds.
I'm happy to say we not only owned the fields of play with performance products like the KD9, but we also set the tone for sports style innovation through new apparel silhouettes like the dynamic Reveal Jacket worn by all U.S. Olympic medal winners on the medal stand.
What's amazing is that this success covers only 3 months. We absolutely dominated the sports calendar, and we used the power of sport to energize the marketplace and fuel growth. While I'm pleased with our overall momentum, I'm even more excited about what the future holds for our company. 
When we last spoke in June, I outlined our key strategies for growth in fiscal year '17. We talked about driving a continuous cycle of innovation for athletes, about transforming the global marketplace and then deepening our commitment to lead in this new era of personalized performance. And I'm proud to say we kicked off the year with strong progress in each of those areas.
Starting with innovation, Running is a great example of our complete offense within a category, delivering both performance innovation and sports style innovation in both footwear and apparel. Let's start with the LunarEpic Low which broke new ground this quarter. Delivering a completely new ride, it doesn't feel or look like any running shoe before it. The LunarEpic Low is also translating extremely well to a style audience and it's selling through well beyond expectations.
Innovation at NIKE can also mean reinterpreting our most successful franchises. For example, the Air Zoom Pegasus 33 has proven to be consistently popular. In fact, since its inception, NIKE has sold over 50 million pairs of the Pegasus. 
We also brought new technology to sportswear in Q1, as seen with the Roshe 2 Flyknit and the Air Max 1 Ultra Flyknit. These iconic running styles were paired with our groundbreaking digital knitting to maximize flexibility and comfort like only NIKE can. 
And finally in apparel, among the most successful styles of the quarter are the new dynamic Reveal Jacket that I had mentioned, and performance running tops, shorts and tights. Apparel's accelerated growth is bringing great balance to running.  
I should also call out the women's sportswear apparel category which continues to be another standout growth category for NIKE. 
Innovation, of course, extends far beyond product at NIKE. It's also about transforming the global marketplace by serving and inspiring consumers in ways that are most meaningful to them. It's about creating ways to keep them coming back. And we do that with our long-standing wholesale partners as well as with our own category-focused stores. One of our greatest competitive advantages is our ability to connect physical and digital shopping experiences for our consumers. In more places than ever, NIKE consumers can now shop in-store and through mobile at the same time in a single transaction. And it's clear our investments are paying off. On a currency -- constant-currency basis, DTC revenue for Q1 was up 22%, with the NIKE.com business leading the way at 49% growth. 
Another critical part of the success of NIKE.com continues to be our seamless integration with Nike+. It was a busy quarter for Nike+ as we delivered all access to the best of NIKE with one single sign-on to connect our running, training and sneaker apps. All 3 apps continue to be refreshed with the new features that are more directly tailored to the user.
We also continue to expand our industry leadership in digital innovation through key partnerships. We got a taste of the combined power of NIKE and Apple again this month. And there's much more to come as we focus on solving problems for athletes together, combining NIKE's deep knowledge of sport with Apple's expertise in digital technology.
We're off to a solid start to the fiscal year, and we're confident we'll reach our near-term goals. At the same time, we're always looking ahead to shape the future of sport. In Q1, we took major leaps toward those long-term goals, especially in the promise of personalized performance. Our connection to the consumer through Nike+ is core to that vision, but equally important is disrupting the business model that supports it, or, as we like to call it, our Manufacturing Revolution or ManRev. Through our acceleration of ManRev, we're currently seeing the benefit to product cost optimization. And at the same time, we're building capabilities for increased speed to market. 
Beyond that, one of the most exciting opportunities for ManRev is within design. We're continuing to scale our transition from cut and sew, where precision is at the stitch level, to digital design, where precision is at the pixel level. And we're leveraging the power of computational design that uses algorithms to create highly tunable innovations very quickly. 
This summer in Rio, athletes such as Allyson Felix, Elaine Thompson and Mo Farah claimed gold wearing our latest track spikes. Each were developed using computational design, 3D printing and selective laser centering, which allowed us to create and refine prototypes in hours instead of months and align with the athletes' specific training programs and competitive needs. Personalized products and services where and when you need them is the future NIKE is building for tomorrow and delivering today.
You've heard me talk before about how NIKE is built for growth. I'm as confident as ever that we're built to win now, to deliver accelerated growth in the near term. And equally, we're built to win for the long term. As we continue to invest surgically and aggressively to create the future of sport and active life, we'll continue deliver shareholder value for years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Trevor."

Q1 is always an exciting quarter for the NIKE Brand, but this past summer was something really special. It was full of global sports moments where our ability to deliver new and innovative products and create powerful consumer connections was on full display. And with that, we're off to a good start to the year. 
On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 10% for the quarter, led by double-digit growth in all international geographies. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 22%, driven by online growth of 49%, new store growth and comp store growth of 8%. And finally, global futures are up 7%. 
At NIKE, we take pride in developing authentic relationships with consumers all over the world. And this summer of sport highlighted how we take full advantage of the world's best athletes to deepen those connections. Our Unlimited You campaign during the Olympics offered an excellent example of that power, with its message of inviting all athletes to push their limits, reaching more than 480 million views online and 1.1 billion TV impressions around the world. For us, this energy is our engine as it continues to drive excitement and momentum for the NIKE Brand. 
And ultimately, this brand energy comes to life within our categories and through our geographies. Let's take a look, starting with our categories. First, Running. Growing double digits, this was the highest revenue quarter ever for our performance running category, with strong growth across footwear and apparel. Leading the way for footwear were key products that translate our rich understanding of runners into groundbreaking performance innovations like the LunarEpic Low and the Air Zoom Pegasus 33. What's more, the reinvention of our Free technology reignited demand for one of the most iconic footwear franchises around the world. 
And with our deep passion for running, we continued to connect products and services. Earlier this month, in partnership with Apple, we announced the Apple Watch Nike+, your perfect running partner. Built seamlessly into the watch is the Nike+ Run Club with motivation through smart run reminders and training data like pace and distance available at a glance. I was excited to help introduce the watch at Apple's keynote, and I can't wait for runners everywhere to start using it. 
With Running, we never rest on our heels. With even more exciting products in the pipeline, our expansive running strategy will continue to drive tremendous energy for both this important category and across our entire portfolio.
Now let's take a look at Nike Basketball. Mark mentioned what the U.S. men's and women's teams accomplished in Rio. In particular, I want to highlight Kevin Durant's incredible performance, leading the team throughout the tournament and putting up 30 points in the gold medal game. And as KD9 hit the market this summer to a great response, there's one thing I want to call out. To give fans a way to celebrate KD's move to Golden State, we offered a blue and yellow colorway on NIKEiD on the same day he joined the team. This was a great example of the kind of real-time personalized opportunities you'll see more of as we invest in capability to deliver products to market when and where fans want them most. 
Kyrie had an amazing summer, winning an Olympic gold and the NBA championship, and his signature Kyrie 2 continues to be met with strong consumer response. We see a very bright future for this young star, and we are excited for the years ahead together with him. 
And finally, the energy for Lebron continues to build after his incredible dominance in the playoffs and his very successful visit to China. And the LeBron Soldier 10 is seeing very strong sell-through in the United States and China, our 2 largest basketball markets. 
We continue to see great opportunities in the power of our relationships in basketball. We have both the deepest roster of great athletes, from LeBron and KD, to Russell Westbrook and Paul George, to Ben Simmons and Elena Delle Donne, and great universities and clubs around the world. 
Fueled by these relationships, Nike Basketball continues to energize passion for the game and inspire future generations worldwide. The products are strong, the pipeline is loaded, and I can't wait for the NBA season to start so we can deliver these amazing innovations to our consumers.
In the Jordan Brand, we continue to see huge opportunities as we expand beyond the sport of basketball. Jordan's entrance into the Men's Training category with the Jordan Trainer 1 has been greeted with strong excitement in the marketplace. To support the launch, we created a new training program, the Jordan Breakfast Club based on Michael's legendary work ethic. And as the college football season began, the Jordan Brand joined forces with University of Michigan to a response of real energy. We launched the partnership between these 2 iconic brands with a midnight event attended by thousands of consumers who camped out for the new apparel.
And of course, the Jordan Brand can still lead the world of basketball, as it did with the announcement of the Air Jordan XXXI, with its first of its kind Flyweave and leather upper and a full zoom length -- and a full-length Zoom Air, enhancing lateral support and court feel. What's more, earlier this month, we launched the Jordan 1 Retro High with the original ""Banned"" red and black colorway, and it sold out within an hour. It's clear with continued double-digit revenue growth, the Jordan Brand is more popular than ever.
In both Nike Basketball and Jordan, we serve the full lifestyle of basketball like no other brand, from performance to sports style innovation, to sharing our passion for sport with millions of consumers around the world. 
And importantly, our Sportswear category, which in Q1 saw its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, continues to amplify the power of our performance categories to serve consumers through sport- style innovation. As always, Nike Sportswear challenges conventional notions of performance and style by remixing inspiration from our greatest athletes with modern approach to Lifestyle design.
In Q1, consumers continued their love of footwear like the Huarache, the Tanjun and the Air Force 1, along with running icons we've enhanced with Flyknit, like the Roshe 2 and the Air Max 1 to create a look and feel that only NIKE can offer. And our apparel success was highlighted by the ever-popular and improved Tech Fleece, and the new innovative NIKE dynamic Reveal Jacket, which created the look of victory this summer as athletes wore it proudly on the medal stands throughout the Olympics. With both footwear and apparel, our strong Sportswear category continues our leadership in fueling passion for sports lifestyle to a global and diverse audience.
Now let's discuss a few of our key geographies. First, North America, where the brand remains very strong. In Q1, we returned our largest geography back to growth with revenues up 6%. This growth was fueled in part by record awareness and engagement around the Olympics and our Unlimited campaign. 
From a category perspective, we saw growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. And driven by launches of new innovations, we returned signature basketball to a pull market. We also made great progress against clearing excess inventory within the quarter, and we're seeing the benefit of bringing new product into the clean full-price, in-line channels.  Looking forward, we will continue to manage the flow of product into the market as we expand on an already healthy in-line marketplace. 
We've always said, there is no finish line, and that's as true today as it ever was. We continue to see tremendous opportunity offered by the still untapped potential of our complete offense in women's and in young athletes, across performance and sportswear, and up and down the price points. As we look at this considerable upside, we are as excited as we've ever been about our growth opportunities ahead, both in the near term and into the future.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we see broad-based demand with growth of 10% for the quarter, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Excitement in the marketplace was fueled by the European Championships and the kickoff to football season with the launch of the new kits from Man City to FC Barcelona to Atlético de Madrid to Paris Saint-Germain, all of which combined advance performance technologies with beautiful design. 
And the energy from this great summer of sports could be seen across Western Europe's marketplace in Q1. From our elevated execution in Paris with Intersport to the House of Hoops on London's Oxford Street with Foot Locker, we are creating compelling retail experiences for our consumers, and these strong partnerships are paying off. At the same time, our own DTC business continues to perform well, growing 30% in the quarter.  
We are rated by consumers as the favorite brand in all key cities in Western Europe, and the momentum we have seen in Q1 reinforces our view that we have tremendous growth potential in this important geography. 
And finally, in Greater China, we continue to see great results, with revenue growing 21% for the quarter. We are leveraging consumer sports moments such as the Olympics and the athlete visits by LeBron, KD and Russell Westbrook this summer. This energy is reflected in our category results, with tremendous momentum across Running, Sportswear, Jordan and Nike Basketball.
Just recently, the China retail market became the world's largest market, eclipsing the United States. And with our impressive growth there, we continue to feel confident about the successful strategies we are executing. We are leading with digital, where we're seeing incredible growth in our NIKE.com business as we continue to innovate with a focus on mobile. 
And we are leveraging the best practices from China across our global portfolio. Consumers are also responding to our efforts to create more compelling and unique retail experiences, and the re-profiled doors with our wholesale partners continue to be more productive. We will continue to raise the bar as we scale the number of re-profiled doors in the fleet. 
We feel great about the progress of our business in China, and more importantly, we are more confident than ever in our ability to sustain -- to drive sustained growth in this geography.
Q1 was the start of a new fiscal year for the NIKE Brand, but to us, it's much more than that. It's the continuation of delivering innovative products to the marketplace, connecting our consumers with more fun and authentic experiences and elevating every aspect of our game to help athletes get better.
Thanks. Now here's Andy."

And our consistent delivery of results across all 3 of those",2048,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone on the call.
Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the 3 pillars of NIKE's financial strategy. And our consistent delivery of results across all 3 of those dimensions over the long term is what continues to set NIKE apart in terms of creating value for shareholders.
To be clear, first and foremost, NIKE is a growth company. We're obsessed with bringing inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. And with more than 7 billion athletes on the planet, that's no small feat. We are relentlessly in pursuit of our mission, and our pace and intensity always accelerates around the biggest moments in sport. So it should come as no surprise that we're off to a great start against our growth agenda for fiscal year '17.
As Mark noted, the past 90 days have been a hit parade for the NIKE Brand and the amazing athletes and teams that we serve, from LeBron and Kyrie winning the NBA Finals in dramatic fashion, all the way through to the unprecedented medal-winning performances of hundreds of NIKE athletes at the Olympic Games in Rio. Those are the moments that bring out the best in NIKE, pushing our brand and our pipeline of innovative, beautifully designed products to new heights. Powered by this inspiring summer of sport, our revenue grew to $9.1 billion in the quarter, up 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a currency-neutral basis.
Expanding profitability is another key pillar of NIKE's financial strategy. While margins contracted in the quarter driven by foreign exchange and several temporary or discrete items, we continued to benefit from our more systemic, long-term drivers of margin expansion, including higher in-line average selling prices and benefits associated with our footwear Manufacturing Revolution initiatives. In fact, based upon the progress we're making in footwear manufacturing, we announced a new strategic relationship with Apollo Global Management in the quarter aimed at revolutionizing apparel manufacturing. 
SG&A productivity is also increasingly a driver of our expanding profitability. In Q1, operating overhead grew just 6% as continued strategic investment was offset by productivity gains. Having grown rapidly from a $16 billion enterprise in fiscal year '07 to an over $32 billion enterprise today, we're intensifying our reallocation of the unrivaled resources that we have in our arsenal, leveraging an approach that we call Edit to Amplify. We are amplifying what matters most in terms of creating value for consumers and driving growth. That includes the path we've been on to double our investment in innovation and revolutionize our supply chain. At the same time, we are editing and realigning resources in areas where the investment we have today is more than sufficient.
Growth and expanding profitability, along with strategic capital deployment, also continue to yield strong returns on invested capital. In the first quarter, our ROIC expanded 160 basis points compared to prior year and is now over 30% for the first time in our history. 
Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the 3 pillars of our financial strategy, and we continue to build momentum toward delivering on our long-term goals across all 3 dimensions through nimble and strategic management. So on that note, let's reflect on our financial results for Q1.
In Q1, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 8%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 10%, with all international geographies growing double digits and North America returning to growth at 6%. NIKE Brand futures orders are up 5% on a reported basis. Currency-neutral futures orders are growing 7%, driven by a 2% increase in units, with increases in average selling prices contributing 5 percentage points of growth. 
First quarter diluted EPS of $0.73 increased 9% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenue growth, operating overhead leverage, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted 200 basis points in the quarter.  
Now let me take a moment to provide greater dimension on the drivers impacting gross margin in the short term and why we remain so confident in our ability to expand margins over the long term. As I previously noted, the primary drivers of the contraction in Q1 were several temporary or discrete items, including, for example, foreign exchange impacts, our exit from the golf equipment business, a higher mix of off-price sales as compared to Q1 fiscal year '16, and a shift of expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold. 
Note that cost of goods sold includes our investments in innovation, Manufacturing Revolution and other product creation-related resources, which have expanded significantly to fuel long-term growth.  At the same time, we continue to benefit from higher full-price average selling prices, lower oil-based input costs and the favorable impacts on product cost driven by our Manufacturing Revolution initiatives.
Turning to SG&A. Demand creation increased 25% in the first quarter, primarily driven by investment around the Olympics and the European Football Championships. Operating overhead increased just 6% as continued strategic investment in DTC, operational infrastructure and consumer-facing digital capabilities were partially offset by productivity gains and the shift of certain expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold.
The effective tax rate for Q1 was 2.5%, significantly lower than prior year, primarily due to a onetime benefit related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter. 
As of August 31, inventories were up 11%. NIKE Brand wholesale units were up just 3%. The remainder of the expansion in inventory was driven by growth to support our fast-growing DTC businesses and a higher average cost of the inventory due to a higher mix of footwear this quarter versus prior year.
Now let's turn to the performance of a few key operating segments. In Q1, North America revenue grew 6% on both a currency-neutral and reported basis. Growth was driven by Sportswear and Jordan. As Trevor noted, we're also seeing strong consumer demand for the signature performance basketball styles that we've just recently launched as we approach the tipoff of the NBA season later in Q2.  
On a reported basis, North America EBIT decreased 4% in the first quarter, as revenue growth and full-priced gross margin expansion were offset by higher demand creation related to the Olympics and a higher mix of off-price liquidation in Q1 versus the same period in the prior year.
Overall, we feel great about the progress we are making to rebalance supply and demand in the North America marketplace, and we will deliberately keep supply tight to maintain a pull market. Accordingly, we expect North America's reported revenue growth over the balance of the year to outpace the rate of futures growth, driven by stronger sell-through to consumers.
Now turning to Western Europe, where the NIKE Brand continues to be the leading brand in all 10 key cities, and consumer demand for our product remains extremely strong. In Q1, revenue grew to $1.8 billion, up 10% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was primarily driven by Sportswear, Global Football, Running and Jordan. We also experienced strong growth across both our DTC businesses and with our wholesale partners. 
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue increased 7%, while EBIT declined 19%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin and demand creation investments around the European Football Championships and the Olympics.
While NIKE brings the energy of the Olympics to consumers in key cities all around the world, the Olympic Games also offered us the opportunity to more deeply connect with consumers in our Emerging Markets geography and specifically ignite the passion for sport in Brazil. 
The stars could not have aligned better for the NIKE Brand, culminating with Neymar's gold-medal winning goal in the historic Maracanã Stadium. Fueled by inspiration from the games, our Emerging Markets geography grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was driven by incredibly strong momentum across Sportswear, Running and Jordan. And the territories with the highest rates of growth were Soco and Pacific. 
We're also very effectively managing supply and demand in the Emerging Markets as reflected in lower inventory unit levels versus prior year. 
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue and EBIT continued to be heavily impacted by FX headwinds. As a result, Q1 reported revenue decreased 2%, while EBIT decreased 34%.
Q1 was another exceptional quarter for NIKE in Greater China, with currency-neutral revenue growth of 21%. Growth was in the double digits in both footwear and apparel, in both DTC and at wholesale, and across nearly every category. Our brand leadership and connection with consumers in China is unrivaled and accelerating. Sell-through at retail remains robust, and inventories are healthy. And as our focus remains on the long term, we continue to prioritize strategic investment in this important geography to fuel strong and sustainable growth. That includes investments in: deepening our connections with consumers; consumer-focused experiences in both owned and partner retail; accelerating digital commerce; and new supply chain capabilities that enable us to more personally serve consumers in the world's largest market. 
Perhaps, most importantly, we are also investing in our team and talent. The NIKE Brand is winning in China, and the investments we're making now will continue to drive growth and extend our leadership long term.
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue in China was up 15%, while EBIT expanded 12%. 
Q1 was a solid start to the year. We have strong brand momentum and a pipeline of innovative performance and sportswear product that is resonating with consumers. Accordingly, our outlook for fiscal year '17 remains largely unchanged in terms of growth and the profitability of our business. 
Specifically, for the full year, our revenue expectations remain in line with prior guidance: high single-digit reported revenue growth; and high single to low double-digit currency-neutral revenue growth. 
For Q2, we expect reported revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range, at or slightly below our rate of reported futures growth, reflecting FX headwinds.
Futures orders continue to be an important and valuable aspect of our operating model. That said, the relationship between reported futures and reported revenue in a given quarter has become less correlated based on our evolving business mix. Accordingly, over the past several quarters, we have been providing greater dimension on our outlook for the business. Going forward, based upon our own evaluation and taking into account input that we have received from stakeholders, we will change the sequencing of our futures reporting. Futures will first be referenced in the context of the broader guidance that we provide on the earnings conference call rather than as a stand-alone forward-looking metric in our earnings release. We will also continue to report futures in detail in our quarterly filings with the SEC.
Turning to gross margin, we now expect the full year rate to contract. For Q2, we expect gross margin to contract by approximately 125 basis points, with the rate in the second half of the fiscal year approaching flat versus the prior year. 
Our underlying fundamental drivers of gross margin expansion remains strong, including higher full-price average selling price and product cost optimization. However, those favorable drivers are being offset in the short term by the aforementioned temporary or discrete factors, some of which have a continuing impact on the balance of year. 
For total SG&A, we now expect full year growth in the mid- to high single digits, with Q2 growing in the low to mid-single-digit range, as our continued strategic investments are increasingly being funded or offset by SG&A productivity gains as we Edit to Amplify. 
In Q2, we expect other income or expense to be roughly 0. 
For the full year, our guidance remains unchanged from prior guidance. 
We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 17% for the full year, taking into account the rate in Q1 and an average rate of about 22% for Q2 through Q4.
We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year, and as we look to the balance of year and beyond, our level of intensity is high. And we are more obsessed than ever with creating extraordinary value for consumers and translating that into sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth for NIKE and our shareholders.
With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

We're actually quite well represented in leading product on both the performance and the sportswear side of the business as we talked about. There's many things that we're excited about, including some of the product that's in the market right now that I think is -- has a lot of upside opportunity to more completely leverage things in performance -- products and performance. Signature, we talked about; LeBron Soldier; the KD9; new KYRIE; Paul George signatures shoes; of course, the Air Jordan XXXI, those are great examples. Running, we talked about the LunarEpic Low, really incredible new cushioning system there for a great ride. Pegasus, the update on a real classic apparel. The running performance category, both tops and bottoms, women's sports bras. I mean, those are some examples on the performance side. And then on the sportswear side, we've got classics that we've reissued as well as new updates, including innovation as part of those classics: Air Force 1, Air Max, Presto, Sock Dart, the Roshe 2, Huarache, just to name some of those. In terms of new upcoming innovation, in Q2, we've got more signature basketball coming. You know the LeBron 14 is in the on-deck circle. It's another great signature product for LeBron. The Air VaporMax, which we talked about in March, which is a phenomenal new modern interpretation of Nike Air cushioning. It's incredible both in how it performs, but how it looks. We have new iterations of Free product. In apparel, we've got new Base Layer technology. Tech running, new Hyperwarm apparel collection, which we're excited about. Jordan is expanding beyond the Basketball category to Training and Running, including Sportswear. We -- Trevor mentioned the new Apple Watch Nike+ version, which is the start of, I think, intensifying that relationship between NIKE and Apple. And then we've got some -- on the Sportswear side, some new innovative interpretations of, again, some of our sportswear classics. Big anniversaries coming with the Air Max 1, the Air Max 97, the Air Force 1 35th anniversary Cortez, modern comfort collection in the Jordan category as well as NIKE. So we'll bring some real innovation to both the Sportswear category with the classics as well as some new products. So there's an array -- AND I didn't mention the HyperAdapt, by the way, that probably should be toward the top of the list. It's gotten a lot of attention, as it should, because it really ushers in a whole new wave of adaptive technology. So we're bringing innovation, obviously, to performance, but also to sports style innovation. And I think it's interesting that the consumer doesn't necessarily distinguish between the 2. Much of -- many of our performance products are worn in terms of the street, and they're quite fashionable. That isn't necessarily our intent out of the box, but we're definitely seeing that be the case as well. So very excited about the innovation that's coming, obviously, in product, and our innovation goes well beyond product. We talked about ManRev. We talked about digital. We talked about personalized performance, Nike+, NIKE.com, innovations in retail. So this has really always been, always will be the engine for growth for the company. And I'll just say that we're as aggressive as ever in investing in those biggest opportunities. And I'm not including the things I can't talk about, which we are obviously very excited about as well. So..."

Overall, we feel great about the progress that we're making from an inventory, or maybe more broadly, a supply-and-demand management perspective. As I noted, our overall enterprise inventory growth was driven by only 3 percentage point increase in units. And actually, we saw a decline in North America, in particular, in inventory, both in the value of that inventory as well as the units, actually, declining even greater. So while I noted that in margin, off-price sales had a negative mix impact, that was versus the prior year in the first quarter. We're actually continuing to see those off-price sales tighten up as we make the progress we told you we would in terms of returning to a healthy pull market in North America."

And maybe just to give a broader context around the inventory of the marketplace, I would say, really, around the world, our in-line channels are very healthy really across the board. So we feel that we've made great progress in North America to make sure that we have obviously cleared the excess inventory, and we're bringing in new products into the marketplace, and we're seeing the result of that. Going forward, we will continue to manage the supply into the marketplace proactively to make sure that we maintain a pull market. If you look across to Western Europe, the inventory is actually well in line with revenue growth. Maybe the only difference would be on the value side, you're certainly seeing foreign exchange have some impact. Then in China, we're certainly seeing inventories are very healthy there. And you've seeing some inventory build as we prepare for Singles Day, which is obviously a big impact. And so we're excited about that. So across the board, we feel very confident about our -- the marketplace and the inventory position that we're in today, and we're just excited about the pipeline of products that are coming through."

I would say the 2 biggest drivers of the margin contraction versus prior year were the bucket of discrete or temporary items that we referenced and foreign exchange. So those items most notably included the shift of operating overhead expenses into cost of goods sold. So that is a movement within our P&L versus a change in trajectory. And as I mentioned, it's not always that evident to those on the call or otherwise, that included in gross margin or in cost of goods sold is not just the product cost, but also the investments in the team and resources that we deploy against innovation and Manufacturing Revolution and otherwise. Golf, as you highlighted, was another factor within gross margin, both some charges that we took as well as the impact of exiting the golf equipment business. Frankly, it's a great example of the Edit to Amplify approach that we've talked about in the past and we've talked about on this call increasingly being applied to operating overhead. That is having an impact on our margin in the short term and will over the balance of the year. It's not reported as a discontinued operation. It's in our numbers. But we are making those decisions because we believe our long-term focus, in other words what we will amplify, is our focus on footwear and apparel and drive greater growth and profitability there. And we think we'll see the benefits in margin and return on invested capital from the decision we made to edit."

NIKE's always -- we've always started with the athlete. It's how we create the insights to drive the innovative product, and then we amplify that across the portfolio. And sportswear is a really important means of doing that. We see tremendous growth in all areas, specifically in both dimensions of performance and sportswear. We just had our most successful quarter ever for performance running. And our Sportswear business at the same time continues to be a massive growth driver for the company. So it's really, for us, just the balance between the 2 and the relationship between the 2. That intersection between performance and style, I think is stronger than ever. And by the way, innovation is a huge part of creating a new aesthetic, and lifestyle product does prioritize, I think, at this stage, with the consumer comfort and lightweight and breathability. So performance is really an element of sportswear for NIKE, and that's what helps to separate and distinguish NIKE in the marketplace."

I think, though, the difference, the inflection point that you mentioned is really more about the taking it to scale with partners like Flex, but then across our whole manufacturing partner base. So we're really modernizing not just with any one partner, but using that innovation to drive it across the whole base. So we talked about Flex and footwear. Apollo is a more recent focus for us on the apparel side, our investment in the Advanced Product Creation Center here on the NIKE campus, some amazing innovations and looking at disruptive methods of make. Obviously, we're aware of Flyknit. 3D printing, is -- I think it's got a lot of potential for scale.

Before I turn the call over to Mr. Sharan, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. 
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including Equipment, Converse Hurley and NIKE Golf are not included in these futures numbers. 
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures including references to wholesale equivalent sales and constant-dollar revenue. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as financial measure of actual results. Similarly, references to constant-dollar revenue are intended to provide context as to the performance of the business eliminating foreign exchange fluctuations. 
Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. Discussion of nonpublic financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, investors.nike.com.

It's proven to be NIKE's greatest competitive edge. We win now by editing our opportunities aggressively, we sharpen our execution, and we focus on those with the greatest impact and highest return. And we build for the future by intensifying our investments in our brand and innovation. 
NIKE is on the offense like never before, driving up a global athletic market that holds tremendous potential for growth. Q1 is the start of what's going to be a strong year for our company.
Let's review the financial highlights. NIKE, Inc. first quarter revenues were up 8%, growing to $9.1 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10%. Gross margin was 45.5%, down 200 basis points to prior year. Earnings per share increased 9% to $0.73, and we delivered ROIC of 30.5%. 
It was a summer of amazing sports moments, and it all began with an historic NBA Finals win, led by LeBron and Kyrie. It continued with Chile taking the Copa América title for the second time in a row. And weeks later at Wimbledon, Serena Williams celebrated her 22nd grand slam, tying her for the most singles titles in the open era. And the next day, the Euro Champs featured the first-ever all-NIKE final with Portugal defeating France. 
And of course, we were all captivated by the Rio Olympics last month. Everywhere you looked in Rio, you could feel NIKE's support of the athlete. Over 1,500 Olympians from 60 countries won 189 medals wearing our latest innovations. If NIKE were a country, we would have stood atop the medal count leaderboard. 
We saw so many inspiring performances. A few of the highlights for me were Neymar scoring the final penalty kick, leading Brazil to their first-ever Olympic gold in men's football; Mo Farah becoming the second man to win both the 5,000- and 10,000-meter races in consecutive Olympics; and with 21 of the 2014 USA basketball players wearing NIKE or Jordan footwear, both the men's and women's teams winning gold. It's moments like these that validate our obsession with the athlete. They serve as the ultimate proving grounds.
I'm happy to say we not only owned the fields of play with performance products like the KD9, but we also set the tone for sports style innovation through new apparel silhouettes like the dynamic Reveal Jacket worn by all U.S. Olympic medal winners on the medal stand.
What's amazing is that this success covers only 3 months. We absolutely dominated the sports calendar, and we used the power of sport to energize the marketplace and fuel growth. While I'm pleased with our overall momentum, I'm even more excited about what the future holds for our company. 
When we last spoke in June, I outlined our key strategies for growth in fiscal year '17. We talked about driving a continuous cycle of innovation for athletes, about transforming the global marketplace and then deepening our commitment to lead in this new era of personalized performance. And I'm proud to say we kicked off the year with strong progress in each of those areas.
Starting with innovation, Running is a great example of our complete offense within a category, delivering both performance innovation and sports style innovation in both footwear and apparel. Let's start with the LunarEpic Low which broke new ground this quarter. Delivering a completely new ride, it doesn't feel or look like any running shoe before it. The LunarEpic Low is also translating extremely well to a style audience and it's selling through well beyond expectations.
Innovation at NIKE can also mean reinterpreting our most successful franchises. For example, the Air Zoom Pegasus 33 has proven to be consistently popular. In fact, since its inception, NIKE has sold over 50 million pairs of the Pegasus. 
We also brought new technology to sportswear in Q1, as seen with the Roshe 2 Flyknit and the Air Max 1 Ultra Flyknit. These iconic running styles were paired with our groundbreaking digital knitting to maximize flexibility and comfort like only NIKE can. 
And finally in apparel, among the most successful styles of the quarter are the new dynamic Reveal Jacket that I had mentioned, and performance running tops, shorts and tights. Apparel's accelerated growth is bringing great balance to running.  
I should also call out the women's sportswear apparel category which continues to be another standout growth category for NIKE. 
Innovation, of course, extends far beyond product at NIKE. It's also about transforming the global marketplace by serving and inspiring consumers in ways that are most meaningful to them. It's about creating ways to keep them coming back. And we do that with our long-standing wholesale partners as well as with our own category-focused stores. One of our greatest competitive advantages is our ability to connect physical and digital shopping experiences for our consumers. In more places than ever, NIKE consumers can now shop in-store and through mobile at the same time in a single transaction. And it's clear our investments are paying off. On a currency -- constant-currency basis, DTC revenue for Q1 was up 22%, with the NIKE.com business leading the way at 49% growth. 
Another critical part of the success of NIKE.com continues to be our seamless integration with Nike+. It was a busy quarter for Nike+ as we delivered all access to the best of NIKE with one single sign-on to connect our running, training and sneaker apps. All 3 apps continue to be refreshed with the new features that are more directly tailored to the user.
We also continue to expand our industry leadership in digital innovation through key partnerships. We got a taste of the combined power of NIKE and Apple again this month. And there's much more to come as we focus on solving problems for athletes together, combining NIKE's deep knowledge of sport with Apple's expertise in digital technology.
We're off to a solid start to the fiscal year, and we're confident we'll reach our near-term goals. At the same time, we're always looking ahead to shape the future of sport. In Q1, we took major leaps toward those long-term goals, especially in the promise of personalized performance. Our connection to the consumer through Nike+ is core to that vision, but equally important is disrupting the business model that supports it, or, as we like to call it, our Manufacturing Revolution or ManRev. Through our acceleration of ManRev, we're currently seeing the benefit to product cost optimization. And at the same time, we're building capabilities for increased speed to market. 
Beyond that, one of the most exciting opportunities for ManRev is within design. We're continuing to scale our transition from cut and sew, where precision is at the stitch level, to digital design, where precision is at the pixel level. And we're leveraging the power of computational design that uses algorithms to create highly tunable innovations very quickly. 
This summer in Rio, athletes such as Allyson Felix, Elaine Thompson and Mo Farah claimed gold wearing our latest track spikes. Each were developed using computational design, 3D printing and selective laser centering, which allowed us to create and refine prototypes in hours instead of months and align with the athletes' specific training programs and competitive needs. Personalized products and services where and when you need them is the future NIKE is building for tomorrow and delivering today.
You've heard me talk before about how NIKE is built for growth. I'm as confident as ever that we're built to win now, to deliver accelerated growth in the near term. And equally, we're built to win for the long term. As we continue to invest surgically and aggressively to create the future of sport and active life, we'll continue deliver shareholder value for years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Trevor."

Q1 is always an exciting quarter for the NIKE Brand, but this past summer was something really special. It was full of global sports moments where our ability to deliver new and innovative products and create powerful consumer connections was on full display. And with that, we're off to a good start to the year. 
On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 10% for the quarter, led by double-digit growth in all international geographies. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 22%, driven by online growth of 49%, new store growth and comp store growth of 8%. And finally, global futures are up 7%. 
At NIKE, we take pride in developing authentic relationships with consumers all over the world. And this summer of sport highlighted how we take full advantage of the world's best athletes to deepen those connections. Our Unlimited You campaign during the Olympics offered an excellent example of that power, with its message of inviting all athletes to push their limits, reaching more than 480 million views online and 1.1 billion TV impressions around the world. For us, this energy is our engine as it continues to drive excitement and momentum for the NIKE Brand. 
And ultimately, this brand energy comes to life within our categories and through our geographies. Let's take a look, starting with our categories. First, Running. Growing double digits, this was the highest revenue quarter ever for our performance running category, with strong growth across footwear and apparel. Leading the way for footwear were key products that translate our rich understanding of runners into groundbreaking performance innovations like the LunarEpic Low and the Air Zoom Pegasus 33. What's more, the reinvention of our Free technology reignited demand for one of the most iconic footwear franchises around the world. 
And with our deep passion for running, we continued to connect products and services. Earlier this month, in partnership with Apple, we announced the Apple Watch Nike+, your perfect running partner. Built seamlessly into the watch is the Nike+ Run Club with motivation through smart run reminders and training data like pace and distance available at a glance. I was excited to help introduce the watch at Apple's keynote, and I can't wait for runners everywhere to start using it. 
With Running, we never rest on our heels. With even more exciting products in the pipeline, our expansive running strategy will continue to drive tremendous energy for both this important category and across our entire portfolio.
Now let's take a look at Nike Basketball. Mark mentioned what the U.S. men's and women's teams accomplished in Rio. In particular, I want to highlight Kevin Durant's incredible performance, leading the team throughout the tournament and putting up 30 points in the gold medal game. And as KD9 hit the market this summer to a great response, there's one thing I want to call out. To give fans a way to celebrate KD's move to Golden State, we offered a blue and yellow colorway on NIKEiD on the same day he joined the team. This was a great example of the kind of real-time personalized opportunities you'll see more of as we invest in capability to deliver products to market when and where fans want them most. 
Kyrie had an amazing summer, winning an Olympic gold and the NBA championship, and his signature Kyrie 2 continues to be met with strong consumer response. We see a very bright future for this young star, and we are excited for the years ahead together with him. 
And finally, the energy for Lebron continues to build after his incredible dominance in the playoffs and his very successful visit to China. And the LeBron Soldier 10 is seeing very strong sell-through in the United States and China, our 2 largest basketball markets. 
We continue to see great opportunities in the power of our relationships in basketball. We have both the deepest roster of great athletes, from LeBron and KD, to Russell Westbrook and Paul George, to Ben Simmons and Elena Delle Donne, and great universities and clubs around the world. 
Fueled by these relationships, Nike Basketball continues to energize passion for the game and inspire future generations worldwide. The products are strong, the pipeline is loaded, and I can't wait for the NBA season to start so we can deliver these amazing innovations to our consumers.
In the Jordan Brand, we continue to see huge opportunities as we expand beyond the sport of basketball. Jordan's entrance into the Men's Training category with the Jordan Trainer 1 has been greeted with strong excitement in the marketplace. To support the launch, we created a new training program, the Jordan Breakfast Club based on Michael's legendary work ethic. And as the college football season began, the Jordan Brand joined forces with University of Michigan to a response of real energy. We launched the partnership between these 2 iconic brands with a midnight event attended by thousands of consumers who camped out for the new apparel.
And of course, the Jordan Brand can still lead the world of basketball, as it did with the announcement of the Air Jordan XXXI, with its first of its kind Flyweave and leather upper and a full zoom length -- and a full-length Zoom Air, enhancing lateral support and court feel. What's more, earlier this month, we launched the Jordan 1 Retro High with the original ""Banned"" red and black colorway, and it sold out within an hour. It's clear with continued double-digit revenue growth, the Jordan Brand is more popular than ever.
In both Nike Basketball and Jordan, we serve the full lifestyle of basketball like no other brand, from performance to sports style innovation, to sharing our passion for sport with millions of consumers around the world. 
And importantly, our Sportswear category, which in Q1 saw its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, continues to amplify the power of our performance categories to serve consumers through sport- style innovation. As always, Nike Sportswear challenges conventional notions of performance and style by remixing inspiration from our greatest athletes with modern approach to Lifestyle design.
In Q1, consumers continued their love of footwear like the Huarache, the Tanjun and the Air Force 1, along with running icons we've enhanced with Flyknit, like the Roshe 2 and the Air Max 1 to create a look and feel that only NIKE can offer. And our apparel success was highlighted by the ever-popular and improved Tech Fleece, and the new innovative NIKE dynamic Reveal Jacket, which created the look of victory this summer as athletes wore it proudly on the medal stands throughout the Olympics. With both footwear and apparel, our strong Sportswear category continues our leadership in fueling passion for sports lifestyle to a global and diverse audience.
Now let's discuss a few of our key geographies. First, North America, where the brand remains very strong. In Q1, we returned our largest geography back to growth with revenues up 6%. This growth was fueled in part by record awareness and engagement around the Olympics and our Unlimited campaign. 
From a category perspective, we saw growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. And driven by launches of new innovations, we returned signature basketball to a pull market. We also made great progress against clearing excess inventory within the quarter, and we're seeing the benefit of bringing new product into the clean full-price, in-line channels.  Looking forward, we will continue to manage the flow of product into the market as we expand on an already healthy in-line marketplace. 
We've always said, there is no finish line, and that's as true today as it ever was. We continue to see tremendous opportunity offered by the still untapped potential of our complete offense in women's and in young athletes, across performance and sportswear, and up and down the price points. As we look at this considerable upside, we are as excited as we've ever been about our growth opportunities ahead, both in the near term and into the future.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we see broad-based demand with growth of 10% for the quarter, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Excitement in the marketplace was fueled by the European Championships and the kickoff to football season with the launch of the new kits from Man City to FC Barcelona to Atlético de Madrid to Paris Saint-Germain, all of which combined advance performance technologies with beautiful design. 
And the energy from this great summer of sports could be seen across Western Europe's marketplace in Q1. From our elevated execution in Paris with Intersport to the House of Hoops on London's Oxford Street with Foot Locker, we are creating compelling retail experiences for our consumers, and these strong partnerships are paying off. At the same time, our own DTC business continues to perform well, growing 30% in the quarter.  
We are rated by consumers as the favorite brand in all key cities in Western Europe, and the momentum we have seen in Q1 reinforces our view that we have tremendous growth potential in this important geography. 
And finally, in Greater China, we continue to see great results, with revenue growing 21% for the quarter. We are leveraging consumer sports moments such as the Olympics and the athlete visits by LeBron, KD and Russell Westbrook this summer. This energy is reflected in our category results, with tremendous momentum across Running, Sportswear, Jordan and Nike Basketball.
Just recently, the China retail market became the world's largest market, eclipsing the United States. And with our impressive growth there, we continue to feel confident about the successful strategies we are executing. We are leading with digital, where we're seeing incredible growth in our NIKE.com business as we continue to innovate with a focus on mobile. 
And we are leveraging the best practices from China across our global portfolio. Consumers are also responding to our efforts to create more compelling and unique retail experiences, and the re-profiled doors with our wholesale partners continue to be more productive. We will continue to raise the bar as we scale the number of re-profiled doors in the fleet. 
We feel great about the progress of our business in China, and more importantly, we are more confident than ever in our ability to sustain -- to drive sustained growth in this geography.
Q1 was the start of a new fiscal year for the NIKE Brand, but to us, it's much more than that. It's the continuation of delivering innovative products to the marketplace, connecting our consumers with more fun and authentic experiences and elevating every aspect of our game to help athletes get better.
Thanks. Now here's Andy."
291981,382921027,1051131,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 27, 2016",2016-09-27,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone on the call.Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the 3 pillars of NIKE's financial strategy. And our consistent delivery of results across all 3 of those",2048,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone on the call.
Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the 3 pillars of NIKE's financial strategy. And our consistent delivery of results across all 3 of those dimensions over the long term is what continues to set NIKE apart in terms of creating value for shareholders.
To be clear, first and foremost, NIKE is a growth company. We're obsessed with bringing inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. And with more than 7 billion athletes on the planet, that's no small feat. We are relentlessly in pursuit of our mission, and our pace and intensity always accelerates around the biggest moments in sport. So it should come as no surprise that we're off to a great start against our growth agenda for fiscal year '17.
As Mark noted, the past 90 days have been a hit parade for the NIKE Brand and the amazing athletes and teams that we serve, from LeBron and Kyrie winning the NBA Finals in dramatic fashion, all the way through to the unprecedented medal-winning performances of hundreds of NIKE athletes at the Olympic Games in Rio. Those are the moments that bring out the best in NIKE, pushing our brand and our pipeline of innovative, beautifully designed products to new heights. Powered by this inspiring summer of sport, our revenue grew to $9.1 billion in the quarter, up 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a currency-neutral basis.
Expanding profitability is another key pillar of NIKE's financial strategy. While margins contracted in the quarter driven by foreign exchange and several temporary or discrete items, we continued to benefit from our more systemic, long-term drivers of margin expansion, including higher in-line average selling prices and benefits associated with our footwear Manufacturing Revolution initiatives. In fact, based upon the progress we're making in footwear manufacturing, we announced a new strategic relationship with Apollo Global Management in the quarter aimed at revolutionizing apparel manufacturing. 
SG&A productivity is also increasingly a driver of our expanding profitability. In Q1, operating overhead grew just 6% as continued strategic investment was offset by productivity gains. Having grown rapidly from a $16 billion enterprise in fiscal year '07 to an over $32 billion enterprise today, we're intensifying our reallocation of the unrivaled resources that we have in our arsenal, leveraging an approach that we call Edit to Amplify. We are amplifying what matters most in terms of creating value for consumers and driving growth. That includes the path we've been on to double our investment in innovation and revolutionize our supply chain. At the same time, we are editing and realigning resources in areas where the investment we have today is more than sufficient.
Growth and expanding profitability, along with strategic capital deployment, also continue to yield strong returns on invested capital. In the first quarter, our ROIC expanded 160 basis points compared to prior year and is now over 30% for the first time in our history. 
Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the 3 pillars of our financial strategy, and we continue to build momentum toward delivering on our long-term goals across all 3 dimensions through nimble and strategic management. So on that note, let's reflect on our financial results for Q1.
In Q1, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 8%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 10%, with all international geographies growing double digits and North America returning to growth at 6%. NIKE Brand futures orders are up 5% on a reported basis. Currency-neutral futures orders are growing 7%, driven by a 2% increase in units, with increases in average selling prices contributing 5 percentage points of growth. 
First quarter diluted EPS of $0.73 increased 9% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenue growth, operating overhead leverage, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted 200 basis points in the quarter.  
Now let me take a moment to provide greater dimension on the drivers impacting gross margin in the short term and why we remain so confident in our ability to expand margins over the long term. As I previously noted, the primary drivers of the contraction in Q1 were several temporary or discrete items, including, for example, foreign exchange impacts, our exit from the golf equipment business, a higher mix of off-price sales as compared to Q1 fiscal year '16, and a shift of expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold. 
Note that cost of goods sold includes our investments in innovation, Manufacturing Revolution and other product creation-related resources, which have expanded significantly to fuel long-term growth.  At the same time, we continue to benefit from higher full-price average selling prices, lower oil-based input costs and the favorable impacts on product cost driven by our Manufacturing Revolution initiatives.
Turning to SG&A. Demand creation increased 25% in the first quarter, primarily driven by investment around the Olympics and the European Football Championships. Operating overhead increased just 6% as continued strategic investment in DTC, operational infrastructure and consumer-facing digital capabilities were partially offset by productivity gains and the shift of certain expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold.
The effective tax rate for Q1 was 2.5%, significantly lower than prior year, primarily due to a onetime benefit related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter. 
As of August 31, inventories were up 11%. NIKE Brand wholesale units were up just 3%. The remainder of the expansion in inventory was driven by growth to support our fast-growing DTC businesses and a higher average cost of the inventory due to a higher mix of footwear this quarter versus prior year.
Now let's turn to the performance of a few key operating segments. In Q1, North America revenue grew 6% on both a currency-neutral and reported basis. Growth was driven by Sportswear and Jordan. As Trevor noted, we're also seeing strong consumer demand for the signature performance basketball styles that we've just recently launched as we approach the tipoff of the NBA season later in Q2.  
On a reported basis, North America EBIT decreased 4% in the first quarter, as revenue growth and full-priced gross margin expansion were offset by higher demand creation related to the Olympics and a higher mix of off-price liquidation in Q1 versus the same period in the prior year.
Overall, we feel great about the progress we are making to rebalance supply and demand in the North America marketplace, and we will deliberately keep supply tight to maintain a pull market. Accordingly, we expect North America's reported revenue growth over the balance of the year to outpace the rate of futures growth, driven by stronger sell-through to consumers.
Now turning to Western Europe, where the NIKE Brand continues to be the leading brand in all 10 key cities, and consumer demand for our product remains extremely strong. In Q1, revenue grew to $1.8 billion, up 10% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was primarily driven by Sportswear, Global Football, Running and Jordan. We also experienced strong growth across both our DTC businesses and with our wholesale partners. 
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue increased 7%, while EBIT declined 19%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin and demand creation investments around the European Football Championships and the Olympics.
While NIKE brings the energy of the Olympics to consumers in key cities all around the world, the Olympic Games also offered us the opportunity to more deeply connect with consumers in our Emerging Markets geography and specifically ignite the passion for sport in Brazil. 
The stars could not have aligned better for the NIKE Brand, culminating with Neymar's gold-medal winning goal in the historic Maracanã Stadium. Fueled by inspiration from the games, our Emerging Markets geography grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was driven by incredibly strong momentum across Sportswear, Running and Jordan. And the territories with the highest rates of growth were Soco and Pacific. 
We're also very effectively managing supply and demand in the Emerging Markets as reflected in lower inventory unit levels versus prior year. 
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue and EBIT continued to be heavily impacted by FX headwinds. As a result, Q1 reported revenue decreased 2%, while EBIT decreased 34%.
Q1 was another exceptional quarter for NIKE in Greater China, with currency-neutral revenue growth of 21%. Growth was in the double digits in both footwear and apparel, in both DTC and at wholesale, and across nearly every category. Our brand leadership and connection with consumers in China is unrivaled and accelerating. Sell-through at retail remains robust, and inventories are healthy. And as our focus remains on the long term, we continue to prioritize strategic investment in this important geography to fuel strong and sustainable growth. That includes investments in: deepening our connections with consumers; consumer-focused experiences in both owned and partner retail; accelerating digital commerce; and new supply chain capabilities that enable us to more personally serve consumers in the world's largest market. 
Perhaps, most importantly, we are also investing in our team and talent. The NIKE Brand is winning in China, and the investments we're making now will continue to drive growth and extend our leadership long term.
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue in China was up 15%, while EBIT expanded 12%. 
Q1 was a solid start to the year. We have strong brand momentum and a pipeline of innovative performance and sportswear product that is resonating with consumers. Accordingly, our outlook for fiscal year '17 remains largely unchanged in terms of growth and the profitability of our business. 
Specifically, for the full year, our revenue expectations remain in line with prior guidance: high single-digit reported revenue growth; and high single to low double-digit currency-neutral revenue growth. 
For Q2, we expect reported revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range, at or slightly below our rate of reported futures growth, reflecting FX headwinds.
Futures orders continue to be an important and valuable aspect of our operating model. That said, the relationship between reported futures and reported revenue in a given quarter has become less correlated based on our evolving business mix. Accordingly, over the past several quarters, we have been providing greater dimension on our outlook for the business. Going forward, based upon our own evaluation and taking into account input that we have received from stakeholders, we will change the sequencing of our futures reporting. Futures will first be referenced in the context of the broader guidance that we provide on the earnings conference call rather than as a stand-alone forward-looking metric in our earnings release. We will also continue to report futures in detail in our quarterly filings with the SEC.
Turning to gross margin, we now expect the full year rate to contract. For Q2, we expect gross margin to contract by approximately 125 basis points, with the rate in the second half of the fiscal year approaching flat versus the prior year. 
Our underlying fundamental drivers of gross margin expansion remains strong, including higher full-price average selling price and product cost optimization. However, those favorable drivers are being offset in the short term by the aforementioned temporary or discrete factors, some of which have a continuing impact on the balance of year. 
For total SG&A, we now expect full year growth in the mid- to high single digits, with Q2 growing in the low to mid-single-digit range, as our continued strategic investments are increasingly being funded or offset by SG&A productivity gains as we Edit to Amplify. 
In Q2, we expect other income or expense to be roughly 0. 
For the full year, our guidance remains unchanged from prior guidance. 
We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 17% for the full year, taking into account the rate in Q1 and an average rate of about 22% for Q2 through Q4.
We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year, and as we look to the balance of year and beyond, our level of intensity is high. And we are more obsessed than ever with creating extraordinary value for consumers and translating that into sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth for NIKE and our shareholders.
With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

Actually, that's a good question. Let me take that. First of all, on a little more macro level, I think that, as I mentioned, the current environment really plays right into NIKE's strengths, with the athletic footwear and apparel segments being so strong and outpacing the rest of the footwear and apparel industry. We're actually quite well represented in leading product on both the performance and the sportswear side of the business as we talked about. There's many things that we're excited about, including some of the product that's in the market right now that I think is -- has a lot of upside opportunity to more completely leverage things in performance -- products and performance. Signature, we talked about; LeBron Soldier; the KD9; new KYRIE; Paul George signatures shoes; of course, the Air Jordan XXXI, those are great examples. Running, we talked about the LunarEpic Low, really incredible new cushioning system there for a great ride. Pegasus, the update on a real classic apparel. The running performance category, both tops and bottoms, women's sports bras. I mean, those are some examples on the performance side. And then on the sportswear side, we've got classics that we've reissued as well as new updates, including innovation as part of those classics: Air Force 1, Air Max, Presto, Sock Dart, the Roshe 2, Huarache, just to name some of those. In terms of new upcoming innovation, in Q2, we've got more signature basketball coming. You know the LeBron 14 is in the on-deck circle. It's another great signature product for LeBron. The Air VaporMax, which we talked about in March, which is a phenomenal new modern interpretation of Nike Air cushioning. It's incredible both in how it performs, but how it looks. We have new iterations of Free product. In apparel, we've got new Base Layer technology. Tech running, new Hyperwarm apparel collection, which we're excited about. Jordan is expanding beyond the Basketball category to Training and Running, including Sportswear. We -- Trevor mentioned the new Apple Watch Nike+ version, which is the start of, I think, intensifying that relationship between NIKE and Apple. And then we've got some -- on the Sportswear side, some new innovative interpretations of, again, some of our sportswear classics. Big anniversaries coming with the Air Max 1, the Air Max 97, the Air Force 1 35th anniversary Cortez, modern comfort collection in the Jordan category as well as NIKE. So we'll bring some real innovation to both the Sportswear category with the classics as well as some new products. So there's an array -- and I didn't mention the HyperAdapt, by the way, that probably should be toward the top of the list. It's gotten a lot of attention, as it should, because it really ushers in a whole new wave of adaptive technology. So we're bringing innovation, obviously, to performance, but also to sports style innovation. And I think it's interesting that the consumer doesn't necessarily distinguish between the 2. Much of -- many of our performance products are worn in terms of the street, and they're quite fashionable. That isn't necessarily our intent out of the box, but we're definitely seeing that be the case as well. So very excited about the innovation that's coming, obviously, in product, and our innovation goes well beyond product. We talked about ManRev. We talked about digital. We talked about personalized performance, Nike+, NIKE.com, innovations in retail. So this has really always been, always will be the engine for growth for the company. And I'll just say that we're as aggressive as ever in investing in those biggest opportunities. And I'm not including the things I can't talk about, which we are obviously very excited about as well. So..."

Overall, we feel great about the progress that we're making from an inventory, or maybe more broadly, a supply-and-demand management perspective. As I noted, our overall enterprise inventory growth was driven by only 3 percentage point increase in units. And actually, we saw a decline in North America, in particular, in inventory, both in the value of that inventory as well as the units, actually, declining even greater. So while I noted that in margin, off-price sales had a negative mix impact, that was versus the prior year in the first quarter. We're actually continuing to see those off-price sales tighten up as we make the progress we told you we would in terms of returning to a healthy pull market in North America."

And maybe just to give a broader context around the inventory of the marketplace, I would say, really, around the world, our in-line channels are very healthy really across the board. So we feel that we've made great progress in North America to make sure that we have obviously cleared the excess inventory, and we're bringing in new products into the marketplace, and we're seeing the result of that. Going forward, we will continue to manage the supply into the marketplace proactively to make sure that we maintain a pull market. If you look across to Western Europe, the inventory is actually well in line with revenue growth. Maybe the only difference would be on the value side, you're certainly seeing foreign exchange have some impact. Then in China, we're certainly seeing inventories are very healthy there. And you've seeing some inventory build as we prepare for Singles Day, which is obviously a big impact. And so we're excited about that. So across the board, we feel very confident about our -- the marketplace and the inventory position that we're in today, and we're just excited about the pipeline of products that are coming through."

I would say the 2 biggest drivers of the margin contraction versus prior year were the bucket of discrete or temporary items that we referenced and foreign exchange. So those items most notably included the shift of operating overhead expenses into cost of goods sold. So that is a movement within our P&L versus a change in trajectory. And as I mentioned, it's not always that evident to those on the call or otherwise, that included in gross margin or in cost of goods sold is not just the product cost, but also the investments in the team and resources that we deploy against innovation and Manufacturing Revolution and otherwise. Golf, as you highlighted, was another factor within gross margin, both some charges that we took as well as the impact of exiting the golf equipment business. Frankly, it's a great example of the Edit to Amplify approach that we've talked about in the past and we've talked about on this call increasingly being applied to operating overhead. That is having an impact on our margin in the short term and will over the balance of the year. It's not reported as a discontinued operation. It's in our numbers. But we are making those decisions because we believe our long-term focus, in other words what we will amplify, is our focus on footwear and apparel and drive greater growth and profitability there. And we think we'll see the benefits in margin and return on invested capital from the decision we made to edit."

NIKE's always -- we've always started with the athlete. It's how we create the insights to drive the innovative product, and then we amplify that across the portfolio. And sportswear is a really important means of doing that. We see tremendous growth in all areas, specifically in both dimensions of performance and sportswear. We just had our most successful quarter ever for performance running. And our Sportswear business at the same time continues to be a massive growth driver for the company. So it's really, for us, just the balance between the 2 and the relationship between the 2. That intersection between performance and style, I think is stronger than ever. And by the way, innovation is a huge part of creating a new aesthetic, and lifestyle product does prioritize, I think, at this stage, with the consumer comfort and lightweight and breathability. So performance is really an element of sportswear for NIKE, and that's what helps to separate and distinguish NIKE in the marketplace."

It's about lowering our product cost, as we talked about, really trying to drive greater labor productivity, less waste in the system, new design capabilities. These are all parts of ManRev. I think, though, the difference, the inflection point that you mentioned is really more about the taking it to scale with partners like Flex, but then across our whole manufacturing partner base. So we're really modernizing not just with any one partner, but using that innovation to drive it across the whole base. So we talked about Flex and footwear. Apollo is a more recent focus for us on the apparel side, our investment in the Advanced Product Creation Center here on the NIKE campus, some amazing innovations and looking at disruptive methods of make. Obviously, we're aware of Flyknit. 3D printing, is -- I think it's got a lot of potential for scale.

Before I turn the call over to Mr. Sharan, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. 
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including Equipment, Converse Hurley and NIKE Golf are not included in these futures numbers. 
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures including references to wholesale equivalent sales and constant-dollar revenue. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as financial measure of actual results. Similarly, references to constant-dollar revenue are intended to provide context as to the performance of the business eliminating foreign exchange fluctuations. 
Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. Discussion of nonpublic financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, investors.nike.com.

This summer proved just how powerful sport can be around the world. Some of the greatest performances of all time entertained us and, in the process, inspired a new generation of athletes to get moving. At the same time, the look of sport continues to influence everyday style around the world. As a result, new brands are entering into the athletic landscape. The activewear market continues to outpace the overall apparel and footwear market, which itself continues to outpace global GDP growth. 
It's a great time to be in the business of sports, and as the market leader, this is a great time to be NIKE. We are on the front end of all this growth, a driving force behind the expanding market. We not only see the upside across the landscape; we have both the scale and the skill to act on it. We believe in our strategy and in our complete offense. It's proven to be NIKE's greatest competitive edge. We win now by editing our opportunities aggressively, we sharpen our execution, and we focus on those with the greatest impact and highest return. And we build for the future by intensifying our investments in our brand and innovation. 
NIKE is on the offense like never before, driving up a global athletic market that holds tremendous potential for growth. Q1 is the start of what's going to be a strong year for our company.
Let's review the financial highlights. NIKE, Inc. first quarter revenues were up 8%, growing to $9.1 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10%. Gross margin was 45.5%, down 200 basis points to prior year. Earnings per share increased 9% to $0.73, and we delivered ROIC of 30.5%. 
It was a summer of amazing sports moments, and it all began with an historic NBA Finals win, led by LeBron and Kyrie. It continued with Chile taking the Copa América title for the second time in a row. And weeks later at Wimbledon, Serena Williams celebrated her 22nd grand slam, tying her for the most singles titles in the open era. And the next day, the Euro Champs featured the first-ever all-NIKE final with Portugal defeating France. 
And of course, we were all captivated by the Rio Olympics last month. Everywhere you looked in Rio, you could feel NIKE's support of the athlete. Over 1,500 Olympians from 60 countries won 189 medals wearing our latest innovations. If NIKE were a country, we would have stood atop the medal count leaderboard. 
We saw so many inspiring performances. A few of the highlights for me were Neymar scoring the final penalty kick, leading Brazil to their first-ever Olympic gold in men's football; Mo Farah becoming the second man to win both the 5,000- and 10,000-meter races in consecutive Olympics; and with 21 of the 2014 USA basketball players wearing NIKE or Jordan footwear, both the men's and women's teams winning gold. It's moments like these that validate our obsession with the athlete. They serve as the ultimate proving grounds.
I'm happy to say we not only owned the fields of play with performance products like the KD9, but we also set the tone for sports style innovation through new apparel silhouettes like the dynamic Reveal Jacket worn by all U.S. Olympic medal winners on the medal stand.
What's amazing is that this success covers only 3 months. We absolutely dominated the sports calendar, and we used the power of sport to energize the marketplace and fuel growth. While I'm pleased with our overall momentum, I'm even more excited about what the future holds for our company. 
When we last spoke in June, I outlined our key strategies for growth in fiscal year '17. We talked about driving a continuous cycle of innovation for athletes, about transforming the global marketplace and then deepening our commitment to lead in this new era of personalized performance. And I'm proud to say we kicked off the year with strong progress in each of those areas.
Starting with innovation, Running is a great example of our complete offense within a category, delivering both performance innovation and sports style innovation in both footwear and apparel. Let's start with the LunarEpic Low which broke new ground this quarter. Delivering a completely new ride, it doesn't feel or look like any running shoe before it. The LunarEpic Low is also translating extremely well to a style audience and it's selling through well beyond expectations.
Innovation at NIKE can also mean reinterpreting our most successful franchises. For example, the Air Zoom Pegasus 33 has proven to be consistently popular. In fact, since its inception, NIKE has sold over 50 million pairs of the Pegasus. 
We also brought new technology to sportswear in Q1, as seen with the Roshe 2 Flyknit and the Air Max 1 Ultra Flyknit. These iconic running styles were paired with our groundbreaking digital knitting to maximize flexibility and comfort like only NIKE can. 
And finally in apparel, among the most successful styles of the quarter are the new dynamic Reveal Jacket that I had mentioned, and performance running tops, shorts and tights. Apparel's accelerated growth is bringing great balance to running.  
I should also call out the women's sportswear apparel category which continues to be another standout growth category for NIKE. 
Innovation, of course, extends far beyond product at NIKE. It's also about transforming the global marketplace by serving and inspiring consumers in ways that are most meaningful to them. It's about creating ways to keep them coming back. And we do that with our long-standing wholesale partners as well as with our own category-focused stores. One of our greatest competitive advantages is our ability to connect physical and digital shopping experiences for our consumers. In more places than ever, NIKE consumers can now shop in-store and through mobile at the same time in a single transaction. And it's clear our investments are paying off. On a currency -- constant-currency basis, DTC revenue for Q1 was up 22%, with the NIKE.com business leading the way at 49% growth. 
Another critical part of the success of NIKE.com continues to be our seamless integration with Nike+. It was a busy quarter for Nike+ as we delivered all access to the best of NIKE with one single sign-on to connect our running, training and sneaker apps. All 3 apps continue to be refreshed with the new features that are more directly tailored to the user.
We also continue to expand our industry leadership in digital innovation through key partnerships. We got a taste of the combined power of NIKE and Apple again this month. And there's much more to come as we focus on solving problems for athletes together, combining NIKE's deep knowledge of sport with Apple's expertise in digital technology.
We're off to a solid start to the fiscal year, and we're confident we'll reach our near-term goals. At the same time, we're always looking ahead to shape the future of sport. In Q1, we took major leaps toward those long-term goals, especially in the promise of personalized performance. Our connection to the consumer through Nike+ is core to that vision, but equally important is disrupting the business model that supports it, or, as we like to call it, our Manufacturing Revolution or ManRev. Through our acceleration of ManRev, we're currently seeing the benefit to product cost optimization. And at the same time, we're building capabilities for increased speed to market. 
Beyond that, one of the most exciting opportunities for ManRev is within design. We're continuing to scale our transition from cut and sew, where precision is at the stitch level, to digital design, where precision is at the pixel level. And we're leveraging the power of computational design that uses algorithms to create highly tunable innovations very quickly. 
This summer in Rio, athletes such as Allyson Felix, Elaine Thompson and Mo Farah claimed gold wearing our latest track spikes. Each were developed using computational design, 3D printing and selective laser centering, which allowed us to create and refine prototypes in hours instead of months and align with the athletes' specific training programs and competitive needs. Personalized products and services where and when you need them is the future NIKE is building for tomorrow and delivering today.
You've heard me talk before about how NIKE is built for growth. I'm as confident as ever that we're built to win now, to deliver accelerated growth in the near term. And equally, we're built to win for the long term. As we continue to invest surgically and aggressively to create the future of sport and active life, we'll continue deliver shareholder value for years to come. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Trevor."

Q1 is always an exciting quarter for the NIKE Brand, but this past summer was something really special. It was full of global sports moments where our ability to deliver new and innovative products and create powerful consumer connections was on full display. And with that, we're off to a good start to the year. 
On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 10% for the quarter, led by double-digit growth in all international geographies. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 22%, driven by online growth of 49%, new store growth and comp store growth of 8%. And finally, global futures are up 7%. 
At NIKE, we take pride in developing authentic relationships with consumers all over the world. And this summer of sport highlighted how we take full advantage of the world's best athletes to deepen those connections. Our Unlimited You campaign during the Olympics offered an excellent example of that power, with its message of inviting all athletes to push their limits, reaching more than 480 million views online and 1.1 billion TV impressions around the world. For us, this energy is our engine as it continues to drive excitement and momentum for the NIKE Brand. 
And ultimately, this brand energy comes to life within our categories and through our geographies. Let's take a look, starting with our categories. First, Running. Growing double digits, this was the highest revenue quarter ever for our performance running category, with strong growth across footwear and apparel. Leading the way for footwear were key products that translate our rich understanding of runners into groundbreaking performance innovations like the LunarEpic Low and the Air Zoom Pegasus 33. What's more, the reinvention of our Free technology reignited demand for one of the most iconic footwear franchises around the world. 
And with our deep passion for running, we continued to connect products and services. Earlier this month, in partnership with Apple, we announced the Apple Watch Nike+, your perfect running partner. Built seamlessly into the watch is the Nike+ Run Club with motivation through smart run reminders and training data like pace and distance available at a glance. I was excited to help introduce the watch at Apple's keynote, and I can't wait for runners everywhere to start using it. 
With Running, we never rest on our heels. With even more exciting products in the pipeline, our expansive running strategy will continue to drive tremendous energy for both this important category and across our entire portfolio.
Now let's take a look at Nike Basketball. Mark mentioned what the U.S. men's and women's teams accomplished in Rio. In particular, I want to highlight Kevin Durant's incredible performance, leading the team throughout the tournament and putting up 30 points in the gold medal game. And as KD9 hit the market this summer to a great response, there's one thing I want to call out. To give fans a way to celebrate KD's move to Golden State, we offered a blue and yellow colorway on NIKEiD on the same day he joined the team. This was a great example of the kind of real-time personalized opportunities you'll see more of as we invest in capability to deliver products to market when and where fans want them most. 
Kyrie had an amazing summer, winning an Olympic gold and the NBA championship, and his signature Kyrie 2 continues to be met with strong consumer response. We see a very bright future for this young star, and we are excited for the years ahead together with him. 
And finally, the energy for Lebron continues to build after his incredible dominance in the playoffs and his very successful visit to China. And the LeBron Soldier 10 is seeing very strong sell-through in the United States and China, our 2 largest basketball markets. 
We continue to see great opportunities in the power of our relationships in basketball. We have both the deepest roster of great athletes, from LeBron and KD, to Russell Westbrook and Paul George, to Ben Simmons and Elena Delle Donne, and great universities and clubs around the world. 
Fueled by these relationships, Nike Basketball continues to energize passion for the game and inspire future generations worldwide. The products are strong, the pipeline is loaded, and I can't wait for the NBA season to start so we can deliver these amazing innovations to our consumers.
In the Jordan Brand, we continue to see huge opportunities as we expand beyond the sport of basketball. Jordan's entrance into the Men's Training category with the Jordan Trainer 1 has been greeted with strong excitement in the marketplace. To support the launch, we created a new training program, the Jordan Breakfast Club based on Michael's legendary work ethic. And as the college football season began, the Jordan Brand joined forces with University of Michigan to a response of real energy. We launched the partnership between these 2 iconic brands with a midnight event attended by thousands of consumers who camped out for the new apparel.
And of course, the Jordan Brand can still lead the world of basketball, as it did with the announcement of the Air Jordan XXXI, with its first of its kind Flyweave and leather upper and a full zoom length -- and a full-length Zoom Air, enhancing lateral support and court feel. What's more, earlier this month, we launched the Jordan 1 Retro High with the original ""Banned"" red and black colorway, and it sold out within an hour. It's clear with continued double-digit revenue growth, the Jordan Brand is more popular than ever.
In both Nike Basketball and Jordan, we serve the full lifestyle of basketball like no other brand, from performance to sports style innovation, to sharing our passion for sport with millions of consumers around the world. 
And importantly, our Sportswear category, which in Q1 saw its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, continues to amplify the power of our performance categories to serve consumers through sport- style innovation. As always, Nike Sportswear challenges conventional notions of performance and style by remixing inspiration from our greatest athletes with modern approach to Lifestyle design.
In Q1, consumers continued their love of footwear like the Huarache, the Tanjun and the Air Force 1, along with running icons we've enhanced with Flyknit, like the Roshe 2 and the Air Max 1 to create a look and feel that only NIKE can offer. And our apparel success was highlighted by the ever-popular and improved Tech Fleece, and the new innovative NIKE dynamic Reveal Jacket, which created the look of victory this summer as athletes wore it proudly on the medal stands throughout the Olympics. With both footwear and apparel, our strong Sportswear category continues our leadership in fueling passion for sports lifestyle to a global and diverse audience.
Now let's discuss a few of our key geographies. First, North America, where the brand remains very strong. In Q1, we returned our largest geography back to growth with revenues up 6%. This growth was fueled in part by record awareness and engagement around the Olympics and our Unlimited campaign. 
From a category perspective, we saw growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. And driven by launches of new innovations, we returned signature basketball to a pull market. We also made great progress against clearing excess inventory within the quarter, and we're seeing the benefit of bringing new product into the clean full-price, in-line channels.  Looking forward, we will continue to manage the flow of product into the market as we expand on an already healthy in-line marketplace. 
We've always said, there is no finish line, and that's as true today as it ever was. We continue to see tremendous opportunity offered by the still untapped potential of our complete offense in women's and in young athletes, across performance and sportswear, and up and down the price points. As we look at this considerable upside, we are as excited as we've ever been about our growth opportunities ahead, both in the near term and into the future.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we see broad-based demand with growth of 10% for the quarter, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Excitement in the marketplace was fueled by the European Championships and the kickoff to football season with the launch of the new kits from Man City to FC Barcelona to Atlético de Madrid to Paris Saint-Germain, all of which combined advance performance technologies with beautiful design. 
And the energy from this great summer of sports could be seen across Western Europe's marketplace in Q1. From our elevated execution in Paris with Intersport to the House of Hoops on London's Oxford Street with Foot Locker, we are creating compelling retail experiences for our consumers, and these strong partnerships are paying off. At the same time, our own DTC business continues to perform well, growing 30% in the quarter.  
We are rated by consumers as the favorite brand in all key cities in Western Europe, and the momentum we have seen in Q1 reinforces our view that we have tremendous growth potential in this important geography. 
And finally, in Greater China, we continue to see great results, with revenue growing 21% for the quarter. We are leveraging consumer sports moments such as the Olympics and the athlete visits by LeBron, KD and Russell Westbrook this summer. This energy is reflected in our category results, with tremendous momentum across Running, Sportswear, Jordan and Nike Basketball.
Just recently, the China retail market became the world's largest market, eclipsing the United States. And with our impressive growth there, we continue to feel confident about the successful strategies we are executing. We are leading with digital, where we're seeing incredible growth in our NIKE.com business as we continue to innovate with a focus on mobile. 
And we are leveraging the best practices from China across our global portfolio. Consumers are also responding to our efforts to create more compelling and unique retail experiences, and the re-profiled doors with our wholesale partners continue to be more productive. We will continue to raise the bar as we scale the number of re-profiled doors in the fleet. 
We feel great about the progress of our business in China, and more importantly, we are more confident than ever in our ability to sustain -- to drive sustained growth in this geography.
Q1 was the start of a new fiscal year for the NIKE Brand, but to us, it's much more than that. It's the continuation of delivering innovative products to the marketplace, connecting our consumers with more fun and authentic experiences and elevating every aspect of our game to help athletes get better.
Thanks. Now here's Andy."
291981,382921027,1051361,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 27, 2016",2016-09-27,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone on the call.Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the 3 pillars of NIKE's financial strategy. And our consistent delivery of results across all 3 of those",2048,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone on the call.
Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the 3 pillars of NIKE's financial strategy. And our consistent delivery of results across all 3 of those dimensions over the long term is what continues to set NIKE apart in terms of creating value for shareholders.
To be clear, first and foremost, NIKE is a growth company. We're obsessed with bringing inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. And with more than 7 billion athletes on the planet, that's no small feat. We are relentlessly in pursuit of our mission, and our pace and intensity always accelerates around the biggest moments in sport. So it should come as no surprise that we're off to a great start against our growth agenda for fiscal year '17.
As Mark noted, the past 90 days have been a hit parade for the NIKE Brand and the amazing athletes and teams that we serve, from LeBron and Kyrie winning the NBA Finals in dramatic fashion, all the way through to the unprecedented medal-winning performances of hundreds of NIKE athletes at the Olympic Games in Rio. Those are the moments that bring out the best in NIKE, pushing our brand and our pipeline of innovative, beautifully designed products to new heights. Powered by this inspiring summer of sport, our revenue grew to $9.1 billion in the quarter, up 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a currency-neutral basis.
Expanding profitability is another key pillar of NIKE's financial strategy. While margins contracted in the quarter driven by foreign exchange and several temporary or discrete items, we continued to benefit from our more systemic, long-term drivers of margin expansion, including higher in-line average selling prices and benefits associated with our footwear Manufacturing Revolution initiatives. In fact, based upon the progress we're making in footwear manufacturing, we announced a new strategic relationship with Apollo Global Management in the quarter aimed at revolutionizing apparel manufacturing. 
SG&A productivity is also increasingly a driver of our expanding profitability. In Q1, operating overhead grew just 6% as continued strategic investment was offset by productivity gains. Having grown rapidly from a $16 billion enterprise in fiscal year '07 to an over $32 billion enterprise today, we're intensifying our reallocation of the unrivaled resources that we have in our arsenal, leveraging an approach that we call Edit to Amplify. We are amplifying what matters most in terms of creating value for consumers and driving growth. That includes the path we've been on to double our investment in innovation and revolutionize our supply chain. At the same time, we are editing and realigning resources in areas where the investment we have today is more than sufficient.
Growth and expanding profitability, along with strategic capital deployment, also continue to yield strong returns on invested capital. In the first quarter, our ROIC expanded 160 basis points compared to prior year and is now over 30% for the first time in our history. 
Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the 3 pillars of our financial strategy, and we continue to build momentum toward delivering on our long-term goals across all 3 dimensions through nimble and strategic management. So on that note, let's reflect on our financial results for Q1.
In Q1, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 8%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 10%, with all international geographies growing double digits and North America returning to growth at 6%. NIKE Brand futures orders are up 5% on a reported basis. Currency-neutral futures orders are growing 7%, driven by a 2% increase in units, with increases in average selling prices contributing 5 percentage points of growth. 
First quarter diluted EPS of $0.73 increased 9% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenue growth, operating overhead leverage, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted 200 basis points in the quarter.  
Now let me take a moment to provide greater dimension on the drivers impacting gross margin in the short term and why we remain so confident in our ability to expand margins over the long term. As I previously noted, the primary drivers of the contraction in Q1 were several temporary or discrete items, including, for example, foreign exchange impacts, our exit from the golf equipment business, a higher mix of off-price sales as compared to Q1 fiscal year '16, and a shift of expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold. 
Note that cost of goods sold includes our investments in innovation, Manufacturing Revolution and other product creation-related resources, which have expanded significantly to fuel long-term growth.  At the same time, we continue to benefit from higher full-price average selling prices, lower oil-based input costs and the favorable impacts on product cost driven by our Manufacturing Revolution initiatives.
Turning to SG&A. Demand creation increased 25% in the first quarter, primarily driven by investment around the Olympics and the European Football Championships. Operating overhead increased just 6% as continued strategic investment in DTC, operational infrastructure and consumer-facing digital capabilities were partially offset by productivity gains and the shift of certain expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold.
The effective tax rate for Q1 was 2.5%, significantly lower than prior year, primarily due to a onetime benefit related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter. 
As of August 31, inventories were up 11%. NIKE Brand wholesale units were up just 3%. The remainder of the expansion in inventory was driven by growth to support our fast-growing DTC businesses and a higher average cost of the inventory due to a higher mix of footwear this quarter versus prior year.
Now let's turn to the performance of a few key operating segments. In Q1, North America revenue grew 6% on both a currency-neutral and reported basis. Growth was driven by Sportswear and Jordan. As Trevor noted, we're also seeing strong consumer demand for the signature performance basketball styles that we've just recently launched as we approach the tipoff of the NBA season later in Q2.  
On a reported basis, North America EBIT decreased 4% in the first quarter, as revenue growth and full-priced gross margin expansion were offset by higher demand creation related to the Olympics and a higher mix of off-price liquidation in Q1 versus the same period in the prior year.
Overall, we feel great about the progress we are making to rebalance supply and demand in the North America marketplace, and we will deliberately keep supply tight to maintain a pull market. Accordingly, we expect North America's reported revenue growth over the balance of the year to outpace the rate of futures growth, driven by stronger sell-through to consumers.
Now turning to Western Europe, where the NIKE Brand continues to be the leading brand in all 10 key cities, and consumer demand for our product remains extremely strong. In Q1, revenue grew to $1.8 billion, up 10% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was primarily driven by Sportswear, Global Football, Running and Jordan. We also experienced strong growth across both our DTC businesses and with our wholesale partners. 
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue increased 7%, while EBIT declined 19%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin and demand creation investments around the European Football Championships and the Olympics.
While NIKE brings the energy of the Olympics to consumers in key cities all around the world, the Olympic Games also offered us the opportunity to more deeply connect with consumers in our Emerging Markets geography and specifically ignite the passion for sport in Brazil. 
The stars could not have aligned better for the NIKE Brand, culminating with Neymar's gold-medal winning goal in the historic Maracanã Stadium. Fueled by inspiration from the games, our Emerging Markets geography grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was driven by incredibly strong momentum across Sportswear, Running and Jordan. And the territories with the highest rates of growth were Soco and Pacific. 
We're also very effectively managing supply and demand in the Emerging Markets as reflected in lower inventory unit levels versus prior year. 
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue and EBIT continued to be heavily impacted by FX headwinds. As a result, Q1 reported revenue decreased 2%, while EBIT decreased 34%.
Q1 was another exceptional quarter for NIKE in Greater China, with currency-neutral revenue growth of 21%. Growth was in the double digits in both footwear and apparel, in both DTC and at wholesale, and across nearly every category. Our brand leadership and connection with consumers in China is unrivaled and accelerating. Sell-through at retail remains robust, and inventories are healthy. And as our focus remains on the long term, we continue to prioritize strategic investment in this important geography to fuel strong and sustainable growth. That includes investments in: deepening our connections with consumers; consumer-focused experiences in both owned and partner retail; accelerating digital commerce; and new supply chain capabilities that enable us to more personally serve consumers in the world's largest market. 
Perhaps, most importantly, we are also investing in our team and talent. The NIKE Brand is winning in China, and the investments we're making now will continue to drive growth and extend our leadership long term.
On a reported basis, Q1 revenue in China was up 15%, while EBIT expanded 12%. 
Q1 was a solid start to the year. We have strong brand momentum and a pipeline of innovative performance and sportswear product that is resonating with consumers. Accordingly, our outlook for fiscal year '17 remains largely unchanged in terms of growth and the profitability of our business. 
Specifically, for the full year, our revenue expectations remain in line with prior guidance: high single-digit reported revenue growth; and high single to low double-digit currency-neutral revenue growth. 
For Q2, we expect reported revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range, at or slightly below our rate of reported futures growth, reflecting FX headwinds.
Futures orders continue to be an important and valuable aspect of our operating model. That said, the relationship between reported futures and reported revenue in a given quarter has become less correlated based on our evolving business mix. Accordingly, over the past several quarters, we have been providing greater dimension on our outlook for the business. Going forward, based upon our own evaluation and taking into account input that we have received from stakeholders, we will change the sequencing of our futures reporting. Futures will first be referenced in the context of the broader guidance that we provide on the earnings conference call rather than as a stand-alone forward-looking metric in our earnings release. We will also continue to report futures in detail in our quarterly filings with the SEC.
Turning to gross margin, we now expect the full year rate to contract. For Q2, we expect gross margin to contract by approximately 125 basis points, with the rate in the second half of the fiscal year approaching flat versus the prior year. 
Our underlying fundamental drivers of gross margin expansion remains strong, including higher full-price average selling price and product cost optimization. However, those favorable drivers are being offset in the short term by the aforementioned temporary or discrete factors, some of which have a continuing impact on the balance of year. 
For total SG&A, we now expect full year growth in the mid- to high single digits, with Q2 growing in the low to mid-single-digit range, as our continued strategic investments are increasingly being funded or offset by SG&A productivity gains as we Edit to Amplify. 
In Q2, we expect other income or expense to be roughly 0. 
For the full year, our guidance remains unchanged from prior guidance. 
We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 17% for the full year, taking into account the rate in Q1 and an average rate of about 22% for Q2 through Q4.
We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year, and as we look to the balance of year and beyond, our level of intensity is high. And we are more obsessed than ever with creating extraordinary value for consumers and translating that into sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth for NIKE and our shareholders.
With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

Actually, that's a good question. Let me take that. First of all, on a little more macro level, I think that, as I mentioned, the current environment really plays right into NIKE's strengths, with the athletic footwear and apparel segments being so strong and outpacing the rest of the footwear and apparel industry. We're actually quite well represented in leading product on both the performance and the sportswear side of the business as we talked about. There's many things that we're excited about, including some of the product that's in the market right now that I think is -- has a lot of upside opportunity to more completely leverage things in performance -- products and performance. Signature, we talked about; LeBron Soldier; the KD9; new KYRIE; Paul George signatures shoes; of course, the Air Jordan XXXI, those are great examples. Running, we talked about the LunarEpic Low, really incredible new cushioning system there for a great ride. Pegasus, the update on a real classic apparel. The running performance category, both tops and bottoms, women's sports bras. I mean, those are some examples on the performance side. And then on the sportswear side, we've got classics that we've reissued as well as new updates, including innovation as part of those classics: Air Force 1, Air Max, Presto, Sock Dart, the Roshe 2, Huarache, just to name some of those. In terms of new upcoming innovation, in Q2, we've got more signature basketball coming. You know the LeBron 14 is in the on-deck circle. It's another great signature product for LeBron. The Air VaporMax, which we talked about in March, which is a phenomenal new modern interpretation of Nike Air cushioning. It's incredible both in how it performs, but how it looks. We have new iterations of Free product. In apparel, we've got new Base Layer technology. Tech running, new Hyperwarm apparel collection, which we're excited about. Jordan is expanding beyond the Basketball category to Training and Running, including Sportswear. We -- Trevor mentioned the new Apple Watch Nike+ version, which is the start of, I think, intensifying that relationship between NIKE and Apple. And then we've got some -- on the Sportswear side, some new innovative interpretations of, again, some of our sportswear classics. Big anniversaries coming with the Air Max 1, the Air Max 97, the Air Force 1 35th anniversary Cortez, modern comfort collection in the Jordan category as well as NIKE. So we'll bring some real innovation to both the Sportswear category with the classics as well as some new products. So there's an array -- and I didn't mention the HyperAdapt, by the way, that probably should be toward the top of the list. It's gotten a lot of attention, as it should, because it really ushers in a whole new wave of adaptive technology. So we're bringing innovation, obviously, to performance, but also to sports style innovation. And I think it's interesting that the consumer doesn't necessarily distinguish between the 2. Much of -- many of our performance products are worn in terms of the street, and they're quite fashionable. That isn't necessarily our intent out of the box, but we're definitely seeing that be the case as well. So very excited about the innovation that's coming, obviously, in product, and our innovation goes well beyond product. We talked about ManRev. We talked about digital. We talked about personalized performance, Nike+, NIKE.com, innovations in retail. So this has really always been, always will be the engine for growth for the company. And I'll just say that we're as aggressive as ever in investing in those biggest opportunities. And I'm not including the things I can't talk about, which we are obviously very excited about as well.

Overall, we feel great about the progress that we're making from an inventory, or maybe more broadly, a supply-and-demand management perspective. As I noted, our overall enterprise inventory growth was driven by only 3 percentage point increase in units. And actually, we saw a decline in North America, in particular, in inventory, both in the value of that inventory as well as the units, actually, declining even greater. So while I noted that in margin, off-price sales had a negative mix impact, that was versus the prior year in the first quarter. We're actually continuing to see those off-price sales tighten up as we make the progress we told you we would in terms of returning to a healthy pull market in North America."

And maybe just to give a broader context around the inventory of the marketplace, I would say, really, around the world, our in-line channels are very healthy really across the board. So we feel that we've made great progress in North America to make sure that we have obviously cleared the excess inventory, and we're bringing in new products into the marketplace, and we're seeing the result of that. Going forward, we will continue to manage the supply into the marketplace proactively to make sure that we maintain a pull market. If you look across to Western Europe, the inventory is actually well in line with revenue growth. Maybe the only difference would be on the value side, you're certainly seeing foreign exchange have some impact. Then in China, we're certainly seeing inventories are very healthy there. And you've seeing some inventory build as we prepare for Singles Day, which is obviously a big impact. And so we're excited about that. So across the board, we feel very confident about our -- the marketplace and the inventory position that we're in today, and we're just excited about the pipeline of products that are coming through."

I would say the 2 biggest drivers of the margin contraction versus prior year were the bucket of discrete or temporary items that we referenced and foreign exchange. So those items most notably included the shift of operating overhead expenses into cost of goods sold. So that is a movement within our P&L versus a change in trajectory. And as I mentioned, it's not always that evident to those on the call or otherwise, that included in gross margin or in cost of goods sold is not just the product cost, but also the investments in the team and resources that we deploy against innovation and Manufacturing Revolution and otherwise. Golf, as you highlighted, was another factor within gross margin, both some charges that we took as well as the impact of exiting the golf equipment business. Frankly, it's a great example of the Edit to Amplify approach that we've talked about in the past and we've talked about on this call increasingly being applied to operating overhead. That is having an impact on our margin in the short term and will over the balance of the year. It's not reported as a discontinued operation. It's in our numbers. But we are making those decisions because we believe our long-term focus, in other words what we will amplify, is our focus on footwear and apparel and drive greater growth and profitability there. And we think we'll see the benefits in margin and return on invested capital from the decision we made to edit."

I'll just back up and say, though, that sport in general and innovation have always been, and I think always will be, 2 of the most powerful drivers of culture and style. NIKE's always -- we've always started with the athlete. It's how we create the insights to drive the innovative product, and then we amplify that across the portfolio. And sportswear is a really important means of doing that. We see tremendous growth in all areas, specifically in both dimensions of performance and sportswear. We just had our most successful quarter ever for performance running. And our Sportswear business at the same time continues to be a massive growth driver for the company. So it's really, for us, just the balance between the 2 and the relationship between the 2. That intersection between performance and style, I think is stronger than ever. And by the way, innovation is a huge part of creating a new aesthetic, and lifestyle product does prioritize, I think, at this stage, with the consumer comfort and lightweight and breathability. So performance is really an element of sportswear for NIKE, and that's what helps to separate and distinguish NIKE in the marketplace."

For us, this is about getting product to the consumer faster. It's about lowering our product cost, as we talked about, really trying to drive greater labor productivity, less waste in the system, new design capabilities. These are all parts of ManRev. I think, though, the difference, the inflection point that you mentioned is really more about the taking it to scale with partners like Flex, but then across our whole manufacturing partner base. So we're really modernizing not just with any one partner, but using that innovation to drive it across the whole base. So we talked about Flex and footwear. Apollo is a more recent focus for us on the apparel side, our investment in the Advanced Product Creation Center here on the NIKE campus, some amazing innovations and looking at disruptive methods of make. Obviously, we're aware of Flyknit. 3D printing, is -- I think it's got a lot of potential for scale.

The tangible results that we're seeing today are primarily driven by automation and being closer to market. In terms of automation, specifically, we're seeing greater yield in terms of our use of materials, so less waste means lower cost.

I guess in short, I'd say we're increasingly confident the Manufacturing Revolution now across both footwear and apparel will have a significant impact on both revenue and margin long term.

Q2 was another quarter of positive momentum for NIKE, Inc. Let's start with the numbers.
NIKE, Inc.'s second quarter revenues were up 6% growing to $8.2 billion and, on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8%. Gross margin declined approximately 140 basis points to 44.2%, earnings per share increased 11% to $0.50 and we delivered ROIC of 31.3%.
In the fast-moving world of sports and use culture, [ph] results like these come from our obsession with the consumer, of knowing what they need and what inspires them. That's what drives innovation at NIKE, and innovation is what drives growth. Our approach has fueled 28 consecutive quarters of growth at a scale that is unrivaled in our industry. We have a strong track record and, more importantly, we have an even better runway ahead.
With the energy we see in sports right now, along with today's more active lifestyle, it's no surprise that our industry continues to attract competition. As in sports, competition is a positive thing. It sharpens our focus. And we know there are areas in the short term where we haven't executed as precisely as we would've liked. As good as we are, we can be even better by hyper-focusing on our most compelling growth opportunities.
Starting with the consumer, who's not asking for more product but looking for more choice of the products they love. We're responding by giving this consumer more distinctive options with fewer products, what we call edit to amplify. [ph] Reducing styles and highlighting key items and concepts has a huge impact across our entire value chain. And this is especially important in North America and our key geographies as we better manage supply and demand to drive productivity and profitable top line growth while highlighting and scaling our most compelling product stories.
We're looking [ph] at our success in China, where we amplify what's working and edit out what's not to accelerate growth. Beyond product, e-commerce is one example as we double down on the power of digital in this mobile-first market. We also know from our consumers that speed matters. That insight is driving several speed and agility initiatives throughout our company. For example, we're scaling a process we call the express lane, [ph] which allows us to go from creation to market in weeks instead of months. The express lane is becoming an important competitive advantage, and it led to a new product called the Lunar charge [ph] this quarter, which is seeing strong consumer demand.
We've always given consumers high-energy product in the right place at the right time. We're now leveraging and creating capabilities on a much larger scale. The investments we make in manufacturing revolution and throughout the supply chain are going a long way in helping us realize that. Editing to amplify and driving speed and agility are keys to winning now. They also help set the foundation for growth in the future.
The other focus for us, of course, is innovation, my top priority for the company. Innovation is what offers differentiation for consumers and takes them somewhere new. It's how we lead the market. To be clear, without innovation, there is no such thing as sustained growth. We have some exciting new platforms underway, starting with Air VaporMax, [ph] our highest performance and most visually striking Air Max [ph] cushioning system ever. We see a growing anticipation around Air VaporMax from runners to sneaker retailers. It's a great example of an innovation that stands at the intersection of high-tech, pure function and esthetic beauty. We expect big things from Air VaporMax in Running and we have an ambitious road map to bring it to life through other sports.
In apparel, we launched thermosphere [ph] in Running, adding to our diverse lineup of apparel that offers warmth without weight in cold weather. The sphere [ph] family including its lead style, element sphere, [ph] is performing very well in the marketplace. We also launched the Strike [ph] series featuring AeroSwift [ph] technology, establishing the new look of football training.
This quarter, we delivered on the promise of personalized performance with our first adaptive product, the HyperAdapt 1.0. [ph] And there's a reason we called it the 1.0. Generations 2 and 3 are in the works, expanding adaptive performance products across other sport categories. There was huge demand for the HyperAdapt 1.0, and we plan to drive that momentum into adaptive products at a much larger scale. And there's a lot more on deck with new cushioning experiences in Running and Basketball, digitally integrated product, advancements in customization and personalization and breakthroughs in lightweight performance. Our pipeline is very strong. Covering the near, medium and long-term horizons, we've created both platforms in category-defining products designed in a distinctive style that spans all categories. We're driving a pace and a scale of innovation that will deliver growth for years to come.
Right now, the consumer continues to respond to new generations of our state-of-the-art platforms in Flyknit, Free and Lunarlon. [ph] This year we redesigned NIKE Free [ph] and brought a whole new sensation to Lunarlon with the LunarEpic. [ph] Both continue to be huge drivers of our business in both Training and Running for both men and women. Flyknit is also advancing well beyond our expectations. Its versatility is allowing us to create unexpected forms [ph] across multiple sports for all weather conditions and even blending it with other materials to advance both performance and style. And you're about to see even more firepower coming out of Basketball. You'll hear more from Trevor on this, but we're in a good position to build on recent successes in NIKE Basketball and Jordan for the back half of the fiscal year.
Another advantage we leverage is NIKE's deep reservoir of iconic styles and innovation. It's a source of inspiration to our design teams and a tremendous source of growth for our business. There's always been a huge consumer appetite for reinterpreted [ph] franchises and icons. Take the Air Force 1 [ph] as one example this past quarter. Of course, the original remains a staple. But this quarter, consumers responded to some of our long-awaited reissued Air Force 1s. Versions like the New York City, the LA, the Chin-Town and the linen, [ph]. But we also give it new life through a weather-repelling sneaker boot, a featherweight Flyknit style and a NIKE Lab [ph] version with premium materials. One style that drove tremendous heat in the Air Force 1 family this quarter was the special field Air Force 1, [ph] bringing a new look to an icon, this exciting new model has been selling through very quickly.
I think there's a misconception that growth in our Lifestyle business comes at the expense of growth in our Performance [ph] business. The reality is they fuel each other. Performance and Lifestyle are not tradeoffs. Consumers want innovation that is styled right, and they want style with real innovation. They want product that helps them do more and get better, that's comfortable and light and looks great on the court and on the street. Ultimately, they want choices that look and feel good across the spectrum of performance and lifestyle, including performance products that are high demand and fueling growth like the LeBron Soldier, the Jordan 31, the KOBE AD, the Flyknit Razor, the LunarEpic Low and the upcoming Air VaporMax. [ph][ph]  NIKE's opportunity is to continue to deliver across that spectrum to accelerate our leading performance position and the world's largest sportswear business.
Part of our role as the industry leader is to continue to grow the whole market for sport, and that means knowing where the consumer is headed. We're leading through digital. We made a move long ago to integrate brand, service and commerce in a meaningful way for consumers. No one in our space is close to connecting all 3 and turning it into value for the business the way that we do. We brought this to life in a powerful way this quarter with NIKE Soho. The 5-story store is built around trial zones, [ph] personalized services and amazing product. It's bringing digital and physical retail together to deepen our relationships with our customers. It's clear that DTC [ph] continues to be one of the greatest returns on investment. In Q2, our DTC business grew 23%, with NIKE.com leading the way at 46%. There continues to be much more growth potential ahead for NIKE in DTC.
We're also accelerating partnerships with our multi-brand wholesalers. We share our vision for serving our customers with elevated and differentiated consumer experiences. Dick's [ph] is a great example, with its full-service footwear departments. Other examples this quarter include our women's lifestyle concept shop with Nordstrom, our first European Jordan store in Paris with Foot Locker [ph] and our most digitally integrated multi-brand consumer experience with JD. [ph] More and more consumers want a seamless shopping experience across physical and digital, and we're delivering that completely through our DTC wholesale partners in wholesale.com.[ph] 
I feel really good about where NIKE stands for the long term. We're earning our #1 position every single day. We're facing our challenges head-on, and we're obsessing the fundamentals while seizing opportunities to be disruptive in leading our industry. We are well positioned for the back half of the year and, more importantly, we're clear on the opportunities in front of us and confident in our plans to drive long-term growth and shareholder value for years to come.
Thanks. And now here's Trevor."

As always, my remarks are on a constant-currency basis.The NIKE Brand [ph] revenue grew 8%, led by broad-based growth across our largest geographi",1913,"Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another solid quarter of growth in Q2. As always, my remarks are on a constant-currency basis.
The NIKE Brand [ph] revenue grew 8%, led by broad-based growth across our largest geographies and categories. And NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 25%, driven by continued strong growth in digital commerce, 11% comp store growth and new store expansion.
In Q2, we attacked opportunities across our portfolio to strengthen and extend our leadership position. In particular, I'd like to mention 3 of note. First, we're seeing incredible momentum in Basketball. To be clear, Basketball is back. Second, we have made tremendous progress aligned [ph] in supply and demand in North America, returning this important geography to a pull market. And third, we continue to see strong and steady momentum in Greater China as we continue to invest in that market to fuel growth.
Now let's take a look at some of our key categories, starting with Running. Running is our largest performance category and continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and growth, with Q2 revenue growing at a double-digit rate. It also continues to be one of our most influential and largest drivers of our Sportswear business. Now even if the weather turns, our runners never slow down. They inspire us to provide solutions to help them get out and run more. Mark mentioned the popular LunarEpic [ph] and, in Q2, we launched the LunarEpic Flyknit shield, [ph] with its all-weather construction designed to keep the foot warm and dry. It's another example of how NIKE expands the market by adapting our popular platforms to new audiences and serve consumer needs. Other Running footwear successes included the Pegasus 33 [ph] and the Air Max 2017, [ph] which features a fly mesh upper and a full-length Max Air unit.
In apparel, products offering lightweight yet breathable warmth are also showing increased popularity with athletes from the most elite to the everyday, highlighted by the Aeroloft [ph] and the Sphere platforms. And I'd be remiss if I did not mention the excitement we're seeing around the Apple Watch Nike+, [ph] and it sells well ahead of our plans.
Lastly, Mark mentioned the Air VaporMax, which is not only an amazing star in its own right but an innovation that will fuel growth across the entire Nike Air family of products, and I'm really excited about this platform which will be in the market this spring.
Next, Basketball. As a leader in Basketball, we never settle. We note there's always work to be done. Last year, we knew we didn't perform to our potential in Basketball. Whilst we have a diverse portfolio across NIKE Basketball, Jordan and Sportswear, we recognize that 2 of our signature styles were not resonating with consumers to our expectations. We saw the opportunity, and we addressed it. First, we went back to the fundamentals and redesigned our products with stronger esthetics and delivered better price value to our consumers. That work led to dynamic products like the KYRIE 2, the LeBron Soldier 10, the KD9, the Jordan 31, the KOBE AD and the Westport 0.2. [ph][ph]  All of these have been incredibly popular with consumers on and off the court.
Second, we created demand and energy in the marketplace, with our out of nowhere [ph] campaign. And third, we delivered all this powerfully through retail, for example, with our House of Hoops partnership [ph] with Foot Locker. The end result, our Basketball business is much healthier today than it's ever been over the past 18 months, and the energy continues with the KYRIE 3 and the LeBron 14 [ph] generating off-the-charts anticipation. With the upcoming launch of our first new signature shoe in years, the Paul George 1, [ph] get ready for even more consumer and commercial energy in NIKE Basketball over the next few months.
With all this strong sell-through combined with what's coming, we expect a return to growth in NIKE Basketball over the back half of the fiscal year. At the same time, Jordan footwear continues to electrify the marketplace with products that generate excitement through vibrant storytelling. In Q2, this was highlighted by the global launch of the much anticipated Space Jam 11 [ph] collection in both performance and lifestyle. And when combined with other releases this quarter like the Jordan 1s, the True Blue 3s [ph] and the 9 and the original colorway, [ph] we surprise and delight the sneaker fans across the globe.
This is the power of what we do. The ability to drive energy through a combination of history, culture and performance. When we combine many of our hottest styles together, as we have showed with our 12 souls [ph] collection that launched in our SoHo store, it brings together performance and sportswear with a power no other brand can match. And our strong momentum in the next truly global sport is coming at the right time as we approach the launch, of our partnership with the NBA.[ph] 
In Q2, our Sportswear category grew high teens, its 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Today, we are driving our amplified sport strategy as we go deeper with our best products mixing innovation and style, creating sneaker heat [ph] from running to basketball to women's to young athletes. As Mark mentioned, we have shown creativity and versatility in dimensionalizing [ph] our footwear franchises across these categories. We've also shown visibility in the marketplace by connecting these products to consumers with a twofold approach. We create energy through targeted releases while also giving consumers easy access through broader launches across the marketplace.
Throughout this work, we're seeing strong sell-through for silhouettes that mix our past with a modern simplicity like the Presto mid-utility, [ph] the Flyknit Racer [ph] and a new style, the LunarCharge, which we brought to market in roughly 1/4 of the time it usually takes, thanks to our accelerated footwear creation capacity. That's the power of our express lane [ph] process.
We also had the successful launch of our beautiful power collection for her, which feature great styles like the Cortez classic [ph] and the Air Max Thea Ultra [ph] in all-black, premium leather. At the same time, we drove traffic into our dedicated women's bases [ph] with 2 exclusive city styles for the Air Max 90. [ph] All this work and so much more goes to consistent efforts to serving women who covet sneaker style.
Now before I move on from Sportswear, I want to make one very important point. We continue to see extraordinary growth in our Sportswear apparel business across men's and women's up and down the price points and fueled by over fleece collections. This marketplace energy comes from the power and creativity we're using to expand what sport means to the lifestyle of today's consumer.
Now let's take a look at a few of our key geographies. In Q2, North America revenue was up 3%. From the Cavs to the Cubs, [ph] sports in North America have never been more inspiring. And the energy is set to continue with the upcoming playoffs in college football and the NFL, filled entirely the teams wearing NIKE. As we continue to serve these athletes and celebrate these heroes and storylines, it's no surprise our brand is so strong.
From a marketplace perspective, we're seeing continued improvement, with inventory down 4%. We continue to keep supply tight, which you'll see reflected in futures. And as a result, we expect a stronger sell-through to the end consumer, which ultimately results in stronger revenue growth. Andy will talk more about this in our guidance, but this is another area where we identified the challenge, we attacked it and now we're starting to see the returns. Q2 growth in North America was led by DTC where we experienced a strong start to the holiday season over the Black Friday weekend. Compared to last year, we saw double-digit traffic increases and higher conversion and higher dollars per transaction across our stores and NIKE.com. And our new SoHo store in New York is not only a source of growth in this important market, it's a powerful look at the future of sports retail, product trials with experts, [ph] elevated personalized experiences and heightened member engagement, all while seamlessly combining digital and physical. We create environments that bring our products and services together in a way that allows consumers to experience the NIKE Brand in its most sublime state. And we are executing this strategy through our DTC businesses as well as with our key strategic wholesale partners who share this vision. We still see tremendous potential in North America. And with the strategies in place, we will grow both NIKE and the overall marketplace.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we saw our 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, with strong growth across nearly all categories, led by Sportswear and Running. Mark mentioned our first European Jordan store in Paris. Just as in SoHo, we see the Jordan best deal [ph] store as the future of retail, featuring premium products and services like customization and interactive wear testing. [ph] And as always, our footprint in football continues to expand across Europe, with our recent re-signing of the French, English and Turkish federations as well as the recent Golden Ball winner, Cristiano Ronaldo. [ph] And with the start of our new relationship with Chelsea Football Club [ph] next season, our brand is Europe is only getting stronger.
Lastly, Greater China continued its strong results with its 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, highlighted by another quarter of triple-digit growth in NIKE.com. We had our biggest singles day [ph] ever, reaching nearly 3x last year's sales. Our success followed our decisions to feature exclusive products on NIKE.com and at NIKE-only stores and give early access to high-heat products for our Nike+ members. And we also saw tremendous results with T-Mall. [ph] The Greater China marketplace continues to be fueled by higher sports participation, with 38,000 runners taking part in the Shanghai marathon, while nearly 4x that many consumers tried to sign up. Runners were introduced to NIKE's premium services by customizing their Nike Pro Bross [ph] and creating custom shoes at NIKE ID stations, just to name a few. In fact, I was in China a few weeks ago, and I met one athlete who achieved a personal dream to run the Shanghai marathon. What struck me wasn't just her desire to reach her potential, but the importance of NIKE's role in meeting her complete lifestyle needs: to look good, to feel confident and to connect with others throughout her journey. I left China reminded of the amazing potential for our brand as we move at her speed and we authentically serve athletes like her.
All in all, we are still in early days of our marking [ph] to growth in this important geography. In the end, we have the strategies in place that yield results. Consumers have so many choices more than ever, which is why we are glad that we have the foundation in place to connect consumers with energy and excitement. We know what works, and we know how to create, amplify and sustain our opportunities. Make no mistake, in 2017, we will stay on offense. This mentality is one of our greatest competitive advantages, that relentless drive to serve our athlete and consumers is what keeps us in the lead. Thanks. Now here's Andy."
291981,411443623,1104196,"NIKE, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and happy holidays to everyone on the call. The enduring passion for sport around the world and consumers' desire to lead a more active lifestyle continue to fuel new opportunities for growth in our industry. And the growth potent",2139,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and happy holidays to everyone on the call. The enduring passion for sport around the world and consumers' desire to lead a more active lifestyle continue to fuel new opportunities for growth in our industry. And the growth potential in our industry has always attracted competition. That said, as Mark noted, Q2 was NIKE's 28th consecutive quarter of growth. Each and every quarter over the past 7 years, NIKE has grown despite healthy competition within our industry, extreme macroeconomic volatility, discontinuities in the retail landscape and rapidly evolving trends in consumer preferences. That track record does not happen by accident. As the leading brand in sports, we are on the offense always. We take nothing for granted. We continuously evaluate how we can better leverage our unrivaled portfolio of businesses and competitive advantages to grow the market and win. From a brand and business perspective, we are obsessed with staying one step ahead of consumer expectations. And maintaining that focus and pace [ph] is what ultimately separates NIKE from the competition over the long haul. From a financial perspective, we're obsessed with delivering: one, strong growth; two, expanding profitability; and three, high returns on invested capital. We continue to manage all of the operating levers in our business to deliver across all 3 dimensions of our financial model, and that has afforded NIKE unmatched scale and resources. Like the world's best marathoners, the results that we post always reflect moments where we have pushed the pace and moments where we took stock [ph] of the circumstances and made adjustments.
In the second quarter, we executed on the plan that we shared with you 90 days ago. We pushed the pace with innovation because, as Mark noted, there is no such thing as sustained growth without innovation. We also made important adjustments, for example, with respect to supply and demand management to ensure the sustainability, profitability and capital efficiency of our growth long term.
From a product innovation perspective, we launched several innovative and beautifully designed footwear and apparel styles across both our performance categories and Sportswear. Perhaps, most notably, we launched of the HyperAdapt 1.0, which is an innovative product in its own right and also a glimpse into the future of personalized performance. As we look ahead to the second half of fiscal year '17, we will continue pushing the pace with products such as the Air VaporMax that merge innovation and style.
In Q2, we also innovated at retail. As we've said in the past, NIKE's growth trajectory is not highly correlated with macroeconomic trends nor has our growth solely a function of market share. Our primary focus has always been on growing the overall market, creating greater capacity for the NIKE Brand over the long term. Today, we see the potential to increasingly leverage digital, to more personally and fully serve consumers, unlocking new growth and productivity within and well beyond the 4 walls of a retail store. As Trevor mentioned in November, we opened NIKE SoHo in New York, which sheds light on our vision for the future of retail.
Finally, we continue to innovate within our supply chain. Our investments in manufacturing revolution, our partnerships with Flex and Apollo, [ph] and the speed and agility initiatives that Mark referenced all enable us to bring product creation closer to the consumer, while also enhancing labor productivity and reducing materials waste. As the world becomes increasingly dynamic, we could not be more pleased with the head start that we have in terms of supply chain innovation. While we pushed the pace with innovation in Q2, we also made important adjustments in areas where we knew we could do better. Trevor referred to the work we have done to reignite strong momentum in NIKE Basketball. We also took the actions required to return North America to a pull market. We have grown our business in North America for 7 consecutive years. No other brand has near [ph] our scale or our proven ability to expand the market in this important geography. That said, we are relentlessly self-critical at NIKE. Several factors led to elevated inventory in North America, including the West Coast port congestion, issues in our North America distribution center, third-party retail discontinuities and lower-than-expected sell-through on a few key items last year, most notably 2 signature styles in Basketball. The actions we have taken to rebalance our supply negatively impacted our gross margin over the past 2 quarters. But at NIKE, we manage for the long term. Based on the progress we have made, we now expect North America to continue growing in the second half of the fiscal year with a return to expanding growth margins and tighter inventory levels. With that context, let's turn to a more detailed review of our Q2 financial results and our outlook going forward.
In Q2, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased over 6%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 8% led by double-digit growth in Western Europe, Greater China and the emerging markets. Second quarter diluted EPS of $0.50 increased 11% versus the prior year driven by revenue growth, SG&A leverage and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted approximately 140 basis points in the quarter, roughly in line with our expectations. Full-priced [ph] average selling prices continue to expand. However, margin contracted overall due to higher product cost, FX headwinds and a higher mix of off-price versus the prior year and the more discrete or temporary items that we referenced last quarter.
Demand creation decreased 1% for the quarter, according to plan, following significant Q1 investments in the Olympics and Euro champs. [ph] Operating overhead decreased 3% as our continued strategic investments are being funded by productivity gains as we increasingly edit to amplify within our core operations.
The effective tax rate for Q2 was 24.4% compared to 19.1% for the same period last year, primarily due to an increased mix of U.S. earnings which are generally subject to a higher tax rate. As of November 30, inventories were up 9%. Wholesale units grew just 1%. The remainder of the expansion in inventory was driven by a higher average cost due primarily to product mix as well as growth in support of our fast-growing DTC businesses. Now let's turn to the performance of a few key operating segments.
North America revenue grew 3% on both a reported and constant currency basis to $3.7 billion, with balanced growth across footwear and apparel. Growth was led by DTC, which grew 17%, with 10% comp store growth. EBIT from [ph] North America increased 3% in the quarter as revenue growth, full-priced gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage all contributed to increased profitability. These factors were partially offset by a higher mix of off-price versus the same period in the prior year. In the second half of fiscal year '17, you will see evidence of the progress that we have made returning North America to a pull market. North America revenue growth will continue to outpace futures, and that will be coupled with a return to gross margin expansion.
In Western Europe, revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis as we continue to see strong multidimensional growth across the business from footwear to apparel, performance categories to Sportswear, wholesale to DTC and across all territories. Standout categories for the quarter were Sportswear, Running and Jordan. On a reported basis, revenue increased 7% while EBIT declined 23%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.
Our emerging markets geography grew 13% [ph] on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth across Sportswear, Running and Jordan and across the territories of Soco, [ph] Korea and Mexico. On a reported basis, revenue and EBIT continued to be heavily impacted by FX headwinds. As a result, reported revenue increased 6% while EBIT decreased 2%.
Finally, Greater China continues to deliver exceptional results. Currency-neutral revenue grew 17% in the quarter, reflecting strong growth across nearly all dimensions of our business. Most categories grew double digits, and our DTC businesses delivered another quarter of tremendous growth, up 42%. NIKE is the leading brand in China, with the deepest, most authentic connections to the Chinese consumer. We expect strong and steady growth going forward in China as we serve consumers through China's fast-growing digital ecosystem and our continued expansion of category-oriented NIKE-branded concepts at retail. On a reported basis, revenue grew 12% and EBIT expanded 15% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage.
Over the balance of the fiscal year, we will continue to manage for the long term with our focus on ensuring sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth. 
As for specific guidance, for the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth in the high single-digit range. That said, FX headwinds from further strengthening of the U.S. dollar have put downward pressure on our second half revenue forecast. While our hedges will delay and partially mitigate the impact of FX on our profitability, we do not hedge the revenue line item per se. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect revenue growth for the full year to be within the high single to low double-digit range. For Q3, we expect reported revenue to grow squarely in the mid-single-digit range.
As we shared on our last earnings conference call, we are changing the sequencing of our communications regarding NIKE Brand futures orders. Futures orders will now be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call in the same detail as previously reported in our earnings release. As you will see, currency-neutral futures orders are growing 2%, driven by a 1% increase in units, with increases in average selling prices contributing the other 1 percentage point of growth. Futures orders are flat versus prior year on a reported basis. As you know, futures orders growth and reported revenue growth have become increasingly less correlated. That lesser correlation is evidenced by the roughly 5 percentage-point disparity between our guidance for Q3 reported revenue growth and our futures growth on a reported basis. The longer-term, more systemic drivers of the disparity include: first, impacts related to our evolving DTC versus wholesale business mix. For example, DTC futures are reported on a wholesale-equivalent basis. However, reported revenue for DTC is recognized based upon the full retail price to consumers. Therefore, as the mix of futures shifts towards DTC, NIKE's overall reported revenue impacts will inherently grow faster than futures.
Second, material dimensions of our revenue are not included within futures orders, such as Converse, NIKE factory stores and our shorter lead time or at once businesses. There can only also be temporary anomalies between futures orders and reported revenue growth. One of the most notable is consumer sell-through. Take, for example, North America, where as you will see, futures orders are down 4%. But we expect continued revenue growth and expanding margins over the second half of this fiscal year. In the second half of fiscal year '16, we had elevated inventory levels for the reasons we have detailed. In the second half of fiscal year '17, we now have tighter supply against continuing strong demand, and that will have a favorable impact on revenue growth as a result of lower year-over-year cancellations, returns and discounts.
Other temporary anomalies can include the timing of our buys related to launches, key sports moments and other events. In short, the key takeaway is that our revenue guidance reflects a much more comprehensive outlook for our business as compared to using reported futures orders growth as a proxy.
Turning to gross margin. For the second half of the fiscal year, we expect less contraction than we experienced in the first half as we see stronger, full-priced sell-through to consumers. For Q3, we expect gross margin to contract by approximately 100 to 125 basis points, driven primarily by FX. The fundamental drivers of NIKE's long-term gross margin expansion remain intact, including higher average selling prices, product cost optimization through our manufacturing revolution efforts and the positive mix benefit associated with our fast-growing DTC businesses.
For total SG&A, we now expect full year growth in the low single to mid-single-digit range. As we edit to amplify, we expect Q3 SG&A to grow in the mid-single to high single digits. We expect other income, net of interest expense, to be approximately $80 million for the full year, and approximately 0 in Q3. We continue to expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 17% for the full year. For Q3, we expect the rate to be approximately 18% to 20%.
As evidenced by our Q2 results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to be on the offense, focused on driving sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth over the long term.
With that, we'll now open the call up for your questions."

The consumers' response to the latest signature styles has been incredibly strong, and we're seeing some more energy moments to come. What we have -- what we've definitely seen in North America is we've seen healthy sell-throughs on the KYRIE 2s, the LeBron soldiers, the KD9s, the KOBE ADs, the Jordan 31s, so we're seeing a really comprehensive shift towards energy coming towards Basketball both in the numbers but also on the street, on the ground, you're seeing it both on the court and on the court. One of the things I would like to do with Basketball is maybe broaden the context so that we're also thinking about our Sportswear business which is a part of our Basketball. And in Sportswear, the Air Force 1 styles continue to actually perform very well. The special forces Air Force 1 was exceptionally strong. The -- part was also good and Jordan both on its performance, the Jordan 31 and the retro style did really well.

Happy holidays, by the way. As you noted, our inventory in North America is down. And as we talked about on the call, we feel like we've made a tremendous amount of progress in tightening supply and demand and positioning ourselves for more sustainable, profitable growth in the second half. Just to give you some dimension on that, we have had very strong sell-through in in-line. We had a great holiday season. We continue to see tremendous growth in NIKE.com, for example. And I'll remind you that we also have our factory store business, and that has been a great channel or outlet for us to take the action that were required to rebalance supply and demand and we have seen phenomenal traffic and conversion and comp store growth in that dimension of the business, so feel great from that perspective. And then I'll hand it over to Trevor but as Trevor noted, we are seeing tremendous opportunities for growth in some of the biggest and most important categories in North America, that being Sportswear which continues to deliver strong growth both footwear and apparel. We feel like we've reignited strong momentum in Basketball and as Trevor said, -- we're fast approaching the launch of the NBA partnership. So again, tighter inventories, continued growth and a return to gross margin expansion in North America is what we see."

I think to touch on what Andy just touched on, there is more promotional activity in the marketplace. Having said that, when we tightened supply and demand, we're seeing increasingly stronger full-priced sales so we feel good about that. In North America again, we are seeing our sell-throughs perform at a much better level. The other thing that you will see coming into the spring season, you're going to see a lot of excitement, some of the great products we have on tap. So we are very excited and bullish about as we launch of the Air VaporMax, not only for the VaporMax itself but also because it will drive a greater Air business across our business. So we think as we bring more innovation in the marketplace that allows us to obviously command stronger full price in our products. And with that, I mean, we'll -- we definitely seen all the signs that the actual decline in inventory is now proving the strongest sell-through -- we're seeing stronger sell-through as a result."

We've always had the ability to move quickly and respond. What we're doing now through express lane, particularly as we scale this capability across the org, is to make this a sustained season-in, season-out part of what we do and how we operate. The exciting thing about the express lane is it literally puts us in a position to, as I've mentioned, deliver product from start to finish, completely new product in weeks versus months. The LunarCharge is a great example in this last quarter of a product that literally went through that complete start from scratch to a completed product it went out to the market and the sell-throughs on that have been incredibly positive. So we're now in the midst as we move into the second half of the year and then beyond, frankly, this is sort of new norm is to make this a part of a sort of the muscle that we have to give us a more complete competitive advantage. We're focused right now in footwear but we see this scaling also across apparel as well. I'm personally, as a product nerd, incredibly excited, not just by the ability to do this by to take it to a significantly higher scale."

And I'd love to give a context which is both, when you go in the stores and you walk the streets, you can certainly see the energy and vibrancy for the brand, and you can see that in also in the strong sell-through that we're seeing in the marketplace. Across Singles Day, Singles Day, we actually were 3x, it was 300% greater this year than last in terms of sales. And so we's are seeing tremendous growth in the .com business. The categories that are performing well are Sportswear, Running, Jordan Brand and NIKE Basketball all performing really well, which were the key ones we decided to focus in on in China. We also continue to have really tremendous amount of doors in the marketplace, over 6,000 doors. So we're really ever-present in the market, which allows us to expand and tell the right stories and create the the right impact. And one of the biggest tailwinds that we always have is sports participation. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, certainly, the Shanghai marathon is one example of watching this market become increasingly sophisticated around participation, around their connection to sport and also their connection into sport culture, and so we see that across multiple dimensions. So I continue to feel very bullish about China as we do as a total group. And again, 10 consecutive quarters of continuous growth."

We are a global company, obviously, operating in over 190 countries, serving billions of consumers with close to 70,000 employees.

We talked about that publicly and that continues to be the case. So we're looking for expanding on those opportunities as much as we possibly can and working with this administration in that respect. We're making the real headway on our ManRev initiative. It certainly reflects -- we talked about Apollo, we've got new methods of manufacturing that we're really focused on here toward Advanced Product Creation Center. Some of the most exciting innovations we have beyond product is in this space. And the good news is that it not only enables us to get closer to the market with more customized, personalized products potentially but it also helps to just create a better business overall so the financial impact is definitely there.

At the same time, I think it's really important to note that what's most important to us is growing the overall market, as we said. And that has less to do with owned versus partnered and more to do with the nature of the experiences that we're putting into the marketplace. SoHo is a great example. It happens to be owned. The focus is really much more personalized service to the consumer. And creating what we really calling the new square foot, leveraging digital to more fully serve consumer and expand the productivity.

Leading today's call is Nitesh Sharan, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Sharan, please let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to the mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.
In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf, are not included in these futures numbers. Following the conference call, the futures order schedule will be posted to the financials schedules on the NIKE Investor Relations website.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales and constant dollar revenue. References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprints of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Similarly, references to constant dollar revenue are intended to provide context as to the performance of the business eliminating foreign exchange fluctuations. Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. Discussion of nonpublic financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, http://investors.nikeinc.com.

Q2 was another quarter of positive momentum for NIKE, Inc. Let's start with the numbers.
NIKE, Inc.'s second quarter revenues were up 6% growing to $8.2 billion and, on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8%. Gross margin declined approximately 140 basis points to 44.2%, earnings per share increased 11% to $0.50 and we delivered ROIC of 31.3%.
In the fast-moving world of sports and news culture, results like these come from our obsession with the consumer, of knowing what they need and what inspires them. That's what drives innovation at NIKE, and innovation is what drives growth. Our approach has fueled 28 consecutive quarters of growth at a scale that is unrivaled in our industry. We have a strong track record and, more importantly, we have an even better runway ahead.
With the energy we see in sports right now, along with today's more active lifestyle, it's no surprise that our industry continues to attract competition. As in sports, competition is a positive thing. It sharpens our focus. And we know there are areas in the short term where we haven't executed as precisely as we would've liked. As good as we are, we can be even better by hyper-focusing on our most compelling growth opportunities.
Starting with the consumer, who's not asking for more product but looking for more choice of the products they love. We're responding by giving this consumer more distinctive options with fewer products, what we call edit to amplify. Reducing styles and highlighting key items and concepts has a huge impact across our entire value chain. And this is especially important in North America and our key geographies as we better manage supply and demand to drive productivity and profitable top line growth while highlighting and scaling our most compelling product stories.
We're looking at our success in China, where we amplify what's working and edit out what's not to accelerate growth. Beyond product, e-commerce is one example as we double down on the power of digital in this mobile-first market. We also know from our consumers that speed matters. That insight is driving several speed and agility initiatives throughout our company. For example, we're scaling a process we call the Express Lane, which allows us to go from creation to market in weeks instead of months. The Express Lane is becoming an important competitive advantage, and it led to a new product called the LunarCharge this quarter, which is seeing strong consumer demand.
We've always given consumers high-energy product in the right place at the right time. We're now leveraging and creating capabilities on a much larger scale. The investments we make in manufacturing revolution and throughout the supply chain are going a long way in helping us realize that. Editing to amplify and driving speed and agility are keys to winning now. They also help set the foundation for growth in the future.
The other focus for us, of course, is innovation, my top priority for the company. Innovation is what offers differentiation for consumers and takes them somewhere new. It's how we lead the market. To be clear, without innovation, there is no such thing as sustained growth. We have some exciting new platforms underway, starting with Air VaporMax, our highest performance and most visually striking Air Max cushioning system ever. We see a growing anticipation around Air VaporMax from runners to sneaker retailers. It's a great example of an innovation that stands at the intersection of high-tech, pure function and esthetic beauty. We expect big things from Air VaporMax in Running and we have an ambitious road map to bring it to life through other sports.
In apparel, we launched Therma-Sphere in Running, adding to our diverse lineup of apparel that offers warmth without weight in cold weather. The sphere family including its lead style, Element sphere, is performing very well in the marketplace. We also launched the Strike series featuring AeroSwift technology, establishing the new look of football training.
This quarter, we delivered on the promise of personalized performance with our first adaptive product, the HyperAdapt 1.0. And there's a reason we called it the 1.0. Generations 2 and 3 are in the works, expanding adaptive performance products across other sport categories. There was huge demand for the HyperAdapt 1.0, and we plan to drive that momentum into adaptive products at a much larger scale. And there's a lot more on deck with new cushioning experiences in Running and Basketball, digitally integrated product, advancements in customization and personalization and breakthroughs in lightweight performance. Our pipeline is very strong. Covering the near, medium and long-term horizons, we've created both platforms in category-defining products designed in a distinctive style that spans all categories. We're driving a pace and a scale of innovation that will deliver growth for years to come.
Right now, the consumer continues to respond to new generations of our state-of-the-art platforms in Flyknit, Free and Lunarlon. This year we redesigned NIKE Free and brought a whole new sensation to Lunarlon with the LunarEpic. Both continue to be huge drivers of our business in both Training and Running for both men and women. Flyknit is also advancing well beyond our expectations. Its versatility is allowing us to create unexpected forms across multiple sports for all weather conditions and even blending it with other materials to advance both performance and style. And you're about to see even more firepower coming out of Basketball. You'll hear more from Trevor on this, but we're in a good position to build on recent successes in NIKE Basketball and Jordan for the back half of the fiscal year.
Another advantage we leverage is NIKE's deep reservoir of iconic styles and innovation. It's a source of inspiration to our design teams and a tremendous source of growth for our business. There's always been a huge consumer appetite for reinterpreted franchises and icons. Take the Air Force 1 as one example this past quarter. Of course, the original remains a staple. But this quarter, consumers responded to some of our long-awaited reissued Air Force 1s. Versions like the New York City, the LA, the Chi-Town and the Linen. But we also give it new life through a weather-repelling sneaker boot, a featherweight Flyknit style and a NIKELab version with premium materials. One style that drove tremendous heat in the Air Force 1 family this quarter was the Special Field Air Force 1, bringing a new look to an icon, this exciting new model has been selling through very quickly.
I think there's a misconception that growth in our Lifestyle business comes at the expense of growth in our performance business. The reality is they fuel each other. Performance and Lifestyle are not tradeoffs. Consumers want innovation that is styled right, and they want style with real innovation. They want product that helps them do more and get better, that's comfortable and light and looks great on the court and on the street. Ultimately, they want choices that look and feel good across the spectrum of performance and lifestyle, including performance products that are high demand and fueling growth like the LeBron Soldier, the Jordan XXXI, the KOBE A.D., the Flyknit Racer, the LunarEpic Low and the upcoming Air VaporMax. NIKE's opportunity is to continue to deliver across that spectrum to accelerate our leading performance position and the world's largest sportswear business.
Part of our role as the industry leader is to continue to grow the whole market for sport, and that means knowing where the consumer is headed. We're leading through digital. We made a move long ago to integrate brand, service and commerce in a meaningful way for consumers. No one in our space is close to connecting all 3 and turning it into value for the business the way that we do. We brought this to life in a powerful way this quarter with NIKE SoHo. The 5-story store is built around trial zones, personalized services and amazing product. It's bringing digital and physical retail together to deepen our relationships with our customers. It's clear that DTC continues to be one of the greatest returns on investment. In Q2, our DTC business grew 23%, with NIKE.com leading the way at 46%. There continues to be much more growth potential ahead for NIKE in DTC.
We're also accelerating partnerships with our multi-brand wholesalers. We share our vision for serving our customers with elevated and differentiated consumer experiences. DICK's is a great example, with its full-service footwear departments. Other examples this quarter include our women's lifestyle concept shop with Nordstrom, our first European Jordan store in Paris with Foot Locker and our most digitally integrated multi-brand consumer experience with JD. More and more consumers want a seamless shopping experience across physical and digital, and we're delivering that completely through our DTC wholesale partners in wholesale.com.
I feel really good about where NIKE stands for the long term. We're earning our #1 position every single day. We're facing our challenges head-on, and we're obsessing the fundamentals while seizing opportunities to be disruptive in leading our industry. We are well positioned for the back half of the year and, more importantly, we're clear on the opportunities in front of us and confident in our plans to drive long-term growth and shareholder value for years to come.
Thanks. And now here's Trevor."

As always, my remarks are on a constant-currency basis.The NIKE Brand revenue grew 8%, led by broad-based growth across our largest geographies an",1875,"Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another solid quarter of growth in Q2. As always, my remarks are on a constant-currency basis.
The NIKE Brand revenue grew 8%, led by broad-based growth across our largest geographies and categories. And NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 25%, driven by continued strong growth in digital commerce, 11% comp store growth and new store expansion.
In Q2, we attacked opportunities across our portfolio to strengthen and extend our leadership position. In particular, I'd like to mention 3 of note. First, we're seeing incredible momentum in Basketball. To be clear, Basketball is back. Second, we have made tremendous progress aligning supply and demand in North America, returning this important geography to a pull market. And third, we continue to see strong and steady momentum in Greater China as we continue to invest in that market to fuel growth.
Now let's take a look at some of our key categories, starting with Running. Running is our largest performance category and continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and growth, with Q2 revenue growing at a double-digit rate. It also continues to be one of our most influential and largest drivers of our Sportswear business. Now even if the weather turns, our runners never slow down. They inspire us to provide solutions to help them get out and run more. Mark mentioned the popular LunarEpic and, in Q2, we launched the LunarEpic Flyknit Shield, with its all-weather construction designed to keep the foot warm and dry. It's another example of how NIKE expands the market by adapting our popular platforms to new audiences and serve consumer needs. Other Running footwear successes included the Pegasus 33 and the Air Max 2017, which features a fly mesh upper and a full-length Max Air unit.
In apparel, products offering lightweight yet breathable warmth are also showing increased popularity with athletes from the most elite to the everyday, highlighted by the Aeroloft and the Sphere platforms. And I'd be remiss if I did not mention the excitement we're seeing around the Apple Watch Nike+, and it sells well ahead of our plans.
Lastly, Mark mentioned the Air VaporMax, which is not only an amazing star in its own right but an innovation that will fuel growth across the entire Nike Air family of products, and I'm really excited about this platform which will be in the market this spring.
Next, Basketball. As a leader in Basketball, we never settle. We note there's always work to be done. Last year, we knew we didn't perform to our potential in Basketball. Whilst we have a diverse portfolio across NIKE Basketball, Jordan and Sportswear, we recognize that 2 of our signature styles were not resonating with consumers to our expectations. We saw the opportunity, and we addressed it. First, we went back to the fundamentals and redesigned our products with stronger esthetics and delivered better price value to our consumers. That work led to dynamic products like the KYRIE 2, the LeBron Soldier 10, the KD9, the Jordan XXXI, the KOBE A.D. and the Westbrook 0.2. All of these have been incredibly popular with consumers on and off the court.
Second, we created demand and energy in the marketplace, with our Out of Nowhere campaign. And third, we delivered all this powerfully through retail, for example, with our House of Hoops partnership with Foot Locker. The end result, our Basketball business is much healthier today than it's ever been over the past 18 months, and the energy continues with the KYRIE 3 and the LeBron 14 generating off-the-charts anticipation. With the upcoming launch of our first new signature shoe in years, the Paul George 1, get ready for even more consumer and commercial energy in NIKE Basketball over the next few months.
With all this strong sell-through combined with what's coming, we expect a return to growth in NIKE Basketball over the back half of the fiscal year. At the same time, Jordan footwear continues to electrify the marketplace with products that generate excitement through vibrant storytelling. In Q2, this was highlighted by the global launch of the much anticipated Space Jam 11 collection in both performance and lifestyle. And when combined with other releases this quarter like the Jordan 1s, the True Blue 3s and the XI in the original colorway, we surprised and delighted sneaker fans across the globe.
This is the power of what we do. The ability to drive energy through a combination of history, culture and performance. When we combine many of our hottest styles together, as we have showed with our 12 Soles collection that launched in our SoHo store, it brings together performance and sportswear with a power no other brand can match. And our strong momentum in the next truly global sport is coming at the right time as we approach the launch, of our partnership with the NBA.
In Q2, our Sportswear category grew high teens, its 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Today, we are driving our amplified sport strategy as we go deeper with our best products mixing innovation and style, creating sneaker heat from running to basketball to women's to young athletes. As Mark mentioned, we have shown creativity and versatility in dimensionalizing our footwear franchises across these categories. We've also shown visibility in the marketplace by connecting these products to consumers with a twofold approach. We create energy through targeted releases while also giving consumers easy access through broader launches across the marketplace.
Throughout this work, we're seeing strong sell-through for silhouettes that mix our past with a modern simplicity like the Presto Mid Utility, the Flyknit Racer and a new style, the LunarCharge, which we brought to market in roughly 1/4 of the time it usually takes, thanks to our accelerated footwear creation capacity. That's the power of our Express Lane process.
We also had the successful launch of our beautiful power collection for her, which feature great styles like the Cortez Classic and the Air Max Thea Ultra in all-black, premium leather. At the same time, we drove traffic into our dedicated women spaces with 2 exclusive city styles for the Air Max 90. All this work and so much more goes to consistent efforts to serving women who covet sneaker style.
Now before I move on from Sportswear, I want to make one very important point. We continue to see extraordinary growth in our Sportswear apparel business across men's and women's up and down the price points and fueled by over fleece collections. This marketplace energy comes from the power and creativity we're using to expand what sport means to the lifestyle of today's consumer.
Now let's take a look at a few of our key geographies. In Q2, North America revenue was up 3%. From the Cavs to the Cubs, sports in North America have never been more inspiring. And the energy is set to continue with the upcoming playoffs in college football and the NFL, filled entirely the teams wearing NIKE. As we continue to serve these athletes and celebrate these heroes and storylines, it's no surprise our brand is so strong.
From a marketplace perspective, we're seeing continued improvement, with inventory down 4%. We continue to keep supply tight, which you'll see reflected in futures. And as a result, we expect a stronger sell-through to the end consumer, which ultimately results in stronger revenue growth. Andy will talk more about this in our guidance, but this is another area where we identified the challenge, we attacked it and now we're starting to see the returns. Q2 growth in North America was led by DTC where we experienced a strong start to the holiday season over the Black Friday weekend. Compared to last year, we saw double-digit traffic increases and higher conversion and higher dollars per transaction across our stores and NIKE.com. And our new SoHo store in New York is not only a source of growth in this important market, it's a powerful look at the future of sports retail, product trials with experts, elevated personalized experiences and heightened member engagement, all while seamlessly combining digital and physical. We create environments that bring our products and services together in a way that allows consumers to experience the NIKE Brand in its most sublime state. And we are executing this strategy through our DTC businesses as well as with our key strategic wholesale partners who share this vision. We still see tremendous potential in North America. And with the strategies in place, we will grow both NIKE and the overall marketplace.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we saw our 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, with strong growth across nearly all categories, led by Sportswear and Running. Mark mentioned our first European Jordan store in Paris. Just as in SoHo, we see the Jordan Bastille store as the future of retail, featuring premium products and services like customization and interactive wear testing. And as always, our footprint in football continues to expand across Europe, with our recent re-signing of the French, English and Turkish federations as well as the recent Golden Boot winner, Cristiano Ronaldo. And with the start of our new relationship with Chelsea Football Club next season, our brand is Europe is only getting stronger.
Lastly, Greater China continued its strong results with its 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, highlighted by another quarter of triple-digit growth in NIKE.com. We had our biggest Singles Day ever, reaching nearly 3x last year's sales. Our success followed our decisions to feature exclusive products on NIKE.com and at NIKE-only stores and give early access to high-heat products for our Nike+ members. And we also saw tremendous results with Tmall. The Greater China marketplace continues to be fueled by higher sports participation, with 38,000 runners taking part in the Shanghai marathon, while nearly 4x that many consumers tried to sign up. Runners were introduced to NIKE's premium services by customizing their Nike Pro Bras and creating custom shoes at NIKE ID stations, just to name a few. In fact, I was in China a few weeks ago, and I met one athlete who achieved a personal dream to run the Shanghai marathon. What struck me wasn't just her desire to reach her potential, but the importance of NIKE's role in meeting her complete lifestyle needs: to look good, to feel confident and to connect with others throughout her journey. I left China reminded of the amazing potential for our brand as we move at her speed and we authentically serve athletes like her.
All in all, we are still in early days of our marking the growth in this important geography. In the end, we have the strategies in place that yield results. Consumers have so many choices more than ever, which is why we are glad that we have the foundation in place to connect consumers with energy and excitement. We know what works, and we know how to create, amplify and sustain our opportunities. Make no mistake, in 2017, we will stay on offense. This mentality is one of our greatest competitive advantages, that relentless drive to serve our athlete and consumers is what keeps us in the lead. Thanks. Now here's Andy."

The enduring passion for sport around the world and consumers' desire to lead a more active lifestyle continue to fuel new opportunities for growth in our industry. And the growth potent",2127,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and happy holidays to everyone on the call. The enduring passion for sport around the world and consumers' desire to lead a more active lifestyle continue to fuel new opportunities for growth in our industry. And the growth potential in our industry has always attracted competition. That said, as Mark noted, Q2 was NIKE's 28th consecutive quarter of growth. Each and every quarter over the past 7 years, NIKE has grown despite healthy competition within our industry, extreme macroeconomic volatility, discontinuities in the retail landscape and rapidly evolving trends in consumer preferences. That track record does not happen by accident. As the leading brand in sports, we are on the offense always. We take nothing for granted. We continuously evaluate how we can better leverage our unrivaled portfolio of businesses and competitive advantages to grow the market and win. From a brand and business perspective, we are obsessed with staying one step ahead of consumer expectations. And maintaining that focus and pace is what ultimately separates NIKE from the competition over the long haul. From a financial perspective, we're obsessed with delivering: one, strong growth; two, expanding profitability; and three, high returns on invested capital. We continue to manage all of the operating levers in our business to deliver across all 3 dimensions of our financial model, and that has afforded NIKE unmatched scale and resources. Like the world's best marathoners, the results that we post always reflect moments where we have pushed the pace and moments where we took stock of the circumstances and made adjustments.
In the second quarter, we executed on the plan that we shared with you 90 days ago. We pushed the pace with innovation because, as Mark noted, there is no such thing as sustained growth without innovation. We also made important adjustments, for example, with respect to supply and demand management to ensure the sustainability, profitability and capital efficiency of our growth long term.
From a product innovation perspective, we launched several innovative and beautifully designed footwear and apparel styles across both our performance categories and Sportswear. Perhaps, most notably, we launched of the HyperAdapt 1.0, which is an innovative product in its own right and also a glimpse into the future of personalized performance. As we look ahead to the second half of fiscal year '17, we will continue pushing the pace with products such as the Air VaporMax that merge innovation and style.
In Q2, we also innovated at retail. As we've said in the past, NIKE's growth trajectory is not highly correlated with macroeconomic trends nor has our growth solely a function of market share. Our primary focus has always been on growing the overall market, creating greater capacity for the NIKE Brand over the long term. Today, we see the potential to increasingly leverage digital, to more personally and fully serve consumers, unlocking new growth and productivity within and well beyond the 4 walls of a retail store. As Trevor mentioned in November, we opened NIKE SoHo in New York, which sheds light on our vision for the future of retail.
Finally, we continue to innovate within our supply chain. Our investments in manufacturing revolution, our partnerships with Flex and Apollo, and the speed and agility initiatives that Mark referenced all enable us to bring product creation closer to the consumer, while also enhancing labor productivity and reducing materials waste. As the world becomes increasingly dynamic, we could not be more pleased with the head start that we have in terms of supply chain innovation. While we pushed the pace with innovation in Q2, we also made important adjustments in areas where we knew we could do better. Trevor referred to the work we have done to reignite strong momentum in NIKE Basketball. We also took the actions required to return North America to a pull market. We have grown our business in North America for 7 consecutive years. No other brand has near our scale or our proven ability to expand the market in this important geography. That said, we are relentlessly self-critical at NIKE. Several factors led to elevated inventory in North America, including the West Coast port congestion, issues in our North America distribution center, third-party retail discontinuities and lower-than-expected sell-through on a few key items last year, most notably 2 signature styles in Basketball. The actions we have taken to rebalance our supply negatively impacted our gross margin over the past 2 quarters. But at NIKE, we manage for the long term. Based on the progress we have made, we now expect North America to continue growing in the second half of the fiscal year with a return to expanding growth margins and tighter inventory levels. With that context, let's turn to a more detailed review of our Q2 financial results and our outlook going forward.
In Q2, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased over 6%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 8% led by double-digit growth in Western Europe, Greater China and the emerging markets. Second quarter diluted EPS of $0.50 increased 11% versus the prior year driven by revenue growth, SG&A leverage and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted approximately 140 basis points in the quarter, roughly in line with our expectations. Full-price average selling prices continue to expand. However, margin contracted overall due to higher product cost, FX headwinds and a higher mix of off-price versus the prior year and the more discrete or temporary items that we referenced last quarter.
Demand creation decreased 1% for the quarter, according to plan, following significant Q1 investments in the Olympics and Euro Champs. Operating overhead decreased 3% as our continued strategic investments are being funded by productivity gains as we increasingly edit to amplify within our core operations.
The effective tax rate for Q2 was 24.4% compared to 19.1% for the same period last year, primarily due to an increased mix of U.S. earnings which are generally subject to a higher tax rate. As of November 30, inventories were up 9%. Wholesale units grew just 1%. The remainder of the expansion in inventory was driven by a higher average cost due primarily to product mix as well as growth in support of our fast-growing DTC businesses. Now let's turn to the performance of a few key operating segments.
North America revenue grew 3% on both a reported and constant currency basis to $3.7 billion, with balanced growth across footwear and apparel. Growth was led by DTC, which grew 17%, with 10% comp store growth. EBIT for North America increased 3% in the quarter as revenue growth, full-price gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage all contributed to increased profitability. These factors were partially offset by a higher mix of off-price versus the same period in the prior year. In the second half of fiscal year '17, you will see evidence of the progress that we have made returning North America to a pull market. North America revenue growth will continue to outpace futures, and that will be coupled with a return to gross margin expansion.
In Western Europe, revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis as we continue to see strong multidimensional growth across the business from footwear to apparel, performance categories to Sportswear, wholesale to DTC and across all territories. Standout categories for the quarter were Sportswear, Running and Jordan. On a reported basis, revenue increased 7% while EBIT declined 23%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.
Our emerging markets geography grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth across Sportswear, Running and Jordan and across the territories of Soco, Korea and Mexico. On a reported basis, revenue and EBIT continued to be heavily impacted by FX headwinds. As a result, reported revenue increased 6% while EBIT decreased 2%.
Finally, Greater China continues to deliver exceptional results. Currency-neutral revenue grew 17% in the quarter, reflecting strong growth across nearly all dimensions of our business. Most categories grew double digits, and our DTC businesses delivered another quarter of tremendous growth, up 42%. NIKE is the leading brand in China, with the deepest, most authentic connections to the Chinese consumer. We expect strong and steady growth going forward in China as we serve consumers through China's fast-growing digital ecosystem and our continued expansion of category-oriented NIKE-branded concepts at retail. On a reported basis, revenue grew 12% and EBIT expanded 15% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage.
Over the balance of the fiscal year, we will continue to manage for the long term with our focus on ensuring sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth. 
As for specific guidance, for the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth in the high single-digit range. That said, FX headwinds from further strengthening of the U.S. dollar have put downward pressure on our second half revenue forecast. While our hedges will delay and partially mitigate the impact of FX on our profitability, we do not hedge the revenue line item per se. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect revenue growth for the full year to be within the high single to low double-digit range. For Q3, we expect reported revenue to grow squarely in the mid-single-digit range.
As we shared on our last earnings conference call, we are changing the sequencing of our communications regarding NIKE Brand futures orders. Futures orders will now be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call in the same detail as previously reported in our earnings release. As you will see, currency-neutral futures orders are growing 2%, driven by a 1% increase in units, with increases in average selling prices contributing the other 1 percentage point of growth. Futures orders are flat versus prior year on a reported basis. As you know, futures orders growth and reported revenue growth have become increasingly less correlated. That lesser correlation is evidenced by the roughly 5 percentage-point disparity between our guidance for Q3 reported revenue growth and our futures growth on a reported basis. The longer-term, more systemic drivers of the disparity include: first, impacts related to our evolving DTC versus wholesale business mix. For example, DTC futures are reported on a wholesale-equivalent basis. However, reported revenue for DTC is recognized based upon the full retail price to consumers. Therefore, as the mix of futures shifts towards DTC, NIKE's overall reported revenue impacts will inherently grow faster than futures.
Second, material dimensions of our revenue are not included within futures orders, such as Converse, NIKE Factory Stores and our shorter lead time or at-once businesses. There can also be temporary anomalies between futures orders and reported revenue growth. One of the most notable is consumer sell-through. Take, for example, North America, where, as you will see, futures orders are down 4%. But we expect continued revenue growth and expanding margins over the second half of this fiscal year. In the second half of fiscal year '16, we had elevated inventory levels for the reasons we have detailed. In the second half of fiscal year '17, we now have tighter supply against continuing strong demand, and that will have a favorable impact on revenue growth as a result of lower year-over-year cancellations, returns and discounts.
Other temporary anomalies include the timing of our buys related to launches, key sports moments and other events. In short, the key takeaway is that our revenue guidance reflects a much more comprehensive outlook for our business as compared to using reported futures orders growth as a proxy.
Turning to gross margin. For the second half of the fiscal year, we expect less contraction than we experienced in the first half as we see stronger, full-price sell-through to consumers. For Q3, we expect gross margin to contract by approximately 100 to 125 basis points, driven primarily by FX. The fundamental drivers of NIKE's long-term gross margin expansion remain intact, including higher average selling prices, product cost optimization through our manufacturing revolution efforts and the positive mix benefit associated with our fast-growing DTC businesses.
For total SG&A, we now expect full year growth in the low single to mid-single-digit range. As we edit to amplify, we expect Q3 SG&A to grow in the mid-single to high single digits. We expect other income, net of interest expense, to be approximately $80 million for the full year and approximately 0 in Q3. We continue to expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 17% for the full year. For Q3, we expect the rate to be approximately 18% to 20%.
As evidenced by our Q2 results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to be on the offense, focused on driving sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth over the long term.
With that, we'll now open the call up for your questions."

One of the things that we get a chance to see is we get a chance to see Basketball sort of in line, and what we are seeing is Basketball is back. The consumer response to the latest signature styles has been incredibly strong, and we're seeing some more energy moments to come. What we have -- what we've definitely seen in North America is we've seen healthy sell-throughs on the KYRIE 2s, the LeBron Soldiers, the KD9s, the KOBE A.D.s, the Jordan XXXIs, so we're seeing a really comprehensive shift towards energy coming towards Basketball both in the numbers but also in the on the street, on the ground, you're seeing it both on the court and off the court. One of the things I would like to do with Basketball is maybe broaden the context so that we're also thinking about our Sportswear business which is a part of Basketball. And in Sportswear, the Air Force 1 styles continue to actually perform very well. The Special Forces Air Force 1 was exceptionally strong, the Foamposite was also good, and Jordan both on its performance, the Jordan 31 and the retro style, did really well. So all of those really put us in a position where we feel that we are poised to get ready for the NBA partnership as we go into next year. So all the energy signs are there for us, and so we see the back half continuing to accelerate in our Basketball business."

So can you just help us reconcile where you are with the clean inventory position that you talked about, North America being down 4%, and how -- what's happening at retail this month, for instance, is altering your outlook at all, if any?"

Happy holidays, by the way. As you noted, our inventory in North America is down. And as we talked about on the call, we feel like we've made a tremendous amount of progress in tightening supply and demand and positioning ourselves for more sustainable, profitable growth in the second half. Just to give you some dimension on that, we have had very strong sell-through in in-line. We had a great holiday season. We continue to see tremendous growth in NIKE.com, for example. And I'll remind you that we also have our factory store business, and that has been a great channel or outlet for us to take the actions that were required to rebalance supply and demand, and we have seen phenomenal traffic and conversion and comp store growth in that dimension of the business, so feel great from that perspective. And then I'll hand it over to Trevor but, as Trevor noted, we are seeing tremendous opportunities for growth in some of the biggest and most important categories in North America, that being Sportswear which continues to deliver strong growth both footwear and apparel. We feel like we've really reignited strong momentum in Basketball and, as Trevor said, that's -- we're fast approaching the launch of the NBA partnership. So again, tighter inventories, continued growth and a return to gross margin expansion in North America is what we see."

I think as -- just to touch on what Andy just hit on, I would say that there is the idea of more promotional activity in the marketplace. Having said that, when we tightened supply and demand, we're seeing increasingly stronger full-price sales, so we feel good about that. In North America again, we are seeing our sell-throughs perform at a much better level. The other thing that you will see coming into the spring season, you're going to see a lot of excitement, some of the great products we have on tap. So we are very excited and bullish about -- as we launch of the Air VaporMax, not only for the VaporMax itself but also because it will drive a greater Air business across our business. So we think, as we bring more innovation in the marketplace, that allows us to obviously command stronger full price in our products. And with that, I mean, we -- like I said, we're definitely seeing all the signs that say that the actual decline in inventory is now proving the strongest sell-through -- we're seeing stronger sell-through as a result."

We've always had the ability to move quickly and respond. What we're doing now through Express Lane, particularly as we scale this capability across the org, is to make this a sustained season-in, season-out part of what we do and how we operate. The exciting thing about the Express Lane is it literally puts us in a position to, as I've mentioned, deliver product from start to finish, completely new product in weeks versus months. The LunarCharge is a great example in this last quarter of a product that literally went through that complete start from scratch to a completed product. It went out to the market, and the sell-throughs on that have been incredibly positive. So we're now in the midst, as we move into the second half of the year and then beyond, frankly, this is sort of the new norm, is to make this a part of a sort of the muscle that we have to give us a more complete competitive advantage. We're focused right now in footwear but we see this scaling also across apparel as well. I'm personally, as a product nerd, incredibly excited not just by the ability to do this but to take it to a significantly higher scale."

Obviously -- I was just in China actually a couple of weeks ago, and the thing that I continue to see is the NIKE Brand is really performing incredibly well. And I'd love to give a context which is both when you go in the stores and you walk the streets, you can certainly see the energy and vibrancy for the brand, and you can see that also in the strong sell-through that we're seeing in the marketplace. Across Singles Day, Singles Day, we actually were 3x, it was 300% greater this year than last in terms of sales. And so we're seeing tremendous growth in the dot-com business. The categories that are performing well are Sportswear, Running, Jordan Brand and NIKE Basketball, all performing really well, which were the key ones we decided to focus in on in China. We also continue to have really a tremendous amount of doors in the marketplace, over 6,000 doors. So we're really ever-present in the market, which allows us to expand and tell the right stories and create the right impact. And one of the biggest sort of tailwinds that we always have is sports participation. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, certainly, the Shanghai marathon is one example of watching this market become increasingly sophisticated around participation, around their connection to sport and also their connection into sport culture, and so we're seeing it across multiple dimensions. So I continue to feel very bullish about China as we do as a total group. And again, 10 consecutive quarters of continuous growth."

We are a global company, obviously, operating in over 190 countries, serving billions of consumers with close to 70,000 employees. So the reality for us is that the closer we can be to the consumers that we serve in markets around the world, the more efficiently we can do so.

I will say that we're highly motivated, as I said, to engage and look for opportunities to bring our product capabilities closer to markets. We've talked about that publicly, and that continues to be the case. So we're looking for expanding on those opportunities as much as we possibly can and working with the administration in that respect. We're making real headway on our ManRev initiative. Certainly reflects -- we talked about Apollo, we've got new methods of manufacturing that we're really focused on here through our Advanced Product Creation Center. Some of the most exciting innovations we have beyond product is in this space. And the good news is that it not only enables us to get closer to the market with more customized, personalized product potentially but it also helps to just create a better business overall, so the financial impact is definitely there.

And so that was also the case in the second quarter. As you review our 10-K -- 10-Q filing, you'll see some detail on that, the difference between our DTC business and our sales to third-party wholesalers. At the same time, I think it's really important to note that what's most important to us is growing the overall market, as we said. And that has less to do with owned versus partnered and more to do with the nature of the experiences that we're putting into the marketplace. SoHo is a great example. It happens to be owned. But the focus is really much more personalized services to consumer and creating what we're really calling the new square foot, leveraging digital to more fully serve consumer and expand the productivity. And we're going to increasingly do that with our wholesale partners as well. We have several very strategic wholesale partners here in North America, Western Europe and around the world. We have wholesale partners in China who operate NIKE-branded stores for us. And we think that's a big opportunity, both owned and partnered, going forward to expand the market."

Leading today's call is Nitesh Sharan, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. 
Before I turn the call over to Mr. Sharan, please let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in reports filed with the SEC, including forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to the mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.
In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf, are not included in these futures numbers. Following the conference call, the futures order schedule will be posted to the financials schedules on the NIKE Investor Relations website.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales and constant dollar revenue. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprints of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Similarly, references to constant dollar revenue are intended to provide context as to the performance of the business eliminating foreign exchange fluctuations. 
Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. Discussion of nonpublic financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, http://investors.nikeinc.com.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Nitesh Sharan, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer."

Let's start with the numbers.NIKE, Inc.'s second quarter revenues were up 6% growing to $8.2 billion and, on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. re",1563,"Thanks, Nitesh, and happy holidays, everyone. Q2 was another quarter of positive momentum for NIKE, Inc. Let's start with the numbers.
NIKE, Inc.'s second quarter revenues were up 6% growing to $8.2 billion and, on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8%. Gross margin declined approximately 140 basis points to 44.2%; earnings per share increased 11% to $0.50; and we delivered ROIC of 31.3%.
In the fast-moving world of sports and news culture, results like these come from our obsession with the consumer, of knowing what they need and what inspires them. That's what drives innovation at NIKE, and innovation is what drives growth. Our approach has fueled 28 consecutive quarters of growth at a scale that is unrivaled in our industry. We have a strong track record and, more importantly, we have an even better runway ahead.
With the energy we see in sports right now, along with today's more active lifestyle, it's no surprise that our industry continues to attract competition. As in sports, competition is a positive thing. It sharpens our focus. And we know there are areas in the short term where we haven't executed as precisely as we would have liked. As good as we are, we can be even better by hyper-focusing on our most compelling growth opportunities.
Starting with the consumer, who's not asking for more product but looking for more choice of the products they love. We're responding by giving the consumer more distinctive options with fewer products, what we call Edit to Amplify. Reducing styles and highlighting key items and concepts has a huge impact across our entire value chain. And this is especially important in North America and our key geographies as we better manage supply and demand to drive productivity and profitable top line growth while highlighting and scaling our most compelling product stories.
Or look at our success in China, where we amplify what's working and edit out what's not to accelerate growth. Beyond product, e-commerce is one example as we double down on the power of digital in this mobile-first market. 
We also know from our consumers that speed matters. That insight is driving several speed and agility initiatives throughout our company. For example, we're scaling a process we call the Express Lane, which allows us to go from creation to market in weeks instead of months. The Express Lane is becoming an important competitive advantage, and it led to a new product called the LunarCharge this quarter, which is seeing strong consumer demand.
We've always given consumers high-energy product in the right place at the right time. We're now leveraging and creating capabilities on a much larger scale. The investments we make in Manufacturing Revolution and throughout the supply chain are going a long way in helping us realize that. Editing to Amplify and driving speed and agility are keys to winning now. They also help set the foundation for growth in the future.
The other focus for us, of course, is innovation, my top priority for the company. Innovation is what offers differentiation for consumers and takes them somewhere new. It's how we lead the market. To be clear, without innovation, there is no such thing as sustained growth. We have some exciting new platforms on the way, starting with Air VaporMax, our highest performance and most visually striking Air Max cushioning system ever. We see a growing anticipation around Air VaporMax from runners to sneaker retailers. It's a great example of an innovation that stands at the intersection of high-tech, pure function and esthetic beauty. We expect big things from Air VaporMax in Running and we have an ambitious road map to bring it to life through other sports.
In apparel, we launched Therma-Sphere in Running, adding to our diverse lineup of apparel that offers warmth without weight in cold weather. The Sphere family including its lead style, Element Sphere, is performing very well in the marketplace. We also launched the Strike series featuring AeroSwift technology, establishing the new look of football training.
This quarter, we delivered on the promise of personalized performance with our first adaptive product, the HyperAdapt 1.0. And there's a reason we called it the 1.0. Generations 2 and 3 are in the works, expanding adaptive performance products across other sport categories. There was huge demand for the HyperAdapt 1.0, and we plan to drive that momentum into adaptive product at a much larger scale. 
And there's a lot more on deck with new cushioning experiences in Running and Basketball; digitally integrated product; advancements in customization and personalization; and breakthroughs in lightweight performance. Our pipeline is very strong. Covering the near-, medium- and long-term horizons, we've created both platforms and category-defining products designed in a distinctive style that spans all categories. We're driving a pace and a scale of innovation that will deliver growth for years to come.
Right now, the consumer continues to respond to new generations of our state-of-the-art platforms in Flyknit, Free and Lunarlon. This year we redesigned NIKE Free and brought a whole new sensation to Lunarlon with the LunarEpic. Both continue to be huge drivers of our business in both Training and Running for both men and women. Flyknit is also advancing well beyond our expectations. Its versatility is allowing us to create unexpected forms across multiple sports for all weather conditions and even blending it with other materials to advance both performance and style. And you're about to see even more firepower coming out of Basketball. You'll hear more from Trevor on this, but we're in a good position to build on recent successes in NIKE Basketball and Jordan for the back half of the fiscal year.
Another advantage we leverage is NIKE's deep reservoir of iconic styles and innovation. It's a source of inspiration to our design teams and a tremendous source of growth for our business. There's always been a huge consumer appetite for reinterpreted franchises and icons. Take the Air Force 1 as one example this past quarter. Of course, the original remains a staple. But this quarter, consumers responded to some of our long-awaited reissued Air Force 1s, versions like the New York City, the LA, the Chi-Town and the Linen. But we also give it new life through a weather-repelling sneaker boot, a featherweight Flyknit style and a NIKELab version with premium materials. One style that drove tremendous heat in the Air Force 1 family this quarter was the Special Field Air Force 1. Bringing a new look to an icon, this exciting new model has been selling through very quickly.
I think there's a misconception that growth in our Lifestyle business comes at the expense of growth in our performance business. The reality is they fuel each other. Performance and Lifestyle are not tradeoffs. Consumers want innovation that is style right, and they want style with real innovation. They want product that helps them do more and get better, that's comfortable and light and looks great on the court and on the street. Ultimately, they want choices that look and feel good across the spectrum of performance and lifestyle, including performance products that are high demand and fueling growth like the LeBron Soldier, the Jordan XXXI, the KOBE A.D., the Flyknit Racer, the LunarEpic Low and the upcoming Air VaporMax. NIKE's opportunity is to continue to deliver across that spectrum to accelerate our leading performance position and the world's largest sportswear business.
Part of our role as the industry leader is to continue to grow the whole market for sport, and that means knowing where the consumer is headed. We're leading through digital. We made a move long ago to integrate brand, service and commerce in a meaningful way for consumers. No one in our space is close to connecting all 3 and turning it into value for the business the way that we do. We brought this to life in a powerful way this quarter with NIKE Soho. The 5-story store is built around trial zones, personalized services and amazing product. It's bringing digital and physical retail together to deepen our relationships with our customers. 
It's clear that DTC continues to be one of the greatest returns on investment. In Q2, our DTC business grew 23%, with NIKE.com leading the way at 46%. There continues to be much more growth potential ahead for NIKE in DTC.
We're also accelerating partnerships with our multi-brand wholesalers who share our vision for serving our customers with elevated and differentiated consumer experiences. DICK's is a great example, with its full-service footwear departments. Other examples this quarter include: our women's lifestyle concept shop with Nordstrom; our first European Jordan store in Paris with Foot Locker; and our most digitally integrated multi-brand consumer experience with JD. More and more consumers want a seamless shopping experience across physical and digital, and we're delivering that completely through our DTC wholesale partners in wholesale.com.
I feel really good about where NIKE stands for the long term. We're earning our #1 position every single day. We're facing our challenges head-on, and we're obsessing the fundamentals while seizing opportunities to be disruptive in leading our industry. We are well positioned for the back half of the year and, more importantly, we're clear on the opportunities in front of us and confident in our plans to drive long-term growth and shareholder value for years to come.
Thanks. And now here's Trevor."

The NIKE Brand delivered another solid quarter of growth in Q2. As always, my remarks are on a constant-currency basis.The NIKE Brand revenue grew 8%, led by broad-based growth across our largest geographies an",1873,"Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another solid quarter of growth in Q2. As always, my remarks are on a constant-currency basis.
The NIKE Brand revenue grew 8%, led by broad-based growth across our largest geographies and categories. And NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 25%, driven by continued strong growth in digital commerce, 11% comp store growth and new store expansion.
In Q2, we attacked opportunities across our portfolio to strengthen and extend our leadership position. In particular, I'd like to mention 3 of note. First, we're seeing incredible momentum in Basketball. To be clear, Basketball is back. Second, we have made tremendous progress aligning supply and demand in North America, returning this important geography to a pull market. And third, we continue to see strong and steady momentum in Greater China as we continue to invest in that market to fuel growth.
Now let's take a look at some of our key categories, starting with Running. Running is our largest performance category and continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and growth, with Q2 revenue growing at a double-digit rate. It also continues to be one of our most influential and largest drivers of our Sportswear business. 
Now even if the weather turns, our runners never slow down. They inspire us to provide solutions to help them get out and run more. Mark mentioned the popular LunarEpic and, in Q2, we launched the LunarEpic Flyknit Shield, with its all-weather construction designed to keep the foot warm and dry. It's another example of how NIKE expands the market by adapting our popular platforms to new audiences and serve consumer needs. 
Other Running footwear successes included the Pegasus 33 and the Air Max 2017, which features a fly mesh upper and a full-length Max Air unit.
In apparel, products offering lightweight yet breathable warmth are also showing increased popularity with athletes from the most elite to the everyday, highlighted by the Aeroloft and the Sphere platforms. And I'd be remiss if I did not mention the excitement we're seeing around the Apple Watch Nike+, as it sells well ahead of our plans.
Lastly, Mark mentioned the Air VaporMax, which is not only an amazing star in its own right but an innovation that will fuel growth across the entire Nike Air family of products, and I'm really excited about this platform which will be in the market this spring.
Next, Basketball. As the leader in Basketball, we never settle. We know there's always work to be done. Last year, we knew we didn't perform to our potential in Basketball. Whilst we have a diverse portfolio across NIKE Basketball, Jordan and Sportswear, we recognized that 2 of our signature styles were not resonating with consumers to our expectations. 
We saw the opportunity, and we addressed it. First, we went back to the fundamentals and redesigned our products with stronger aesthetics and delivered better price value to our consumers. That work led to dynamic products like the KYRIE 2, the LeBron Soldier 10, the KD9, the Jordan XXXI, the KOBE A.D. and the Westbrook 0.2. All of these have been incredibly popular with consumers on and off the court. Second, we created demand and energy in the marketplace, with our Out of Nowhere campaign. And third, we delivered all this powerfully through retail, for example, with our House of Hoops partnership with Foot Locker. The end result, our Basketball business is much healthier today than it's ever been over the past 18 months, and the energy continues with the KYRIE 3 and the LeBron 14 generating off-the-charts anticipation. With the upcoming launch of our first new signature shoe in years, the Paul George 1, get ready for even more consumer and commercial energy in NIKE Basketball over the next few months.
With all this strong sell-through combined with what's coming, we expect a return to growth in NIKE Basketball over the back half of the fiscal year. At the same time, Jordan footwear continues to electrify the marketplace with products that generate excitement through vibrant storytelling. In Q2, this was highlighted by the global launch of the much anticipated Space Jam 11 collection in both performance and Lifestyle. And when combined with other releases this quarter like the Jordan 1s, the True Blue 3s and the XI in the original colorway, we surprised and delighted sneaker fans across the globe.
This is the power of what we do; the ability to drive energy through a combination of history, culture and performance. When we combine many of our hottest styles together, as we have showed with our 12 Soles collection that launched in our Soho store, it brings together performance and sportswear with a power no other brand can match. And our strong momentum in the next truly global sport is coming at the right time as we approach the launch of our partnership with the NBA.
In Q2, our Sportswear category grew high-teens, its 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Today, we are driving our amplified sport strategy as we go deeper with our best products, mixing innovation and style, creating sneaker heat from Running to Basketball to women's to young athletes. As Mark mentioned, we have shown creativity and versatility in dimensionalizing our footwear franchises across these categories. We've also shown visibility in the marketplace by connecting these products to consumers with a twofold approach. We create energy through targeted releases while also giving consumers easy access through broader launches across the marketplace.
Throughout this work, we're seeing strong sell-through for silhouettes that mix our past with a modern simplicity like the Presto Mid Utility, the Flyknit Racer and a new style, the LunarCharge, which we brought to market in roughly 1/4 of the time it usually takes, thanks to our accelerated footwear creation capacity. That's the power of our Express Lane process.
We also had the successful launch of our Beautiful Power collection for her, which featured great styles like the Cortez Classic and the Air Max Thea Ultra in all-black, premium leather. At the same time, we drove traffic into our dedicated women's spaces with 2 exclusive city styles for the Air Max 90. All this work and so much more goes to consistent efforts to serving women who covet sneaker style.
Now before I move on from Sportswear, I want to make one very important point. We continue to see extraordinary growth in our Sportswear apparel business across men's and women's up and down the price points and fueled by our Fleece collections. This marketplace energy comes from the power and creativity we're using to expand what sport means to the lifestyle of today's consumer.
Now let's take a look at a few of our key geographies. In Q2, North America revenue was up 3%. From the Cavs to the Cubs, sports in North America have never been more inspiring. And the energy is set to continue with the upcoming playoffs in college football and the NFL, filled entirely the teams wearing NIKE. As we continue to serve these athletes and celebrate these heroes and storylines, it's no surprise our brand is so strong.
From a marketplace perspective, we're seeing continued improvement, with inventory down 4%. We continue to keep supply tight, which you'll see reflected in futures. And as a result, we expect a stronger sell-through to the end consumer, which ultimately results in stronger revenue growth. Andy will talk more about this in our guidance, but this is another area where we identified a challenge, we attacked it and now we're starting to see the returns. 
Q2 growth in North America was led by DTC where we experienced a strong start to the holiday season over the Black Friday weekend. Compared to last year, we saw double-digit traffic increases and higher conversion and higher dollars per transaction across our stores and NIKE.com. And our new Soho store in New York is not only a source of growth in this important market, it's a powerful look at the future of sports retail, product trials with experts, elevated personalized experiences and heightened member engagement, all while seamlessly combining digital and physical. We create environments that bring our products and services together in a way that allows consumers to experience the NIKE Brand in its most sublime state. And we are executing this strategy through our DTC businesses as well as with our key strategic wholesale partners who share this vision. We still see tremendous potential in North America. And with the strategies in place, we will grow both NIKE and the overall marketplace.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we saw our 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, with strong growth across nearly all categories, led by Sportswear and Running. Mark mentioned our first European Jordan store in Paris. Just as in Soho, we see the Jordan Bastille store as the future of retail, featuring premium products and services like customization and interactive wear testing. And as always, our footprint in football continues to expand across Europe, with our recent re-signing of the French, English and Turkish federations as well as the recent Golden Ball winner, Cristiano Ronaldo. And with the start of our new relationship with Chelsea Football Club next season, our brand in Europe is only getting stronger.
Lastly, Greater China continued its strong results with its 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, highlighted by another quarter of triple-digit growth in NIKE.com. We had our biggest Singles Day ever, reaching nearly 3x last year's sales. Our success followed our decisions to feature exclusive product on NIKE.com and at NIKE-only stores and give early access to high-heat products for our Nike+ members. And we also saw tremendous results with Tmall. The Greater China marketplace continues to be fueled by higher sports participation, with 38,000 runners taking part in the Shanghai marathon, while nearly 4x that many consumers tried to sign up. Runners were introduced to NIKE's premium services by customizing their Nike Pro Bras and creating custom shoes at NIKE ID stations, just to name a few. 
In fact, I was in China a few weeks ago, and I met one athlete who achieved a personal dream to run the Shanghai marathon. What struck me wasn't just her desire to reach her potential, but the importance of NIKE's role in meeting her complete lifestyle needs: to look good, to feel confident and to connect with others throughout her journey. I left China reminded of the amazing potential for our brand as we move at her speed and we authentically serve athletes like her. All in all, we are still in early days of unlocking the growth in this important geography. 
In the end, we have the strategies in place that yield results. Consumers have so many choices, more than ever, which is why we are glad that we have the foundation in place to connect consumers with energy and excitement. We know what works, and we know how to create, amplify and sustain our opportunities. 
Make no mistake, in 2017, we will stay on offense. This mentality is one of our greatest competitive advantages. That relentless drive to serve our athlete and consumers is what keeps us in the lead. 
Thanks. Now here's Andy."
291981,411443623,1104238,"NIKE, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and happy holidays to everyone on the call. The enduring passion for sport around the world and consumers' desire to lead a more active lifestyle continue to fuel new opportunities for growth in our industry. And the growth potent",2126,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and happy holidays to everyone on the call. The enduring passion for sport around the world and consumers' desire to lead a more active lifestyle continue to fuel new opportunities for growth in our industry. And the growth potential in our industry has always attracted competition. That said, as Mark noted, Q2 was NIKE's 28th consecutive quarter of growth. Each and every quarter over the past 7 years, NIKE has grown despite healthy competition within our industry, extreme macroeconomic volatility, discontinuities in the retail landscape and rapidly evolving trends in consumer preferences. That track record does not happen by accident. 
As the leading brand in sport, we are on the offense always. We take nothing for granted. We continuously evaluate how we can better leverage our unrivaled portfolio of businesses and competitive advantages to grow the market and win. From a brand and business perspective, we are obsessed with staying one step ahead of consumer expectations. And maintaining that focus and pace is what ultimately separates NIKE from the competition over the long haul. 
From a financial perspective, we're obsessed with delivering: one, strong growth; two, expanding profitability; and three, high returns on invested capital. We continue to manage all of the operating levers in our business to deliver across all 3 dimensions of our financial model, and that has afforded NIKE unmatched scale and resources. Like the world's best marathoners, the results that we post always reflect moments where we have pushed the pace and moments where we took stock of the circumstances and made adjustments.
In the second quarter, we executed on the plan that we shared with you 90 days ago. We pushed the pace with innovation because, as Mark noted, there is no such thing as sustained growth without innovation. We also made important adjustments, for example, with respect to supply and demand management, to ensure the sustainability, profitability and capital efficiency of our growth long term.
From a product innovation perspective, we launched several innovative and beautifully designed footwear and apparel styles across both our performance categories and Sportswear. Perhaps, most notably, we launched of the HyperAdapt 1.0, which is an innovative product in its own right and also a glimpse into the future of personalized performance. As we look ahead to the second half of fiscal year '17, we will continue pushing the pace with products such as the Air VaporMax that merge innovation and style.
In Q2, we also innovated at retail. As we've said in the past, NIKE's growth trajectory is not highly correlated with macroeconomic trends nor is our growth solely a function of market share. Our primary focus has always been on growing the overall market, creating greater capacity for the NIKE Brand over the long term. Today, we see the potential to increasingly leverage digital, to more personally and fully serve consumers, unlocking new growth and productivity within and well beyond the 4 walls of a retail store. As Trevor mentioned in November, we opened NIKE Soho in New York, which sheds light on our vision for the future of retail.
Finally, we continue to innovate within our supply chain. Our investments in Manufacturing revolution, our partnerships with Flex and Apollo, and the speed and agility initiatives that Mark referenced all enable us to bring product creation closer to the consumer, while also enhancing labor productivity and reducing materials waste. As the world becomes increasingly dynamic, we could not be more pleased with the head start that we have in terms of supply chain innovation. 
While we pushed the pace with innovation in Q2, we also made important adjustments in areas where we knew we could do better. Trevor referred to the work we have done to reignite strong momentum in NIKE Basketball. We also took the actions required to return North America to a pull market. We have grown our business in North America for 7 consecutive years. No other brand has near our scale or our proven ability to expand the market in this important geography. That said, we are relentlessly self-critical at NIKE. Several factors led to elevated inventory in North America, including the West Coast port congestion, issues in our North America distribution center, third-party retail discontinuities and lower-than-expected sell-through on a few key items last year, most notably 2 signature styles in Basketball. 
The actions we have taken to rebalance our supply negatively impacted our gross margin over the past 2 quarters. But at NIKE, we manage for the long term. Based on the progress we have made, we now expect North America to continue growing in the second half of the fiscal year with a return to expanding growth margins and tighter inventory levels. 
With that context, let's turn to a more detailed review of our Q2 financial results and our outlook going forward. In Q2, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased over 6%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 8% led by double-digit growth in Western Europe, Greater China and the emerging markets. 
Second quarter diluted EPS of $0.50 increased 11% versus the prior year driven by revenue growth, SG&A leverage and a lower average share count. 
Gross margin contracted approximately 140 basis points in the quarter, roughly in line with our expectations. 
Full-price average selling prices continue to expand. However, margin contracted overall due to higher product cost, FX headwinds and a higher mix of off-price versus the prior year and the more discrete or temporary items that we referenced last quarter.
Demand creation decreased 1% for the quarter, according to plan, following significant Q1 investments in the Olympics and Euro Champs. 
Operating overhead decreased 3% as our continued strategic investments are being funded by productivity gains as we increasingly Edit to Amplify within our core operations.
The effective tax rate for Q2 was 24.4% compared to 19.1% for the same period last year, primarily due to an increased mix of U.S. earnings which are generally subject to a higher tax rate. 
As of November 30, inventories were up 9%. Wholesale units grew just 1%. The remainder of the expansion in inventory was driven by a higher average cost due primarily to product mix as well as growth in support of our fast-growing DTC businesses. 
Now let's turn to the performance of a few key operating segments. North America revenue grew 3% on both a reported and constant-currency basis to $3.7 billion, with balanced growth across footwear and apparel. Growth was led by DTC, which grew 17%, with 10% comp store growth. EBIT for North America increased 3% in the quarter as revenue growth, full-price gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage all contributed to increased profitability. These factors were partially offset by a higher mix of off-price versus the same period in the prior year. 
In the second half of fiscal year '17, you will see evidence of the progress that we have made returning North America to a pull market. North America revenue growth will continue to outpace futures, and that will be coupled with a return to gross margin expansion.
In Western Europe, revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis as we continued to see strong multidimensional growth across the business from footwear to apparel, performance categories to Sportswear, wholesale to DTC and across all territories. Standout categories for the quarter were Sportswear, Running and Jordan. On a reported basis, revenue increased 7% while EBIT declined 23%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.
Our Emerging Markets geography grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth across Sportswear, Running and Jordan and across the territories of Soco, Korea and Mexico. On a reported basis, revenue and EBIT continued to be heavily impacted by FX headwinds. As a result, reported revenue increased 6% while EBIT decreased 2%.
Finally, Greater China continues to deliver exceptional results. Currency-neutral revenue grew 17% in the quarter, reflecting strong growth across nearly all dimensions of our business. Most categories grew double digits, and our DTC businesses delivered another quarter of tremendous growth, up 42%. NIKE is the leading brand in China, with the deepest, most authentic connections to the Chinese consumer. 
We expect strong and steady growth going forward in China as we serve consumers through China's fast-growing digital ecosystem and our continued expansion of category-oriented NIKE-branded concepts at retail. 
On a reported basis, revenue grew 12% and EBIT expanded 15% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage.
Over the balance of the fiscal year, we will continue to manage for the long term with our focus on ensuring sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth. 
As for specific guidance, for the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth in the high single-digit range. That said, FX headwinds from further strengthening of the U.S. dollar have put downward pressure on our second half revenue forecast. While our hedges will delay and partially mitigate the impact of FX on our profitability, we do not hedge the revenue line item per se. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect revenue growth for the full year to be within the high single to low double-digit range. For Q3, we expect reported revenue to grow squarely in the mid-single-digit range.
As we shared on our last earnings conference call, we are changing the sequencing of our communications regarding NIKE Brand futures orders. Futures orders will now be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call in the same detail as previously reported in our earnings release. As you will see, currency-neutral futures orders are growing 2%, driven by a 1% increase in units, with increases in average selling prices contributing the other 1 percentage point of growth. Futures orders are flat versus prior year on a reported basis. As you know, futures orders growth and reported revenue growth have become increasingly less correlated. That lesser correlation is evidenced by the roughly 5 percentage-point disparity between our guidance for Q3 reported revenue growth and our futures growth on a reported basis. 
The longer-term, more systemic drivers of the disparity include: First, impacts related to our evolving DTC versus wholesale business mix. For example, DTC futures are reported on a wholesale-equivalent basis. However, reported revenue for DTC is recognized based upon the full retail price to consumers. Therefore, as the mix of futures shifts toward DTC, NIKE's overall reported revenue will inherently grow faster than futures.
Second, material dimensions of our revenue are not included within futures orders, such as Converse, NIKE Factory Stores and our shorter lead time or at-once businesses. There can also be temporary anomalies between futures orders and reported revenue growth. One of the most notable is consumer sell-through. Take, for example, North America, where, as you will see, futures orders are down 4%. But we expect continued revenue growth and expanding margins over the second half of this fiscal year. In the second half of fiscal year '16, we had elevated inventory levels for the reasons we have detailed. In the second half of fiscal year '17, we now have tighter supply against continuing strong demand, and that will have a favorable impact on revenue growth as a result of lower year-over-year cancellations, returns and discounts. Other temporary anomalies can include the timing of our buys related to launches, key sports moments and other events. 
In short, the key takeaway is that our revenue guidance reflects a much more comprehensive outlook for our business as compared to using reported futures orders growth as a proxy.
Turning to gross margin. For the second half of the fiscal year, we expect less contraction than we experienced in the first half as we see stronger, full-price sell-through to consumers. For Q3, we expect gross margin to contract by approximately 100 to 125 basis points, driven primarily by FX. The fundamental drivers of NIKE's long-term gross margin expansion remain intact, including higher average selling prices, product cost optimization through our Manufacturing Revolution efforts and the positive mix benefit associated with our fast-growing DTC businesses.
For total SG&A, we now expect full year growth in the low single to mid-single-digit range as we Edit to Amplify. We expect Q3 SG&A to grow in the mid-single to high single digits. We expect other income, net of interest expense, to be approximately $80 million for the full year and approximately 0 in Q3. We continue to expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 17% for the full year. For Q3, we expect the rate to be approximately 18% to 20%.
As evidenced by our Q2 results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to be on the offense, focused on driving sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth over the long term.
With that, we'll now open the call up for your questions."

One of the things that we get a chance to see is we get chance to see Basketball sort of in line, and what we are seeing is Basketball is back. The consumer response to the latest signature styles has been incredibly strong, and we're seeing some more energy moments to come. What we have -- what we've definitely seen in North America is we've seen healthy sell-throughs on the KYRIE 2s, the LeBron Soldiers, the KD9s, the KOBE A.D.s, the Jordan XXXIs, so we're seeing a really comprehensive shift towards energy coming towards Basketball both in the numbers but also when you're on the street, on the ground, you're seeing it both on the court and off the court. One of the other things I would like to do with Basketball is maybe broaden the context so that we're also thinking about our Sportswear business which is a part of Basketball. And in Sportswear, the Air Force 1 styles continue to actually perform very well. The Special Forces Air Force 1 was exceptionally strong, the Foamposite was also good, and Jordan both on its performance, the Jordan 31 and the retro style, did really well. So all of those really put us in a position where we feel that we are poised to get ready for the NBA partnership as we go into next year. So all the energy signs are there for us, and so we see the back half continuing to accelerate in our Basketball business."

So can you just help us reconcile where you are with the clean inventory position that you talked about, North America being down 4%, and how what's happening at retail this month, for instance, is altering your outlook at all, if any?"

Happy holidays, by the way. As you noted, our inventory in North America is down. And as we talked about on the call, we feel like we've made a tremendous amount of progress in tightening supply and demand and positioning ourself for more sustainable, profitable growth in the second half. Just to give you some dimension on that, we have had very strong sell-through in in-line. We had a great holiday season. We continue to see tremendous growth in NIKE.com, for example. And I'll remind you that we also have our Factory Store business, and that has been a great channel or outlet for us to take the actions that were required to rebalance supply and demand, and we have seen phenomenal traffic and conversion and comp store growth in that dimension of the business, so feel great from that perspective. And then I'll hand it over to Trevor but, as Trevor noted, we are seeing tremendous opportunities for growth in some of the biggest and most important categories in North America, that being Sportswear which continues to deliver strong growth both footwear and apparel. We feel like we've really reignited strong momentum in Basketball and, as Trevor said, that's with -- we're fast approaching the launch of the NBA partnership. So again, tighter inventories, continued growth and a return to gross margin expansion in North America is what we see."

I think as -- just to touch on what Andy just hit on, I would say that there is the idea of more promotional activity in the marketplace. Having said that, when we tighten supply and demand, we're seeing increasingly stronger full-price sales, so we feel good about that. In North America again, we are seeing our sell-throughs perform at a much better level. The other thing that you will see coming into the spring season, you're going to see a lot of excitement, some of the great products we have on tap. So we are very excited and bullish about -- as we launch the Air VaporMax, not only for the VaporMax itself but also because it will drive a greater Air business across our business. So we think as we bring more innovation in the marketplace, that allows us to obviously command stronger full price in our products. And with that, I mean, we -- like I said, we're definitely seeing all the signs that say that the actual decline in inventory is now proving the strongest sell-through -- we're seeing stronger sell-through as a result."

We've always had the ability to move quickly and respond. What we're doing now through Express Lane, particularly as we scale this capability across the org, is to make this a sustained season-in, season-out part of what we do and how we operate. The exciting thing about the Express Lane is it literally puts us in a position to, as I've mentioned, deliver product from start to finish, completely new product in weeks versus months. The LunarCharge is a great example in this last quarter of a product that literally went through that complete start from scratch to a completed product, went out to the market, and the sell-throughs on that have been incredibly positive. So we're now in the midst, as we move into the second half of the year and then beyond, frankly, this is sort of the new norm, is to make this a part of a sort of the muscle that we have to give us a more complete competitive advantage. We're focused right now in footwear but we see this scaling also across apparel as well. I'm personally, as a product nerd, incredibly excited not just by the ability to do this but to take it to a significantly higher scale."

And I'd love to give a context which is both when you go in the stores and you walk the streets, you can certainly see the energy and vibrancy for the brand, and you can see that also in the strong sell-through that we're seeing in the marketplace. Across Singles Day, Singles Day, we actually were 3x, it was 300% greater this year than last in terms of sales. And so we're seeing tremendous growth in the dot-com business. The categories that are performing well are Sportswear, Running, Jordan Brand and NIKE Basketball, all performing really well, which were the key ones we decided to focus in on in China. We also continue to have really a tremendous amount of doors in the marketplace, over 6,000 doors. So we're really ever-present in the market, which allows us to expand and tell the right stories and create the right impact. And one of the biggest sort of tailwinds that we always have is sports participation. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, certainly, the Shanghai marathon is one example of watching this market become increasingly sophisticated around participation, around their connection to sport and also their connection into sport culture, and so we're seeing it across multiple dimensions. So I continue to feel very bullish about China as we do as a total group. And again, it's 10 consecutive quarters of continuous growth."

We are a global company, obviously, operating in over 190 countries, serving billions of consumers with close to 70,000 employees. So the reality for us is that the closer we can be to the consumers that we serve in markets around the world, the more efficiently we can do so.

I will say that we're highly motivated, as I said, to engage and look for opportunities to bring our product capabilities closer to markets. We've talked about that publicly, and that continues to be the case. So we're looking for expanding on those opportunities as much as we possibly can and working with the administration in that respect. We're making, though, real headway on our ManRev initiative. Certainly with Flex; we talked about Apollo. We've got new methods of manufacturing that we're really focused on here through our Advanced Product Creation Center. Some of the most exciting innovation we have beyond product is in this space. And the good news is it not only enables us to get closer to the market with more customized, personalized product potentially, but it also helps to just create a better business overall, so the financial impact is definitely there.

As you review our 10-K -- 10-Q filing, you'll see some detail on that, the difference between our DTC business and our sales to third-party wholesalers. At the same time, I think it's really important to note that what's most important to us is growing the overall market, as we said. And that has less to do with owned versus partnered and more to do with the nature of the experiences that we're putting into the marketplace. Soho is a great example. It happens to be owned. But the focus is really much more personalized service to the consumer and creating what we're really calling the new square foot, leveraging digital to more fully serve consumer and expand the productivity. And we're going to increasingly do that with our wholesale partners as well. We have several very strategic wholesale partners here in North America, Western Europe and around the world. We have wholesale partners in China who operate NIKE-branded stores for us. And we think that's a big opportunity, both owned and partnered, going forward to expand the market."

Welcome to NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2017 second quarter conference call. For those who need to reference today's press release, you will find it at http://investors.nikeinc.com.
Leading today's call is Nitesh Sharan, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. 
Before I turn the call over to Mr. Sharan, please let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in reports filed with the SEC, including forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to the mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.
In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf, are not included in these futures numbers. Following the conference call, the futures order schedule will be posted to the financials schedules on the NIKE Investor Relations website.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales and constant dollar revenue. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprints of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Similarly, references to constant dollar revenue are intended to provide context as to the performance of the business eliminating foreign exchange fluctuations.

291981,411443623,1104712,"NIKE, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2016",2016-12-20,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nitesh, and happy holidays, everyone. Q2 was another quarter of positive momentum for NIKE, Inc. Let's start with the numbers.NIKE, Inc.'s second quarter revenues were up 6% growing to $8.2 billion and, on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. re",1563,"Thanks, Nitesh, and happy holidays, everyone. Q2 was another quarter of positive momentum for NIKE, Inc. Let's start with the numbers.
NIKE, Inc.'s second quarter revenues were up 6% growing to $8.2 billion and, on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8%. Gross margin declined approximately 140 basis points to 44.2%; earnings per share increased 11% to $0.50; and we delivered ROIC of 31.3%.
In the fast-moving world of sports and news culture, results like these come from our obsession with the consumer, of knowing what they need and what inspires them. That's what drives innovation at NIKE, and innovation is what drives growth. Our approach has fueled 28 consecutive quarters of growth at a scale that is unrivaled in our industry. We have a strong track record and, more importantly, we have an even better runway ahead.
With the energy we see in sports right now, along with today's more active lifestyle, it's no surprise that our industry continues to attract competition. As in sports, competition is a positive thing. It sharpens our focus. And we know there are areas in the short term where we haven't executed as precisely as we would have liked. As good as we are, we can be even better by hyper-focusing on our most compelling growth opportunities.
Starting with the consumer, who's not asking for more product but looking for more choice of the products they love. We're responding by giving the consumer more distinctive options with fewer products, what we call Edit to Amplify. Reducing styles and highlighting key items and concepts has a huge impact across our entire value chain. And this is especially important in North America and our key geographies as we better manage supply and demand to drive productivity and profitable top line growth while highlighting and scaling our most compelling product stories.
Or look at our success in China, where we amplify what's working and edit out what's not to accelerate growth. Beyond product, e-commerce is one example as we double down on the power of digital in this mobile-first market. 
We also know from our consumers that speed matters. That insight is driving several speed and agility initiatives throughout our company. For example, we're scaling a process we call the Express Lane, which allows us to go from creation to market in weeks instead of months. The Express Lane is becoming an important competitive advantage, and it led to a new product called the LunarCharge this quarter, which is seeing strong consumer demand.
We've always given consumers high-energy product in the right place at the right time. We're now leveraging and creating capabilities on a much larger scale. The investments we make in Manufacturing Revolution and throughout the supply chain are going a long way in helping us realize that. Editing to Amplify and driving speed and agility are keys to winning now. They also help set the foundation for growth in the future.
The other focus for us, of course, is innovation, my top priority for the company. Innovation is what offers differentiation for consumers and takes them somewhere new. It's how we lead the market. To be clear, without innovation, there is no such thing as sustained growth. We have some exciting new platforms on the way, starting with Air VaporMax, our highest performance and most visually striking Air Max cushioning system ever. We see a growing anticipation around Air VaporMax from runners to sneaker retailers. It's a great example of an innovation that stands at the intersection of high-tech, pure function and esthetic beauty. We expect big things from Air VaporMax in Running and we have an ambitious road map to bring it to life through other sports.
In apparel, we launched Therma-Sphere in Running, adding to our diverse lineup of apparel that offers warmth without weight in cold weather. The Sphere family including its lead style, Element Sphere, is performing very well in the marketplace. We also launched the Strike series featuring AeroSwift technology, establishing the new look of football training.
This quarter, we delivered on the promise of personalized performance with our first adaptive product, the HyperAdapt 1.0. And there's a reason we called it the 1.0. Generations 2 and 3 are in the works, expanding adaptive performance products across other sport categories. There was huge demand for the HyperAdapt 1.0, and we plan to drive that momentum into adaptive product at a much larger scale. 
And there's a lot more on deck with new cushioning experiences in Running and Basketball; digitally integrated product; advancements in customization and personalization; and breakthroughs in lightweight performance. Our pipeline is very strong. Covering the near-, medium- and long-term horizons, we've created both platforms and category-defining products designed in a distinctive style that spans all categories. We're driving a pace and a scale of innovation that will deliver growth for years to come.
Right now, the consumer continues to respond to new generations of our state-of-the-art platforms in Flyknit, Free and Lunarlon. This year we redesigned NIKE Free and brought a whole new sensation to Lunarlon with the LunarEpic. Both continue to be huge drivers of our business in both Training and Running for both men and women. Flyknit is also advancing well beyond our expectations. Its versatility is allowing us to create unexpected forms across multiple sports for all weather conditions and even blending it with other materials to advance both performance and style. And you're about to see even more firepower coming out of Basketball. You'll hear more from Trevor on this, but we're in a good position to build on recent successes in NIKE Basketball and Jordan for the back half of the fiscal year.
Another advantage we leverage is NIKE's deep reservoir of iconic styles and innovation. It's a source of inspiration to our design teams and a tremendous source of growth for our business. There's always been a huge consumer appetite for reinterpreted franchises and icons. Take the Air Force 1 as one example this past quarter. Of course, the original remains a staple. But this quarter, consumers responded to some of our long-awaited reissued Air Force 1s, versions like the New York City, the LA, the Chi-Town and the Linen. But we also give it new life through a weather-repelling sneaker boot, a featherweight Flyknit style and a NIKELab version with premium materials. One style that drove tremendous heat in the Air Force 1 family this quarter was the Special Field Air Force 1. Bringing a new look to an icon, this exciting new model has been selling through very quickly.
I think there's a misconception that growth in our Lifestyle business comes at the expense of growth in our performance business. The reality is they fuel each other. Performance and Lifestyle are not tradeoffs. Consumers want innovation that is style right, and they want style with real innovation. They want product that helps them do more and get better, that's comfortable and light and looks great on the court and on the street. Ultimately, they want choices that look and feel good across the spectrum of performance and lifestyle, including performance products that are high demand and fueling growth like the LeBron Soldier, the Jordan XXXI, the KOBE A.D., the Flyknit Racer, the LunarEpic Low and the upcoming Air VaporMax. NIKE's opportunity is to continue to deliver across that spectrum to accelerate our leading performance position and the world's largest sportswear business.
Part of our role as the industry leader is to continue to grow the whole market for sport, and that means knowing where the consumer is headed. We're leading through digital. We made a move long ago to integrate brand, service and commerce in a meaningful way for consumers. No one in our space is close to connecting all 3 and turning it into value for the business the way that we do. We brought this to life in a powerful way this quarter with NIKE Soho. The 5-story store is built around trial zones, personalized services and amazing product. It's bringing digital and physical retail together to deepen our relationships with our customers. 
It's clear that DTC continues to be one of the greatest returns on investment. In Q2, our DTC business grew 23%, with NIKE.com leading the way at 46%. There continues to be much more growth potential ahead for NIKE in DTC.
We're also accelerating partnerships with our multi-brand wholesalers who share our vision for serving our customers with elevated and differentiated consumer experiences. DICK's is a great example, with its full-service footwear departments. Other examples this quarter include: our women's lifestyle concept shop with Nordstrom; our first European Jordan store in Paris with Foot Locker; and our most digitally integrated multi-brand consumer experience with JD. More and more consumers want a seamless shopping experience across physical and digital, and we're delivering that completely through our DTC wholesale partners in wholesale.com.
I feel really good about where NIKE stands for the long term. We're earning our #1 position every single day. We're facing our challenges head-on, and we're obsessing the fundamentals while seizing opportunities to be disruptive in leading our industry. We are well positioned for the back half of the year and, more importantly, we're clear on the opportunities in front of us and confident in our plans to drive long-term growth and shareholder value for years to come.
Thanks. And now here's Trevor."

The NIKE Brand delivered another solid quarter of growth in Q2. As always, my remarks are on a constant-currency basis.The NIKE Brand revenue grew 8%, led by broad-based growth across our largest geographies an",1873,"Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another solid quarter of growth in Q2. As always, my remarks are on a constant-currency basis.
The NIKE Brand revenue grew 8%, led by broad-based growth across our largest geographies and categories. And NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 25%, driven by continued strong growth in digital commerce, 11% comp store growth and new store expansion.
In Q2, we attacked opportunities across our portfolio to strengthen and extend our leadership position. In particular, I'd like to mention 3 of note. First, we're seeing incredible momentum in Basketball. To be clear, Basketball is back. Second, we have made tremendous progress aligning supply and demand in North America, returning this important geography to a pull market. And third, we continue to see strong and steady momentum in Greater China as we continue to invest in that market to fuel growth.
Now let's take a look at some of our key categories, starting with Running. Running is our largest performance category and continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and growth, with Q2 revenue growing at a double-digit rate. It also continues to be one of our most influential and largest drivers of our Sportswear business. 
Now even if the weather turns, our runners never slow down. They inspire us to provide solutions to help them get out and run more. Mark mentioned the popular LunarEpic and, in Q2, we launched the LunarEpic Flyknit Shield, with its all-weather construction designed to keep the foot warm and dry. It's another example of how NIKE expands the market by adapting our popular platforms to new audiences and serve consumer needs. 
Other Running footwear successes included the Pegasus 33 and the Air Max 2017, which features a fly mesh upper and a full-length Max Air unit.
In apparel, products offering lightweight yet breathable warmth are also showing increased popularity with athletes from the most elite to the everyday, highlighted by the Aeroloft and the Sphere platforms. And I'd be remiss if I did not mention the excitement we're seeing around the Apple Watch Nike+, as it sells well ahead of our plans.
Lastly, Mark mentioned the Air VaporMax, which is not only an amazing star in its own right but an innovation that will fuel growth across the entire Nike Air family of products, and I'm really excited about this platform which will be in the market this spring.
Next, Basketball. As the leader in Basketball, we never settle. We know there's always work to be done. Last year, we knew we didn't perform to our potential in Basketball. Whilst we have a diverse portfolio across NIKE Basketball, Jordan and Sportswear, we recognized that 2 of our signature styles were not resonating with consumers to our expectations. 
We saw the opportunity, and we addressed it. First, we went back to the fundamentals and redesigned our products with stronger aesthetics and delivered better price value to our consumers. That work led to dynamic products like the KYRIE 2, the LeBron Soldier 10, the KD9, the Jordan XXXI, the KOBE A.D. and the Westbrook 0.2. All of these have been incredibly popular with consumers on and off the court. Second, we created demand and energy in the marketplace, with our Out of Nowhere campaign. And third, we delivered all this powerfully through retail, for example, with our House of Hoops partnership with Foot Locker. The end result, our Basketball business is much healthier today than it's ever been over the past 18 months, and the energy continues with the KYRIE 3 and the LeBron 14 generating off-the-charts anticipation. With the upcoming launch of our first new signature shoe in years, the Paul George 1, get ready for even more consumer and commercial energy in NIKE Basketball over the next few months.
With all this strong sell-through combined with what's coming, we expect a return to growth in NIKE Basketball over the back half of the fiscal year. At the same time, Jordan footwear continues to electrify the marketplace with products that generate excitement through vibrant storytelling. In Q2, this was highlighted by the global launch of the much anticipated Space Jam 11 collection in both performance and Lifestyle. And when combined with other releases this quarter like the Jordan 1s, the True Blue 3s and the XI in the original colorway, we surprised and delighted sneaker fans across the globe.
This is the power of what we do; the ability to drive energy through a combination of history, culture and performance. When we combine many of our hottest styles together, as we have showed with our 12 Soles collection that launched in our Soho store, it brings together performance and sportswear with a power no other brand can match. And our strong momentum in the next truly global sport is coming at the right time as we approach the launch of our partnership with the NBA.
In Q2, our Sportswear category grew high-teens, its 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Today, we are driving our amplified sport strategy as we go deeper with our best products, mixing innovation and style, creating sneaker heat from Running to Basketball to women's to young athletes. As Mark mentioned, we have shown creativity and versatility in dimensionalizing our footwear franchises across these categories. We've also shown visibility in the marketplace by connecting these products to consumers with a twofold approach. We create energy through targeted releases while also giving consumers easy access through broader launches across the marketplace.
Throughout this work, we're seeing strong sell-through for silhouettes that mix our past with a modern simplicity like the Presto Mid Utility, the Flyknit Racer and a new style, the LunarCharge, which we brought to market in roughly 1/4 of the time it usually takes, thanks to our accelerated footwear creation capacity. That's the power of our Express Lane process.
We also had the successful launch of our Beautiful Power collection for her, which featured great styles like the Cortez Classic and the Air Max Thea Ultra in all-black, premium leather. At the same time, we drove traffic into our dedicated women's spaces with 2 exclusive city styles for the Air Max 90. All this work and so much more goes to consistent efforts to serving women who covet sneaker style.
Now before I move on from Sportswear, I want to make one very important point. We continue to see extraordinary growth in our Sportswear apparel business across men's and women's up and down the price points and fueled by our Fleece collections. This marketplace energy comes from the power and creativity we're using to expand what sport means to the lifestyle of today's consumer.
Now let's take a look at a few of our key geographies. In Q2, North America revenue was up 3%. From the Cavs to the Cubs, sports in North America have never been more inspiring. And the energy is set to continue with the upcoming playoffs in college football and the NFL, filled entirely the teams wearing NIKE. As we continue to serve these athletes and celebrate these heroes and storylines, it's no surprise our brand is so strong.
From a marketplace perspective, we're seeing continued improvement, with inventory down 4%. We continue to keep supply tight, which you'll see reflected in futures. And as a result, we expect a stronger sell-through to the end consumer, which ultimately results in stronger revenue growth. Andy will talk more about this in our guidance, but this is another area where we identified a challenge, we attacked it and now we're starting to see the returns. 
Q2 growth in North America was led by DTC where we experienced a strong start to the holiday season over the Black Friday weekend. Compared to last year, we saw double-digit traffic increases and higher conversion and higher dollars per transaction across our stores and NIKE.com. And our new Soho store in New York is not only a source of growth in this important market, it's a powerful look at the future of sports retail, product trials with experts, elevated personalized experiences and heightened member engagement, all while seamlessly combining digital and physical. We create environments that bring our products and services together in a way that allows consumers to experience the NIKE Brand in its most sublime state. And we are executing this strategy through our DTC businesses as well as with our key strategic wholesale partners who share this vision. We still see tremendous potential in North America. And with the strategies in place, we will grow both NIKE and the overall marketplace.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we saw our 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, with strong growth across nearly all categories, led by Sportswear and Running. Mark mentioned our first European Jordan store in Paris. Just as in Soho, we see the Jordan Bastille store as the future of retail, featuring premium products and services like customization and interactive wear testing. And as always, our footprint in football continues to expand across Europe, with our recent re-signing of the French, English and Turkish federations as well as the recent Golden Ball winner, Cristiano Ronaldo. And with the start of our new relationship with Chelsea Football Club next season, our brand in Europe is only getting stronger.
Lastly, Greater China continued its strong results with its 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, highlighted by another quarter of triple-digit growth in NIKE.com. We had our biggest Singles Day ever, reaching nearly 3x last year's sales. Our success followed our decisions to feature exclusive product on NIKE.com and at NIKE-only stores and give early access to high-heat products for our Nike+ members. And we also saw tremendous results with Tmall. The Greater China marketplace continues to be fueled by higher sports participation, with 38,000 runners taking part in the Shanghai marathon, while nearly 4x that many consumers tried to sign up. Runners were introduced to NIKE's premium services by customizing their Nike Pro Bras and creating custom shoes at NIKE ID stations, just to name a few. 
In fact, I was in China a few weeks ago, and I met one athlete who achieved a personal dream to run the Shanghai marathon. What struck me wasn't just her desire to reach her potential, but the importance of NIKE's role in meeting her complete lifestyle needs: to look good, to feel confident and to connect with others throughout her journey. I left China reminded of the amazing potential for our brand as we move at her speed and we authentically serve athletes like her. All in all, we are still in early days of unlocking the growth in this important geography. 
In the end, we have the strategies in place that yield results. Consumers have so many choices, more than ever, which is why we are glad that we have the foundation in place to connect consumers with energy and excitement. We know what works, and we know how to create, amplify and sustain our opportunities. 
Make no mistake, in 2017, we will stay on offense. This mentality is one of our greatest competitive advantages. That relentless drive to serve our athlete and consumers is what keeps us in the lead. 
Thanks. Now here's Andy."

The enduring passion for sport around the world and consumers' desire to lead a more active lifestyle continue to fuel new opportunities for growth in our industry. And the growth potent",2126,"Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and happy holidays to everyone on the call. The enduring passion for sport around the world and consumers' desire to lead a more active lifestyle continue to fuel new opportunities for growth in our industry. And the growth potential in our industry has always attracted competition. That said, as Mark noted, Q2 was NIKE's 28th consecutive quarter of growth. Each and every quarter over the past 7 years, NIKE has grown despite healthy competition within our industry, extreme macroeconomic volatility, discontinuities in the retail landscape and rapidly evolving trends in consumer preferences. That track record does not happen by accident. 
As the leading brand in sport, we are on the offense always. We take nothing for granted. We continuously evaluate how we can better leverage our unrivaled portfolio of businesses and competitive advantages to grow the market and win. From a brand and business perspective, we are obsessed with staying one step ahead of consumer expectations. And maintaining that focus and pace is what ultimately separates NIKE from the competition over the long haul. 
From a financial perspective, we're obsessed with delivering: one, strong growth; two, expanding profitability; and three, high returns on invested capital. We continue to manage all of the operating levers in our business to deliver across all 3 dimensions of our financial model, and that has afforded NIKE unmatched scale and resources. Like the world's best marathoners, the results that we post always reflect moments where we have pushed the pace and moments where we took stock of the circumstances and made adjustments.
In the second quarter, we executed on the plan that we shared with you 90 days ago. We pushed the pace with innovation because, as Mark noted, there is no such thing as sustained growth without innovation. We also made important adjustments, for example, with respect to supply and demand management, to ensure the sustainability, profitability and capital efficiency of our growth long term.
From a product innovation perspective, we launched several innovative and beautifully designed footwear and apparel styles across both our performance categories and Sportswear. Perhaps, most notably, we launched of the HyperAdapt 1.0, which is an innovative product in its own right and also a glimpse into the future of personalized performance. As we look ahead to the second half of fiscal year '17, we will continue pushing the pace with products such as the Air VaporMax that merge innovation and style.
In Q2, we also innovated at retail. As we've said in the past, NIKE's growth trajectory is not highly correlated with macroeconomic trends nor is our growth solely a function of market share. Our primary focus has always been on growing the overall market, creating greater capacity for the NIKE Brand over the long term. Today, we see the potential to increasingly leverage digital, to more personally and fully serve consumers, unlocking new growth and productivity within and well beyond the 4 walls of a retail store. As Trevor mentioned in November, we opened NIKE Soho in New York, which sheds light on our vision for the future of retail.
Finally, we continue to innovate within our supply chain. Our investments in Manufacturing revolution, our partnerships with Flex and Apollo, and the speed and agility initiatives that Mark referenced all enable us to bring product creation closer to the consumer, while also enhancing labor productivity and reducing materials waste. As the world becomes increasingly dynamic, we could not be more pleased with the head start that we have in terms of supply chain innovation. 
While we pushed the pace with innovation in Q2, we also made important adjustments in areas where we knew we could do better. Trevor referred to the work we have done to reignite strong momentum in NIKE Basketball. We also took the actions required to return North America to a pull market. We have grown our business in North America for 7 consecutive years. No other brand has near our scale or our proven ability to expand the market in this important geography. That said, we are relentlessly self-critical at NIKE. Several factors led to elevated inventory in North America, including the West Coast port congestion, issues in our North America distribution center, third-party retail discontinuities and lower-than-expected sell-through on a few key items last year, most notably 2 signature styles in Basketball. 
The actions we have taken to rebalance our supply negatively impacted our gross margin over the past 2 quarters. But at NIKE, we manage for the long term. Based on the progress we have made, we now expect North America to continue growing in the second half of the fiscal year with a return to expanding growth margins and tighter inventory levels. 
With that context, let's turn to a more detailed review of our Q2 financial results and our outlook going forward. In Q2, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased over 6%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 8% led by double-digit growth in Western Europe, Greater China and the emerging markets. 
Second quarter diluted EPS of $0.50 increased 11% versus the prior year driven by revenue growth, SG&A leverage and a lower average share count. 
Gross margin contracted approximately 140 basis points in the quarter, roughly in line with our expectations. 
Full-price average selling prices continue to expand. However, margin contracted overall due to higher product cost, FX headwinds and a higher mix of off-price versus the prior year and the more discrete or temporary items that we referenced last quarter.
Demand creation decreased 1% for the quarter, according to plan, following significant Q1 investments in the Olympics and Euro Champs. 
Operating overhead decreased 3% as our continued strategic investments are being funded by productivity gains as we increasingly Edit to Amplify within our core operations.
The effective tax rate for Q2 was 24.4% compared to 19.1% for the same period last year, primarily due to an increased mix of U.S. earnings which are generally subject to a higher tax rate. 
As of November 30, inventories were up 9%. Wholesale units grew just 1%. The remainder of the expansion in inventory was driven by a higher average cost due primarily to product mix as well as growth in support of our fast-growing DTC businesses. 
Now let's turn to the performance of a few key operating segments. North America revenue grew 3% on both a reported and constant-currency basis to $3.7 billion, with balanced growth across footwear and apparel. Growth was led by DTC, which grew 17%, with 10% comp store growth. EBIT for North America increased 3% in the quarter as revenue growth, full-price gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage all contributed to increased profitability. These factors were partially offset by a higher mix of off-price versus the same period in the prior year. 
In the second half of fiscal year '17, you will see evidence of the progress that we have made returning North America to a pull market. North America revenue growth will continue to outpace futures, and that will be coupled with a return to gross margin expansion.
In Western Europe, revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis as we continued to see strong multidimensional growth across the business from footwear to apparel, performance categories to Sportswear, wholesale to DTC and across all territories. Standout categories for the quarter were Sportswear, Running and Jordan. On a reported basis, revenue increased 7% while EBIT declined 23%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.
Our Emerging Markets geography grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth across Sportswear, Running and Jordan and across the territories of Soco, Korea and Mexico. On a reported basis, revenue and EBIT continued to be heavily impacted by FX headwinds. As a result, reported revenue increased 6% while EBIT decreased 2%.
Finally, Greater China continues to deliver exceptional results. Currency-neutral revenue grew 17% in the quarter, reflecting strong growth across nearly all dimensions of our business. Most categories grew double digits, and our DTC businesses delivered another quarter of tremendous growth, up 42%. NIKE is the leading brand in China, with the deepest, most authentic connections to the Chinese consumer. 
We expect strong and steady growth going forward in China as we serve consumers through China's fast-growing digital ecosystem and our continued expansion of category-oriented NIKE-branded concepts at retail. 
On a reported basis, revenue grew 12% and EBIT expanded 15% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage.
Over the balance of the fiscal year, we will continue to manage for the long term with our focus on ensuring sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth. 
As for specific guidance, for the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth in the high single-digit range. That said, FX headwinds from further strengthening of the U.S. dollar have put downward pressure on our second half revenue forecast. While our hedges will delay and partially mitigate the impact of FX on our profitability, we do not hedge the revenue line item per se. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect revenue growth for the full year to be within the high single to low double-digit range. For Q3, we expect reported revenue to grow squarely in the mid-single-digit range.
As we shared on our last earnings conference call, we are changing the sequencing of our communications regarding NIKE Brand futures orders. Futures orders will now be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call in the same detail as previously reported in our earnings release. As you will see, currency-neutral futures orders are growing 2%, driven by a 1% increase in units, with increases in average selling prices contributing the other 1 percentage point of growth. Futures orders are flat versus prior year on a reported basis. As you know, futures orders growth and reported revenue growth have become increasingly less correlated. That lesser correlation is evidenced by the roughly 5 percentage-point disparity between our guidance for Q3 reported revenue growth and our futures growth on a reported basis. 
The longer-term, more systemic drivers of the disparity include: First, impacts related to our evolving DTC versus wholesale business mix. For example, DTC futures are reported on a wholesale-equivalent basis. However, reported revenue for DTC is recognized based upon the full retail price to consumers. Therefore, as the mix of futures shifts toward DTC, NIKE's overall reported revenue will inherently grow faster than futures.
Second, material dimensions of our revenue are not included within futures orders, such as Converse, NIKE Factory Stores and our shorter lead time or at-once businesses. There can also be temporary anomalies between futures orders and reported revenue growth. One of the most notable is consumer sell-through. Take, for example, North America, where, as you will see, futures orders are down 4%. But we expect continued revenue growth and expanding margins over the second half of this fiscal year. In the second half of fiscal year '16, we had elevated inventory levels for the reasons we have detailed. In the second half of fiscal year '17, we now have tighter supply against continuing strong demand, and that will have a favorable impact on revenue growth as a result of lower year-over-year cancellations, returns and discounts. Other temporary anomalies can include the timing of our buys related to launches, key sports moments and other events. 
In short, the key takeaway is that our revenue guidance reflects a much more comprehensive outlook for our business as compared to using reported futures orders growth as a proxy.
Turning to gross margin. For the second half of the fiscal year, we expect less contraction than we experienced in the first half as we see stronger, full-price sell-through to consumers. For Q3, we expect gross margin to contract by approximately 100 to 125 basis points, driven primarily by FX. The fundamental drivers of NIKE's long-term gross margin expansion remain intact, including higher average selling prices, product cost optimization through our Manufacturing Revolution efforts and the positive mix benefit associated with our fast-growing DTC businesses.
For total SG&A, we now expect full year growth in the low single to mid-single-digit range as we Edit to Amplify. We expect Q3 SG&A to grow in the mid-single to high single digits. We expect other income, net of interest expense, to be approximately $80 million for the full year and approximately 0 in Q3. We continue to expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 17% for the full year. For Q3, we expect the rate to be approximately 18% to 20%.
As evidenced by our Q2 results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to be on the offense, focused on driving sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth over the long term.
With that, we'll now open the call up for your questions."

One of the things that we get a chance to see is we get chance to see Basketball sort of in line, and what we are seeing is Basketball is back. The consumer response to the latest signature styles has been incredibly strong, and we're seeing some more energy moments to come. What we have -- what we've definitely seen in North America is we've seen healthy sell-throughs on the KYRIE 2s, the LeBron Soldiers, the KD9s, the KOBE A.D.s, the Jordan XXXIs, so we're seeing a really comprehensive shift towards energy coming towards Basketball both in the numbers but also when you're on the street, on the ground, you're seeing it both on the court and off the court. One of the other things I would like to do with Basketball is maybe broaden the context so that we're also thinking about our Sportswear business which is a part of Basketball. And in Sportswear, the Air Force 1 styles continue to actually perform very well. The Special Forces Air Force 1 was exceptionally strong, the Foamposite was also good, and Jordan both on its performance, the Jordan 31 and the retro style, did really well. So all of those really put us in a position where we feel that we are poised to get ready for the NBA partnership as we go into next year. So all the energy signs are there for us, and so we see the back half continuing to accelerate in our Basketball business."

And as we talked about on the call, we feel like we've made a tremendous amount of progress in tightening supply and demand and positioning ourself for more sustainable, profitable growth in the second half. Just to give you some dimension on that, we have had very strong sell-through in in-line. We had a great holiday season. We continue to see tremendous growth in NIKE.com, for example. And I'll remind you that we also have our Factory Store business, and that has been a great channel or outlet for us to take the actions that were required to rebalance supply and demand, and we have seen phenomenal traffic and conversion and comp store growth in that dimension of the business, so feel great from that perspective. And then I'll hand it over to Trevor but, as Trevor noted, we are seeing tremendous opportunities for growth in some of the biggest and most important categories in North America, that being Sportswear which continues to deliver strong growth both footwear and apparel. We feel like we've really reignited strong momentum in Basketball and, as Trevor said, that's with -- we're fast approaching the launch of the NBA partnership. So again, tighter inventories, continued growth and a return to gross margin expansion in North America is what we see."

The other thing that you will see coming into the spring season, you're going to see a lot of excitement, some of the great products we have on tap. So we are very excited and bullish about -- as we launch the Air VaporMax, not only for the VaporMax itself but also because it will drive a greater Air business across our business. So we think as we bring more innovation in the marketplace, that allows us to obviously command stronger full price in our products. And with that, I mean, we -- like I said, we're definitely seeing all the signs that say that the actual decline in inventory is now proving the strongest sell-through -- we're seeing stronger sell-through as a result."

We've always had the ability to move quickly and respond. What we're doing now through Express Lane, particularly as we scale this capability across the org, is to make this a sustained season-in, season-out part of what we do and how we operate. The exciting thing about the Express Lane is it literally puts us in a position to, as I've mentioned, deliver product from start to finish, completely new product in weeks versus months. The LunarCharge is a great example in this last quarter of a product that literally went through that complete start from scratch to a completed product, went out to the market, and the sell-throughs on that have been incredibly positive. So we're now in the midst, as we move into the second half of the year and then beyond, frankly, this is sort of the new norm, is to make this a part of a sort of the muscle that we have to give us a more complete competitive advantage. We're focused right now in footwear but we see this scaling also across apparel as well. I'm personally, as a product nerd, incredibly excited not just by the ability to do this but to take it to a significantly higher scale."

And I'd love to give a context which is both when you go in the stores and you walk the streets, you can certainly see the energy and vibrancy for the brand, and you can see that also in the strong sell-through that we're seeing in the marketplace. Across Singles Day, Singles Day, we actually were 3x, it was 300% greater this year than last in terms of sales. And so we're seeing tremendous growth in the dot-com business. The categories that are performing well are Sportswear, Running, Jordan Brand and NIKE Basketball, all performing really well, which were the key ones we decided to focus in on in China. We also continue to have really a tremendous amount of doors in the marketplace, over 6,000 doors. So we're really ever-present in the market, which allows us to expand and tell the right stories and create the right impact. And one of the biggest sort of tailwinds that we always have is sports participation. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, certainly, the Shanghai marathon is one example of watching this market become increasingly sophisticated around participation, around their connection to sport and also their connection into sport culture, and so we're seeing it across multiple dimensions. So I continue to feel very bullish about China as we do as a total group. And again, it's 10 consecutive quarters of continuous growth."

We've talked about that publicly, and that continues to be the case. So we're looking for expanding on those opportunities as much as we possibly can and working with the administration in that respect. We're making, though, real headway on our ManRev initiative. Certainly with Flex; we talked about Apollo. We've got new methods of manufacturing that we're really focused on here through our Advanced Product Creation Center. Some of the most exciting innovation we have beyond product is in this space. And the good news is it not only enables us to get closer to the market with more customized, personalized product potentially, but it also helps to just create a better business overall, so the financial impact is definitely there.

At the same time, I think it's really important to note that what's most important to us is growing the overall market, as we said. And that has less to do with owned versus partnered and more to do with the nature of the experiences that we're putting into the marketplace. Soho is a great example. It happens to be owned. But the focus is really much more personalized service to the consumer and creating what we're really calling the new square foot, leveraging digital to more fully serve consumer and expand the productivity. And we're going to increasingly do that with our wholesale partners as well. We have several very strategic wholesale partners here in North America, Western Europe and around the world.
