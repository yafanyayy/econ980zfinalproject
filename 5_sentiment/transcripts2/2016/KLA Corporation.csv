Today, I'm very pleased to announce that we got off to a very solid start in FY '17 as KLA-Tencor finished above the midpoint of guidance for shipments and revenue for the first quarter and exceeded the range for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. September quarter orders came in slightly better than our internal forecast, highlighted by strong foundry demand. These results were fueled by strong customer acceptance of new products and a business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage, providing the resources to rank KLA-Tencor among the top tier of all technology companies in terms of returning cash to shareholders.
Our recently announced 4% increase in the quarterly dividend level from $0.52 to $0.54 per share is further evidence of our confidence in the strength of our business and our ongoing commitment to enhance stockholder value. Our performance in Q1 also affirmed KLA-Tencor's ongoing focus on providing value to our customers in terms of meeting market requirements and delivering superior competitive offerings. 
As in the past, a key contributor to the strong demand we're experiencing today is the success of new products across our product portfolio. Our market leadership is sustained by ongoing successful execution of a product strategy that's focused on intersecting market needs with a portfolio of complementary solutions to address the broad range of yield challenges our customers are facing at the leading edge, and the pace of new product introduction continued at a rapid clip. 
Over the past 12 months, we have launched 2 new products in broadband plasma wafer inspection as well as new products in laser scanning wafer inspection, e-beam review, unpatterned wafer inspection and mask inspection. In our flagship broadband plasma optical inspection portfolio, the new Gen 5 platform is currently addressing early yield learning challenges and engineering analysis applications critical to both EUV and advanced optical lithography design rule development. We have also recently introduced upgraded capability for our Gen 4 product line to meet the high-volume inline monitoring needs of customers who are ramping 10-nanometer capacity. The expanded Gen 4 platform is currently experiencing very strong customer acceptance in the marketplace and is exceeding our own expectations both in terms of market reception and operational execution.
We're also very encouraged by the strength we're seeing today in mask inspection. Our leading-edge mask inspection portfolio is not only being incorporated into our customer's optical mask inspection techniques but is also the preferred technology to support early adoption of EUV as customers work to qualify masks for this very important technology inflection. 
So to summarize, our Q1 results demonstrate our strategies are working and the company is operating from a position of strength. As we look ahead to the December quarter and beyond, the stage is set to build on the success and deliver what we expect to be an exciting year for the company in 2017. Given our leading market position, our focus on customer collaborations and with our continued operating discipline, we believe KLA-Tencor is well positioned to successfully execute our strategies and achieve growth in calendar 2017 consistent with our long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7%. This is against a backdrop of WFE growth forecast to be in the low to mid-single digits for the year.
Now turning to the guidance for the December quarter. Q2 shipments are expected to be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. Revenue for the quarter are [ph] expected to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the midpoint of our guidance to a range of $805 million to $865 million, with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.28 per share to $1.48 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?"
282225,404012966,1058187,"KLA-Tencor Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. The September quarter represented another solid period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor.

The September quarter represented another solid period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Revenue was near the top end of the range, and earnings per share finished the quarter above the range, driven by strength in gross margins that continue to reflect strong differentiation of our products in the marketplace. 
Revenue for Q1 was $751 million, and fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.16. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.13 in the quarter. In our press release, you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.03 difference.
With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. In regards to highlights of the Q1 demand environment, we are no longer reporting quarterly and booking results or quantifying order guidance in terms of dollar amounts, but we will continue to share our perspective on the current quarterly demand picture to give investors insight into our industry trends and market mix estimates for the December quarter based on current forecasts. 
Foundry was 69% of new semiconductor system orders in September. Foundry bookings featured strong demand across our product portfolio to support leading-edge development projects. Although foundry is expected to decline to 30% of total system orders in Q2 due to project timing, we are currently expecting foundry orders to grow in the first half of calendar '17 compared with the second half of this calendar year.
Memory was 15% of new system orders in Q1, with demand evenly split between DRAM and NAND. Memory orders are expected to jump to 60% of the total in December, largely due to concentration of orders to support a single new memory project buildout in Korea. 
Logic was 16% of new system orders in the September quarter and is expected to be approximately 10% of the Q2 order mix.
In terms of distribution of orders by product group for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2017, wafer inspection was approximately 37% of new system orders. Patterning was approximately 33% of orders. The patterning order profile includes mask inspection system bookings. Service was 28%, and non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q1 were $786 million and in the upper half of the guided range of $735 million to $815 million. Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments to grow sequentially 7% at the midpoint and be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. 
Turning now to the income statement. Revenue was $751 million, finishing at the top end of the range of guidance for the quarter. We expect revenue to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the midpoint to a range of $805 million to $865 million in the December quarter. And our current forecast shows revenue levels in the first half of calendar '17 growing in the mid- to high single digits compared with the second half of calendar '16, consistent with our long-term annual growth target of 5% to 7% and driven by our strong backlog and expected order profile for the next few quarters.
Gross margin was 63.1% in Q1 and nearly flat compared with the record gross margin result we posted in the June quarter in spite of the sequential quarterly decline in revenue. The strong gross margin performance in Q1 reflects the benefit of a more favorable product mix than was originally modeled for the quarter. Lower parts expenses in our service business and lower inventory reserve expenses associated with new product transitions. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 63% in the December quarter, down slightly versus the September quarter principally due to a less favorable product mix in [ph] the revenue plan, offset by an increase in revenue.
Total operating expenses were $220 million, down $6 million compared with the June quarter; and operating margin was 33.8% in the quarter. We expect quarterly operating expense levels to remain at the $220 million level, plus or minus a few million, for the next several quarters and to continue to deliver strong operating leverage in what we expect to be a growth year for the company in 2017. 
Our effective tax rate was 20% in the quarter, just below our long-term planning rate of 21%. The lower tax rate in the quarter largely reflects the benefit of early adoption of a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. You should continue to use 21% for modeling purposes.
Finally, net income for the September quarter was $182 million, and we ended the quarter with 157 million fully diluted shares outstanding. 
I'll turn now to the highlights from the balance sheet and our cash flow statement.
Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.5 billion, roughly flat with the June quarter. Cash from operations was $170 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $160 million. In September, we paid an aggregate of $89 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and made a supplemental payment of $40 million towards our outstanding term loan. To date, the total amount of payments of principal on our term loan has amounted to approximately $214 million since it was added in the December quarter of 2014.
In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in September signals a strong start for the company in FY '17 and, coupled with the expectations for the December quarter, position the company for strong relative growth versus the wafer fab equipment market in calendar '16. This performance demonstrates the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of a portfolio solution addressing the most critical yield requirements at the leading edge and our operational core competencies. Given our strong backlog and with the expected growth trajectory in new orders, including the book-to-bill forecast of greater than 1 in the December quarter and the first half of 2017 order profile that is stronger than the second half of 2016, KLA-Tencor is in a position for a year of solid growth in 2017.
With that, to reiterate our guidance for the December quarter is: shipments in the range of $800 million to $880 million, revenue between $805 million and $865 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.28 to $1.48, with GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.46 per share. 
This concludes our remarks in the quarter. I'll now turn the call back to Ed to begin the Q&A."

But metrology is also growing, and a lot of that has to do with some of the challenges in terms of things like registration and so the overlay business and some of the films businesses.

Gen 5 really doesn't go into production though and replace GEN 4 and tell future nodes when the critical defect size gets smaller and you can really think about that more in terms of the adoption of EUV lithography.

Today, I'm very pleased to announce that we got off to a very solid start in FY '17 as KLA-Tencor finished above the midpoint of guidance for shipments and revenue for the first quarter and exceeded the range for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. September quarter orders came in slightly better than our internal forecast, highlighted by strong foundry demand. These results were fueled by strong customer acceptance of new products and a business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage, providing the resources to rank KLA-Tencor among the top tier of all technology companies in terms of returning cash to shareholders.
Our recently announced 4% increase in the quarterly dividend level from $0.52 to $0.54 per share is further evidence of our confidence in the strength of our business and our ongoing commitment to enhance stockholder value. Our performance in Q1 also affirmed KLA-Tencor's ongoing focus on providing value to our customers in terms of meeting market requirements and delivering superior competitive offerings. 
As in the past, a key contributor to the strong demand we're experiencing today is the success of new products across our product portfolio. Our market leadership is sustained by ongoing successful execution of a product strategy that's focused on intersecting market needs with a portfolio of complementary solutions to address the broad range of yield challenges our customers are facing at the leading edge, and the pace of new product introduction continued at a rapid clip. 
Over the past 12 months, we have launched 2 new products in broadband plasma wafer inspection as well as new products in laser scanning wafer inspection, e-beam review, unpatterned wafer inspection and mask inspection. In our flagship broadband plasma optical inspection portfolio, the new Gen 5 platform is currently addressing early yield learning challenges and engineering analysis applications critical to both EUV and advanced optical lithography design rule development. We have also recently introduced upgraded capability for our Gen 4 product line to meet the high-volume inline monitoring needs of customers who are ramping 10-nanometer capacity. The expanded Gen 4 platform is currently experiencing very strong customer acceptance in the marketplace and is exceeding our own expectations both in terms of market reception and operational execution.
We're also very encouraged by the strength we're seeing today in mask inspection. Our leading-edge mask inspection portfolio is not only being incorporated into our customer's optical mask inspection techniques but is also the preferred technology to support early adoption of EUV as customers work to qualify masks for this very important technology inflection. 
So to summarize, our Q1 results demonstrate our strategies are working and the company is operating from a position of strength. As we look ahead to the December quarter and beyond, the stage is set to build on the success and deliver what we expect to be an exciting year for the company in 2017. Given our leading market position, our focus on customer collaborations and with our continued operating discipline, we believe KLA-Tencor is well positioned to successfully execute our strategies and achieve growth in calendar 2017 consistent with our long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7%. This is against a backdrop of WFE growth forecast to be in the low to mid-single digits for the year.
Now turning to the guidance for the December quarter. Q2 shipments are expected to be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. Revenue for the quarter are expected to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the midpoint of our guidance to a range of $805 million to $865 million, with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.28 per share to $1.48 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?"

The September quarter represented another solid period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Revenue was near the top end of the range, and earnings per share finished the quarter above the range, driven by strength in gross margins that continue to reflect strong differentiation of our products in the marketplace. 
Revenue for Q1 was $751 million, and fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.16. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.13 in the quarter. In our press release, you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.03 difference.
With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. In regards to highlights of the Q1 demand environment, we are no longer reporting quarterly and booking results or quantifying order guidance in terms of dollar amounts, but we will continue to share our perspective on the current quarterly demand picture to give investors insight into our industry trends and market mix estimates for the December quarter based on current forecasts. 
Foundry was 69% of new semiconductor system orders in September. Foundry bookings featured strong demand across our product portfolio to support leading-edge development projects. Although foundry is expected to decline to 30% of total system orders in Q2 due to project timing, we are currently expecting foundry orders to grow in the first half of calendar '17 compared with the second half of this calendar year.
Memory was 15% of new system orders in Q1, with demand evenly split between DRAM and NAND. Memory orders are expected to jump to 60% of the total in December, largely due to concentration of orders to support a single new memory project buildout in Korea. 
Logic was 16% of new system orders in the September quarter and is expected to be approximately 10% of the Q2 order mix.
In terms of distribution of orders by product group for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2017, wafer inspection was approximately 37% of new system orders. Patterning was approximately 33% of orders. The patterning order profile includes mask inspection system bookings. Service was 28%, and non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q1 were $786 million and in the upper half of the guided range of $735 million to $815 million. Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments to grow sequentially 7% at the midpoint and be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. 
Turning now to the income statement. Revenue was $751 million, finishing at the top end of the range of guidance for the quarter. We expect revenue to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the midpoint to a range of $805 million to $865 million in the December quarter. And our current forecast shows revenue levels in the first half of calendar '17 growing in the mid- to high single digits compared with the second half of calendar '16, consistent with our long-term annual growth target of 5% to 7% and driven by our strong backlog and expected order profile for the next few quarters.
Gross margin was 63.1% in Q1 and nearly flat compared with the record gross margin result we posted in the June quarter in spite of the sequential quarterly decline in revenue. The strong gross margin performance in Q1 reflects the benefit of a more favorable product mix than was originally modeled for the quarter. Lower parts expenses in our service business and lower inventory reserve expenses associated with new product transitions. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 63% in the December quarter, down slightly versus the September quarter principally due to a less favorable product mix in the revenue plan, offset by an increase in revenue.
Total operating expenses were $220 million, down $6 million compared with the June quarter; and operating margin was 33.8% in the quarter. We expect quarterly operating expense levels to remain at the $220 million level, plus or minus a few million, for the next several quarters and to continue to deliver strong operating leverage in what we expect to be a growth year for the company in 2017. 
Our effective tax rate was 20% in the quarter, just below our long-term planning rate of 21%. The lower tax rate in the quarter largely reflects the benefit of early adoption of a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. You should continue to use 21% for modeling purposes.
Finally, net income for the September quarter was $182 million, and we ended the quarter with 157 million fully diluted shares outstanding. 
I'll turn now to the highlights from the balance sheet and our cash flow statement.
Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.5 billion, roughly flat with the June quarter. Cash from operations was $170 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $160 million. In September, we paid an aggregate of $89 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and made a supplemental payment of $40 million towards our outstanding term loan. To date, the total amount of payments of principal on our term loan has amounted to approximately $214 million since it was added in the December quarter of 2014.
In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in September signals a strong start for the company in FY '17 and, coupled with the expectations for the December quarter, position the company for strong relative growth versus the wafer fab equipment market in calendar '16. This performance demonstrates the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of a portfolio solution addressing the most critical yield requirements at the leading edge and our operational core competencies. Given our strong backlog and with the expected growth trajectory in new orders, including the book-to-bill forecast of greater than 1 in the December quarter and the first half of 2017 order profile that is stronger than the second half of 2016, KLA-Tencor is in a position for a year of solid growth in 2017.
With that, to reiterate our guidance for the December quarter is: shipments in the range of $800 million to $880 million, revenue between $805 million and $865 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.28 to $1.48, with GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.46 per share. 
This concludes our remarks in the quarter. I'll now turn the call back to Ed to begin the Q&A."

I think that what we were hoping for is to get it out mainly as a discovery tool. So way back in SEMICON in 2015, we talked about the discovery market, and our goal over time was to get to 50% of that market served by optical. I think by -- at the run rate we have now, at the end of calendar '16, we're addressing about 1/3 of that market. So I'd say we have about 1/3 of that market. And our target remains that by the end of 2017 to be 50% of that market. Part of it, the market grew a little bit because e-beam was just -- is not capable of satisfying some of it. So there was a gap in terms of functionality, in terms of whole wafer, but the displacement, I think, is going on. We're seeing Gen 5 adopted more probably. Gen 5 really doesn't go into production, though, and replace Gen 4 until future nodes when the critical defect size gets smaller, and you can really think about that more in terms of the adoption of EUV lithography. So for now, it's doing what we hoped it would do. Customers like what they see. It's a new product. So of course, there's improvements that we need to keep making, but we think we're on track for the plan that we laid out a little over a year and 3 months ago."

So to Rick's point, given our objective at the end of '17, we think that's how the adoption plays out. Most of what we're seeing in terms of 10-nanometer production is really being driven by the Gen 4 product line. The reception has just been really strong for that and its capability. So we're really encouraged by that. The extendability we think it has, has moved into 7.

But it is -- if you think about a yield curve, I think there's a long flat part of that curve down around 0. And I think it took a while for people to debug the process. And frankly, one of the things -- one of the areas for opportunity for us going forward is there's not really a good defect discovery mode for 3D NAND because there's really no tool capable of helping debug and even -- although we've made some attempts, when you do find the defects, they're very hard to verify because you have to essentially deprocess or FIB them to go find it. So I'd say it's been slow in terms of getting started. Now it's getting better. I think that there's -- some people are getting their process. But as they look at expanding to the next technical challenges, we anticipate yield is going to be a big part of the challenge.

Today, I'm very pleased to announce that we got off to a very solid start in FY '17 as KLA-Tencor finished above the midpoint of guidance for shipments and revenue for the first quarter and exceeded the range for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. September quarter orders came in slightly better than our internal forecast, highlighted by strong foundry demand. These results were fueled by strong customer acceptance of new products and a business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage, providing the resources to rank KLA-Tencor among the top tier of all technology companies in terms of returning cash to shareholders.
Our recently announced 4% increase in the quarterly dividend level from $0.52 to $0.54 per share is further evidence of our confidence in the strength of our business and our ongoing commitment to enhance stockholder value. Our performance in Q1 also affirmed KLA-Tencor's ongoing focus on providing value to our customers in terms of meeting market requirements and delivering superior competitive offerings. 
As in the past, a key contributor to the strong demand we're experiencing today is the success of new products across our product portfolio. Our market leadership is sustained by ongoing successful execution of a product strategy that's focused on intersecting market needs with a portfolio of complementary solutions to address the broad range of yield challenges our customers are facing at the leading edge, and the pace of new product introduction continued at a rapid clip. 
Over the past 12 months, we have launched 2 new products in broadband plasma wafer inspection as well as new products in laser scanning wafer inspection, e-beam review, unpatterned wafer inspection and mask inspection. In our flagship broadband plasma optical inspection portfolio, the new Gen 5 platform is currently addressing early yield learning challenges and engineering analysis applications critical to both EUV and advanced optical lithography design rule development. We have also recently introduced upgraded capability for our Gen 4 product line to meet the high-volume inline monitoring needs of customers who are ramping 10-nanometer capacity. The expanded Gen 4 platform is currently experiencing very strong customer acceptance in the marketplace and is exceeding our own expectations both in terms of market reception and operational execution.
We're also very encouraged by the strength we're seeing today in mask inspection. Our leading-edge mask inspection portfolio is not only being incorporated into our customer's optical mask inspection techniques, but is also the preferred technology to support early adoption of EUV as customers work to qualify masks for this very important technology inflection. 
So to summarize, our Q1 results demonstrate our strategies are working and the company is operating from a position of strength. As we look ahead to the December quarter and beyond, the stage is set to build on the success and deliver what we expect to be an exciting year for the company in 2017. Given our leading market position, our focus on customer collaborations and with our continued operating discipline, we believe KLA-Tencor is well positioned to successfully execute our strategies and achieve growth in calendar 2017 consistent with our long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7%. This is against a backdrop of WFE growth forecast to be in the low to mid-single digits for the year.
Now, turning to the guidance for the December quarter. Q2 shipments are expected to be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. Revenue for the quarter are expected to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the midpoint of our guidance to a range of $805 million to $865 million, with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.28 per share to $1.48 per share.

The September quarter represented another solid period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Revenue was near the top end of the range, and earnings per share finished the quarter above the range, driven by strength in gross margins that continue to reflect strong differentiation of our products in the marketplace. 
Revenue for Q1 was $751 million, and fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.16. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.13 in the quarter. In our press release, you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.03 difference.
With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. In regards to highlights of the Q1 demand environment, we are no longer reporting quarterly and booking results or quantifying order guidance in terms of dollar amounts, but we will continue to share our perspective on the current quarterly demand picture to give investors insight into our industry trends, and market mix estimates for the December quarter are based on current forecasts. 
Foundry was 69% of new semiconductor system orders in September. Foundry bookings featured strong demand across our product portfolio to support leading-edge development projects. Although foundry is expected to decline to 30% of total system orders in Q2 due to project timing, we are currently expecting foundry orders to grow in the first half of calendar '17 compared with the second half of this calendar year.
Memory was 15% of new system orders in Q1, with demand evenly split between DRAM and NAND. Memory orders are expected to jump to 60% of the total in December, largely due to concentration of orders to support a single new memory project build-out in Korea. 
Logic was 16% of new system orders in the September quarter and is expected to be approximately 10% of the Q2 order mix.
In terms of distribution of orders by product group for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2017, wafer inspection was approximately 37% of new system orders. Patterning was approximately 33% of orders. The patterning order profile includes mask inspection system bookings. Service was 28%, and non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q1 were $786 million and in the upper half of the guided range of $735 million to $815 million. Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments to grow sequentially 7% at the midpoint and be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. 
Turning now to the income statement. Revenue was $751 million, finishing at the top end of the range of guidance for the quarter. We expect revenue to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the midpoint to a range of $805 million to $865 million in the December quarter. And our current forecast shows revenue levels in the first half of calendar '17 growing in the mid- to high single digits compared with the second half of calendar '16, consistent with our long-term annual growth target of 5% to 7% and driven by our strong backlog and expected order profile for the next few quarters.
Gross margin was 63.1% in Q1 and nearly flat compared with the record gross margin result we posted in the June quarter, in spite of the sequential quarterly decline in revenue. The strong gross margin performance in Q1 reflects the benefit of a more favorable product mix than was originally modeled for the quarter; lower parts expenses in our service business and lower inventory reserve expenses associated with new product transitions. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 63% in the December quarter, down slightly versus the September quarter principally due to a less favorable product mix in the revenue plan, offset by an increase in revenue.
Total operating expenses were $220 million, down $6 million compared with the June quarter; and operating margin was 33.8% in the quarter. We expect quarterly operating expense levels to remain at the $220 million level, plus or minus a few million, for the next several quarters and to continue to deliver strong operating leverage in what we expect to be a growth year for the company in 2017. 
Our effective tax rate was 20% in the quarter, just below our long-term planning rate of 21%. The lower tax rate in the quarter largely reflects the benefit of early adoption of a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. You should continue to use 21% for modeling purposes.
Finally, net income for the September quarter was $182 million, and we ended the quarter with 157 million fully diluted shares outstanding. 
I'll turn now to the highlights from the balance sheet and our cash flow statement.
Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.5 billion, roughly flat with the June quarter. Cash from operations was $170 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $160 million. In September, we paid an aggregate of $89 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and made a supplemental payment of $40 million towards our outstanding term loan. To date, the total amount of payments of principal on our term loan has amounted to approximately $214 million since it was added in the December quarter of 2014.
In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in September signals a strong start for the company in FY '17 and coupled with the expectations for the December quarter, position the company for strong relative growth versus the wafer fab equipment market in calendar '16. This performance demonstrates the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of a portfolio solutions addressing the most critical yield requirements at the leading edge and our operational core competencies. Given our strong backlog and with the expected growth trajectory in new orders, including the book-to-bill forecast of greater than 1 in the December quarter and the first half of 2017 order profile that is stronger than the second half of 2016, KLA-Tencor is in a position for a year of solid growth in 2017.
With that, to reiterate our guidance for the December quarter is: shipments in the range of $800 million to $880 million; revenue between $805 million and $865 million; and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.28 to $1.48, with GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.46 per share. 
This concludes our remarks in the quarter. I'll now turn the call back to Ed to begin the Q&A."

So we've seen some strength, albeit modest at this point. But metrology is also growing, and a lot of that has to do with some of the challenges in terms of things like registration and so the overlay business and some of the films businesses. So we're feeling pretty good about it. It's not at the intensity levels, of course, of foundry. But it is significantly up from where it had been in prior nodes, and we see strength going forward there."

I think that what we were hoping for is to get it out mainly as a discovery tool. So way back in SEMICON in 2015, we talked about the discovery market, and our goal over time was to get to 50% of that market served by an optical. I think by -- at the run rate we have now, at the end of calendar '16, we're addressing about 1/3 of that market. So I'd say we have about 1/3 of that market. And our target remains that by the end of 2017 to be 50% of that market. Part of it, the market grew a little bit because e-beam was just -- is not capable of satisfying some of it. So there was a gap in terms of functionality, in terms of whole wafer, but the displacement, I think, is going on. We're seeing Gen 5 adopted more probably. Gen 5 really doesn't go into production, though, and replace Gen 4 until future nodes when the critical defect size gets smaller, and you can really think about that more in terms of the adoption of EUV lithography. So for now, it's doing what we hoped it would do. Customers like what they see. It's a new product. So of course, there's improvements that we need to keep making, but we think we're on track for the plan that we laid out a little over a year and 3 months ago."

So to Rick's point, given our objective at the end of '17, we think that's how the adoption plays out. Most of what we're seeing in terms of 10-nanometer production is really being driven by the Gen 4 product line. The reception has just been really strong for that and its capability. So we're really encouraged by that. The extendability we think it has, has moved into 7.

So I mean, I think that's sustainable. So I think some of what we're seeing today, it'd be hard for me, I think, to replicate that type of gross margin profile into next year, so might be a little bit of degradation there.

And frankly, one of the things -- one of the areas for opportunity for us going forward is there's not really a good defect discovery mode for 3D NAND because there's really no tool capable of helping debug and even -- although we've made some attempts, when you do find the defects, they're very hard to verify because you have to essentially deprocess or FIB them to go find it. So I'd say it's been slow in terms of getting started. Now it's getting better. I think that there's -- some people are getting their process.

Today, I'm very pleased to announce that we got off to a very solid start in FY '17 as KLA-Tencor finished above the midpoint of guidance for shipments and revenue for the first quarter and exceeded the range for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. September quarter orders came in slightly better than our internal forecast, highlighted by strong foundry demand. These results were fueled by strong customer acceptance of new products and a business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage, providing the resources to rank KLA-Tencor among the top tier of all technology companies in terms of returning cash to shareholders.
Our recently announced 4% increase in the quarterly dividend level from $0.52 to $0.54 per share is further evidence of our confidence in the strength of our business and our ongoing commitment to enhance stockholder value. Our performance in Q1 also affirmed KLA-Tencor's ongoing focus on providing value to our customers in terms of meeting market requirements and delivering superior competitive offerings. 
As in the past, a key contributor to the strong demand we're experiencing today is the success of new products across our product portfolio. Our market leadership is sustained by ongoing successful execution of a product strategy that's focused on intersecting market needs with a portfolio of complementary solutions to address the broad range of yield challenges our customers are facing at the leading edge, and the pace of new product introduction continued at a rapid clip. 
Over the past 12 months, we have launched 2 new products in broadband plasma wafer inspection as well as new products in laser scanning wafer inspection, e-beam review, unpatterned wafer inspection and mask inspection. In our flagship broadband plasma optical inspection portfolio, the new Gen 5 platform is currently addressing early yield learning challenges and engineering analysis applications critical to both EUV and advanced optical lithography design rule development. We have also recently introduced upgraded capability for our Gen 4 product line to meet the high-volume inline monitoring needs of customers who are ramping 10-nanometer capacity. The expanded Gen 4 platform is currently experiencing very strong customer acceptance in the marketplace and is exceeding our own expectations both in terms of market reception and operational execution.
We're also very encouraged by the strength we're seeing today in mask inspection. Our leading-edge mask inspection portfolio is not only being incorporated into our customer's optical mask inspection techniques, but is also the preferred technology to support early adoption of EUV as customers work to qualify masks for this very important technology inflection. 
So to summarize, our Q1 results demonstrate our strategies are working and the company is operating from a position of strength. As we look ahead to the December quarter and beyond, the stage is set to build on the success and deliver what we expect to be an exciting year for the company in 2017. Given our leading market position, our focus on customer collaborations and with our continued operating discipline, we believe KLA-Tencor is well positioned to successfully execute our strategies and achieve growth in calendar 2017 consistent with our long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7%. This is against a backdrop of WFE growth forecast to be in the low to mid-single digits for the year.
Now, turning to the guidance for the December quarter. Q2 shipments are expected to be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. Revenue for the quarter are expected to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the midpoint of our guidance to a range of $805 million to $865 million, with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.28 per share to $1.48 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?"
282225,404012966,1059461,"KLA-Tencor Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone.

The September quarter represented another solid period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Revenue was near the top end of the range, and earnings per share finished the quarter above the range, driven by strength in gross margins that continue to reflect strong differentiation of our products in the marketplace. 
Revenue for Q1 was $751 million, and fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.16. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.13 in the quarter. In our press release, you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.03 difference.
With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. In regards to highlights of the Q1 demand environment, we are no longer reporting quarterly and booking results or quantifying order guidance in terms of dollar amounts, but we will continue to share our perspective on the current quarterly demand picture to give investors insight into our industry trends, and market mix estimates for the December quarter are based on current forecasts. 
Foundry was 69% of new semiconductor system orders in September. Foundry bookings featured strong demand across our product portfolio to support leading-edge development projects. Although foundry is expected to decline to 30% of total system orders in Q2 due to project timing, we are currently expecting foundry orders to grow in the first half of calendar '17 compared with the second half of this calendar year.
Memory was 15% of new system orders in Q1, with demand evenly split between DRAM and NAND. Memory orders are expected to jump to 60% of the total in December, largely due to concentration of orders to support a single new memory project build-out in Korea. 
Logic was 16% of new system orders in the September quarter and is expected to be approximately 10% of the Q2 order mix.
In terms of distribution of orders by product group for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2017, wafer inspection was approximately 37% of new system orders. Patterning was approximately 33% of orders. The patterning order profile includes mask inspection system bookings. Service was 28%, and non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q1 were $786 million and in the upper half of the guided range of $735 million to $815 million. Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments to grow sequentially 7% at the midpoint and be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. 
Turning now to the income statement. Revenue was $751 million, finishing at the top end of the range of guidance for the quarter. We expect revenue to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the midpoint to a range of $805 million to $865 million in the December quarter. And our current forecast shows revenue levels in the first half of calendar '17 growing in the mid- to high single digits compared with the second half of calendar '16, consistent with our long-term annual growth target of 5% to 7% and driven by our strong backlog and expected order profile for the next few quarters.
Gross margin was 63.1% in Q1 and nearly flat compared with the record gross margin result we posted in the June quarter, in spite of the sequential quarterly decline in revenue. The strong gross margin performance in Q1 reflects the benefit of a more favorable product mix than was originally modeled for the quarter; lower parts expenses in our service business and lower inventory reserve expenses associated with new product transitions. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 63% in the December quarter, down slightly versus the September quarter principally due to a less favorable product mix in the revenue plan, offset by an increase in revenue.
Total operating expenses were $220 million, down $6 million compared with the June quarter; and operating margin was 33.8% in the quarter. We expect quarterly operating expense levels to remain at the $220 million level, plus or minus a few million, for the next several quarters and to continue to deliver strong operating leverage in what we expect to be a growth year for the company in 2017. 
Our effective tax rate was 20% in the quarter, just below our long-term planning rate of 21%. The lower tax rate in the quarter largely reflects the benefit of early adoption of a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. You should continue to use 21% for modeling purposes.
Finally, net income for the September quarter was $182 million, and we ended the quarter with 157 million fully diluted shares outstanding. 
I'll turn now to the highlights from the balance sheet and our cash flow statement.
Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.5 billion, roughly flat with the June quarter. Cash from operations was $170 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $160 million. In September, we paid an aggregate of $89 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and made a supplemental payment of $40 million towards our outstanding term loan. To date, the total amount of payments of principal on our term loan has amounted to approximately $214 million since it was added in the December quarter of 2014.
In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in September signals a strong start for the company in FY '17 and coupled with the expectations for the December quarter, position the company for strong relative growth versus the wafer fab equipment market in calendar '16. This performance demonstrates the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of a portfolio solutions addressing the most critical yield requirements at the leading edge and our operational core competencies. Given our strong backlog and with the expected growth trajectory in new orders, including the book-to-bill forecast of greater than 1 in the December quarter and the first half of 2017 order profile that is stronger than the second half of 2016, KLA-Tencor is in a position for a year of solid growth in 2017.
With that, to reiterate our guidance for the December quarter is: shipments in the range of $800 million to $880 million; revenue between $805 million and $865 million; and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.28 to $1.48, with GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.46 per share. 
This concludes our remarks in the quarter. I'll now turn the call back to Ed to begin the Q&A."

But metrology is also growing, and a lot of that has to do with some of the challenges in terms of things like registration and so the overlay business and some of the films businesses.

So way back in SEMICON in 2015, we talked about the discovery market, and our goal over time was to get to 50% of that market served by an optical. I think by -- at the run rate we have now, at the end of calendar '16, we're addressing about 1/3 of that market. So I'd say we have about 1/3 of that market. And our target remains that by the end of 2017 to be 50% of that market. Part of it, the market grew a little bit because e-beam was just -- is not capable of satisfying some of it. So there was a gap in terms of functionality, in terms of whole wafer, but the displacement, I think, is going on. We're seeing Gen 5 adopted more probably. Gen 5 really doesn't go into production, though, and replace Gen 4 until future nodes when the critical defect size gets smaller, and you can really think about that more in terms of the adoption of EUV lithography. So for now, it's doing what we hoped it would do. Customers like what they see. It's a new product. So of course, there's improvements that we need to keep making, but we think we're on track for the plan that we laid out a little over a year and 3 months ago."

So to Rick's point, given our objective at the end of '17, we think that's how the adoption plays out. Most of what we're seeing in terms of 10-nanometer production is really being driven by the Gen 4 product line. The reception has just been really strong for that and its capability. So we're really encouraged by that. The extendability we think it has, has moved into 7.

But I think as we start to transition into some of the newer products, some of the benefits we've seen around warranty and support costs and efficient cycle times and things like that, I think some of that goes away. Now, I do think, and as I've said in the call a couple of weeks ago, I do believe that versus the model we published that we're operating probably a solid 100 basis points above what we had put out there. So I mean, I think that's sustainable. So I think some of what we're seeing today, it'd be hard for me, I think, to replicate that type of gross margin profile into next year, so might be a little bit of degradation there. So given at that revenue level, the range that you mentioned probably feels a little bit high. But I would say you're probably in that 35-ish percent range, plus or minus, 100 basis points or so.

I would say the leaders feel good about where they are, and I won't comment to that. There are other players getting in the market, and I would say that we are seeing success. But it is -- if you think about a yield curve, I think that there's a long flat part of that curve down around 0. And I think it took a while for people to debug the process. And frankly, one of the things -- one of the areas for opportunity for us going forward is there's not really a good defect discovery mode for 3D NAND because there's really no tool capable of helping debug and even -- although we've made some attempts, when you do find the defects, they're very hard to verify because you have to essentially deprocess or FIB them to go find it. So I'd say it's been slow in terms of getting started. Now it's getting better. I think that there's -- some people are getting their process. But as they look at expanding to the next technical challenges, we anticipate yield is going to be a big part of the challenge. And I think there's a lot of interest in partnering with us to come up with solutions to address that because obviously, there's demand there. But they're certainly getting very challenged by making the processes actually work."

We've taken some risks. I think we're managing through transitions.

So I think it's really the strength -- I don't see a fundamental shift in overall mix as we move into next year.

So that could be an inflecting product a little bit into the year -- year-to-year. But overall, I think the mix looks relatively consistent across the different product segments."
