Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today's call is particularly important. The financial markets have created pressure on both our debt and equity for racing significant value from investors.
This morning, I'll address the factors impacting our enterprise value, what we're doing to manage them and demonstrate while the intrinsic value of our company remains strong and intact.
Front and center for us, and I know many of you is our access to and cost of liquidity. The legal final maturity date topic has caused spreads to widen in trading to be limited in the top ABS market. This, along with the disruptive high-yield market, has caused our unsecured debt spreads to widen. 
Some investors have asked about our ability to continue to return excess capital to shareholders while meeting our unsecured debt maturities. Let me be perfectly clear, I am confident we can continue to do both, in the fact, we have a plan to do so. 
I'm confident because our $123 billion portfolio of student loans generates sizable and predictable cash flow. This cash flow totaled $3 billion in 2015 and is projected to be $2.7 billion in 2016. In addition, we have a very long track record of securing funding from the assets we own. For example, in the fourth quarter, we completed 2 new first-time financings for over $900 million, at a cost that was several hundred basis points inside of our unsecured debt spreads.
We used the proceeds to take advantage of market conditions and we repurchased $691 million of unsecured debt generating a gain of $21 million. We also confirmed our confidence in our cash flows with the new $700 million share repurchase program. And we used our authority. In 2015, we repurchased 56 million shares. And since January 1, we have acquired an additional 5.4 million shares. Combined, over 15% of shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015.
In 2015, we took a number of steps to address the legal final maturity topic. During the year, we amended 6 trusts to extend the maturity date, amended 16 different trusts to provide us with an additional 10% loan purchase option and we exercised cleanup calls on 12 ABS trusts, totaling $1.1 billion. Notably, these actions consumed little additional liquidity, notably increased our costs. 
We also provided extensive detail to the rating agencies and investors to demonstrate the stability of federal student loan cash flows even under the unlikely deferred payment trust scenarios. While the rating agencies have yet to issue their final AAA criteria for faulty ABS, we are confident they will be less stringent than their preliminary statements. 
We also maintained significant liquidity to loan purchases. This liquidity is most often in the form of limited purchase -- limited purpose structured debt facilities and we've used these facilities consistently for close to 20 years to support our loan acquisition activities, including the acquisition of loans from cleanup calls associated with our ABS trust.
These facilities provided the liquidity to purchase $3.7 billion in student loans and $1.1 billion in cleanup call acquisitions in 2015. The prepayment in default assumptions that drive our projected cash flows are based on our over 40 years of data and experience. Each year, the cash flows realized have closely matched our projections and we've been able to add to the expected future cash flows with servicing skills that reduce default rates, by capturing floor income and by purchasing student loan portfolios at appropriate prices.
This is not our first experience with difficult markets. Our long track record here demonstrates our deep understanding of our assets and our ability to confidently and creatively manage our liquidity and maximize our cash flows.
Headlines covering student loans have created a storyline that lead one to believe that most student loan borrowers have an overwhelming debt burden that cannot be met. That's far from the typical experience. For example, 85% of our federal loan customers are current. Still, some student loan borrowers do have more debt than they can reasonably afford. This is usually due to dropping out before they earn their degree, taking 6 years or more to complete their degree or paying more than the degree is worth.
At Navient, our practices are designed to assist struggling borrowers with solutions that keep them out of delinquency and default and instead drive repayment success. For short-term issues, payment deferral may be a good solution, while income-based solutions addressed longer-term challenges.
Paying down the loan balance is, however, the true objective. That's why we continue to recommend that federal policies should include programs to provide students with actionable information about the financial resources they will need to earn their degree on time and whether or not their degree supports that investment.
Many are surprised to learn that the average bachelor's degree recipient who borrows for a 4-year degree, and not all do, leave school with less than $29,000 in loans. Furthermore, while a small percentage of undergraduate borrowers owe more than $60,000, defaults have far more likely to occur among those who borrowed substantially lower amounts.
In addition, many are not aware that program-wide default rates and the vacancy rates have fallen significantly since the end of the Great Recession. In fact, at year end, our total delinquency rates have all federal and private portfolios are at their lowest levels in over a decade. Finally, student loans are on the agenda of several regulatory agencies. While we continue to be responsive to the requests from regulators, we also work to demonstrate the effectiveness of our services and practices and data-driven servicing solutions, while we used customer feedback to drive changes, and how we lead efforts around industry best practices.
It's important to acknowledge here that for federal student loans, neither FFELP lenders nor Department of Education loan servicers set the price, school charges, the amount of student can borrow, the interest rate on the loan, the repayment terms, nor a borrower's eligibility for any of the over 40 alternative repayment and deferment options available to them. And we like, all like federal loan servicers, must follow rules and regulations issued by the Department of Education.
Over the years, the federal student loan program has added numerous loan programs and repayment options. These programs often have very similar sounding names like income sensitive, income-based, pays you learn, and revised pay as you learn. This is our customers in understanding the different options so they can select the payment program that best fit their needs.
Still, the numerous options, unique terms and lengthy applications can all be overwhelming to borrowers. We continue to advocate our program simplicity as a way to meaningfully increase our -- increase customer participation.
On our fees and programs should encourage borrowers to contact their servicers not overwhelm them, contact works and it should be encourage. The regulatory focus on student loans had led some to believe that new regulations could significantly increase our cost to service our loans. We have a decade of long track record of managing regulatory changes while simultaneously improving our operating efficiency. We were able to view this as a result of our expertise and scale and expect to be able to do so going forward.
For example, this year, we automated our processes for FCRA benefits and enrollment and re-enrollment in income driven repayment programs, including the new revised pay as you learn program. Both of these examples would otherwise be very labor-intensive tasks.
During 2015, our great team maintained our focus on our business and building value. I'm proud of our work and thankful for their commitment. For the year, we generated core cash earnings of $1.85, reduced outstanding unsecured debt by $2.3 billion, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reduced private credit charge-offs by $58 million or 8%, ending the year at the lowest delinquency rate since 2005, extended our business services with the acquisition of Gila and Extent, we converted nearly $5 billion of FFELP loans to our servicing platform, we enrolled or reenrolled over 1 million borrowers in the income driven repayment programs; assisted 728,000 severely delinquent customers who are now current and finding a solution that help them avoid default and we improved our operating cost and efficiency.
For 2016, we're focused on realizing the value of our portfolio and leveraging our core skills to generate growing earnings from our student loan and non-student loan businesses. The current financial market conditions, however, will likely limit opportunities to purchase student loan portfolios in the near term.
While our net financing plans are modest in 2016, we do plan to issue FFELP and private asset-backed securities shortly and unsecured notes later this year. While Somsak will provide more details later in the presentation, we believe our business will generate core EPS between $1.82 and $1.87 per share in 2016.
Yesterday, our stock closed at $9.45 per share. I do not believe this is an accurate reflection of our value. It's not even close. In today's earnings presentation, we provided summary of our expected future cash flows from our existing student loan portfolios. These cash flows are expected to exceed $31 billion before unsecured debt and operating expenses. The $31.7 billion in cash flows is also not discounted.
Several research analysts have estimated the net present value of these cash flows including unsecured debt and including operating expense, that produce per-share estimates in the high-teens and low 20s.
I agree with these estimates. I strongly agree with them. Our focus for 2016 is to realize this value, we do so by focusing on maximizing our earnings and cash flow and by using excess capital to repurchase our shares, shares that are trading at a very deep discount. We intend to utilize the full $755 million available at January 1 under our share repurchase authority this year.
At today's prices, this would equate to buying over 20% of shares outstanding. Thank you for your interest and support. We're committed on delivering our enterprise value to our investors. And I'll now turn the call over to Somsak for a more detailed review of the financials."

During my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing the fourth quarter results, highlighting the recent financing activity and help provide additional details behind the company's 2016 earnings guidance.

During my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing the fourth quarter results, highlighting the recent financing activity and help provide additional details behind the company's 2016 earnings guidance. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on the company's website. And let me start with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.49. These results exclude $0.01 per share or $7 million of regulatory related costs during the quarter. Our full-year 2015 core EPS was $1.85, excluding regulatory related costs. 
And our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $228 million versus $206 million a year ago. This increase is related to the additional costs resulting from the acquisition of Gila and Xtend Healthcare. And as Jack mentioned, we expect our full-year 2016 core EPS to range between $1.82 and $1.87, and we expect our operating expenses to be under $930 million from 2016.
Both these items exclude the impact of any regulatory-related costs. The primary driver for the increase in operating expenses from 2015 will be the full year run rate for Xtend and Gila.
Excluding the operating expenses from the 2 companies, our 2016 projected core operating expenses would be 6% lower than 2015 levels.
Let's start to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $74 million for the fourth quarter 2015 compared with $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
In the quarter, our FFELP NIM was at 84 basis points and we expect the full year 2016 FFELP NIM to remain in the low to mid-80s. Our FFELP NIM may be impacted by future LIBOR rates which will determine the amount of portfolio. But since our -- since quarter end -- and since the quarter ended, we have hedged an additional $270 million of full income, bringing the future hedge for income total to over $1 billion.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loan segment results. Core earnings in this segment decreased $36 million from the year-ago quarter to $56 million. During the quarter, Navient sold $178 million of low coupon private education loans, which rates $157 million. The reduction in interest expense from paying down the debt and servicing fee income we retained had a net present value greater than the loss in the future expected spread income from this portfolio.
Our third quarter net interest margin came in at 3.61%. The private net interest margin continues to be impacted by the timing of when our prime-based learning assets reset versus our debt that is funded with LIBOR. As a result, we are forecasting the full year 2016 private student loan net interest margin to be in the mid-3 50s. At year-end, we have approximately $17 billion of prime earning assets funded by LIBOR index to LIBOR.
Slide 7 highlights our improving private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This is a portfolio that is well seasoned, it's 94% loan and repayment status having made more than 12 payments.
Our fourth quarter charge-offs came in at 2.3% or $33 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year. Our total delinquency rate of 7.2% at year end is at the lowest rate which we've seen since 2005. And for 2016, we expect our annualized charge-off rate for the full year to be between 2.3% and 2.5%. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment results. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter compared with $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was related to unexpected $8 million reduction in asset recovery revenues related a legislative reduction that we highlighted in the third quarter, along with the decrease in education loan related expenses -- revenues.
Our nonfederal student loan related asset recovery revenues increased by $70 million for 2014 to $118 million for 2015. The increase in these revenues was primarily related to the additions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015, and we expect our full-year 2016 business services revenues to range between $620 million and $650 million, and that revenue excludes any intercompany loan servicing revenues.
I would like to highlight the financing activities that took place in the fourth quarter, on Slide 9. During the quarter, we issued $359 million private loan ABS, and this transaction was unique since it was the first of this kind from Navient with collateral consisting and ski season, performing nontraditional loans.
While the term nontraditional may have negative connotations, the assets in this field improved from the average FFELP's FICO score of 625 at origination to a current score of 690. This demonstrates the positive impact that season have on the credit quality of this portfolio.
Of the $2.1 billion of nontraditional loans in repayment on a forbearance on our balance sheet, nearly 90% of these loans have made more than 12 payments. We also raised an additional $500 million in the quarter to a new 2-year private education loan repurchase facility. This is the first time they instructed the facility to allow us to advance against the over collateralization associated with our private education loan securitization that have a Turbo repayment structure.
After this transaction, we have similar securitizations with $3.1 billion remaining at current OC levels and that is expected to grow to $4.5 billion at expect maturities.
During the quarter, our unsecured debt declined by $734 million to $15.2 billion outstanding at year-end. Of the 300 -- of the $734 million reduction and unsecured debt, $991 million was achieved through repurchases, through tender offers and open market transactions. And then during the quarter, we repurchased 14.1 million shares or $170 million and announced an additional $700 million share repurchase authorization.
Since January 1, we have spent $55 million. And as of today, we have remaining authority of $700 million under our current share repurchase plan. Although this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and resulted in a tangible net asset ratio of 2-point -- 1.25x. We continued to reduce and smooth out our debt maturity profile to better match the cash flow generated by our asset management business.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We reported fourth quarter GAAP net income of $286 million, or $0.79 per share, that's compared to net income of $263 million or $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM Bank.
I will now -- let's open up the call for questions."

I want to bet verify some numbers and better understand the motivation for the buyback. I think you've given all the answers, you said that the net present value and the high-teens, low 20s, you [indiscernible] et cetera, and this is my observation, in 2014, you spent $600 million to buy $30.4 million, you paid $19.76. In 2015, you spent $945 million or 56 million shares, at $16.88. On 12/31/2015, you said you had $755 million left, you bought $55 million worth of stock fund, 44 million shares you paid $10.90, so far this year. we have less $700 million, which I believe is roughly 23% of the market capital of the company. Why are we not and the stock is somewhere between 6% and 7%, why don't we engage in accelerated repurchase and spend that $700 million now because we seem with a stock so far disjointed from the economic realities as you portray them and being an uncertain environment in the market which creates this opportunity? It seems to me that we should really accelerate the repurchase program, we thought 23 was coming. And by the way, unless I'm missing something, if you bought back 23% of the company at call it $10 or $11 and you think the real value is the low 20s, that could create significant value to remain shares, the value goes up not exponentially, but goes up quite significantly. So my question is, we paid prices of $20, $17 for so much that, why don't we accelerate it? How dangerous is it? How risky is it to by 11 months in advance today? I'm going to leave the operational questions to my partner, who knows more about the business than me."

You can just see that there's a fair amount of complexity here. I do think we made some excellent progress with both Moody's and Fitch on this topic, helping to provide the data that they need to -- that can drive assumptions or stress scenarios that can at least theoretically happen instead of impossible to happen, and we are continuing to work with them. We do make them aware of the consequences that the delays are having in the financial markets and across our capital staff and they assure us they are aware of them and working hard to get this result as quickly as possible. But as I said in my comments, our plan should come to market now ahead of a likely decision -- a decision, a final decision from the agencies is really a reflection that we just can't wait forever for the process to unfold here.

Again, I think, the process that we have utilized here as we engage with regulators is to be responsive to their needs, make sure that they understand the purpose of our policies and practices. For Department of Education loans, I mean a lot of the typical consumer arguments is that some loan is doing something that generates more interest or fees or whatever for the lender. In the Department of Education loan servicing side, we have -- we don't benefit from any duration extension or get harmed by duration shortening. We don't -- there are no fees that are such to consumers. And our job is really to work with the customers according to the guidelines that the Department of Ed sets for us. And within the fee structure that they pay us to help customers find solutions that make sense. We noted this number more times that I can count, but our customers default at 38% lower rate than all other servicers combined. I mean our view is helping customers stay out of default and no one works harder to collect a liability due to them than the federal government. Keeping them out of default is the best thing that we can do and it helps them minimize their expenses and the total cost of loan ownership and we excel at that."

But it really depends on what our -- how we can use it and how we can put that -- those funds to work. In the fourth quarter of last year, is a good example of what we did when we tapped into 2 new forms of financings for this company, securitizing our nontraditional loans and borrowing against the overcollateralization in some of our private credit ABS trust. Those transactions not only just demonstrate that we can actually that funding of our balance sheet, but more importantly do so at substantially lower rates than our unsecured debt as you just mentioned. So when we look at our funding alternatives, that's exactly what we do, we look at what the alternatives are and what these proceeds are and make decisions accordingly. I like the balance sheet as it sits today, I like our liquidity position. We're not in a position where will be forced to issue -- to do things. Obviously, the ability to declare and I get authorization for a $700 million share repurchase program speaks about the confidence in our cash flows and we plan to utilize it, as I said.

Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors in the company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.
During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the fourth quarter 2015 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted, along with the earnings press release on the Investors page at navient.com.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today's call is particularly important. The financial markets have created pressure on both our debt and equity for racing significant value from investors.
This morning, I'll address the factors impacting our enterprise value, what we are doing to manage them and demonstrate why the intrinsic value of our company remains strong and intact.
Front and center for us, and I know many of you is our access to and cost of liquidity. The legal final maturity date topic has caused spreads to widen and trading to be limited in the FFELP ABS market. This, along with the disrupted high-yield market, has caused our unsecured debt spreads to widen.
Some investors have asked about our ability to continue to return excess capital to shareholders while meeting our unsecured debt maturities. Let me be perfectly clear, I am confident we can continue to do both, in the fact, we have a plan to do so.
I'm confident because our $123 billion portfolio of student loans generates sizable and predictable cash flow. This cash flow totaled $3 billion in 2015 and is projected to be $2.7 billion in 2016. In addition, we have a very long track record of securing funding from the assets we own. For example, in the fourth quarter, we completed 2 new first-time financings for over $900 million, at a cost that was several hundred basis points inside of our unsecured debt spreads.
We used the proceeds to take advantage of market conditions and we repurchased $691 million of unsecured debt generating a gain of $21 million. We also confirmed our confidence in our cash flows with the new $700 million share repurchase program. And we used our authority. In 2015, we repurchased 56 million shares. And since January 1, we have acquired an additional 5.4 million shares. Combined, over 15% of shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015.
In 2015, we took a number of steps to address the legal final maturity topic. During the year, we amended 6 trusts to extend the maturity date, amended 16 different trusts to provide us with an additional 10% loan purchase option and we exercised cleanup calls on 12 ABS trusts, totaling $1.1 billion. Notably, these actions consumed little additional liquidity nor did they increase our costs.
We also provided extensive date to the rating agencies and investors to demonstrate the stability of federal student loan cash flows even under the unlikely deferred payments trust scenarios. While the rating agencies have yet to issue their final AAA criteria for FFELP ABS, we are confident they will be less stringent than their preliminary statements.
We also maintained significant liquidity to loan purchases. This liquidity is most often in the form of limited purchase -- limited purpose structured debt facilities and we've used these facilities consistently for close to 20 years to support our loan acquisition activities, including the acquisition of loans from cleanup calls associated with our ABS trust.
These facilities provided the liquidity to purchase $3.7 billion in student loans and $1.1 billion in cleanup call acquisitions in 2015. The prepayment in default assumptions that drive our projected cash flows are based on our over 40 years of data and experience. Each year, the cash flows realized have closely matched our projections and we've been able to add to the expected future cash flows with servicing skills that reduce default rates, by capturing floor income and by purchasing student loan portfolios at appropriate prices.
This is not our first experience with difficult markets. Our long track record here demonstrates our deep understanding of our assets and our ability to confidently and creatively manage our liquidity and maximize our cash flows.
Headlines covering student loans have created storyline that lead one to believe that most student loan borrowers have an overwhelming debt burden that cannot be met. That's far from the typical experience. For example, 85% of our federal loan customers are current. Still, some student loan borrowers do have more debt than they can reasonably afford. This is usually due to dropping out before they earn their degree, taking 6 years or more to complete their degree or paying more than the degree is worth.
At Navient, our practices are designed to assist struggling borrowers with solutions that keep them out of delinquency and default and instead drive repayment success. For short-term issues, payment deferral may be a good solution, while income-based solutions address longer-term challenges.
Paying down the loan balance is, however, the true objective. That's why we continue to recommend that federal policies should include programs to provide students with actionable information about the financial resources they will need to earn their degree on time and whether or not their degree supports that investment.
Many are surprised to learn that the average bachelor's degree recipient, who borrows for a 4-year degree, and not all do, leave school with less than $29,000 in loans. Furthermore, while a small percentage of undergraduate borrowers owe more than $60,000, defaults have far more likely to occur among those who borrow substantially lower amounts.
In addition, many are not aware that program-wide default rates and delinquency rates have fallen significantly since the end of the Great Recession. In fact, at year-end, our total delinquency rates, for both our federal and private portfolios, are at the lowest levels in over a decade. Finally, student loans are on the agenda of several regulatory agencies. While we continue to be responsive to the requests from regulators, we also work to demonstrate the effectiveness of our servicing practices and data-driven servicing solutions, while we used customer feedback to drive changes and how we lead efforts around industry best practices.
It's important to acknowledge here that for federal student loans, neither FFELP lenders nor Department of Education loan servicers set the price, school charges, the amount the student can borrow, the interest rate on the loan, the repayment terms nor a borrower's eligibility for any of over 40 alternative repayment and deferment options available to them. And we, like all federal loan servicers, must follow rules and regulations issued by the Department of Education.
Over the years, the federal student loan program has added numerous loan programs and repayment options. These programs often have very similar sounding names like income sensitive, income-based, pay as you learn and revised pay as you learn. We assist our customers in understanding the different options, so they can select the payment program that best fits their needs.
Still, the numerous options, unique terms, lengthy applications can all be overwhelming to borrowers. We continue to advocate for program simplicity as a way to meaningfully increase our -- increase customer participation.
Policies and programs should encourage borrowers to contact their servicers not overwhelm them, contact works and it should be encouraged. The regulatory focus on student loans have led some to believe that new regulations could significantly increase our cost to service our loans. We have a decades long track record of managing regulatory changes while simultaneously improving our operating efficiency. We were able to view this as a result of our expertise and scale and expect to be able to do so going forward.
For example, this year, we automated our processes for SCRA benefits and enrollment and reenrollment in income-driven repayment programs, including the new revised pay as you learn program. Both of these examples would otherwise be very labor-intensive tasks.
During 2015, our great team maintained our focus on our business and building value. I'm proud of our work and thankful for their commitment. For the year, we generated core cash earnings of $1.85, reduced outstanding unsecured debt by $2.3 billion, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reduced private credit charge-offs by $58 million or 8%, ending the year at the lowest delinquency rate since 2005, extended our business services with the acquisition of Gila and Xtend, we converted nearly $5 billion of FFELP loans to our servicing platform, we enrolled or reenrolled over 1 million borrowers into income-driven repayment programs, assisted 728,000 severely delinquent customers who are now current and finding a solution that help them avoid default and we improved our operating cost and efficiency.
For 2016, we're focused on realizing the value of our portfolio and leveraging our core skills to generate growing earnings from our student loan and nonstudent loan businesses. The current financial market conditions, however, will likely limit opportunities to purchase student loan portfolios in the near term.
While our net financing plans are modest in 2016, we do plan to issue FFELP and private asset-backed securities shortly and unsecured notes later this year. While Somsak will provide more details later in the presentation, we believe our business will generate core EPS between $1.82 and $1.87 per share in 2016.
Yesterday, our stock closed at $9.45 a share. I do not believe this is an accurate reflection of our value. It's not even close. In today's earnings presentation, we provided summary of our expected future cash flows from our existing student loan portfolios. These cash flows are expected to exceed $31 billion before unsecured debt and operating expenses. The $31.7 billion in cash flow is also not discounted.
Several research analysts have estimated the net present value of these cash flows, including unsecured debt and including operating expense, that produce per-share estimates in the high-teens and low 20s. I agree with these estimates. I strongly agree with them.
Our focus for 2016 is to realize this value. We'll do so by focusing on maximizing our earnings and cash flow and by using excess capital to repurchase our shares, shares that are trading at a very deep discount. We intend to utilize the full $755 million available at January 1 under our share repurchase authority this year.
At today's prices, this would equate to buying over 20% of shares outstanding. Thank you for your interest and support. We're committed on delivering our enterprise value to our investors.
And I'll now turn the call over to Somsak for a more detailed review of the financials."

During my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing the fourth quarter results, highlighting the recent financing activity and I'll provide additional detail behind the company's 2016 earnings guidance. I'll be referencing",1128,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing the fourth quarter results, highlighting the recent financing activity and I'll provide additional detail behind the company's 2016 earnings guidance. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on the company's website. And let me start with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.49. These results exclude $0.01 per share or $7 million of regulatory-related costs during the quarter. Our full year 2015 core EPS was $1.85, excluding regulatory-related costs.
And our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $228 million versus $206 million a year ago. This increase is related to the additional costs resulting from the acquisition of Gila and Xtend Healthcare. And as Jack mentioned, we expect our full year 2016 core EPS to range between $1.82 and $1.87, and we expect our operating expenses to be under $930 million from 2016.
Both these items exclude the impact of any regulatory-related costs. The primary driver for the increase in operating expenses from 2015 will be the full year run rate for Xtend and Gila.
Excluding the operating expenses from the 2 companies, our 2016 projected core operating expenses would be 6% lower than 2015 levels.
Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $74 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
In the quarter, our FFELP NIM was at 84 basis points and we expect the full year 2016 FFELP NIM to remain in the low to mid-80s. Our FFELP NIM may be impacted by future LIBOR rates which will determine the amount of floor income in our portfolio. But since our -- since quarter end -- and since the quarter ended, we have hedged an additional $217 million of floor income, bringing the future hedge floor income total to over $1 billion.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loan segment results. Core earnings in this segment decreased $36 million from the year-ago quarter to $56 million. During the quarter, Navient sold $178 million of low coupon private education loans, which raised $157 million. The reduction in interest expense from paying down the debt and servicing fee income we retained had a net present value greater than the loss in the future expected spread income from this portfolio.
Our third quarter net interest margin came in at 3.61%. The private net interest margin continues to be impacted by the timing of when our prime-based earning assets reset versus our debt that is funded with LIBOR. As a result, we are forecasting the full year 2016 private student loan net interest margin to be in the mid-3.50's. At year-end, we have approximately $17 billion of prime earning assets funded by LIBOR lease -- index for LIBOR.
Slide 7 highlights our improving private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This is a portfolio that is well seasoned with 94% for loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments.
Our fourth quarter charge-offs came in at 2.3% or $33 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year. Our total delinquency rate of 7.2% at year-end is at the lowest rate that we've seen since 2005. And for 2016, we expect our annualized charge-off rate for the full year to be between 2.3% and 2.5%.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment results. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter compared with $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was related to an expected $8 million reduction in asset recovery revenues related to a legislative reduction that we highlighted in the third quarter, along with the decrease in education loan-related expenses -- revenues.
Our nonfederal student loan-related asset recovery revenues increased by $17 million for 2014 to $118 million for 2015. The increase in these revenues was primarily related to the additions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015, and we expect our full year 2016 business services revenues to range between $620 million and $650 million, and that revenue excludes any intercompany loan servicing revenues.
I would like to highlight the financing activities that took place in the fourth quarter on Slide 9. During the quarter, we issued $359 million private loan ABS, and this transaction was unique since it was the first of its kind from Navient with collateral consisting entirely of seasoned, performing nontraditional loans.
While the term nontraditional may have negative connotations, the assets in this field improved from the average FICO score of 625 at origination to a current score of 690. This demonstrates the positive impact that seasoning have on the credit quality of this portfolio.
Of the $2.1 billion of nontraditional loans in repayment [indiscernible] forbearance on our balance sheet, nearly 90% of these loans have made more than 12 payments. We also raised an additional $500 million in the quarter through a new 2-year private education loan repurchase facility. This is the first time they structured a facility to allow us to advance against the over collateralization associated with our private education loan securitization that have a Turbo repayment structure.
After this transaction, we have similar securitizations with $3.1 billion remaining at current OC levels and that's expected to grow to $4.5 billion at expected maturities.
During the quarter, our unsecured debt declined by $734 million to $15.2 billion outstanding at the year-end. Of the 300 -- of the $734 million reduction in unsecured debt, $691 million was achieved through repurchases, through tender offers and open market transactions. And then during the quarter, we repurchased 14.1 million shares or $170 million and announced an additional $700 million share repurchase authorization.
Since January 1, we have spent $55 million. And as of today, we have remaining authority of $700 million under our current share repurchase plan. Although this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and resulted in a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25x. We continued to reduce and smooth out our debt maturity profile to better match the cash flow generated by our asset management business.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded fourth quarter GAAP net income of $286 million or $0.79 per share, that's compared to net income of $263 million or $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM Bank.
I will now -- let's open up the call up for questions."

There will be some unique characteristics to this set. Really, I can't probably talk about it at the moment, but we think it will be something that can get done and get done at levels that make sense."

You said that the net present value in the high-teens, low 20s, you strongly, et cetera. This is my observation, in 2014, you spent $600 million to buy 30.4 million shares, you paid $19.70. In 2015, you spent $945 million on 56 million shares at $16.88. On 12/31/2015, you said you had $755 million left, you bought $55 million worth of stock, 5.4 million shares, you paid $10.19 so far this year. And you have left $700 million, which I believe is roughly 23% of the market capital of the company. Why are we not -- and the stock is somewhere between 6% and 7%, why don't we engage in accelerated repurchase and spend that $700 million now because we seeing with the stock so far disjointed from the economic realities as you portray them and being in an uncertain environment in the market which creates this opportunity, it seems to me that we should really accelerate the repurchase program. We thought 23% was coming. And by the way, unless I'm missing something, if you bought back 23% of the company at, call it, $10 or $11 and you think the real value is in low 20s, than it creates significant value to remaining shares. So the value goes up not exponentially, but goes up quite significantly. So my question is, we paid prices of $20, $17 for so much stock, why don't we accelerate it? How dangerous is it? How risky is it to buy 11 months in advance today? I'm going to leave the operational questions to my partner, [indiscernible] who knows more about the business than me."

We do make them aware of the consequences that the delays are having in the financial markets and across our capital stack.

Again, I think, the process that we have utilized here as we engage with regulators is to be responsive to their needs, make sure that they understand the purpose of our policies and practices. For Department of Education loans, I mean a lot of the typical consumer arguments is that someone is doing something that generates more interest or fees or whatever for the lender or in the Department of Education loan servicing side. We have -- we don't benefit from any duration extension or get harmed by duration shortening. We don't -- there are no fees that are such to consumers. And our job is really to work with the customers according to the guidelines that the Department of Ed set for us, and within the fee structure that they pay us to help customers find solutions that make sense. And we've quoted this number more times than I can count, but our customers default at 38% lower rate than all other servicers combined. I mean, our view is helping customers stay out of default and no one works harder to collect a liability due to them than the federal government. Keeping them out of default is the best thing that we can do and it helps them minimize their expenses and the total cost of loan ownership and we excel at that."

But it really depends on what our -- how we can use it and how we can put that fund -- those funds to work. In the fourth quarter of last year, is a good example of what we did when we tapped into 2 new forms of financings for this company, securitizing our nontraditional loans and borrowing against the overcollateralization in some of our private credit ABS trust. Those transactions not only just demonstrate that we can actually tap funding off of our balance sheet, but more importantly do so at substantially lower rates than our unsecured debt costs as you just mentioned. So when we look at our funding alternatives, that's exactly what we do, we look at what the alternatives are and what the use of proceeds are and make decisions accordingly. I like the balance sheet as it sits today. I like our liquidity position. We're not in a position where we're being forced to issue -- to do things. Obviously, the ability to declare and get authorization for a $700 million share repurchase program speaks about the confidence in our cash flows and we plan to utilize it, as I said.

With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO; and Somsak Chivavibul, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.
Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors in the company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.
During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the fourth quarter 2015 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted, along with the earnings press release on the Investors page at navient.com.
Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Jack."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today's call is particularly important. The financial markets have created pressure on both our debt and equity for racing significant value from investors.
This morning, I'll address the factors impacting our enterprise value, what we are doing to manage them and demonstrate why the intrinsic value of our company remains strong and intact.
Front and center for us, and I know many of you is our access to and cost of liquidity. The legal final maturity date topic has caused spreads to widen and trading to be limited in the FFELP ABS market. This, along with the disrupted high-yield market, has caused our unsecured debt spreads to widen.
Some investors have asked about our ability to continue to return excess capital to shareholders while meeting our unsecured debt maturities. Let me be perfectly clear, I am confident we can continue to do both, in fact, we have a plan to do so.
I'm confident because our $123 billion portfolio of student loans generates sizable and predictable cash flow. This cash flow totaled $3 billion in 2015 and is projected to be $2.7 billion in 2016. In addition, we have a very long track record of securing funding from the assets we own. For example, in the fourth quarter, we completed 2 new first-time financings for over $900 million, at a cost that was several hundred basis points inside of our unsecured debt spreads.
We used the proceeds to take advantage of market conditions and we repurchased $691 million of unsecured debt generating a gain of $21 million. We also confirmed our confidence in our cash flows with the new $700 million share repurchase program. And we used our authority. In 2015, we repurchased 56 million shares. And since January 1, we have acquired an additional 5.4 million shares. Combined, over 15% of shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015.
In 2015, we took a number of steps to address the legal final maturity topic. During the year, we amended 6 trusts to extend the maturity date, amended 16 different trusts to provide us with an additional 10% loan purchase option and we exercised cleanup calls on 12 ABS trusts, totaling $1.1 billion. Notably, these actions consumed little additional liquidity nor did they increase our costs.
We also provided extensive data to the rating agencies and investors to demonstrate the stability of federal student loan cash flows even under the unlikely deferred payments trust scenarios. While the rating agencies have yet to issue their final AAA criteria for FFELP ABS, we are confident they will be less stringent than their preliminary statements.
We also maintained significant liquidity for loan purchases if liquidity is most often in the form of limited purchase -- limited purpose structured debt facilities and we've used these facilities consistently for close to 20 years to support our loan acquisition activities, including the acquisition of loans from cleanup calls associated with our ABS trust.
These facilities provided the liquidity to purchase $3.7 billion in student loans and $1.1 billion in cleanup call acquisitions in 2015. The prepayment in default assumptions that drive our projected cash flows are based on our over 40 years of data and experience. Each year, the cash flows realized have closely matched our projections and we've been able to add to the expected future cash flows with servicing skills that reduce default rates, by capturing floor income and by purchasing student loan portfolios at appropriate prices.
This is not our first experience with difficult markets. Our long track record here demonstrates our deep understanding of our assets and our ability to confidently and creatively manage our liquidity and maximize our cash flows.
Headlines covering student loans have created storyline that lead one to believe that most student loan borrowers have an overwhelming debt burden that cannot be met. That's far from the typical experience. For example, 85% of our federal loan customers are current. Still, some student loan borrowers do have more debt than they can reasonably afford. This is usually due to dropping out before they earn their degree, taking 6 years or more to complete their degree or paying more than the degree is worth.
At Navient, our practices are designed to assist struggling borrowers with solutions that keep them out of delinquency and default and instead drive repayment success. For short-term issues, payment deferral may be a good solution, while income-based solutions address longer-term challenges.
Paying down the loan balance is, however, the true objective. That's why we continue to recommend that federal policies should include programs to provide students with actionable information about the financial resources they will need to earn their degree on time and whether or not their degree supports that investment.
Many are surprised to learn that the average bachelor's degree recipient, who borrows for a 4-year degree, and not all do, leave school with less than $29,000 in loans. Furthermore, while a small percentage of undergraduate borrowers owe more than $60,000, defaults have far more likely to occur among those who borrow substantially lower amounts.
In addition, many are not aware that program-wide default rates and delinquency rates have fallen significantly since the end of the Great Recession. In fact, at year-end, our total delinquency rates, for both our federal and private portfolios, are at the lowest levels in over a decade. Finally, student loans are on the agenda of several regulatory agencies. While we continue to be responsive to the requests from regulators, we also work to demonstrate the effectiveness of our servicing practices and data-driven servicing solutions, while we used customer feedback to drive changes and how we lead efforts around industry best practices.
It's important to acknowledge here that for federal student loans, neither FFELP lenders nor Department of Education loan servicers set the price, school charges, the amount the student can borrow, the interest rate on the loan, the repayment terms nor a borrower's eligibility for any of over 40 alternative repayment and deferment options available to them. And we, like all federal loan servicers, must follow rules and regulations issued by the Department of Education.
Over the years, the federal student loan program has added numerous loan programs and repayment options. These programs often have very similar sounding names like income sensitive, income-based, pay as you earn and revised pay as you earn. We assist our customers in understanding the different options, so they can select the payment program that best fits their needs.
Still, the numerous options, unique terms, lengthy applications can all be overwhelming to borrowers. We continue to advocate for program simplicity as a way to meaningfully increase our -- increase customer participation.
Policies and programs should encourage borrowers to contact their servicers not overwhelm them, contact works and it should be encouraged. The regulatory focus on student loans have led some to believe that new regulations could significantly increase our cost to service our loans. We have a decades long track record of managing regulatory changes while simultaneously improving our operating efficiency. We were able to do this as a result of our expertise and scale and expect to be able to do so going forward.
For example, this year, we automated our processes for SCRA benefits and enrollment and reenrollment in income-driven repayment programs, including the new revised pay as you earn program. Both of these examples would otherwise be very labor-intensive tasks.
During 2015, our great team maintained our focus on our business and building value. I'm proud of our work and thankful for their commitment. For the year, we generated core cash earnings of $1.85, reduced outstanding unsecured debt by $2.3 billion, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reduced private credit charge-offs by $58 million or 8%, ending the year at the lowest delinquency rate since 2005, extended our business services with the acquisition of Gila and Xtend, we converted nearly $5 billion of FFELP loans to our servicing platform, we enrolled or reenrolled over 1 million borrowers into income-driven repayment programs, assisted 728,000 severely delinquent customers who are now current and finding a solution that help them avoid default and we improved our operating cost and efficiency.
For 2016, we're focused on realizing the value of our portfolio and leveraging our core skills to generate growing earnings from our student loan and nonstudent loan businesses. The current financial market conditions, however, will likely limit opportunities to purchase student loan portfolios in the near term.
While our net financing plans are modest in 2016, we do plan to issue FFELP and private asset-backed securities shortly and unsecured notes later this year. While Somsak will provide more details later in the presentation, we believe our business will generate core EPS between $1.82 and $1.87 per share in 2016.
Yesterday, our stock closed at $9.45 a share. I do not believe this is an accurate reflection of our value. It's not even close. In today's earnings presentation, we provide a summary of our expected future cash flows from our existing student loan portfolios. These cash flows are expected to exceed $31 billion before unsecured debt and operating expenses. The $31.7 billion in cash flow is also not discounted.
Several research analysts have estimated the net present value of these cash flows, including unsecured debt and including operating expense, that produce per-share estimates in the high-teens and low 20s. I agree with these estimates. I strongly agree with them.
Our focus for 2016 is to realize this value. We'll do so by focusing on maximizing our earnings and cash flow and by using excess capital to repurchase our shares, shares that are trading at a very deep discount. We intend to utilize the full $755 million available at January 1 under our share repurchase authority this year.
At today's prices, this would equate to buying over 20% of shares outstanding. Thank you for your interest and support. We're committed on delivering our enterprise value to our investors.
And I'll now turn the call over to Somsak for a more detailed review of the financials."

I'll be referencing",1130,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing the fourth quarter results, highlighting the recent financing activity and I'll provide additional detail behind the company's 2016 earnings guidance. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on the company's website. And let me start with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.49. These results exclude $0.01 per share or $7 million of regulatory-related costs during the quarter. Our full year 2015 core EPS was $1.85, excluding regulatory-related costs.
And our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $228 million versus $206 million a year ago. This increase is related to the additional costs resulting from the acquisition of Gila and Xtend Healthcare. And as Jack mentioned, we expect our full year 2016 core EPS to range between $1.82 and $1.87, and we expect our operating expenses to be under $930 million from 2016.
Both these items exclude the impact of any regulatory-related costs. The primary driver for the increase in operating expenses from 2015 will be the full year run rate for Xtend and Gila.
Excluding the operating expenses from the 2 companies, our 2016 projected core operating expenses would be 6% lower than 2015 levels.
Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $74 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
In the quarter, our FFELP NIM was at 84 basis points and we expect the full year 2016 FFELP NIM to remain in the low to mid-80s. Our FFELP NIM may be impacted by future LIBOR rates which will determine the amount of floor income in our portfolio. But since our -- since quarter end -- and since the quarter ended, we have hedged an additional $217 million of floor income, bringing the future hedge floor income total to over $1 billion.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loan segment results. Core earnings in this segment decreased $36 million from the year-ago quarter to $56 million. During the quarter, Navient sold $178 million of low coupon private education loans, which raised $157 million. The reduction in interest expense from paying down the debt and servicing fee income we retained had a net present value greater than the loss in the future expected spread income from this portfolio.
Our third quarter net interest margin came in at 3.61%. The private net interest margin continues to be impacted by the timing of when our prime-based earning assets reset versus our debt that is funded with LIBOR. As a result, we are forecasting the full year 2016 private student loan net interest margin to be in the mid-350's. At year-end, we have approximately $17 billion of prime earning assets funded by LIBOR lease -- index for LIBOR.
Slide 7 highlights our improving private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This is a portfolio that is well seasoned with 94% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments.
Our fourth quarter charge-offs came in at 2.3% or $33 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year. Our total delinquency rate of 7.2% at year-end is at the lowest rate that we've seen since 2005. And for 2016, we expect our annualized charge-off rate for the full year to be between 2.3% and 2.5%.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment results. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter compared with $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was related to an expected $8 million reduction in asset recovery revenues related to a legislative reduction that we highlighted in the third quarter, along with the decrease in education loan-related expenses -- revenues.
Our nonfederal student loan-related asset recovery revenues increased by $17 million [ph] for 2014 to $118 million for 2015. The increase in these revenues was primarily related to the additions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015, and we expect our full year 2016 business services revenues to range between $620 million and $650 million, and that revenue excludes any intercompany loan servicing revenues.
I would like to highlight the financing activities that took place in the fourth quarter on Slide 9. During the quarter, we issued $359 million private loan ABS, and this transaction was unique since it was the first of its kind from Navient with collateral consisting entirely of seasoned, performing nontraditional loans.
While the term nontraditional may have negative connotations, the assets in this field improved from the average FICO score of 625 at origination to a current score of 690. This demonstrates the positive impact that seasoning have on the credit quality of this portfolio.
Of the $2.1 billion of nontraditional loans in repayment or forbearance on our balance sheet, nearly 90% of these loans have made more than 12 payments. We also raised an additional $500 million in the quarter through a new 2-year private education loan repurchase facility. This is the first time they structured a facility to allow us to advance against the over collateralization associated with our private education loan securitization that have a Turbo repayment structure.
After this transaction, we have similar securitizations with $3.1 billion remaining at current OC levels and that's expected to grow to $4.5 billion at expected maturities.
During the quarter, our unsecured debt declined by $734 million to $15.2 billion outstanding at the year-end. Of the 300 -- of the $734 million reduction in unsecured debt, $691 million was achieved through repurchases, through tender offers and open market transactions. And then during the quarter, we repurchased 14.1 million shares or $170 million and announced an additional $700 million share repurchase authorization.
Since January 1, we have spent $55 million. And as of today, we have remaining authority of $700 million under our current share repurchase plan. Although this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and resulted in a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25x. We continued to reduce and smooth out our debt maturity profile to better match the cash flow generated by our asset management business.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded fourth quarter GAAP net income of $286 million or $0.79 per share, that's compared to net income of $263 million or $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM Bank.
I will now -- let's open up the call up for questions."

There will be some unique characteristics to this set.

Why are we not -- and the stock is somewhere between 6% and 7%, why don't we engage in accelerated repurchase and spend that $700 million now because we're seeing with the stock so far disjointed from the economic realities as you portray them and being in an uncertain environment in the market which creates this opportunity, it seems to me that we should really accelerate the repurchase program. We thought 23% was coming. And by the way, unless I'm missing something, if you bought back 23% of the company at, call it, $10 or $11 and you think the real value is in low 20s, than it creates significant value to remaining shares. So the value goes up not exponentially, but goes up quite significantly. So my question is, we paid prices of $20, $17 for so much stock, why don't we accelerate it? How dangerous is it? How risky is it to buy 11 months in advance today? I'm going to leave the operational questions to my partner, [indiscernible] who knows more about the business than me."

We do make them aware of the consequences that the delays are having in different financial markets and across our capital stack.

We have -- we don't benefit from any duration extension or get harmed by duration shortening. We don't -- there are no fees that are assessed to consumers. And our job is really to work with the customers according to the guidelines that the Department of Ed set for us, and within the fee structure that they pay us to help customers find solutions that make sense. And we've quoted this number more times than I can count, but our customers default at 38% lower rate than all other servicers combined. I mean, our view is helping customers stay out of default and no one works harder to collect a liability due to them than the federal government. Keeping them out of default is the best thing that we can do and it helps them minimize their expenses and the total cost of loan ownership and we excel at that."

But it really depends on what our -- how we can use it and how we can put that fund -- those funds to work. In the fourth quarter of last year, is a good example of what we did when we tapped into 2 new forms of financings for this company, securitizing our nontraditional loans and borrowing against the overcollateralization in some of our private credit ABS trust. Those transactions not only just demonstrate that we can actually tap funding off of our balance sheet, but more importantly do so at substantially lower rates than our unsecured debt costs as you just mentioned. So when we look at our funding alternatives, that's exactly what we do, we look at what the alternatives are and what the use of proceeds are and make decisions accordingly. I like the balance sheet as it sits today. I like our liquidity position. We're not in a position where we're being forced to issue -- to do things. Obviously, the ability to declare and get authorization for a $700 million share repurchase program speaks about the confidence in our cash flows and we plan to utilize it, as I said.

This is posted, along with the earnings press release on the Investors page at navient.com.
Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Jack."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today's call is particularly important. The financial markets have created pressure on both our debt and equity for racing significant value from investors.
This morning, I'll address the factors impacting our enterprise value, what we are doing to manage them and demonstrate why the intrinsic value of our company remains strong and intact.
Front and center for us, and I know many of you is our access to and cost of liquidity. The legal final maturity date topic has caused spreads to widen and trading to be limited in the FFELP ABS market. This, along with the disrupted high-yield market, has caused our unsecured debt spreads to widen.
Some investors have asked about our ability to continue to return excess capital to shareholders while meeting our unsecured debt maturities. Let me be perfectly clear, I am confident we can continue to do both, in fact, we have a plan to do so.
I'm confident because our $123 billion portfolio of student loans generates sizable and predictable cash flow. This cash flow totaled $3 billion in 2015 and is projected to be $2.7 billion in 2016. In addition, we have a very long track record of securing funding from the assets we own. For example, in the fourth quarter, we completed 2 new first-time financings for over $900 million, at a cost that was several hundred basis points inside of our unsecured debt spreads.
We used the proceeds to take advantage of market conditions and we repurchased $691 million of unsecured debt generating a gain of $21 million. We also confirmed our confidence in our cash flows with the new $700 million share repurchase program. And we used our authority. In 2015, we repurchased 56 million shares. And since January 1, we have acquired an additional 5.4 million shares. Combined, over 15% of shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015.
In 2015, we took a number of steps to address the legal final maturity topic. During the year, we amended 6 trusts to extend the maturity date, amended 16 different trusts to provide us with an additional 10% loan purchase option and we exercised cleanup calls on 12 ABS trusts, totaling $1.1 billion. Notably, these actions consumed little additional liquidity nor did they increase our costs.
We also provided extensive data to the rating agencies and investors to demonstrate the stability of federal student loan cash flows even under the unlikely deferred payments trust scenarios. While the rating agencies have yet to issue their final AAA criteria for FFELP ABS, we are confident they will be less stringent than their preliminary statements.
We also maintained significant liquidity for loan purchases if liquidity is most often in the form of limited purchase -- limited purpose structured debt facilities and we've used these facilities consistently for close to 20 years to support our loan acquisition activities, including the acquisition of loans from cleanup calls associated with our ABS trust.
These facilities provided the liquidity to purchase $3.7 billion in student loans and $1.1 billion in cleanup call acquisitions in 2015. The prepayment in default assumptions that drive our projected cash flows are based on our over 40 years of data and experience. Each year, the cash flows realized have closely matched our projections and we've been able to add to the expected future cash flows with servicing skills that reduce default rates, by capturing floor income and by purchasing student loan portfolios at appropriate prices.
This is not our first experience with difficult markets. Our long track record here demonstrates our deep understanding of our assets and our ability to confidently and creatively manage our liquidity and maximize our cash flows.
Headlines covering student loans have created storyline that lead one to believe that most student loan borrowers have an overwhelming debt burden that cannot be met. That's far from the typical experience. For example, 85% of our federal loan customers are current. Still, some student loan borrowers do have more debt than they can reasonably afford. This is usually due to dropping out before they earn their degree, taking 6 years or more to complete their degree or paying more than the degree is worth.
At Navient, our practices are designed to assist struggling borrowers with solutions that keep them out of delinquency and default and instead drive repayment success. For short-term issues, payment deferral may be a good solution, while income-based solutions address longer-term challenges.
Paying down the loan balance is, however, the true objective. That's why we continue to recommend that federal policies should include programs to provide students with actionable information about the financial resources they will need to earn their degree on time and whether or not their degree supports that investment.
Many are surprised to learn that the average bachelor's degree recipient, who borrows for a 4-year degree, and not all do, leave school with less than $29,000 in loans. Furthermore, while a small percentage of undergraduate borrowers owe more than $60,000, defaults have far more likely to occur among those who borrow substantially lower amounts.
In addition, many are not aware that program-wide default rates and delinquency rates have fallen significantly since the end of the Great Recession. In fact, at year-end, our total delinquency rates, for both our federal and private portfolios, are at the lowest levels in over a decade. Finally, student loans are on the agenda of several regulatory agencies. While we continue to be responsive to the requests from regulators, we also work to demonstrate the effectiveness of our servicing practices and data-driven servicing solutions, while we used customer feedback to drive changes and how we lead efforts around industry best practices.
It's important to acknowledge here that for federal student loans, neither FFELP lenders nor Department of Education loan servicers set the price, school charges, the amount the student can borrow, the interest rate on the loan, the repayment terms nor a borrower's eligibility for any of over 40 alternative repayment and deferment options available to them. And we, like all federal loan servicers, must follow rules and regulations issued by the Department of Education.
Over the years, the federal student loan program has added numerous loan programs and repayment options. These programs often have very similar sounding names like income sensitive, income-based, pay as you earn and revised pay as you earn. We assist our customers in understanding the different options, so they can select the payment program that best fits their needs.
Still, the numerous options, unique terms, lengthy applications can all be overwhelming to borrowers. We continue to advocate for program simplicity as a way to meaningfully increase our -- increase customer participation.
Policies and programs should encourage borrowers to contact their servicers not overwhelm them, contact works and it should be encouraged. The regulatory focus on student loans have led some to believe that new regulations could significantly increase our cost to service our loans. We have a decades long track record of managing regulatory changes while simultaneously improving our operating efficiency. We were able to do this as a result of our expertise and scale and expect to be able to do so going forward.
For example, this year, we automated our processes for SCRA benefits and enrollment and reenrollment in income-driven repayment programs, including the new revised pay as you earn program. Both of these examples would otherwise be very labor-intensive tasks.
During 2015, our great team maintained our focus on our business and building value. I'm proud of our work and thankful for their commitment. For the year, we generated core cash earnings of $1.85, reduced outstanding unsecured debt by $2.3 billion, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reduced private credit charge-offs by $58 million or 8%, ending the year at the lowest delinquency rate since 2005, extended our business services with the acquisition of Gila and Xtend, we converted nearly $5 billion of FFELP loans to our servicing platform, we enrolled or reenrolled over 1 million borrowers into income-driven repayment programs, assisted 728,000 severely delinquent customers who are now current and finding a solution that help them avoid default and we improved our operating cost and efficiency.
For 2016, we're focused on realizing the value of our portfolio and leveraging our core skills to generate growing earnings from our student loan and nonstudent loan businesses. The current financial market conditions, however, will likely limit opportunities to purchase student loan portfolios in the near term.
While our net financing plans are modest in 2016, we do plan to issue FFELP and private asset-backed securities shortly and unsecured notes later this year. While Somsak will provide more details later in the presentation, we believe our business will generate core EPS between $1.82 and $1.87 per share in 2016.
Yesterday, our stock closed at $9.45 a share. I do not believe this is an accurate reflection of our value. It's not even close. In today's earnings presentation, we provide a summary of our expected future cash flows from our existing student loan portfolios. These cash flows are expected to exceed $31 billion before unsecured debt and operating expenses. The $31.7 billion in cash flow is also not discounted.
Several research analysts have estimated the net present value of these cash flows, including unsecured debt and including operating expense, that produce per-share estimates in the high-teens and low 20s. I agree with these estimates. I strongly agree with them.
Our focus for 2016 is to realize this value. We'll do so by focusing on maximizing our earnings and cash flow and by using excess capital to repurchase our shares, shares that are trading at a very deep discount. We intend to utilize the full $755 million available at January 1 under our share repurchase authority this year.
At today's prices, this would equate to buying over 20% of shares outstanding. Thank you for your interest and support. We're committed on delivering our enterprise value to our investors.
And I'll now turn the call over to Somsak for a more detailed review of the financials."

During my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing the fourth quarter results, highlighting the recent financing activity and I'll provide additional detail behind the company's 2016 earnings guidance. I'll be referencing",1130,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing the fourth quarter results, highlighting the recent financing activity and I'll provide additional detail behind the company's 2016 earnings guidance. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on the company's website. And let me start with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.49. These results exclude $0.01 per share or $7 million of regulatory-related costs during the quarter. Our full year 2015 core EPS was $1.85, excluding regulatory-related costs.
And our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $228 million versus $206 million a year ago. This increase is related to the additional costs resulting from the acquisition of Gila and Xtend Healthcare. And as Jack mentioned, we expect our full year 2016 core EPS to range between $1.82 and $1.87, and we expect our operating expenses to be under $930 million from 2016.
Both these items exclude the impact of any regulatory-related costs. The primary driver for the increase in operating expenses from 2015 will be the full year run rate for Xtend and Gila.
Excluding the operating expenses from the 2 companies, our 2016 projected core operating expenses would be 6% lower than 2015 levels.
Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $74 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
In the quarter, our FFELP NIM was at 84 basis points and we expect the full year 2016 FFELP NIM to remain in the low to mid-80s. Our FFELP NIM may be impacted by future LIBOR rates which will determine the amount of floor income in our portfolio. But since our -- since quarter end -- and since the quarter ended, we have hedged an additional $217 million of floor income, bringing the future hedge floor income total to over $1 billion.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loan segment results. Core earnings in this segment decreased $36 million from the year-ago quarter to $56 million. During the quarter, Navient sold $178 million of low coupon private education loans, which raised $157 million. The reduction in interest expense from paying down the debt and servicing fee income we retained had a net present value greater than the loss in the future expected spread income from this portfolio.
Our third quarter net interest margin came in at 3.61%. The private net interest margin continues to be impacted by the timing of when our prime-based earning assets reset versus our debt that is funded with LIBOR. As a result, we are forecasting the full year 2016 private student loan net interest margin to be in the mid-350's. At year-end, we have approximately $17 billion of prime earning assets funded by LIBOR lease -- index for LIBOR.
Slide 7 highlights our improving private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This is a portfolio that is well seasoned with 94% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments.
Our fourth quarter charge-offs came in at 2.3% or $33 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year. Our total delinquency rate of 7.2% at year-end is at the lowest rate that we've seen since 2005. And for 2016, we expect our annualized charge-off rate for the full year to be between 2.3% and 2.5%.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment results. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter compared with $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was related to an expected $8 million reduction in asset recovery revenues related to a legislative reduction that we highlighted in the third quarter, along with the decrease in education loan-related expenses -- revenues.
Our nonfederal student loan-related asset recovery revenues increased by $17 million [ph] for 2014 to $118 million for 2015. The increase in these revenues was primarily related to the additions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015, and we expect our full year 2016 business services revenues to range between $620 million and $650 million, and that revenue excludes any intercompany loan servicing revenues.
I would like to highlight the financing activities that took place in the fourth quarter on Slide 9. During the quarter, we issued $359 million private loan ABS, and this transaction was unique since it was the first of its kind from Navient with collateral consisting entirely of seasoned, performing nontraditional loans.
While the term nontraditional may have negative connotations, the assets in this field improved from the average FICO score of 625 at origination to a current score of 690. This demonstrates the positive impact that seasoning have on the credit quality of this portfolio.
Of the $2.1 billion of nontraditional loans in repayment or forbearance on our balance sheet, nearly 90% of these loans have made more than 12 payments. We also raised an additional $500 million in the quarter through a new 2-year private education loan repurchase facility. This is the first time they structured a facility to allow us to advance against the over collateralization associated with our private education loan securitization that have a Turbo repayment structure.
After this transaction, we have similar securitizations with $3.1 billion remaining at current OC levels and that's expected to grow to $4.5 billion at expected maturities.
During the quarter, our unsecured debt declined by $734 million to $15.2 billion outstanding at the year-end. Of the 300 -- of the $734 million reduction in unsecured debt, $691 million was achieved through repurchases, through tender offers and open market transactions. And then during the quarter, we repurchased 14.1 million shares or $170 million and announced an additional $700 million share repurchase authorization.
Since January 1, we have spent $55 million. And as of today, we have remaining authority of $700 million under our current share repurchase plan. Although this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and resulted in a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25x. We continued to reduce and smooth out our debt maturity profile to better match the cash flow generated by our asset management business.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded fourth quarter GAAP net income of $286 million or $0.79 per share, that's compared to net income of $263 million or $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM Bank.
I will now -- let's open up the call up for questions."

There will be some unique characteristics to this set.

I'm going to give you credit for knowing more about your business and its value than myself, given its complications and actually my confidence in management. I think you guys are doing a fine job and you keep us informed. But I want to verify some numbers and better understand the motivation for the buyback. I think you've given all the answers. You said that the net present value in the high-teens, low 20s, you strongly agree, et cetera. This is my observation, in 2014, you spent $600 million to buy 30.4 million shares, you paid $19.70. In 2015, you spent $945 million on 56 million shares at $16.88. On 12/31/2015, you said you had $755 million left, you bought $55 million worth of stock, 5.4 million shares, you paid $10.19 so far this year. And you have left $700 million, which I believe is roughly 23% of the market capital of the company. Why are we not -- and the stock is somewhere between 6% and 7%, why don't we engage in accelerated repurchase and spend that $700 million now because we're seeing with the stock so far disjointed from the economic realities as you portray them and being in an uncertain environment in the market which creates this opportunity, it seems to me that we should really accelerate the repurchase program. We thought 23% was coming. And by the way, unless I'm missing something, if you bought back 23% of the company at, call it, $10 or $11 and you think the real value is in low 20s, than it creates significant value to remaining shares. So the value goes up not exponentially, but goes up quite significantly. So my question is, we paid prices of $20, $17 for so much stock, why don't we accelerate it? How dangerous is it? How risky is it to buy 11 months in advance today? I'm going to leave the operational questions to my partner, [indiscernible] who knows more about the business than me."

We do make them aware of the consequences that the delays are having in different financial markets and across our capital stack.

We have -- we don't benefit from any duration extension or get harmed by duration shortening. We don't -- there are no fees that are assessed to consumers. And our job is really to work with the customers according to the guidelines that the Department of Ed set for us, and within the fee structure that they pay us to help customers find solutions that make sense. And we've quoted this number more times than I can count, but our customers default at 38% lower rate than all other servicers combined. I mean, our view is helping customers stay out of default and no one works harder to collect a liability due to them than the federal government. Keeping them out of default is the best thing that we can do and it helps them minimize their expenses and the total cost of loan ownership and we excel at that."

But it really depends on what our -- how we can use it and how we can put that fund -- those funds to work. In the fourth quarter of last year, is a good example of what we did when we tapped into 2 new forms of financings for this company, securitizing our nontraditional loans and borrowing against the overcollateralization in some of our private credit ABS trust. Those transactions not only just demonstrate that we can actually tap funding off of our balance sheet, but more importantly do so at substantially lower rates than our unsecured debt costs as you just mentioned. So when we look at our funding alternatives, that's exactly what we do, we look at what the alternatives are and what the use of proceeds are and make decisions accordingly. I like the balance sheet as it sits today. I like our liquidity position. We're not in a position where we're being forced to issue -- to do things. Obviously, the ability to declare and get authorization for a $700 million share repurchase program speaks about the confidence in our cash flows and we plan to utilize it, as I said.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today's call is particularly important. The financial markets have created pressure on both our debt and equity erasing significant value from investors.
This morning, I'll address the factors impacting our enterprise value, what we are doing to manage them and demonstrate why the intrinsic value of our company remains strong and intact.
Front and center for us, and I know many of you, is our access to and cost of liquidity. The legal final maturity date topic has caused spreads to widen and trading to be limited in the FFELP ABS market. This, along with the disrupted high-yield market, has caused our unsecured debt spreads to widen.
Some investors have asked about our ability to continue to return excess capital to shareholders while meeting our unsecured debt maturities. Let me be perfectly clear, I am confident we can continue to do both, in fact, we have a plan to do so.
I'm confident because our $123 billion portfolio of student loans generates sizable and predictable cash flow. This cash flow totaled $3 billion in 2015 and is projected to be $2.7 billion in 2016. In addition, we have a very long track record of securing funding from the assets we own. For example, in the fourth quarter, we completed 2 new first-time financings for over $900 million, at a cost that was several hundred basis points inside of our unsecured debt spreads.
We used the proceeds to take advantage of market conditions and we repurchased $691 million of unsecured debt generating a gain of $21 million. We also confirmed our confidence in our cash flows with the new $700 million share repurchase program. And we used our authority. In 2015, we repurchased 56 million shares. And since January 1, we have acquired an additional 5.4 million shares. Combined, over 15% of shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015.
In 2015, we took a number of steps to address the legal final maturity topic. During the year, we amended 6 trusts to extend the maturity date, amended 16 different trusts to provide us with an additional 10% loan purchase option and we exercised cleanup calls on 12 ABS trusts, totaling $1.1 billion. Notably, these actions consumed little additional liquidity nor did they increase our costs.
We also provided extensive data to the rating agencies and investors to demonstrate the stability of federal student loan cash flows even under the unlikely deferred payments trust scenarios. While the rating agencies have yet to issue their final AAA criteria for FFELP ABS, we are confident they will be less stringent than their preliminary statements.
We also maintained significant liquidity for loan purchases if liquidity is most often in the form of limited purchase -- limited purpose structured debt facilities and we've used these facilities consistently for close to 20 years to support our loan acquisition activities, including the acquisition of loans from cleanup calls associated with our ABS trust.
These facilities provided the liquidity to purchase $3.7 billion in student loans and $1.1 billion in cleanup call acquisitions in 2015. The prepayment in default assumptions that drive our projected cash flows are based on our over 40 years of data and experience. Each year, the cash flows realized have closely matched our projections and we've been able to add to the expected future cash flows with servicing skills that reduce default rates, by capturing floor income and by purchasing student loan portfolios at appropriate prices.
This is not our first experience with difficult markets. Our long track record here demonstrates our deep understanding of our assets and our ability to confidently and creatively manage our liquidity and maximize our cash flows.
Headlines covering student loans have created storyline that lead one to believe that most student loan borrowers have an overwhelming debt burden that cannot be met. That's far from the typical experience. For example, 85% of our federal loan customers are current. Still, some student loan borrowers do have more debt than they can reasonably afford. This is usually due to dropping out before they earn their degree, taking 6 years or more to complete their degree or paying more than the degree is worth.
At Navient, our practices are designed to assist struggling borrowers with solutions that keep them out of delinquency and default and instead drive repayment success. For short-term issues, payment deferral may be a good solution, while income-based solutions address longer-term challenges.
Paying down the loan balance is, however, the true objective. That's why we continue to recommend that federal policies should include programs to provide students with actionable information about the financial resources they will need to earn their degree on time and whether or not their degree supports that investment.
Many are surprised to learn that the average bachelor's degree recipient, who borrows for a 4-year degree, and not all do, leave school with less than $29,000 in loans. Furthermore, while a small percentage of undergraduate borrowers owe more than $60,000, defaults are far more likely to occur among those who borrow substantially lower amounts.
In addition, many are not aware that program-wide default rates and delinquency rates have fallen significantly since the end of the Great Recession. In fact, at year-end, our total delinquency rates, for both our federal and private portfolios, are at the lowest levels in over a decade. Finally, student loans are on the agenda of several regulatory agencies. While we continue to be responsive to the requests from regulators, we also work to demonstrate the effectiveness of our servicing practices and data-driven servicing solutions, that we used customer feedback to drive changes and how we lead efforts around industry best practices.
It's important to acknowledge here that for federal student loans, neither FFELP lenders nor Department of Education loan servicers set the price, school charges, the amount the student can borrow, the interest rate on the loan, the repayment terms nor a borrower's eligibility for any of the over 40 alternative repayment and deferment options available to them. And we, like all federal loan servicers, must follow rules and regulations issued by the Department of Education.
Over the years, the federal student loan program has added numerous loan programs and repayment options. These programs often have very similar sounding names like income sensitive, income-based, pay as you earn and revised pay as you earn. We assist our customers in understanding the different options, so they can select the payment program that best fits their needs.
Still, the numerous options, unique terms, lengthy applications can all be overwhelming to borrowers. We continue to advocate for program simplicity as a way to meaningfully increase our -- increase customer participation.
Policies and programs should encourage borrowers to contact their servicers not overwhelm them, contact works and it should be encouraged. The regulatory focus on student loans has led some to believe that new regulations could significantly increase our cost to service our loans. We have a decades long track record of managing regulatory changes while simultaneously improving our operating efficiency. We were able to do this as a result of our expertise and scale and expect to be able to do so going forward.
For example, this year, we automated our processes for SCRA benefits and enrollment and reenrollment in income-driven repayment programs, including the new revised pay as you earn program. Both of these examples would otherwise be very labor-intensive tasks.
During 2015, our great team maintained our focus on our business and building value. I'm proud of our work and thankful for their commitment. For the year, we generated core cash earnings of $1.85, reduced outstanding unsecured debt by $2.3 billion, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reduced private credit charge-offs by $58 million or 8%, ending the year at the lowest delinquency rate since 2005, extended our business services with the acquisition of Gila and Xtend, we converted nearly $5 billion of FFELP loans to our servicing platform, we enrolled or reenrolled over 1 million borrowers into income-driven repayment programs, assisted 728,000 severely delinquent customers who are now current and finding a solution that help them avoid default and we improved our operating cost and efficiency.
For 2016, we're focused on realizing the value of our portfolio and leveraging our core skills to generate growing earnings from our student loan and nonstudent loan businesses. The current financial market conditions, however, will likely limit opportunities to purchase student loan portfolios in the near term.
While our net financing plans are modest in 2016, we do plan to issue FFELP and private asset-backed securities shortly and unsecured notes later this year. While Somsak will provide more details later in the presentation, we believe our business will generate core EPS between $1.82 and $1.87 per share in 2016.
Yesterday, our stock closed at $9.45 a share. I do not believe this is an accurate reflection of our value. It's not even close. In today's earnings presentation, we provide a summary of our expected future cash flows from our existing student loan portfolios. These cash flows are expected to exceed $31 billion before unsecured debt and operating expenses. The $31.7 billion in cash flow is also not discounted.
Several research analysts have estimated the net present value of these cash flows, including unsecured debt and including operating expense, that produce per-share estimates in the high-teens and low 20s. I agree with these estimates. I strongly agree with them.
Our focus for 2016 is to realize this value. We'll do so by focusing on maximizing our earnings and cash flow and by using excess capital to repurchase our shares, shares that are trading at a very deep discount. We intend to utilize the full $755 million available at January 1 under our share repurchase authority this year. At today's prices, this would equate to buying over 20% of shares outstanding. 
Thank you for your interest and support. We're committed on delivering our enterprise value to our investors.
And I'll now turn the call over to Somsak for a more detailed review of the financials."
260005529,321490314,927566,"Navient Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Navient Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing the fourth quarter results, highlighting the recent financing activity and I'll provide additional detail behind the company's 2016 earnings guidance.

During my prepared remarks, I'll be addressing the fourth quarter results, highlighting the recent financing activity and I'll provide additional detail behind the company's 2016 earnings guidance. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on the company's website. And let me start with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.49. These results exclude $0.01 per share or $7 million of regulatory-related costs during the quarter. Our full year 2015 core EPS was $1.85, excluding regulatory-related costs.
And our fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $228 million versus $206 million a year ago. This increase is related to the additional costs resulting from the acquisition of Gila and Xtend Healthcare. And as Jack mentioned, we expect our full year 2016 core EPS to range between $1.82 and $1.87, and we expect our operating expenses to be under $930 million from 2016.
Both these items exclude the impact of any regulatory-related costs. The primary driver for the increase in operating expenses from 2015 will be the full year run rate for Xtend and Gila.
Excluding the operating expenses from the 2 companies, our 2016 projected core operating expenses would be 6% lower than 2015 levels.
Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $74 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
In the quarter, our FFELP NIM was at 84 basis points and we expect the full year 2016 FFELP NIM to remain in the low to mid-80s. Our FFELP NIM may be impacted by future LIBOR rates which will determine the amount of floor income in our portfolio. But since our -- since quarter end -- and since the quarter ended, we have hedged an additional $217 million of floor income, bringing the future hedge floor income total to over $1 billion.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loans segment results. Core earnings in this segment decreased $36 million from the year-ago quarter to $56 million. During the quarter, Navient sold $178 million of low coupon private education loans, which raised $157 million. The reduction in interest expense from paying down the debt and servicing fee income we retained had a net present value greater than the loss in the future expected spread income from this portfolio.
Our third quarter net interest margin came in at 3.61%. The private net interest margin continues to be impacted by the timing of when our prime-based earning assets reset versus our debt that is funded with LIBOR. As a result, we are forecasting the full year 2016 private student loan net interest margin to be in the mid-350's. At year-end, we have approximately $17 billion of prime earning assets funded by LIBOR lease -- index for LIBOR.
Slide 7 highlights our improving private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This is a portfolio that is well seasoned with 94% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments.
Our fourth quarter charge-offs came in at 2.3% or $33 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year. Our total delinquency rate of 7.2% at year-end is at the lowest rate that we've seen since 2005. And for 2016, we expect our annualized charge-off rate for the full year to be between 2.3% and 2.5%.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment results. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter compared with $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was related to an expected $8 million reduction in asset recovery revenues related to a legislative reduction that we highlighted in the third quarter, along with a decrease in education loan-related expenses -- revenues.
Our nonfederal student loan-related asset recovery revenues increased by $70 million [ph] for 2014 to $118 million for 2015. The increase in these revenues was primarily related to the additions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015, and we expect our full year 2016 business services revenues to range between $620 million and $650 million, and that revenue excludes any intercompany loan servicing revenues.
I would like to highlight the financing activities that took place in the fourth quarter on Slide 9. During the quarter, we issued $359 million private loan ABS, and this transaction was unique since it was the first of its kind from Navient with collateral consisting entirely of seasoned, performing nontraditional loans.
While the term nontraditional may have negative connotations, the assets in this field improved from the average FICO score of 625 at origination to a current score of 690. This demonstrates the positive impact that seasoning had on the credit quality of this portfolio.
Of the $2.1 billion of nontraditional loans in repayment or forbearance on our balance sheet, nearly 90% of these loans have made more than 12 payments. We also raised an additional $500 million in the quarter through a new 2-year private education loan repurchase facility. This is the first time they structured a facility to allow us to advance against the over collateralization associated with our private education loan securitization that have a turbo repayment structure.
After this transaction, we have similar securitizations with $3.1 billion remaining at current OC levels and that's expected to grow to $4.5 billion at expected maturities.
During the quarter, our unsecured debt declined by $734 million to $15.2 billion outstanding at the year-end. Of the 300 -- of the $734 million reduction in unsecured debt, $691 million was achieved through repurchases, through tender offers and open market transactions. And then during the quarter, we repurchased 14.1 million shares or $170 million and announced an additional $700 million share repurchase authorization.
Since January 1, we have spent $55 million. And as of today, we have remaining authority of $700 million under our current share repurchase plan. Although this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and resulted in a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25x, we continued to reduce and smooth out our debt maturity profile to better match the cash flow generated by our asset management business.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded fourth quarter GAAP net income of $286 million or $0.79 per share, that's compared to net income of $263 million or $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM Bank.
I will now -- let's open up the call up for questions."

There will be some unique characteristics to this set.

I'm going to give you credit for knowing more about your business and its value than myself, given the complications and actually my confidence in management. I think you guys are doing a fine job and you keep us informed. But I want to verify some numbers and better understand the motivation for the buyback. I think you've given all the answers. You said that the net present value in the high-teens, low 20s, you strongly agree, et cetera. This is my observation, in 2014, you spent $600 million to buy 30.4 million shares, you paid $19.70. In 2015, you spent $945 million on 56 million shares at $16.88. On 12/31/2015, you said you had $755 million left, you bought $55 million worth of stock, 5.4 million shares, you paid $10.19 so far this year. And you have left $700 million, which I believe is roughly 23% of the market capital of the company. Why are we not -- and the stock is somewhere between 6% and 7%, why don't we engage in accelerated repurchase and spend that $700 million now because we're seeing with the stock so far disjointed from the economic realities as you portray them and being in an uncertain environment in the market which creates this opportunity, it seems to me that we should really accelerate the repurchase program, retire 23% of the company. And by the way, unless I'm missing something, if you bought back 23% of the company at, call it, $10 or $11 and you think the real value is in low 20s, than it creates significant value to remaining shares. So the value goes up not exponentially, but goes up quite significantly. So my question is, we paid prices of $20, $17 for so much stock, why don't we accelerate it? How dangerous is it? How risky is it to buy 11 months in advance today? I'm going to leave the operational questions to my partner, Mahmood, who knows more about the business than me."

We are being aggressive on our share repurchase programs. And as we begin the process here after the earnings call, I think you'll see us be more aggressive than we were in the first month of the year to acquire those shares. We are -- if you look at the daily trading volume, we are already through the first month of the year, acquiring roughly a little over 10% of trading volume. So we've been fairly active to begin with and to the extent that we can accelerate those and capture today's prices, which we totally agree are far, far below the net present value or the intrinsic value of the company, we should -- we will continue to do so."

You can just see that there's a fair amount of complexity here. I do think we made some excellent progress with both Moody's and Fitch on this topic, helping to provide the data that they need to -- that can drive assumptions or stress scenarios that can at least theoretically happen instead of impossible to happen, and we are continuing to work with them. We do make them aware of the consequences that the delays are having in the financial markets and across our capital stack. And they assure us they are aware of them and working hard to get this resolved as quickly as possible. But as I said in my comments, our plan to come to market now ahead of a likely decision -- final decision from the agencies is really a reflection that we need to -- we just can't wait forever for the process to unfold here.

For Department of Education loans, I mean a lot of the typical consumer arguments is that someone is doing something that generates more interest or fees or whatever for the lender or in the Department of Education loan servicing side. We have -- we don't benefit from any duration extension or get harmed by duration shortening. We don't -- there are no fees that are assessed to consumers. And our job is really to work with the customers according to the guidelines that the Department of Ed set for us, and within the fee structure that they pay us, to help customers find solutions that make sense. And we've quoted this number more times than I can count, but our customers default at 38% lower rate than all other servicers combined. I mean, our view is helping customers stay out of default and no one works harder to collect a liability due to them than the federal government. Keeping them out of default is the best thing that we can do and it helps them minimize their expenses and the total cost of loan ownership and we excel at that."

But it really depends on what our -- how we can use it and how we can put that fund -- those funds to work. In the fourth quarter of last year, is a good example of what we did when we tapped into 2 new forms of financings for this company, securitizing our nontraditional loans and borrowing against the overcollateralization in some of our private credit ABS trust. Those transactions not only just demonstrate that we can actually tap funding off of our balance sheet, but more importantly do so at substantially lower rates than our unsecured debt costs as you just mentioned. So when we look at our funding alternatives, that's exactly what we do, we look at what the alternatives are and what the use of proceeds are and make decisions accordingly. I like the balance sheet as it sits today. I like our liquidity position. We're not in a position where we're being forced to issue -- to do things. Obviously, the ability to declare and get authorization for a $700 million share repurchase program speaks about the confidence in our cash flows and we plan to utilize it, as I said.

Our results for the first quarter are consistent with our plans. We earned an adjusted $0.44 in core earnings per share, with student loan margins and operating expenses in line with expectations. Credit was a bright spot this quarter, and I will touch on this topic a bit more in a moment.
During the quarter, we continued to focus on several key areas: Improving our access to and the cost of funding, delivering value to our customers and clients, capturing new business opportunities, improving our operating efficiency and growing the value of our company.
While the work in these areas is never complete, I'm pleased with our efforts, execution and results this quarter. We've been working on a number of fronts to address our access to funding and specifically, funding for our government guaranteed FFELP assets. As you know, Moody's and Fitch have been reviewing their criteria for rating terms FFELP asset-backed loans. Unfortunately, to date, they have not issued any updated guidance.
While we currently believe that the final criteria will be more favorable than the initial draft proposals, we decided not to wait any longer to restart our FFELP ABS program. We completed our first FFELP ABS transaction in the first quarter, followed earlier this month with the second sale. Combined, we have now issued $1.6 billion in FFELP ABS bond, investor reception was good and more importantly, even stronger in the second deal.
We also completed an extension of our FFELP conduit facility, pushing the maturity date out 1 year to 2018. This facility was also scheduled to decline to $7 billion in size.
Given the potential for FFELP portfolio purchases, we increased the size to $7.5 billion. And extending this facility and returning to the FFELP ABS market, demonstrate the high quality of the FFELP portfolio in the confidence of lenders and investors in our securities.
We are also addressing the potential rating agency impacts on outstanding bonds. As of today, we have extended the legal final maturity date on $4.8 billion in bonds. While we believe the assumptions used to determine the new maturity date of these extensions are unnecessarily long, or said differently, we certainly expect the loans to pay off prior to the new maturity dates. We have worked with bondholders to extend the maturity date of their bonds in order to protect the value of their investment.
Also on the financing front, we completed a private loan securitization in the first quarter. And last week, we completed our second private credit residual financing. Combined, these transactions raised over $525 million in free cash. The proceeds will be used to further reduce our unsecured debt. Combined, our steady and significant financing activity ensures that we have ample liquidity to run our business, pursue portfolio acquisitions and increase the intrinsic value for shareholders.
As we all know, it's an election year, so student loan performance and indebtedness continues to be a regular political and media topic. The data reported here is often misleading, confusing and driven by anecdotes instead of facts. For example, it was recently reported that few student loan borrowers are making payments on their loans. The calculation here is complicated by the ways the program reports outstanding balances.
Unique to the federal loan program is that cumulative defaults are included in delinquency and repayment statistics since there's no charge-off for bad debt used by the federal government. This would be fine if the statistics also included the balances that were paid down, but they do not. As a result, borrowers who successfully repaid their loans are excluded from the analysis.
For the record, the loans we own our customers are successfully making payments on their loans, having made over $3.6 billion in payments to principal in the first quarter. What we see from over 12 million customers, with over $300 billion in balances, is continued improvement in credit performance.
For our private loans, our 90-plus delinquency rate fell to 3.2% in March 31, down from 3.6% a year ago. And importantly, the dollar balance of loans over 90 days is past due declined over 20% from a year ago to $749 million. The charge-off rate also improved, declining 17% from the year-ago quarter to 2.4%. And the performance this quarter, and the reductions in the delinquent dollar balances at quarter end, are positive signs for the remainder of the year.
We continued to work to capture new business opportunities. During the quarter, we acquired $1.5 billion in FFELP Loans. We're beginning to see signs that opportunities to purchase additional student loan portfolios will increase.
Our processing business in the municipal and healthcare areas is also growing nicely. For example, we recently won a new multiyear contract in New Jersey as well as new contracts in Arizona, Pennsylvania, California and Mississippi, to name a few. And we expanded our healthcare receivable services to new hospitals in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Wisconsin.
This month, the Department of Education issued an ARP for a single servicing platform. The request for proposal is to provide a servicing platform not loan services. Our existing servicing contract extends into 2019. Our team here is actively engage in evaluating the opportunity with respect to the system ARP.
Like most financial services entities, we're working to continuously improve our operating efficiency and we have several initiatives underway to accelerate our pace here. We plan to exit 2016 with a lower run rate operating expense level and where we are today. This is another example of our efforts to add value for our clients and other stakeholders.
During the quarter, we purchased 19.2 million shares at an average price of $10.43, a level significantly below what we see at the intrinsic value of the company. Capturing the opportunity here allows us to increase the intrinsic value per share to non-selling shareholders.
Our stock price is up significantly from its lower earlier this year. Still, it does not reflect the full value of the company as we see it. Our focus on funding, capturing new business opportunities, improving operating efficiencies and taking advantage of a mispriced market has allowed us to add value. We'll continue this focus and execution going forward.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Somsak for a deeper look at our financials, and I look forward to taking your questions later. Sak?"

During my prepared remarks, I'll review the first quarter results before highlighting the recent financing activities that took place. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available on the company's webs",1241,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll review the first quarter results before highlighting the recent financing activities that took place. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available on the company's website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the first quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.44, which excludes regulatory-related costs during the quarter. Our first quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $243 million versus $230 million a year ago. The increase in these expenses is related to the additional costs resulting from the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare.
Excluding the expenses associated with these acquisitions, operating expenses were lower -- 6% lower than a year ago. Let's turn to Slide 5, and discuss our FFELP segment results. In the quarter, we acquired $1.5 billion of FFELP student loans. While many major holders continued to wait for the resolution from the rating agencies related to the legal final maturities, we are beginning to see renewed interest in portfolio sales as well as FFELP ABS transactions.
FFELP core earnings were $66 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared with $85 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFELP core earnings was primarily a result of the lower FFELP balance compared to the prior year and a net interest margin of 81 basis points, which was in line with our expectations.
The FFELP net interest margin declined from the fourth quarter, due mainly to the seasonal impact of [indiscernible] that occurred during the first quarter of each year.
During the quarter, we did hedge an additional $295 million of floor income, bringing future hedge floor income to $1 billion. We're also seeing improving credit trends in our FFELP portfolio, as demonstrated by the 17% improvement in our 90-day delinquency rate.
Let's now turn to Slide 6, for a review of our private education loan segment. Core earnings in this segment decreased $16 million in the year-ago quarter to $61 million. The decline is primarily the result of the declining balance in our private education loan portfolio and lower net interest margin. The decline in NIM is partially offset by the $16 million reduction in our loan loss provision. This reduction came as a result of the improved credit performance that we continued to see in our delinquency forbearance and charge-off rates. Charge-offs declined $46 million or 24% from the prior year.
The improved performance demonstrates the power of seasoning that we have seen in our portfolio. Slide 7 highlights some of those improvements in our private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This portfolio is well-seasoned, with 95% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. Our first quarter charge-offs came in at 2.4% and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.2%.
The chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits of improved performance of having borrower's FICO scores. The nontraditional loans that we have in our portfolio today have improved their FICO scores by 35 points on average over the last 5 years. Today, these loans are nontraditional and we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this segment of the portfolio.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $75 million in the quarter compared with $86 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the expected decline in education related revenues.
Our nonfederal student loan related asset recovery revenues increased by $30 million from the year-ago quarter to $51 million. The increase in these revenues was primarily related to the addition of Gila and Xtend Healthcare 2015.
As Jack noted, we have been leveraging our skills and platform to grow our nonfederal student loan related businesses steadily over the last few quarters, and we continued to win additional contracts in this space.
On Slide 9, I'd like to highlight our recent financing activities that we completed so far in 2016. In the past 2 months, we have issued over $1.6 billion of FFELP asset-backed securities. A $1.1 billion 2016  -- 1 transaction that took place in the first quarter was the largest FFELP securitization in over 2 years. This transaction was done in conjunction with the loan acquisition from a third-party and was unique because we did not utilize any funding capacity for this transaction.
Last week, we cofounded an additional $497 million FFELP securitization. This was the first broadly marketed FFELP transaction since June of last year. And this securitization was met by strong investment demand and included over 18 unique investors receiving allocation.
This [indiscernible] securities priced at 1 month LIBOR plus 138 basis points, with a weighted average life of 5.2 years. the [indiscernible] rating agencies concerned, both these transactions with long legal final maturity date and is baked specific [indiscernible] feature.
While we continued to wait for Moody's and Fitch to provide final ratings methodology, we've been actively extending the legal final maturity dates on various trusts. Just on Monday, we announced the maturity extension on $1.2 billion of bonds. And since December 2015, we have now extended the legal final maturity date on $4.8 billion of bonds.
As Jack mentioned earlier, we also increased and extended our FFELP ABCP facility. This facility's revolving period was extended to March 2018. And maximum financing, which was originally scheduled for step down $7 billion, was increased to $7.5 billion. Facility extension and funding costs were consistent with our plan.
Not all of our activity was related to FFELP during the quarter. We also issued a $488 million private education loan ABS in January. In the AAA portion of this transaction, priced at 1 month LIBOR plus 231 basis points, with a 4.9 year weighted average life. 
On April 15, we added 3 trusts to our existing private education loan repurchase facility, providing an additional $478 million of financing. This facility allows us to borrow against private student loan over quantization and those securitization that is full repayment [indiscernible]. The first week from this transaction will be used to pay down our unsecured debt.
On that front, our unsecured debt declined by $1 billion in the quarter to $14.2 billion outstanding at quarter end. And I'll note, that over the last 15 months, we have reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by $3.3 billion or 19%. 
So as you can see, we remained focused on reducing the total amount of unsecured debt outstanding and smoothing out the maturity profile that are predictable cash flows from [indiscernible] education loan portfolio.
In the quarter, we had repurchased 19.2 million shares for $200 million, at an average price of $10.42. In the quarter end, we have a remaining authority of $555 million under our share repurchase authority. All of these activity was undertaking, while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25x.
Finally, turning to GAAP results, on Slide 10. We recorded first quarter GAAP net income of $181 million or $0.53 per share, and that's compared with net income of $292 million or $0.72 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the months related to our positions, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM bank fund.
That concludes my remarks, and we'll open now the call to questions."

It's -- we're clearly disappointed in terms of the amount of time it's taking to get to a resolution. You know the challenge here is the cash flow aspects of the federal student loans are fairly complex, there's over 56 different repayment options available to borrowers, including, I think, 9 income driven repayment solutions alone. And what we have seen historically is that while borrowers can, in fact, take advantage of multiple opportunities in some form of sequential fashion, that's actually not how the practice actually unfolds. And so I think the struggle has been what the customer -- what customers are eligible to do versus what they really do. And what we're seeing on the FFELP side of the equation as we see in our private loan is that as the portfolios season, borrowers grow, income their actual income and their income potential grows, and delinquencies fall and repayments increase. So we're looking to get the rating agencies to work with the rating agencies to get this issue resolved as quickly as possible. As we said in our comments, at this point, we decided to not wait for those resolutions and return to the FFELP ABS market. On the regulatory front, we continued to have ongoing dialogue with the entities. I think a lot of the issues and items are related to how borrowers access and understands the different programs that are available to them. We are a firm believer that the program turns and options are too many and too complex. But at the end of the day, we know that went 9 times out of 10, when we reach a delinquent customer, we're able to explain those options to them and get them into repayment plan that keeps them out of default. Our biggest challenge in preventing defaults and helping people enroll income driven programs is contact with the customer. Over 90% of the loans, federal loans that we service that do end up in default, and we are at a much smaller rate than all other servicers, not those customers do not respond to the extensive efforts that we make to reach them. And as you know, we can't help a delinquent customer take advantage of the opportunities that are available to them if we can't reach them."

We are confident based on the pavement activity that we see of our behavior that those maturity dates -- those legal final maturity dates are well in excess of what's required. The deals that we acquired, the portfolios, the 1.5 billion of FFELP loans that we acquired this quarter, reflect current spreads and funding cost and term ABS.

I think the big opportunity for us is we don't need to borrow funds to grow our liability these, which is smooth out our unsecured debt maturities. To the extent that spreads are unattractive, we just changes the timing of certain new cash flow distributions but it doesn't change the aggregate story. When we look at the financing transactions that we have done, particularly these private credit residual financing, those cost of funds are several hundreds of basis points inside where our unsecured debt levels trade in, and that's kind of the trade-offs we look at this, what's the opportunity between different alternatives there. Frankly, our biggest challenge right now is the -- is I think tells the story a little bit of where we see unsecured spreads going is buying unsecured debt in the open market. Our investors are telling us they're very happy with what they hold and not looking to sell. And that is the biggest challenge, but it also tells you that where the direction went where you go in spreads here."

In fact, our ability to buy back 19.2 million shares at $10.42 actually increases that value for our remaining shareholders. And that's the type of activity that I said when we see a mispriced market like these, we're trying to take advantage of that in order to add value to the base here, and we'll continue that process. We do expect to utilize our remaining authority in this year. We were a little frontloaded in the first quarter, taking advantage of what we saw as a very low or ridiculously low stock price and bought back more shares than kind of the pro rata portion there. On OpEx, first quarter's OpEx are always a little bit elevated because of basically taxes and compensation, taxes on compensation and compensation pay expenses that take place for the annual programs in February. So we do expect those numbers to come down. As I said, we fully expect to exit the year on a lower run rate than where we were -- where we entered the year for 2016. When we look at OpEx, some of the things that we do look at, we take a look at is not just the absolute levels, but where we're spending, what it cost us to perform different levels of activity. So that we're working to become more efficient in that side of the equation. I will say some of the areas that we are operating in have the fee income side of the equation have different ratios of OpEx to revenues than what you would see saying FFELP loan ownership versus FFELP federal loan servicing, as examples. But there's no question, we are working to try and become and continue our process and our success rate of becoming more efficient here. And as the FFELP and private loan portfolios amortize, you'll see those expenses decline."

Our results for the first quarter are consistent with our plans. We earned an adjusted $0.44 in core earnings per share, with student loan margins and operating expenses in line with expectations. Credit was a bright spot this quarter, and I will touch on this topic a bit more in a moment.
During the quarter, we continued to focus on several key areas: improving our access to and the cost of funding, delivering value to our customers and clients, capturing new business opportunities, improving our operating efficiency and growing the value of our company.
While the work in these areas is never complete, I'm pleased with our efforts, execution and results this quarter. We've been working on a number of fronts to address our access to funding and, specifically, funding for our government guaranteed FFELP assets. As you know, Moody's and Fitch have been reviewing their criteria for rating the term FFELP asset-backed loans. Unfortunately, to date, they have not issued any updated guidance.
While we currently believe that the final criteria will be more favorable than the initial draft proposals, we decided not to wait any longer to restart our FFELP ABS program. We completed our first FFELP ABS transaction in the first quarter, followed earlier this month with the second sale. Combined, we have now issued $1.6 billion in FFELP ABS bond, investor reception was good and, more importantly, even stronger in the second deal.
We also completed an extension of our FFELP conduit facility, pushing the maturity date out 1 year to 2018. This facility was also scheduled to decline to $7 billion in size.
Given the potential for FFELP portfolio purchases, we increased the size to $7.5 billion. And extending this facility and returning to the FFELP ABS market demonstrate the high quality of the FFELP portfolio and the confidence of lenders and investors in our securities.
We are also addressing the potential rating agency impacts on outstanding bonds. As of today, we have extended the legal final maturity date on $4.8 billion in bonds. While we believe the assumptions used to determine the new maturity date of these extensions are unnecessarily long, or said differently, we certainly expect the loans to pay off prior to the new maturity dates. We have worked with bondholders to extend the maturity date of their bonds in order to protect the value of their investment.
Also on the financing front, we completed a private loan securitization in the first quarter. And last week, we completed our second private credit residual financing. Combined, these transactions raised over $525 million in free cash. The proceeds will be used to further reduce our unsecured debt. Combined, our steady and significant financing activity ensures that we have ample liquidity to run our business, pursue portfolio acquisitions and increase the intrinsic value for shareholders.
As we all know, it's an election year, so student loan performance and indebtedness continues to be a regular political and media topic. The data reported here is often misleading, confusing and driven by anecdotes instead of facts. For example, it was recently reported that few student loan borrowers are making payments on their loans. The calculation here is complicated by the ways the program reports outstanding balances.
Unique to the federal loan program is that cumulative defaults are included in delinquency and repayment statistics since there's no charge-off for bad debt used by the federal government. This would be fine if the statistics also included the balances that were paid down, but they do not. As a result, borrowers who successfully repaid their loans are excluded from the analysis.
For the record, for loans we own, our customers are successfully making payments on their loans, having made over $3.6 billion in payments to principal in the first quarter. What we see from over 12 million customers, with over $300 billion in balances, is continued improvement in credit performance.
For our private loans, our 90-plus delinquency rate fell to 3.2% at March 31, down from 3.6% a year ago. And importantly, the dollar balance of loans over 90 days past due declined over 20% from a year ago to $749 million. The charge-off rate also improved, declining 17% from the year-ago quarter to 2.4%. And the performance this quarter and the reductions in delinquent dollar balances at quarter end are positive signs for the remainder of the year.
We continue to work to capture new business opportunities. During the quarter, we acquired $1.5 billion in FFELP Loans. We're beginning to see signs that opportunities to purchase additional student loan portfolios will increase.
Our processing business in the municipal and health care areas is also growing nicely. For example, we recently won a new multiyear contract in New Jersey as well as new contracts in Arizona, Pennsylvania, California and Mississippi, to name a few. And we expanded our health care receivable services to new hospitals in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Wisconsin.
This month, the Department of Education issued an RFP for a single servicing platform. The request for proposal is just to provide a servicing platform, not loaning services. Our existing servicing contract extends into 2019. Our team here is actively engaged in evaluating the opportunity with respect to the system RFP.
Like most financial services entities, we're working to continuously improve our operating efficiency, and we have several initiatives underway to accelerate our pace here. We plan to exit 2016 with a lower run rate operating expense level than where we are today. This is another example of our efforts to add value for our clients and other stakeholders.
During the quarter, we purchased 19.2 million shares at an average price of $10.42, a level significantly below what we see as the intrinsic value of the company. Capturing the opportunity here allows us to increase the intrinsic value per share to non-selling shareholders.
Our stock price is up significantly from its low earlier this year. Still, it does not reflect the full value of the company as we see it. Our focus on funding, capturing new business opportunities, improving operating efficiency and taking advantage of a mispriced market has allowed us to add value. We'll continue this focus and execution going forward.
Now I'll turn the call over to Somsak for a deeper look at our financial results, and I look forward to taking your questions later. Sak?"

During my prepared remarks, I'll review the first quarter results before highlighting the recent financing activities that took place. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available on the company's webs",1255,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll review the first quarter results before highlighting the recent financing activities that took place. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available on the company's website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the first quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.44, which excludes regulatory-related costs during the quarter. Our first quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $243 million versus $230 million a year ago. The increase in these expenses is related to the additional costs resulting from the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare. Excluding the expenses associated with these acquisitions, operating expenses were lower -- 6% lower than a year ago. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. In the quarter, we acquired $1.5 billion of FFELP student loans. While many major holders continue to wait for the resolution from the rating agencies related to the legal final maturities, we are beginning to see renewed interest in portfolio sales as well as FFELP ABS transactions.
FFELP core earnings were $66 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared with $85 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFELP core earnings was primarily a result of the lower FFELP balance compared to the prior year and a net interest margin of 81 basis points, which was in line with our expectations.
The FFELP net interest margin declined from the fourth quarter, due mainly to the seasonal impact of floor income rebates that occur during the first quarter of each year.
During the quarter, we did hedge an additional $295 million of floor income, bringing future hedge floor income to $1 billion. We're also seeing improving credit trends in our FFELP portfolio as demonstrated by the 17% improvement in our 90-day delinquency rate.
Let's now turn to Slide 6 for a review of our Private Education Loans segment. Core earnings in this segment decreased $16 million from the year-ago quarter to $61 million. The decline is primarily the result of the declining balance in our private education loan portfolio and lower net interest margin. The decline in NIM is partially offset by the $16 million reduction in our loan loss provision. This reduction came as a result of the improved credit performance that we continue to see in our delinquency forbearance and charge-off rates. Charge-offs declined $46 million or 24% from the prior year. The improved performance demonstrates the power of seasoning that we have seen in our portfolio.
Slide 7 highlights some of those improvements in our private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This portfolio is well seasoned, with 95% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. Our first quarter charge-offs came in at 2.4%, and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.2%.
The chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits improved performance is having on our average FICO scores. The nontraditional loans that we have in our portfolio today have improved their FICO scores by 35 points on average over the last 5 years. Today, these loans are nontraditional, and we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this segment of the portfolio.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $75 million in the quarter compared with $86 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the expected decline in education-related revenues.
Our nonfederal student loan-related asset recovery revenues increased by $30 million from the year-ago quarter to $51 million. The increase in these revenues was primarily related to the additions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015.
As Jack noted, we have been leveraging our skills and platform to grow our nonfederal student loan-related businesses steadily over the last few quarters, and we continue to win additional contracts in this space.
On Slide 9, I'd like to highlight our recent financing activities that we completed so far in 2016. In the past 2 months, we have issued over $1.6 billion of FFELP asset-backed securities. A $1.1 billion 2016-1 transaction that took place in the first quarter was the largest FFELP securitization in over 2 years. This transaction was done in conjunction with the loan acquisition from a third party and was unique because we did not utilize any funding capacity for this transaction.
Last week, we closed on an additional $497 million FFELP securitization. This was the first broadly marketed FFELP transaction since June of last year. And this securitization was met by strong investment demand and included over 18 unique investors receiving allocation.
The Triple-A rated securities priced at a 1-month LIBOR plus 138 basis points with a weighted average life of 5.2 years. With rating agencies [indiscernible] concerns, both these transactions are structured with long legal final maturity dates and have date-specific full-turbo feature.
While we continue to wait for Moody's and Fitch to provide final ratings methodology, we've been actively extending the legal final maturity dates on various trusts. Just on Monday, we announced the maturity extension on $1.2 billion of bonds. And since December 2015, we have now extended the legal final maturity date on $4.8 billion of bonds.
As Jack mentioned earlier, we also increased and extended our FFELP ABCP facility. This facility's revolving period was extended to March 2018. The maximum financing amount, which was originally scheduled to step down to $7 billion, was increased to $7.5 billion. Facility extension and funding costs were consistent with our plan.
Not all of our activity was related to FFELP during the quarter. We also issued a $488 million private education loan ABS in January. And the Triple-A portion of this transaction is priced at 1-month LIBOR plus 231 basis points with a 4.9-year weighted average life.
On April 15, we added 3 trusts to our existing private education loan repurchase facility, providing an additional $478 million of financing. This facility allows us to borrow against the private student loan overcollateralization and our private education loan securitization. That gives a full-turbo repayment feature. The proceeds from these transactions will be used to pay down our unsecured debt.
On that front, our unsecured debt declined by $1 billion in the quarter to $14.2 billion outstanding at quarter end. And I'll note that over the last 15 months, we have reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by $3.3 billion or 19%.
So as you can see, we remain focused on reducing the total amount of unsecured debt outstanding and smoothing out the maturity profile to better match the predictable cash flows coming from our education loan portfolio.
In the quarter, we had repurchased 19.2 million shares for $200 million at an average price of $10.42. In the quarter end, we have a remaining authority of $555 million under our share repurchase authority. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25x.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded first quarter GAAP net income of $181 million or $0.53 per share, and that's compared with net income of $292 million or $0.72 per share in the first quarter 2015. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM Bank that we spun from.
That concludes my remarks, and we'll open now the call to questions."

It's -- we're clearly disappointed in terms of the amount of time it's taking to get to a resolution. The challenge here is the cash flow aspects of the federal student loans are fairly complex. There's over 56 different repayment options available to borrowers, including, I think, 9 income-driven repayment solutions alone. And what we have seen historically is that while borrowers can, in fact, take advantage of multiple opportunities in some form of sequential fashion, that's actually not -- that's not how the practice actually unfolds. And so I think the struggle has been what the customer -- what customers are eligible to do versus what they really do. And what we're seeing on the FFELP side of the equation as we see in our private loan is that as the portfolios season, borrowers grow, their income -- their actual income and their income potential grows, and delinquencies fall and repayments increase. So we're looking to get the rating agencies -- to work with the rating agencies to get this issue resolved as quickly as possible. As we said in our comments, at this point in time, we decided to not wait for those resolutions and return to the FFELP ABS market. On the regulatory front, we continue to have ongoing dialogue with the entities. I think a lot of the issues and items are related to how borrowers access and understand the different programs that are available to them. We are a firm believer that the program terms and options are too many and too complex. But at the end of the day, we know that when 9 times out of 10, when we reach a delinquent customer, we're able to explain those options to them and get them into a repayment plan that keeps them out of default. Our biggest challenge in preventing defaults and helping people enroll in income-driven repayment programs is contact with the customer. Over 90% of the loans -- federal loans that we service, they do end up in default, and we are at a much smaller rate than all other servicers, not those customers do not respond to the extensive efforts we make to reach them. And as you know, we can't help a delinquent customer take advantage of the opportunities that are available to them if we can't reach them."

But your point is correct, I mean, if we believe they would tighten even further, if we were able to close this issue. The legal final maturity date that we're embedding in new deals and the dates we're using to amend all deals is very long. And so we believe that is providing the protection to investors to make sure that the ratings will exist throughout the life of the bond. At the end of the day, what the rating agency assumptions are, however, don't really -- don't impact what the cash flows actually are in the transactions. And we are confident based on the payment activity that we see of our behavior that those maturity dates are -- those legal final maturity dates are well in excess of what's required. The deals that we acquired, the portfolios, the $1.5 billion of FFELP loans that we acquired this quarter, reflect current spreads and funding cost and term ABS. And so from our perspective, we believe we earn -- the earnings that we will generate from those transactions as similar spreads were tighter. We just believe that if spreads tighten, we will see increased opportunities to buy loans, which is obviously the -- what we're hoping for."

Frankly, our biggest challenge right now is the -- and this, I think, tells the story a little bit about where we see unsecured spreads going, is buying unsecured debt in the open market.

We do expect to utilize our remaining authority in this year. We were a little front-loaded in the first quarter, taking advantage of what we saw as a very low or ridiculously low stock price and bought back more shares than kind of the pro rata portion there. On OpEx, first quarter's OpEx are always a little bit elevated because of, basically, taxes and compensation -- taxes on compensation and compensation pay expenses that take place for the annual programs in February. So we do expect those numbers to come down. And as I said, we fully expect to exit the year on a lower run rate than where we were -- where we entered the year for 2016. When we look at OpEx, some of the things that we do look at, we take a look at, is not just the absolute levels but where we're spending, what it costs us to perform different levels of activity, so that we're working to become more efficient in that side of the equation. I will say some of the areas that we are operating in have -- the fee income side of the equation have different ratios of OpEx to revenues than what you would see, say, in FFELP loan ownership versus FFELP -- versus federal loan servicing, as examples. But there's no question, we are working to try and become -- and continue our process and our success rate of becoming more efficient here.

Our results for the first quarter are consistent with our plans. We earned an adjusted $0.44 in core earnings per share, with student loan margins and operating expenses in line with expectations. Credit was a bright spot this quarter, and I will touch on this topic a bit more in a moment.
During the quarter, we continued to focus on several key areas: improving our access to and the cost of funding, delivering value to our customers and clients, capturing new business opportunities, improving our operating efficiency and growing the value of our company.
While the work in these areas is never complete, I'm pleased with our efforts, execution and results this quarter. We've been working on a number of fronts to address our access to funding and, specifically, funding for our government guaranteed FFELP assets. As you know, Moody's and Fitch have been reviewing their criteria for rating term FFELP asset-backed bonds. Unfortunately, to-date, they have not issued any updated guidance.
While we currently believe that the final criteria will be more favorable than the initial draft proposals, we've decided not to wait any longer to restart our FFELP ABS program. We completed our first FFELP ABS transaction in the first quarter, followed earlier this month with a second sale. Combined, we have now issued $1.6 billion in FFELP ABS bonds, investor reception was good and, more importantly, even stronger in the second deal.
We also completed an extension of our FFELP conduit facility, pushing the maturity date out 1 year to 2018. This facility was also scheduled to decline to $7 billion in size.
Given the potential for FFELP portfolio purchases, we increased the size to $7.5 billion. And extending this facility and returning to the FFELP ABS market demonstrate the high quality of the FFELP portfolio and the confidence of lenders and investors in our securities.
We are also addressing the potential rating agency impacts on outstanding bonds. As of today, we have extended the legal final maturity date on $4.8 billion in bonds. While we believe the assumptions used to determine the new maturity date of these extensions are unnecessarily long, or said differently, we certainly expect the loans to pay off prior to the new maturity dates, we have worked with bondholders to extend the maturity date of their bonds in order to protect the value of their investment.
Also on the financing front, we completed a private loan securitization in the first quarter. And last week, we completed our second private credit residual financing. Combined, these transactions raised over $525 million in free cash. The proceeds will be used to further reduce our unsecured debt. Combined, our steady and significant financing activity ensures that we have ample liquidity to run our business, pursue portfolio acquisitions and increase the intrinsic value for shareholders.
As we all know, it's an election year, so student loan performance and indebtedness continues to be a regular political and media topic. The data reported here is often misleading, confusing and driven by anecdotes instead of facts. For example, it was recently reported that few student loan borrowers are making payments on their loans. The calculation here is complicated by the way the program reports outstanding balances.
Unique to the federal loan program is that cumulative defaults are included in delinquency and repayment statistics since there's no charge-off for bad debt used by the federal government. This would be fine if the statistics also included the balances that were paid down, but they do not. As a result, borrowers who successfully repaid their loans are excluded from the analysis.
For the record, for loans we own, our customers are successfully making payments on their loans, having made over $3.6 billion in payments to principal in the first quarter. What we see from over 12 million customers, with over $300 billion in balances, is continued improvement in credit performance.
For our private loans, our 90-plus delinquency rate fell to 3.2% at March 31, down from 3.6% a year ago. And importantly, the dollar balance of loans over 90 days past due declined over 20% from a year ago to $749 million. The charge-off rate also improved, declining 17% from the year-ago quarter to 2.4%. And the performance this quarter and the reductions in delinquent dollar balances at quarter end are positive signs for the remainder of the year.
We continue to work to capture new business opportunities. During the quarter, we acquired $1.5 billion in FFELP Loans. We're beginning to see signs that opportunities to purchase additional student loan portfolios will increase.
Our processing business in the municipal and health care areas is also growing nicely. For example, we recently won a new multiyear contract in New Jersey as well as new contracts in Arizona, Pennsylvania, California and Mississippi, to name a few. And we expanded our health care receivable services to new hospitals in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Wisconsin.
This month, the Department of Education issued an RFP for a single servicing platform. The request for proposals is to provide a servicing platform, not loan services. Our existing servicing contract extends into 2019. Our team here is actively engaged in evaluating the opportunity with respect to the system RFP.
Like most financial services entities, we're working to continuously improve our operating efficiency, and we have several initiatives underway to accelerate our pace here. We are planning to exit 2016 with a lower run rate operating expense level than where we are today. This is another example of our efforts to add value for our clients and other stakeholders.
During the quarter, we purchased 19.2 million shares at an average price of $10.42, a level significantly below what we see as the intrinsic value of the company. Capturing the opportunity here allows us to increase the intrinsic value per share to non-selling shareholders.
Our stock price is up significantly from its low earlier this year. Still, it does not reflect the full value of the company as we see it. Our focus on funding, capturing new business opportunities, improving operating efficiency and taking advantage of a mispriced market has allowed us to add value. We'll continue this focus and execution going forward.
Now I'll turn the call over to Somsak for a deeper look at our financial results, and I look forward to taking your questions later. Sak?"
260005529,330267780,960042,"Navient Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Navient Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll review the first quarter results before highlighting recent financing activities that took place. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available on the company's website,",1255,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll review the first quarter results before highlighting recent financing activities that took place. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available on the company's website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the first quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.44, which excludes regulatory-related costs during the quarter. Our first quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $243 million versus $230 million a year ago. The increase in these expenses is related to the additional costs resulting from the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare. Excluding the expenses associated with these acquisitions, operating expenses were lower -- 6% lower than a year ago. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. In the quarter, we acquired $1.5 billion of FFELP student loans. While many major holders continue to wait for the resolution from the rating agencies related to the legal final maturities, we are beginning to see renewed interest in portfolio sales as well as FFELP ABS transactions.
FFELP core earnings were $66 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared with $85 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFELP core earnings was primarily a result of lower FFELP balance compared to the prior year and a net interest margin of 81 basis points, which was in line with our expectations.
The FFELP net interest margin declined from the fourth quarter, due mainly to the seasonal impact of floor income rebates that occur during the first quarter of each year.
During the quarter, we did hedge an additional $295 million of floor income, bringing future hedge floor income to $1 billion. We're also seeing improving credit trends in our FFELP portfolio as demonstrated by the 17% improvement in our 90-day delinquency rate.
Let's now turn to Slide 6 for a review of our Private Education Loan segment. Core earnings in this segment decreased $16 million from the year-ago quarter to $61 million. The decline is primarily the result of the declining balance in our private education loan portfolio and lower net interest margin. The decline in NIM is partially offset by the $16 million reduction in our loan loss provision. This reduction came as a result of the improved credit performance that we continue to see in our delinquency forbearance and charge-off rates. Charge-offs declined $46 million or 24% from the prior year. The improved performance demonstrates the power of seasoning that we have seen in our portfolio.
Slide 7 highlights some of those improvements in our private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This portfolio is well seasoned, with 95% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. Our first quarter charge-offs came in at 2.4%, and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.2%.
The chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits improved performance is having on our orawis [ph] FICO scores. The nontraditional loans that we have in our portfolio today have improved their FICO scores by 35 points on average over the last 5 years. Today, these loans are nontraditional in name only, and we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this segment of the portfolio.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $75 million in the quarter compared with $86 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the expected decline in education-related revenues.
Our nonfederal student loan-related asset recovery revenues increased by $30 million from the year-ago quarter to $51 million. The increase in these revenues was primarily related to the additions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015.
As Jack noted, we have been leveraging our skills and platform to grow our nonfederal student loan-related businesses steadily over the last few quarters, and we continue to win additional contracts in this space.
On Slide 9, I'd like to highlight our recent financing activities that we completed so far in 2016. In the past 2 months, we have issued over $1.6 billion of FFELP asset-backed securities. A $1.1 billion 2016-1 transaction that took place in the first quarter was the largest FFELP securitization in over 2 years. This transaction was done in conjunction with a loan acquisition from a third party and was unique because we did not utilize any funding capacity for this transaction.
Last week, we closed on an additional $497 million FFELP securitization. This was the first broadly-marketed FFELP transaction since June of last year. And this securitization was met by strong investment demand and included over 18 unique investors receiving allocations.
The Triple-A rated securities priced at a 1-month LIBOR plus 138 basis points with a weighted average life of 5.2 years. With rack rating agencies extension [ph] concerns, both these transactions are structured with long legal final maturity dates and a date-specific full-turbo feature.
While we continue to wait for Moody's and Fitch to provide final ratings methodology, we've been actively extending the legal final maturity dates on various trusts. Just on Monday, we announced the maturity extension on $1.2 billion of bonds. And since December 2015, we have now extended the legal final maturity date on $4.8 billion of bonds.
As Jack mentioned earlier, we also increased and extended our FFELP ABCP facility. This facility's revolving period was extended to March 2018. The maximum financing amount, which was originally scheduled to step down to $7 billion, was increased to $7.5 billion. Facility extension and funding costs were consistent with our plan.
Not all of our activity was related to FFELP during the quarter. We also issued a $488 million private education loan ABS in January. And the Triple-A portion of this transaction priced at 1-month LIBOR plus 231 basis points with a 4.9-year weighted average life.
On April 15, we added 3 trusts to our existing private education loan repurchase facility, providing an additional $478 million of financing. This facility allows us to borrow against the private student loan overcollateralization and our private education loan securitization, benefit a full-turbo repayment feature. The proceeds from these transactions will be used to pay down our unsecured debt.
On that front, our unsecured debt declined by $1 billion in the quarter to $14.2 billion outstanding at quarter end. And I'll note that over the last 15 months, we have reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by $3.3 billion or 19%.
So as you can see, we remain focused on reducing the total amount of unsecured debt outstanding and smoothing out the maturity profile to better match the predictable cash flows coming from our education loan portfolio.
In the quarter, we repurchased 19.2 million shares for $200 million at an average price of $10.42. In the quarter end, we have a remaining authority of $555 million under our share repurchase authority. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25x.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded first quarter GAAP net income of $181 million or $0.53 per share, and that's compared with net income of $292 million or $0.72 per share in the first quarter 2015. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM Bank that we spun from.
That concludes my remarks, and we'll open now the call to questions."

The challenge here is the cash flow aspects of the federal",408,"Sure. So on the rating agency side, obviously, this has been an open item now for over a year. It's -- we're clearly disappointed in terms of the amount of time it's taking to get to a resolution. The challenge here is the cash flow aspects of the federal student loans are fairly complex. There's over 56 different repayment options available to borrowers, including, I think, 9 income-driven repayment solutions alone. And what we have seen historically is that while borrowers can, in fact, take advantage of multiple opportunities in some form of sequential fashion, that's actually not -- that's not how the practice actually unfolds. And so I think the struggle has been what the customer -- what customers are eligible to do versus what they really do. And what we're seeing on the FFELP side of the equation as we see in our private loan is that as the portfolios season, borrowers grow, their income -- their actual income and their income potential grows, and delinquencies fall and repayments increase. So we're looking to get the rating agencies -- to work with the rating agencies to get this issue resolved as quickly as possible. As we said in our comments, at this point in time, we decided to not wait for those resolutions and return to the FFELP ABS market. On the regulatory front, we continue to have ongoing dialogue with the entities. I think a lot of the issues and items are related to how borrowers access and understand the different programs that are available to them. We are a firm believer that the program terms and options are too many and too complex. But at the end of the day, we know that when 9 times out of 10, when we reach a delinquent customer, we're able to explain those options to them and get them into a repayment plan that keeps them out of default. Our biggest challenge in preventing defaults and helping people enroll in income-driven repayment programs is contact with the customer. Over 90% of the loans -- federal loans that we service that do end up in default, and we are at a much smaller rate than all other servicers --  those customers do not respond to the extensive efforts we make to reach them. And as you know, we can't help a delinquent customer take advantage of the opportunities that are available to them if we can't reach them."

But your point is correct, I mean, if we believe they would tighten even further, if we were able to close this issue. The legal final maturity date that we're embedding in new deals and the dates we're using to amend old deals is very long. And so we believe that is providing the protection to investors to make sure that the ratings will exist throughout the life of the bond. At the end of the day, what the rating agency assumptions are, however, don't really -- don't impact what the cash flows actually are in the transactions. And we are confident based on the payment activity that we see and borrower behavior, that those maturity dates are -- those legal final maturity dates are well in excess of what's required. The deals that we acquired, the portfolios, the $1.5 billion of FFELP loans that we acquired this quarter, reflect current spreads and funding cost and term ABS. And so from our perspective, we believe we earn -- the earnings that we will generate from those transactions is similar if spreads were tighter. We just believe that if spreads tighten, we will see increased opportunities to buy loans, which is obviously the -- what we're hoping for."

Frankly, our biggest challenge right now is the -- and this, I think, tells the story a little bit about where we see unsecured spreads going, is buying unsecured debt in the open market.

I will say some of the areas that we are operating in have -- the fee income side of the equation have different ratios of OpEx to revenues than what you would see, say, in FFELP loan ownership versus FFELP -- versus federal loan servicing, as examples. But there's no question, we are working to try and become -- and continue our process and our success rate of becoming more efficient here.

I'm happy to share my thoughts on this quarter's results, which are quite good and are a tangible example of the value our company can create. I will take the next few minutes to provide some color on our performance this quarter, the progress we have made on new funding and discuss new business opportunities we are seeing, including the Department of Education servicing contract. 
Our financial results this quarter were very good and better than planned. They reflect the efforts we have made in credit, funding and operating efficiency. The result, we earned an adjusted $0.48 in core earnings for the quarter. Key contributors included private credit loan performance, revenue growth in our noneducation business services and operating expense control. 
While the rhetoric implies student loan delinquencies and defaults are rising, I'm happy to report our customers are continuing to experience very different and positive trends. While some borrowers are struggling, overall delinquency and default rates for the federal and private loans we service are at some of the lowest levels since before the financial crisis. 
For example, for federal loans we service, we track the performance of recent graduates 6 months after they first enter repayment following their grace period. For the class of 2015, 7% of borrowers were more than 90 days past due after 6 months in repayment, 3x lower than the class of 2010. It's also 22% lower than the class of 2014. This is very good news. I'd also encourage those who are having difficulty making payments to contact us. We have solutions that can help. 
For our private loan portfolio, charge-offs this quarter totaled $127 million, 29% lower than the year-ago quarter. We saw a similar improvement in loans more than 90 days past due. The balance here declined by 22% to $668 million at quarter end. Our charge-off and 90-plus delinquency rates fell to 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively, the lowest level since before the financial crisis. 
As a result of the steady and significant improvement in credit performance, our provision for private loan losses this quarter declined to $100 million from $104 million in the first quarter and from $191 million in the year-ago period. Our data points to a continuation of these positive trends. 
Our total fee income for the quarter was $176 million, with our noneducation loan-related revenue totaling $49 million. We continue to see strong growth and good opportunities to grow our business services outside of student loans. Leveraging our skills and infrastructure to grow this segment of our business will continue to be an area of focus for us.
Last year, we launched several initiatives to improve our operating efficiency. Excluding newly acquired entities, expenses fell 8% as we benefited from efforts to improve efficiency in the conversion of third-party service loans to our platform. 
In addition to these strong financial results, we continue to demonstrate the breadth of our access to funding. During the quarter, we completed a $478 million private loan ABS repurchase facility, issued 3 FFELP term ABS transactions for $1.8 billion, extended our private education loan conduit facility for another year and repurchased or retired $255 million in unsecured debt. Driven by our cash flows, in the past 12 months, we have repurchased or retired $2.4 billion in unsecured notes with original maturities in 2016, '17, '18 and '19. 
We continue to work with the rating agencies as they implement their new cash flow assumptions for term FFELP ABS transactions. While some progress has been made, the pace is much slower and the results much less than we would have hoped. Nonetheless, earlier this year, we decided to move forward, and we have successfully returned to the term FFELP ABS market. 
Year-to-date, we have completed 4 deals using different structures in funding all loan types, including our first bond backed exclusively by federal rehabilitation loans. Most importantly, investor participation has been growing and funding spreads improving with each deal. 
Our liquidity profile is very strong and improving. In addition to our demonstration of consistent access to a variety of funding sources, we closed the quarter with cash and unencumbered FFELP Loans well in excess of the next 18 months of debt maturities. Our student loan portfolio continues to generate sizable cash flow, consistent with our projections. And finally, we still plan to return to the unsecured markets in the second half of this year as we look to smooth out our near-term debt maturities. 
As I mentioned, we continue to pursue new business opportunities. This quarter, we acquired $646 million in student loans, including $23 million in private loans. We also added new contracts in our business services, asset recovery and health care business lines. The outlook for future portfolio purchases looks promising, and I remain bullish in our ability to organically grow our noneducation loan business services. 
Of course, one of the largest business opportunities is the proposed Department of Education loan servicing contract. We were pleased to be chosen, along with 2 others, to participate in the next round of this RFP. Secretary King recently wrote about the key skills the Department of Ed is looking for here. I believe our demonstrated track record of scale, efficiency and customer outcomes, including income-driven repayment plan enrollment and, of course, default prevention, match up well to these requirements. 
For example, for Department of Education service borrowers, if all large services achieved our default prevention results, 300,000 fewer borrowers would have defaulted in 2015. In short, we make a difference, a huge difference, where it matters most. We look forward to learning more about this opportunity when the next round of the RFP is issued. 
Finally, we continue to deliver value to our investors through our return of excess capital. In addition to our $0.16 quarterly dividend, during the quarter, we purchased 13.6 million shares at an average cost of $12.90 a share, well below our view of the intrinsic value per share. 
Year-to-date, we have purchased 32.8 million shares, reducing our overall share count by 9%. While our stock price is up significantly from its lows earlier this year, it still does not reflect our estimate of the intrinsic value of this company. I believe our strong financial results and accomplishments this quarter demonstrate our commitment and our ability to preserve and create value for our investors. 
I'll now ask Sak to provide a deeper look at our financial results, and I look forward to taking your questions later. Sak?"
260005529,372074597,1008306,"Navient Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Navient Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I will review the solid second quarter results that we reported last night before highlighting our recent financing activities. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available",1216,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I will review the solid second quarter results that we reported last night before highlighting our recent financing activities. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available on the company's website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. 
In the second quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.48, which exclude $0.01 per share of regulatory-related costs during the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted core operating expenses totaled $226 million. That's compared to $220 million -- $221 million from a year ago. The increase is primarily related to the additional operating costs of the Gila and Xtend Healthcare acquisitions. Excluding the expenses associated with these 2015 acquisitions, operating expenses were 8% lower than a year ago. Based on the results through the first half of 2016, we are on pace to beat our operating expense guidance of $930 million for 2016. I also expect us to be on the higher end of our previously issued 2016 core EPS guidance of $1.82 to $1.87. 
Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $68 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $93 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFELP core earnings was primarily a result of the increased recovery expectations that occurred in the second quarter of last year. 
The FFELP net interest margin improved to 85 basis points in the quarter, which came in at the high end of our expectations. And during the quarter, we hedged an additional $205 million of core income, bringing our future hedged core income to $1.1 billion. For the full year, we expect our FFELP net interest margin to be in the low to mid-80s. In the quarter, we acquired $623 million of FFELP student loans, bringing our year-to-date total FFELP acquisitions to $2.2 billion. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loans segment results. Core earnings in this segment increased $35 million from the year-ago quarter to $57 million. Our provision for losses continue to improve as a result of the overall improvement in credit quality, delinquencies and charge-off trends. 
In the quarter, the net interest margin came in at 350 basis points. We expect NIM for the full year to be in the mid-340s. The private net interest margin continues to be impacted by the timing of when our prime-based assets reset versus when our LIBOR-based get reset. This is a result of the anticipated rate hikes that have not materialized. 
Since the last prime reset, LIBOR has increased without a corresponding increase in the prime rates, and we're projecting a higher LIBOR cost of funds for the second half of the year without any increase in the prime rate. In addition, we've also seen a slight balance increase in programs that temporarily reduce monthly payments through a reduction in interest rate versus a decline in our overall private education loan balance. 
Charge-offs declined $52 million or 29% from the prior year, and loans greater than 90 days delinquent have decreased by $184 million or 22%. The improved performance demonstrates the strong and improving credit quality of our portfolio. 
Slide 7 highlights some of these improving trends that we've seen over the last 5 years. Our second quarter charge-off rate fell to 2.2%, and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.1%. And the chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits our improved performance is having on our borrower FICO scores. FICO scores have improved by 36 points for our nontraditional loans and 24 points for our entire portfolio on average over the last 5 years, and we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this area. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter compared with $91 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the expected decline in education loan-related revenues. Our noneducation loan-related asset recovery revenues increased by $23 million from the year ago to $49 million. The increase in revenues is primarily related to the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015. Overall, we continue to expect our consolidated business services revenue to fall between 2 -- $620 million and $650 million for the full year. 
Let's move to Slide 9 to highlight our financing activities that took place in the second quarter. During the quarter, we issued 3 FFELP asset-backed securities totaling $1.8 billion in bonds. From 2016-2, our first ABS transaction during the quarter, to 2016-3, our second ABS transaction during the quarter, we saw 3 things: one, the size of the issuance increased by $264 million; two, we saw pricing improve by 13 basis points; and three, the number of investors increased from 18 to 26. 
Our third issuance during the quarter, 2016-4, was the first time we issued a securitization made entirely of rehabilitated FFELP loans. These 3 transactions during the quarter demonstrate the increased demand for federally guaranteed paper and investors' willingness to participate in this market. 
We believe the assumptions in Moody's methodology that were recently released were divergent from actual loan performance and are well beyond what we expect to see. While we continue to wait for Moody's and Fitch to provide final ratings outcome, we've been actively extending the legal final maturity dates on our previously issued bonds. In total, we have now extended the legal final maturity date on $6.8 billion of bonds. 
In the quarter, we extended our private education loan ABCP facility by another year. We lowered the maximum financing to $750 million and currently have available capacity of $388 million. The facility extension and funding costs are consistent with our plan. And as we've discussed on our prior earnings call, we increased the -- our existing private education loan repurchase facility by an additional $478 million during the quarter. The proceeds from these transactions were used to pay down our unsecured debt. 
We reduced our unsecured debt by $255 million during the quarter to under $14 billion outstanding at quarter end. $219 million of this reduction came through repurchases in the open market. At the same time, the balance of our cash and unencumbered FFELP assets increased by nearly $400 million during the quarter. Today, our cash and unencumbered FFELP loans are in excess of the next 18 months of debt maturities. 
In the quarter, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for $175 million at an average price of $12.90. And at quarter end, we have remaining authority of 388 -- $380 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25. 
Finally, turning to our GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded second quarter GAAP net income of 2 -- $125 million or $0.38 per share compared with net income of $182 million or $0.47 per share in the second quarter 2015. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

So our customers are well beyond their in-school periods or -- and the beginning of their careers, and we lay out those statistics for you in the earnings presentation to show how it's migrating into how many months of repayment they've been in. Historically, the volatility as customers season is much, much lower compared to new to repayment customers, but you're also starting off from rates that are significantly -- that volatility is measured off rates that are significantly lower than what you would see in year 1 of repayment. So those are very positive trends. I would just point out here that the statistical data that is in existence for student loans, whether they be federal or private, is really driven by whether or not the student graduates and is the biggest factor, and we definitely have some exposure points in our private loan portfolio coming out of or going into the financial crisis of borrowers who did not earn their degrees, but what's left in the portfolio today is a portfolio that has a demonstrated track record of performance, and we'd expect that to be less susceptible to economic swings."

A lot of our activity is still around the processes we use, why customers do and require certain types of transactions over others in different time frames. So one good example is forbearance. I think there's been folks who have thought that forbearance is used more heavily over income-driven repayment, and the reality is, is about 70% of our customers who go into income-driven repayment need some form of forbearance before they are effectively enrolled in that program as an example. They're either need a forbearance to bring their account current or if they need a forbearance to give them the time to complete the forms that are required to enroll. So we -- the dialogue I think has been positive. And hopefully, we're providing more insight for them to understand the different activities and actions that are -- that we perform. I do think at the end of the day, our greatest strength is our ability to work with customers, identify at-risk customers and develop strategies that result in higher rates of right-party contacts so that they default at lower rates. And we connect with a customer 9x out of -- a delinquent customer 9x  out of 10, we're able to secure that delinquency. And as I said if everyone performed at our default prevention measures, 300,000 fewer federal borrowers would have defaulted in 2015, but no small difference there for us."

When you are calling a delinquent borrower, it takes a concerted effort and very distinct strategies to improve connection rates.

One is seasoning is clearly a particular benefit. So the further one  borrower, particularly a student loan borrower seasons, they're more entrenched in their career, their income starts to increase, and you have much, much better performance for both federal and more recently originated private loans we are also benefiting from the fact that a higher percentage of that volume has been occurring in more traditional student environments kids go in 4-year school. So you're seeing significant reduction, for example, in volume at for profit institutions. And I do think there's a little bit less occurring on the side of customers recognizing that if they're borrowing for education, they should be borrowing for tuition and less for living expenses. So that's more perhaps more anecdotal at this stage in the game. But if you look at the 2015 graduating class, and that's the most recent graduating class statistics we have, '16 has less school but their grace period doesn't end until December, January of '16, '17. I mean, to be 22% better than the year before is -- remember these are not underwritten loans. These are entitlement loans. So these are borrowers who are benefiting from the economy, benefiting from probably better discipline at the front end of the origination process. And certainly in Navient's case, for Navient service loans, they are benefiting from our targeted outreach campaigns that put us in contact with those borrowers before they become severely delinquent."

I'm happy to share my thoughts on this quarter's results, which are quite good and are a tangible example of the value our company can create. I will take the next few minutes to provide some color on our performance this quarter, the progress we have made on new funding and discuss new business opportunities we are seeing, including the Department of Education servicing contract. 
Our financial results this quarter were very good and better than planned. They reflect the efforts we have made in credit, funding and operating efficiency. The result, we earned an adjusted $0.48 in core earnings for the quarter. Key contributors included private credit loan performance, revenue growth in our noneducation business services and operating expense control. 
While the rhetoric implies student loan delinquencies and defaults are rising, I'm happy to report our customers are continuing to experience very different and positive trends. While some borrowers are struggling, overall delinquency and default rates for the federal and private loans we service are at some of the lowest levels since before the financial crisis. 
For example, for federal loans we service, we track the performance of recent graduates 6 months after they first enter repayment following their grace period. For the class of 2015, 7% of borrowers were more than 90 days past due after 6 months in repayment, 3x lower than the class of 2010. It's also 22% lower than the class of 2014. This is very good news. I'd also encourage those who are having difficulty making payments to contact us. We have solutions that can help. 
For our private loan portfolio, charge-offs this quarter totaled $127 million, 29% lower than the year-ago quarter. We saw a similar improvement in loans more than 90 days past due. The balance here declined by 22% to $668 million at quarter end. Our charge-off and 90-plus delinquency rates fell to 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively, the lowest level since before the financial crisis. 
As a result of the steady and significant improvement in credit performance, our provision for private loan losses this quarter declined to $100 million from $104 million in the first quarter and from $191 million in the year-ago period. Our data points to a continuation of these positive trends. 
Our total fee income for the quarter was $176 million, with our noneducation loan-related revenue totaling $49 million. We continue to see strong growth and good opportunities to grow our business services outside of student loans. Leveraging our skills and infrastructure to grow this segment of our business will continue to be an area of focus for us.
Last year, we launched several initiatives to improve our operating efficiency. Excluding newly acquired entities, expenses fell 8% as we benefited from efforts to improve efficiency in the conversion of third-party service loans to our platform. 
In addition to these strong financial results, we continue to demonstrate the breadth of our access to funding. During the quarter, we completed a $478 million private loan ABS repurchase facility, issued 3 FFELP term ABS transactions for $1.8 billion, extended our private education loan conduit facility for another year and repurchased or retired $255 million in unsecured debt. Driven by our cash flows, in the past 12 months, we have repurchased or retired $2.4 billion in unsecured notes with original maturities in 2016, '17, '18 and '19. 
We continue to work with the rating agencies as they implement their new cash flow assumptions for term FFELP ABS transactions. While some progress has been made, the pace is much slower and the results much less than we would have hoped. Nonetheless, earlier this year, we decided to move forward, and we have successfully returned to the term FFELP ABS market. 
Year-to-date, we have completed 4 deals using different structures in funding all loan types, including our first bond backed exclusively by federal rehabilitation loans. Most importantly, investor participation has been growing and funding spreads improving with each deal. 
Our liquidity profile is very strong and improving. In addition to our demonstration of consistent access to a variety of funding sources, we closed the quarter with cash and unencumbered FFELP Loans well in excess of the next 18 months of debt maturities. Our student loan portfolio continues to generate sizable cash flow, consistent with our projections. And finally, we still plan to return to the unsecured markets in the second half of this year as we look to smooth out our near-term debt maturities. 
As I mentioned, we continue to pursue new business opportunities. This quarter, we acquired $646 million in student loans, including $23 million in private loans. We also added new contracts in our business services, asset recovery and health care business lines. The outlook for future portfolio purchases looks promising, and I remain bullish in our ability to organically grow our noneducation loan business services. 
Of course, one of the largest business opportunities is the proposed Department of Education loan servicing contract. We were pleased to be chosen, along with 2 others, to participate in the next round of this RFP. Secretary King recently wrote about the key skills the Department of Ed is looking for here. I believe our demonstrated track record of scale, efficiency and customer outcomes, including income-driven repayment plan enrollment and, of course, default prevention, match up well to these requirements. 
For example, for Department of Education service borrowers, if all large services achieved our default prevention results, 300,000 fewer borrowers would have defaulted in 2015. In short, we make a difference, a huge difference, where it matters most. We look forward to learning more about this opportunity when the next round of the RFP is issued. 
Finally, we continue to deliver value to our investors through our return of excess capital. In addition to our $0.16 quarterly dividend, during the quarter, we purchased 13.6 million shares at an average cost of $12.90 a share, well below our view of the intrinsic value per share. 
Year-to-date, we have purchased 32.8 million shares, reducing our overall share count by 9%. While our stock price is up significantly from its lows earlier this year, it still does not reflect our estimate of the intrinsic value of this company. I believe our strong financial results and accomplishments this quarter demonstrate our commitment and our ability to preserve and create value for our investors. 
I'll now ask Sak to provide a deeper look at our financial results, and I look forward to taking your questions later. Sak?"

During my prepared remarks, I will review the solid second quarter results that we reported last night before highlighting our recent financing activities. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available",1216,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I will review the solid second quarter results that we reported last night before highlighting our recent financing activities. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available on the company's website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. 
In the second quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.48, which exclude $0.01 per share of regulatory-related costs during the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted core operating expenses totaled $226 million. That's compared to $220 million -- $221 million from a year ago. The increase is primarily related to the additional operating costs of the Gila and Xtend Healthcare acquisitions. Excluding the expenses associated with these 2015 acquisitions, operating expenses were 8% lower than a year ago. Based on the results through the first half of 2016, we are on pace to beat our operating expense guidance of $930 million for 2016. I also expect us to be on the higher end of our previously issued 2016 core EPS guidance of $1.82 to $1.87. 
Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $68 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $93 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFELP core earnings was primarily a result of the increased recovery expectations that occurred in the second quarter of last year. 
The FFELP net interest margin improved to 85 basis points in the quarter, which came in at the high end of our expectations. And during the quarter, we hedged an additional $205 million of core income, bringing our future hedged core income to $1.1 billion. For the full year, we expect our FFELP net interest margin to be in the low to mid-80s. In the quarter, we acquired $623 million of FFELP student loans, bringing our year-to-date total FFELP acquisitions to $2.2 billion. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loans segment results. Core earnings in this segment increased $35 million from the year-ago quarter to $57 million. Our provision for losses continue to improve as a result of the overall improvement in credit quality, delinquencies and charge-off trends. 
In the quarter, the net interest margin came in at 350 basis points. We expect NIM for the full year to be in the mid-340s. The private net interest margin continues to be impacted by the timing of when our prime-based assets reset versus when our LIBOR-based get reset. This is a result of the anticipated rate hikes that have not materialized. 
Since the last prime reset, LIBOR has increased without a corresponding increase in the prime rates, and we're projecting a higher LIBOR cost of funds for the second half of the year without any increase in the prime rate. In addition, we've also seen a slight balance increase in programs that temporarily reduce monthly payments through a reduction in interest rate versus a decline in our overall private education loan balance. 
Charge-offs declined $52 million or 29% from the prior year, and loans greater than 90 days delinquent have decreased by $184 million or 22%. The improved performance demonstrates the strong and improving credit quality of our portfolio. 
Slide 7 highlights some of these improving trends that we've seen over the last 5 years. Our second quarter charge-off rate fell to 2.2%, and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.1%. And the chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits our improved performance is having on our borrower FICO scores. FICO scores have improved by 36 points for our nontraditional loans and 24 points for our entire portfolio on average over the last 5 years, and we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this area. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter compared with $91 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the expected decline in education loan-related revenues. Our noneducation loan-related asset recovery revenues increased by $23 million from the year ago to $49 million. The increase in revenues is primarily related to the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015. Overall, we continue to expect our consolidated business services revenue to fall between 2 -- $620 million and $650 million for the full year. 
Let's move to Slide 9 to highlight our financing activities that took place in the second quarter. During the quarter, we issued 3 FFELP asset-backed securities totaling $1.8 billion in bonds. From 2016-2, our first ABS transaction during the quarter, to 2016-3, our second ABS transaction during the quarter, we saw 3 things: one, the size of the issuance increased by $264 million; two, we saw pricing improve by 13 basis points; and three, the number of investors increased from 18 to 26. 
Our third issuance during the quarter, 2016-4, was the first time we issued a securitization made entirely of rehabilitated FFELP loans. These 3 transactions during the quarter demonstrate the increased demand for federally guaranteed paper and investors' willingness to participate in this market. 
We believe the assumptions in Moody's methodology that were recently released were divergent from actual loan performance and are well beyond what we expect to see. While we continue to wait for Moody's and Fitch to provide final ratings outcome, we've been actively extending the legal final maturity dates on our previously issued bonds. In total, we have now extended the legal final maturity date on $6.8 billion of bonds. 
In the quarter, we extended our private education loan ABCP facility by another year. We lowered the maximum financing to $750 million and currently have available capacity of $388 million. The facility extension and funding costs are consistent with our plan. And as we've discussed on our prior earnings call, we increased the -- our existing private education loan repurchase facility by an additional $478 million during the quarter. The proceeds from these transactions were used to pay down our unsecured debt. 
We reduced our unsecured debt by $255 million during the quarter to under $14 billion outstanding at quarter end. $219 million of this reduction came through repurchases in the open market. At the same time, the balance of our cash and unencumbered FFELP assets increased by nearly $400 million during the quarter. Today, our cash and unencumbered FFELP loans are in excess of the next 18 months of debt maturities. 
In the quarter, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for $175 million at an average price of $12.90. And at quarter end, we have remaining authority of 388 -- $380 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25. 
Finally, turning to our GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded second quarter GAAP net income of 2 -- $125 million or $0.38 per share compared with net income of $182 million or $0.47 per share in the second quarter 2015. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

So our customers are well beyond their in-school periods or -- and the beginning of their careers, and we lay out those statistics for you in the earnings presentation to show how it's migrating into how many months of repayment they've been in. Historically, the volatility as customers season is much, much lower compared to new-to-repayment customers, but you're also starting off from rates that are significantly -- that volatility is measured off rates that are significantly lower than what you would see in year 1 of repayment. So those are very positive trends. I would just point out here that the statistical data that is in existence for student loans, whether they be federal or private, is really driven by whether or not the student graduates, and it is the biggest factor. And we definitely had some exposure points in our private loan portfolio, coming out of or going into the financial crisis, of borrowers who did not earn their degrees. But what's left in the portfolio today is a portfolio that has a demonstrated track record of performance, and we would expect that to be less susceptible to economic swings."

A lot of our activity is still around the processes we use, why customers do and require certain types of transactions over others in different time frames. So one good example is forbearance. I think there's been folks who have thought that forbearance is used more heavily over income-driven repayment, and the reality is, is about 70% of our customers who go into income-driven repayment need some form of forbearance before they are effectively enrolled in that program. As an example, they either need a forbearance to bring their account current or they need a forbearance to give them the time to complete the forms that are required to enroll. So we -- the dialogue, I think, has been positive, and hopefully, we're providing more insight for them to understand the different activities and actions that are -- that we perform here. I do think, at the end of the day, our greatest strength is our ability to work with customers, identify at-risk customers and develop strategies that result in higher rates of right-party contacts so that they default at lower rates. When we connect with a customer, 9 times out of -- a delinquent customer, 9 times out of 10, we're able to cure that delinquency. And as I said if everyone performed at our default-prevention measures, 300,000 fewer federal borrowers would have defaulted in 2015, but no small difference there for us."

So they -- I do think there's a greater awareness here of -- that graduation is key, that contact is an important strategy, higher right-party contact rates combined together produce the best results.

One is seasoning is clearly a particular benefit. So the further one  borrower, particularly a student loan borrower, seasons, they're more entrenched in their career, their income starts to increase, and -- you have much, much better performance for both federal and more recently originated private loans. We're also benefiting from the fact that a higher percentage of that volume has been occurring in more traditional student environments, so as kids go into 4-year schools. So you're seeing a significant reduction, for example, in volume at for-profit institutions. And I do think there's a little bit less occurring on the side of customers recognizing that if they're borrowing for education, they should be borrowing for tuition and less for living expenses. So that's more perhaps more anecdotal at this stage in the game. But if you look at the 2015 graduating class -- and that's the most recent graduating class statistics we have. '16 has less school, but their grace period doesn't end until December, January of '16, '17. I mean, to be 22% better than the year before is -- these are -- remember these are not underwritten loans. These are entitlement loans. So these are borrowers who are benefiting from the economy, benefiting from probably better discipline at the front end of the origination process. And certainly in Navient's case, for Navient-serviced loans, they are benefiting from our targeted outreach campaigns that put us in contact with those borrowers before they become severely delinquent."

I'm happy to share my thoughts on this quarter's results, which are quite good and are a tangible example of the value our company can create. I will take the next few minutes to provide some color on our performance this quarter, the progress we have made on new funding and discuss new business opportunities we are seeing, including the Department of Education servicing contract. 
Our financial results this quarter were very good and better than planned. They reflect the efforts we have made in credit, funding and operating efficiency. The result, we earned an adjusted $0.48 in core earnings for the quarter. Key contributors included private credit loan performance, revenue growth in our noneducation business services and operating expense control. 
While the rhetoric implies student loan delinquencies and defaults are rising, I'm happy to report our customers are continuing to experience very different and positive trends. While some borrowers are struggling, overall delinquency and default rates for the federal and private loans we service are at some of the lowest levels since before the financial crisis. 
For example, for federal loans we service, we track the performance of recent graduates 6 months after they first enter repayment following their grace period. For the class of 2015, 7% of borrowers were more than 90 days past due after 6 months in repayment, 3x lower than the class of 2010. It's also 22% lower than the class of 2014. This is very good news. I'd also encourage those who are having difficulty making payments to contact us. We have solutions that can help. 
For our private loan portfolio, charge-offs this quarter totaled $127 million, 29% lower than the year-ago quarter. We saw a similar improvement in loans more than 90 days past due. The balance here declined by 22% to $668 million at quarter end. Our charge-off and 90-plus delinquency rates fell to 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively, the lowest level since before the financial crisis. 
As a result of the steady and significant improvement in credit performance, our provision for private loan losses this quarter declined to $100 million from $104 million in the first quarter and from $191 million in the year-ago period. Our data points to a continuation of these positive trends. 
Our total fee income for the quarter was $176 million, with our noneducation loan-related revenue totaling $49 million. We continue to see strong growth and good opportunities to grow our business services outside of student loans. Leveraging our skills and infrastructure to grow this segment of our business will continue to be an area of focus for us.
Last year, we launched several initiatives to improve our operating efficiency. Excluding newly acquired entities, expenses fell 8% as we benefited from efforts to improve efficiency in the conversion of third-party service loans to our platform. 
In addition to these strong financial results, we continue to demonstrate the breadth of our access to funding. During the quarter, we completed a $478 million private loan ABS repurchase facility, issued 3 FFELP term ABS transactions for $1.8 billion, extended our private education loan conduit facility for another year and repurchased or retired $255 million in unsecured debt. Driven by our cash flows, in the past 12 months, we have repurchased or retired $2.4 billion in unsecured notes with original maturities in 2016, '17, '18 and '19. 
We continue to work with the rating agencies as they implement their new cash flow assumptions for term FFELP ABS transactions. While some progress has been made, the pace is much slower and the results much less than we would have hoped. Nonetheless, earlier this year, we decided to move forward, and we have successfully returned to the term FFELP ABS market. 
Year-to-date, we have completed 4 deals using different structures in funding all loan types, including our first bond backed exclusively by federal rehabilitation loans. Most importantly, investor participation has been growing and funding spreads improving with each deal. 
Our liquidity profile is very strong and improving. In addition to our demonstration of consistent access to a variety of funding sources, we closed the quarter with cash and unencumbered FFELP Loans well in excess of the next 18 months of debt maturities. Our student loan portfolio continues to generate sizable cash flow, consistent with our projections. And finally, we still plan to return to the unsecured markets in the second half of this year as we look to smooth out our near-term debt maturities. 
As I mentioned, we continue to pursue new business opportunities. This quarter, we acquired $646 million in student loans, including $23 million in private loans. We also added new contracts in our business services, asset recovery and health care business lines. The outlook for future portfolio purchases looks promising, and I remain bullish in our ability to organically grow our noneducation loan business services. 
Of course, one of the largest business opportunities is the proposed Department of Education loan servicing contract. We were pleased to be chosen, along with 2 others, to participate in the next round of this RFP. Secretary King recently wrote about the key skills the Department of Ed is looking for here. I believe our demonstrated track record of scale, efficiency and customer outcomes, including income-driven repayment plan enrollment and, of course, default prevention, match up well to these requirements. 
For example, for Department of Education service borrowers, if all large services achieved our default prevention results, 300,000 fewer borrowers would have defaulted in 2015. In short, we make a difference, a huge difference, where it matters most. We look forward to learning more about this opportunity when the next round of the RFP is issued. 
Finally, we continue to deliver value to our investors through our return of excess capital. In addition to our $0.16 quarterly dividend, during the quarter, we purchased 13.6 million shares at an average cost of $12.90 a share, well below our view of the intrinsic value per share. 
Year-to-date, we have purchased 32.8 million shares, reducing our overall share count by 9%. While our stock price is up significantly from its lows earlier this year, it still does not reflect our estimate of the intrinsic value of this company. I believe our strong financial results and accomplishments this quarter demonstrate our commitment and our ability to preserve and create value for our investors. 
I'll now ask Sak to provide a deeper look at our financial results, and I look forward to taking your questions later. Sak?"

During my prepared remarks, I will review the solid second quarter results that we reported last night before highlighting our recent financing activities. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available",1216,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I will review the solid second quarter results that we reported last night before highlighting our recent financing activities. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available on the company's website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. 
In the second quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.48, which exclude $0.01 per share of regulatory-related costs during the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted core operating expenses totaled $226 million. That's compared to $220 million -- $221 million from a year ago. The increase is primarily related to the additional operating costs of the Gila and Xtend Healthcare acquisitions. Excluding the expenses associated with these 2015 acquisitions, operating expenses were 8% lower than a year ago. Based on the results through the first half of 2016, we are on pace to beat our operating expense guidance of $930 million for 2016. I also expect us to be on the higher end of our previously issued 2016 core EPS guidance of $1.82 to $1.87. 
Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $68 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $93 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFELP core earnings was primarily a result of the increased recovery expectations that occurred in the second quarter of last year. 
The FFELP net interest margin improved to 85 basis points in the quarter, which came in at the high end of our expectations. And during the quarter, we hedged an additional $205 million of core income, bringing our future hedged core income to $1.1 billion. For the full year, we expect our FFELP net interest margin to be in the low to mid-80s. In the quarter, we acquired $623 million of FFELP student loans, bringing our year-to-date total FFELP acquisitions to $2.2 billion. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loans segment results. Core earnings in this segment increased $35 million from the year-ago quarter to $57 million. Our provision for losses continue to improve as a result of the overall improvement in credit quality, delinquencies and charge-off trends. 
In the quarter, the net interest margin came in at 350 basis points. We expect NIM for the full year to be in the mid-340s. The private net interest margin continues to be impacted by the timing of when our prime-based assets reset versus when our LIBOR-based get reset. This is a result of the anticipated rate hikes that have not materialized. 
Since the last prime reset, LIBOR has increased without a corresponding increase in the prime rates, and we're projecting a higher LIBOR cost of funds for the second half of the year without any increase in the prime rate. In addition, we've also seen a slight balance increase in programs that temporarily reduce monthly payments through a reduction in interest rate versus a decline in our overall private education loan balance. 
Charge-offs declined $52 million or 29% from the prior year, and loans greater than 90 days delinquent have decreased by $184 million or 22%. The improved performance demonstrates the strong and improving credit quality of our portfolio. 
Slide 7 highlights some of these improving trends that we've seen over the last 5 years. Our second quarter charge-off rate fell to 2.2%, and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.1%. And the chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits our improved performance is having on our borrower FICO scores. FICO scores have improved by 36 points for our nontraditional loans and 24 points for our entire portfolio on average over the last 5 years, and we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this area. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter compared with $91 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the expected decline in education loan-related revenues. Our noneducation loan-related asset recovery revenues increased by $23 million from the year ago to $49 million. The increase in revenues is primarily related to the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015. Overall, we continue to expect our consolidated business services revenue to fall between 2 -- $620 million and $650 million for the full year. 
Let's move to Slide 9 to highlight our financing activities that took place in the second quarter. During the quarter, we issued 3 FFELP asset-backed securities totaling $1.8 billion in bonds. From 2016-2, our first ABS transaction during the quarter, to 2016-3, our second ABS transaction during the quarter, we saw 3 things: one, the size of the issuance increased by $264 million; two, we saw pricing improve by 13 basis points; and three, the number of investors increased from 18 to 26. 
Our third issuance during the quarter, 2016-4, was the first time we issued a securitization made entirely of rehabilitated FFELP loans. These 3 transactions during the quarter demonstrate the increased demand for federally guaranteed paper and investors' willingness to participate in this market. 
We believe the assumptions in Moody's methodology that were recently released were divergent from actual loan performance and are well beyond what we expect to see. While we continue to wait for Moody's and Fitch to provide final ratings outcome, we've been actively extending the legal final maturity dates on our previously issued bonds. In total, we have now extended the legal final maturity date on $6.8 billion of bonds. 
In the quarter, we extended our private education loan ABCP facility by another year. We lowered the maximum financing to $750 million and currently have available capacity of $388 million. The facility extension and funding costs are consistent with our plan. And as we've discussed on our prior earnings call, we increased the -- our existing private education loan repurchase facility by an additional $478 million during the quarter. The proceeds from these transactions were used to pay down our unsecured debt. 
We reduced our unsecured debt by $255 million during the quarter to under $14 billion outstanding at quarter end. $219 million of this reduction came through repurchases in the open market. At the same time, the balance of our cash and unencumbered FFELP assets increased by nearly $400 million during the quarter. Today, our cash and unencumbered FFELP loans are in excess of the next 18 months of debt maturities. 
In the quarter, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for $175 million at an average price of $12.90. And at quarter end, we have remaining authority of 388 -- $380 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25. 
Finally, turning to our GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded second quarter GAAP net income of 2 -- $125 million or $0.38 per share compared with net income of $182 million or $0.47 per share in the second quarter 2015. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

So our customers are well beyond their in-school periods or -- and the beginning of their careers, and we lay out those statistics for you in the earnings presentation to show how it's migrating into how many months of repayment they've been in. Historically, the volatility as customers season is much, much lower compared to new-to-repayment customers, but you're also starting off from rates that are significantly -- that volatility is measured off rates that are significantly lower than what you would see in year 1 of repayment. So those are very positive trends. I would just point out here that the statistical data that is in existence for student loans, whether they be federal or private, is really driven by whether or not the student graduates, and it is the biggest factor. And we definitely had some exposure points in our private loan portfolio, coming out of or going into the financial crisis, of borrowers who did not earn their degrees. But what's left in the portfolio today is a portfolio that has a demonstrated track record of performance, and we would expect that to be less susceptible to economic swings."

A lot of our activity is still around the processes we use, why customers do and require certain types of transactions over others in",253,"So we continue to have an active engagement with regulators here, which are both the federal and state-based regulators. A lot of our activity is still around the processes we use, why customers do and require certain types of transactions over others in different time frames. So one good example is forbearance. I think there's been folks who have thought that forbearance is used more heavily over income-driven repayment, and the reality is, is about 70% of our customers who go into income-driven repayment need some form of forbearance before they are effectively enrolled in that program. As an example, they either need a forbearance to bring their account current or they need a forbearance to give them the time to complete the forms that are required to enroll. So we -- the dialogue, I think, has been positive, and hopefully, we're providing more insight for them to understand the different activities and actions that are -- that we perform here. I do think, at the end of the day, our greatest strength is our ability to work with customers, identify at-risk customers and develop strategies that result in higher rates of right-party contacts so that they default at lower rates. When we connect with a customer, 9 times out of -- a delinquent customer, 9 times out of 10, we're able to cure that delinquency. And as I said if everyone performed at our default-prevention measures, 300,000 fewer federal borrowers would have defaulted in 2015, but no small difference there for us."

Treasury, who's been running a pilot project on default collections work, recently issued a report on their results, and they were substantially below private-sector collection efforts overall. But what they pointed out is something that we've been saying for quite some time, is that contact is key to resolving this, and that contact is hard. When you are calling a delinquent borrower, it takes a concerted effort and very distinct strategies to improve connection rates. If you just do a kind of a mass one-size-fits-all approach, you're going to get default-prevention results that I think you see throughout the industry versus the ones that Navient is able to produce. So they -- I do think there's a greater awareness here of -- that graduation is key, that contact is important in strategy, higher right-party contact rates combined together produce the best results.

One is seasoning is clearly a particular benefit. So the further one  borrower, particularly a student loan borrower, seasons, they're more entrenched in their career, their income starts to increase, and -- you have much, much better performance for both federal and more recently originated private loans. We're also benefiting from the fact that a higher percentage of that volume has been occurring in more traditional student environments, so as kids go into 4-year schools. So you're seeing a significant reduction, for example, in volume at for-profit institutions. And I do think there's a little bit less occurring on the side of customers recognizing that if they're borrowing for education, they should be borrowing for tuition and less for living expenses. So that's more perhaps more anecdotal at this stage in the game. But if you look at the 2015 graduating class -- and that's the most recent graduating class statistics we have. '16 has less school, but their grace period doesn't end until December, January of '16, '17. I mean, to be 22% better than the year before is -- these are -- remember these are not underwritten loans. These are entitlement loans. So these are borrowers who are benefiting from the economy, benefiting from probably better discipline at the front end of the origination process. And certainly in Navient's case, for Navient-serviced loans, they are benefiting from our targeted outreach campaigns that put us in contact with those borrowers before they become severely delinquent."

I'm happy to share my thoughts on this quarter's results, which are quite good and are a tangible example of the value our company can create. I will take the next few minutes to provide some color on our performance this quarter, the progress we have made on new funding and discuss new business opportunities we are seeing, including the Department of Education servicing contract. 
Our financial results this quarter were very good and better than planned. They reflect the efforts we have made in credit, funding and operating efficiency. The result, we earned an adjusted $0.48 in core earnings for the quarter. Key contributors included private credit loan performance, revenue growth in our noneducation business services and operating expense control. 
While the rhetoric implies student loan delinquencies and defaults are rising, I'm happy to report our customers are continuing to experience very different and positive trends. While some borrowers are struggling, overall delinquency and default rates for the federal and private loans we service are at some of the lowest levels since before the financial crisis. 
For example, for federal loans we service, we track the performance of recent graduates 6 months after they first enter repayment following their grace period. For the class of 2015, 7% of borrowers were more than 90 days past due after 6 months in repayment, 3x lower than the class of 2010. It's also 22% lower than the class of 2014. This is very good news. I'd also encourage those who are having difficulty making payments to contact us. We have solutions that can help. 
For our private loan portfolio, charge-offs this quarter totaled $127 million, 29% lower than the year-ago quarter. We saw a similar improvement in loans more than 90 days past due. The balance here declined by 22% to $668 million at quarter end. Our charge-off and 90-plus delinquency rates fell to 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively, the lowest level since before the financial crisis. 
As a result of the steady and significant improvement in credit performance, our provision for private loan losses this quarter declined to $100 million from $104 million in the first quarter and from $191 million in the year-ago period. Our data points to a continuation of these positive trends. 
Our total fee income for the quarter was $176 million, with our noneducation loan-related revenue totaling $49 million. We continue to see strong growth and good opportunities to grow our business services outside of student loans. Leveraging our skills and infrastructure to grow this segment of our business will continue to be an area of focus for us.
Last year, we launched several initiatives to improve our operating efficiency. Excluding newly acquired entities, expenses fell 8% as we benefited from efforts to improve efficiency in the conversion of third-party service loans to our platform. 
In addition to these strong financial results, we continue to demonstrate the breadth of our access to funding. During the quarter, we completed a $478 million private loan ABS repurchase facility, issued 3 FFELP term ABS transactions for $1.8 billion, extended our private education loan conduit facility for another year and repurchased or retired $255 million in unsecured debt. Driven by our cash flows, in the past 12 months, we have repurchased or retired $2.4 billion in unsecured notes with original maturities in 2016, '17, '18 and '19. 
We continue to work with the rating agencies as they implement their new cash flow assumptions for term FFELP ABS transactions. While some progress has been made, the pace is much slower and the results much less than we would have hoped. Nonetheless, earlier this year, we decided to move forward, and we have successfully returned to the term FFELP ABS market. 
Year-to-date, we have completed 4 deals using different structures in funding all loan types, including our first bond backed exclusively by federal rehabilitation loans. Most importantly, investor participation has been growing and funding spreads improving with each deal. 
Our liquidity profile is very strong and improving. In addition to our demonstration of consistent access to a variety of funding sources, we closed the quarter with cash and unencumbered FFELP Loans well in excess of the next 18 months of debt maturities. Our student loan portfolio continues to generate sizable cash flow, consistent with our projections. And finally, we still plan to return to the unsecured markets in the second half of this year as we look to smooth out our near-term debt maturities. 
As I mentioned, we continue to pursue new business opportunities. This quarter, we acquired $646 million in student loans, including $23 million in private loans. We also added new contracts in our business services, asset recovery and health care business lines. The outlook for future portfolio purchases looks promising, and I remain bullish in our ability to organically grow our noneducation loan business services. 
Of course, one of the largest business opportunities is the proposed Department of Education loan servicing contract. We were pleased to be chosen, along with 2 others, to participate in the next round of this RFP. Secretary King recently wrote about the key skills the Department of Ed is looking for here. I believe our demonstrated track record of scale, efficiency and customer outcomes, including income-driven repayment plan enrollment and, of course, default prevention, match up well to these requirements. 
For example, for Department of Education service borrowers, if all large services achieved our default prevention results, 300,000 fewer borrowers would have defaulted in 2015. In short, we make a difference, a huge difference, where it matters most. We look forward to learning more about this opportunity when the next round of the RFP is issued. 
Finally, we continue to deliver value to our investors through our return of excess capital. In addition to our $0.16 quarterly dividend, during the quarter, we purchased 13.6 million shares at an average cost of $12.90 a share, well below our view of the intrinsic value per share. 
Year-to-date, we have purchased 32.8 million shares, reducing our overall share count by 9%. While our stock price is up significantly from its lows earlier this year, it still does not reflect our estimate of the intrinsic value of this company. I believe our strong financial results and accomplishments this quarter demonstrate our commitment and our ability to preserve and create value for our investors. 
I'll now ask Sak to provide a deeper look at our financial results, and I look forward to taking your questions later. Sak?"

During my prepared remarks, I will review the solid second quarter results that we reported last night before highlighting our recent financing activities. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available",1216,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I will review the solid second quarter results that we reported last night before highlighting our recent financing activities. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation available on the company's website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. 
In the second quarter, we reported adjusted core earnings per share of $0.48, which exclude $0.01 per share of regulatory-related costs during the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted core operating expenses totaled $226 million. That's compared to $220 million -- $221 million from a year ago. The increase is primarily related to the additional operating costs of the Gila and Xtend Healthcare acquisitions. Excluding the expenses associated with these 2015 acquisitions, operating expenses were 8% lower than a year ago. Based on the results through the first half of 2016, we are on pace to beat our operating expense guidance of $930 million for 2016. I also expect us to be on the higher end of our previously issued 2016 core EPS guidance of $1.82 to $1.87. 
Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $68 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $93 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in FFELP core earnings was primarily a result of the increased recovery expectations that occurred in the second quarter of last year. 
The FFELP net interest margin improved to 85 basis points in the quarter, which came in at the high end of our expectations. And during the quarter, we hedged an additional $205 million of core income, bringing our future hedged core income to $1.1 billion. For the full year, we expect our FFELP net interest margin to be in the low to mid-80s. In the quarter, we acquired $623 million of FFELP student loans, bringing our year-to-date total FFELP acquisitions to $2.2 billion. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loans segment results. Core earnings in this segment increased $35 million from the year-ago quarter to $57 million. Our provision for losses continue to improve as a result of the overall improvement in credit quality, delinquencies and charge-off trends. 
In the quarter, the net interest margin came in at 350 basis points. We expect NIM for the full year to be in the mid-340s. The private net interest margin continues to be impacted by the timing of when our prime-based assets reset versus when our LIBOR-based get reset. This is a result of the anticipated rate hikes that have not materialized. 
Since the last prime reset, LIBOR has increased without a corresponding increase in the prime rates, and we're projecting a higher LIBOR cost of funds for the second half of the year without any increase in the prime rate. In addition, we've also seen a slight balance increase in programs that temporarily reduce monthly payments through a reduction in interest rate versus a decline in our overall private education loan balance. 
Charge-offs declined $52 million or 29% from the prior year, and loans greater than 90 days delinquent have decreased by $184 million or 22%. The improved performance demonstrates the strong and improving credit quality of our portfolio. 
Slide 7 highlights some of these improving trends that we've seen over the last 5 years. Our second quarter charge-off rate fell to 2.2%, and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.1%. And the chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits our improved performance is having on our borrower FICO scores. FICO scores have improved by 36 points for our nontraditional loans and 24 points for our entire portfolio on average over the last 5 years, and we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this area. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter compared with $91 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the expected decline in education loan-related revenues. Our noneducation loan-related asset recovery revenues increased by $23 million from the year ago to $49 million. The increase in revenues is primarily related to the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015. Overall, we continue to expect our consolidated business services revenue to fall between 2 -- $620 million and $650 million for the full year. 
Let's move to Slide 9 to highlight our financing activities that took place in the second quarter. During the quarter, we issued 3 FFELP asset-backed securities totaling $1.8 billion in bonds. From 2016-2, our first ABS transaction during the quarter, to 2016-3, our second ABS transaction during the quarter, we saw 3 things: one, the size of the issuance increased by $264 million; two, we saw pricing improve by 13 basis points; and three, the number of investors increased from 18 to 26. 
Our third issuance during the quarter, 2016-4, was the first time we issued a securitization made entirely of rehabilitated FFELP loans. These 3 transactions during the quarter demonstrate the increased demand for federally guaranteed paper and investors' willingness to participate in this market. 
We believe the assumptions in Moody's methodology that were recently released were divergent from actual loan performance and are well beyond what we expect to see. While we continue to wait for Moody's and Fitch to provide final ratings outcome, we've been actively extending the legal final maturity dates on our previously issued bonds. In total, we have now extended the legal final maturity date on $6.8 billion of bonds. 
In the quarter, we extended our private education loan ABCP facility by another year. We lowered the maximum financing to $750 million and currently have available capacity of $388 million. The facility extension and funding costs are consistent with our plan. And as we've discussed on our prior earnings call, we increased the -- our existing private education loan repurchase facility by an additional $478 million during the quarter. The proceeds from these transactions were used to pay down our unsecured debt. 
We reduced our unsecured debt by $255 million during the quarter to under $14 billion outstanding at quarter end. $219 million of this reduction came through repurchases in the open market. At the same time, the balance of our cash and unencumbered FFELP assets increased by nearly $400 million during the quarter. Today, our cash and unencumbered FFELP loans are in excess of the next 18 months of debt maturities. 
In the quarter, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for $175 million at an average price of $12.90. And at quarter end, we have remaining authority of 388 -- $380 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25. 
Finally, turning to our GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded second quarter GAAP net income of 2 -- $125 million or $0.38 per share compared with net income of $182 million or $0.47 per share in the second quarter 2015. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

So our customers are well beyond their in-school periods or -- and the beginning of their careers, and we lay out those statistics for you in the earnings presentation to show how it's migrating into how many months of repayment they've been in. Historically, the volatility as customers season is much, much lower compared to new-to-repayment customers, but you're also starting off from rates that are significantly -- that volatility is measured off rates that are significantly lower than what you would see in year 1 of repayment. So those are very positive trends. I would just point out here that the statistical data that is in existence for student loans, whether they be federal or private, is really driven by whether or not the student graduates, and it is the biggest factor. And we definitely had some exposure points in our private loan portfolio, coming out of or going into the financial crisis, of borrowers who did not earn their degrees. But what's left in the portfolio today is a portfolio that has a demonstrated track record of performance, and we would expect that to be less susceptible to economic swings."

A lot of our activity is still around the processes we use, why customers do and require certain types of transactions over others in different time frames. So one good example is forbearance. I think there's been folks who have thought that forbearance is used more heavily over income-driven repayment, and the reality is, is about 70% of our customers who go into income-driven repayment need some form of forbearance before they are effectively enrolled in that program. As an example, they either need a forbearance to bring their account current or they need a forbearance to give them the time to complete the forms that are required to enroll. So we -- the dialogue, I think, has been positive, and hopefully, we're providing more insight for them to understand the different activities and actions that are -- that we perform here. I do think, at the end of the day, our greatest strength is our ability to work with customers, identify at-risk customers and develop strategies that result in higher rates of right-party contacts so that they default at lower rates. When we connect with a customer, 9 times out of -- a delinquent customer, 9 times out of 10, we're able to cure that delinquency. And as I said if everyone performed at our default-prevention measures, 300,000 fewer federal borrowers would have defaulted in 2015, but no small difference there for us."

When you are calling a delinquent borrower, it takes a concerted effort and very distinct strategies to improve connection rates.

One is seasoning is clearly a particular benefit. So the further one  borrower, particularly a student loan borrower, seasons, they're more entrenched in their career, their income starts to increase, and -- you have much, much better performance for both federal and more recently originated private loans. We're also benefiting from the fact that a higher percentage of that volume has been occurring in more traditional student environments, so as kids go into 4-year schools. So you're seeing a significant reduction, for example, in volume at for-profit institutions. And I do think there's a little bit less occurring on the side of customers recognizing that if they're borrowing for education, they should be borrowing for tuition and less for living expenses. So that's more perhaps more anecdotal at this stage in the game. But if you look at the 2015 graduating class -- and that's the most recent graduating class statistics we have. '16 has less school, but their grace period doesn't end until December, January of '16, '17. I mean, to be 22% better than the year before is -- these are -- remember these are not underwritten loans. These are entitlement loans. So these are borrowers who are benefiting from the economy, benefiting from probably better discipline at the front end of the origination process. And certainly in Navient's case, for Navient-serviced loans, they are benefiting from our targeted outreach campaigns that put us in contact with those borrowers before they become severely delinquent."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and support. This quarter's results continue to reflect the strength of our business model and the value it delivers for our investors.Earlier this year,",1174,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and support. This quarter's results continue to reflect the strength of our business model and the value it delivers for our investors.
Earlier this year, market conditions presented questions on a few items, including credit and access to funding, that placed significant pressure on our funding spreads and our stock price. Our deliberate and directed [ph] actions and our performance this quarter should indisputably put these questions to rest. Our actions also contributed to this quarter's strong results and put us in excellent position to continue to execute on our business plan and deliver value.
I plan to focus my comment this morning on credit performance, funding, including the rating agency, legal final maturity [ph] topic, new business opportunities and creating shareholder value.
Our results this quarter were particularly strong at $0.51 adjusted core earnings per share. The clear standout this quarter and this year has been credit performance. For our private loan portfolio, we have seen consistent and significant improvement in year-over-year delinquency and default trends. 
Credit charges this quarter were down 24% versus last year, and the charge-off rate for the quarter fell to 1.9%. The federal loans we service are also experiencing strong credit performance trends. While the continued recovery in the economy and the jobs market are the prime drivers here, our data-driven approach to loan servicing helps us identify and increase contact rates without risk borrowers. Once in contact, we can help identify solutions, including income-driven repayment programs, that allow borrowers to successfully stay on track.
As an example, the Department of Education released its latest 3-year cohort default data [ph] last month. Once again, Navient service borrowers experienced significantly lower default rates, 31% lower than all other servicers.
We're also a leader in enrolling federal loan customers into income-driven repayment plans. We are proud of these positive borrower experiences and outcomes and welcome policymakers to visit one of our servicing centers to see firsthand how we consistently deliver superior results.
A major priority this year was to demonstrate our access to a broad array of funding options and to materially reduce our near-term unsecured debt maturities. With a well-designed plan and clear demonstration of strong credit and liquidity, we completed new financings in every area of our liability structure, including our first secured financings of new loan types and assets. This activity was capped this quarter with our successful return to the unsecured debt markets, with both a 5-year and later, a 7-year issuance.
Earlier this year, we demonstrated our ability to issue FFELP ABS despite rating agency uncertainty on legacy deals. Year-to-date, we have now completed 6 FFELP deals totaling $4.9 billion using different structures and funding all loan types, including our first bond backed 100% by federal rehabilitation loans. Investor participation has been strong and growing, and funding spreads improved with each deal.
This summer, both Moody's and Fitch announced their new criteria for rating FFELP ABS transactions and have recently begun to apply their criteria to bonds previously placed on watch. While their modeling is complex, and we do not always agree with their predicted impact on cash flows, the issue is finally coming to a close.
While Somsak will cover the details in his comments, we remain committed to working with the rating agencies and investors to minimize ratings impact. Our steady progress and track record in this area is a clear demonstration of this commitment.
As I mentioned, one of our goals this year was to reduce our near-term unsecured debt maturities. Overall, our new financing activity and strong cash flow has allowed us to reduce our 2016 to 2018 unsecured debt maturities by 50%. Including our announced make-whole call of a January 2017 bond later this month, unsecured debt maturities are $700 million next year and $2.1 billion in 2018, well below our projected cash flow.
On the revenue front, our proactive management of interest rate and basis risk has allowed us to earn stable margins on both our federal and private loan portfolios this quarter. We are not, however, immune from market conditions, and so we expect to see a larger impact next quarter as spreads between 1-month and 3-month LIBOR are at historically wide levels. That said, we do believe the current environment is technically driven and short term.  Somsak will provide more detail on this area and our management of the conditions in his remarks.
P [ph] revenue was $179 million this quarter, up from $166 million in the year-ago quarter. We continue to see good growth opportunities that leverage our skills and services, particularly in noneducation-related areas.
I was particularly pleased to win a new contract this quarter to work for the IRS. And while we don't expect to receive first placements until the spring of next year, all of us are excited to put our expertise to work for the IRS and create value for taxpayers and even more employment opportunities at our New York centers.
The acquisition of federal and private loan portfolios is another priority. Year-to-date, we have acquired nearly $3 billion in loans, including $662 million this quarter. And we continue to see opportunities to add to these totals this year and next.
We also continue to aggressively pursue cost savings, particularly efficiency gains. And while we made good progress here in 2016, we have more work to do. Sometimes, these efforts require us to spend more now to create greater savings in the future. One such effort involves moving third-party service loans that we own to our in-house platform. Bringing servicing in-house drives down our future costs and drives up loan performance. We're beginning a new effort here this quarter to move $2.7 billion of loans, and so we will incur higher upfront operating expense in the fourth quarter as we move this portfolio in-house.
We also create value for our investors through our share repurchase program. With a lower stock price, we were able to purchase more shares than we had planned this year. Year-to-date, we have retired 13% of common shares at an average price of $12.21 per share, a price well below our view of intrinsic value. While I would much rather that our stock price traded at intrinsic value, the consolation has been the ability to buy shares at a discount, a significant discount, and to capture that value for our shareholders.
Finally, tomorrow, we will release Money Under 35, our second annual study on millennial financial health. The national survey examines who is faring well and who is struggling in today's economy and drills down on the details by education level, debt and other measures. We conduct the study as part of our efforts to inform policy and identify the groups most in need of help. I hope you watch for the study on Thursday.
I'll now turn the call over to Somsak to provide a deeper look at our financial results, and I look forward to taking your questions later. Somsak?"

This slight increases in expenses is primarily related to the additional operating costs of Gila and Xtend Healthcare acquisitions. Excluding the expenses associated with these 2 acquisitions, our operating expenses were 7% lower than a year ago.
As Jack mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we will transfer $2.7 billion of Navient-owned FFELP loans that are currently being serviced by a third-party for Navient [ph] serving platform. As a result of this transfer, we will incur an additional $7 million of one-time operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Even though these additional expenses were not included in our previous operating expense guidance, we remain on pace to beat our adjusted annual operating expense guidance of $930 million.
Before I go into more detail on our quarterly results, I would like to discuss on Slide 5 the recent widening of the 3-month LIBOR that we saw during the quarter compared to the 1-month LIBOR and the prime rate and how we manage this basis risk.
Approximately $85 billion of our FFELP Loans are indexed to the 1-month LIBOR that reset daily [ph]. After the impact of hedges, about $30 billion of these assets are funded with 3-month LIBOR that resets quarterly. Historically, the spread between these 2 indices have averaged around 11 basis points. In the quarter, the average spread widened to 28 basis points. And today, the spread is closer to 35 basis points.
We believe the recent increase in the average spread is a result of an ongoing anticipation of rate hikes that have yet to occur and the recent money market fund reforms. The spread widening of the 2 indices did not fully impact the third quarter NIM due to the timing of resets associated with our 3-month LIBOR debt.
Approximately $19 billion of this debt had already reset in July before the significant increase in the spread occurred and will reset again on October 25. The remaining $11 billion of debt reset late in the third quarter and had minimal impact to the third quarter FFELP NIM.
Our Private Education Loan net interest margin is impacted by the timing of when our $15 billion of prime-based earning assets reset versus when our LIBOR-based debt reset. $8 billion of these assets are funded with 3-month LIBOR, and $7 billion of these assets are funded with 1-month LIBOR.
Since the last prime reset in December 2015, we've seen LIBOR increase without a corresponding increase in the prime rate. And our guidance will assume LIBOR -- higher LIBOR cost of funds for the fourth quarter without an increase in the prime rate.
Due to the impact of the LIBOR basis risk and the additional one-time $7 million servicing expense, which were not included in our previous EPS guidance, I expect us to be at the midpoint of our previously issued 2016 core EPS guidance of $1.82 to $1.87.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $69 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $70 million in the third quarter of 2015. The FFELP net interest margin improved to 87 basis points due to higher hedge and unhedged [ph] floor income during the quarter.
While the impact of the widening 1-month to 3-month LIBOR spread will be larger in the fourth quarter, we still expect the FFELP net interest margin to remain in the low to mid-80s for the full year and in the low 80s for the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we acquired $596 million of FFELP student loans, bringing the year-to-date total acquisitions to $2.7 billion.
We are optimistic that we will see larger portfolio start to move now that Moody's and Fitch have released their final criterias and have started taking action. We saw significant year-over-year improvement in the credit quality of our FFELP portfolio as late-stage delinquency rates declined by 20%, and the total delinquency rate declined by nearly 30%.
Let's now move to Slide 7 to review our Private Education Loans segment results. Core earnings in this segment declined by $17 million from the year-ago quarter to $60 million. In the quarter, the net interest margin was 348 basis points. And our guidance for the full year NIM in the mid-340s remain intact, but we expect our fourth quarter NIM to be in the low 320s. This guidance includes updated repayment assumptions, our cost of funds from our LIBOR-based debt and no increases in the prime rate during the fourth quarter.
Our provision for Private Education Loan losses continue and improve as a result of the overall improvement in delinquency and charge-off trends. Charge-offs declined $36 million or 24% from the prior year, and loans greater than 90 days delinquent have decreased by $129 million or 15%. The improved performance demonstrates the strong and improving credit quality of our portfolio.
And Slide 8 highlights some of these improvement -- improving trends that we're seeing over the last 5 years. Our third quarter charge-off rate fell to 1.9%, and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.9%.
The chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits, the improved performance is having on our borrowers' most recent FICO scores. FICO scores have improved by 36 basis points over nontraditional loans and 24 points for the entire portfolio on average over the last 5 years. And we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this area.
Let's turn to Slide 9 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter, and that's compared with $79 million in the third quarter of 2015. Noneducation loan-related asset recovery revenues increased $18 million from the year-ago quarter to $46 million. This increase in revenues is primarily related to the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015. Overall, we expect our consolidated Business Services revenue to come in between $620 million and $625 million for the full year.
I would like to highlight our financing activity that took place in the third quarter and give a brief update on the recent actions from the rating agencies on Slide 10. We just issued our second FFELP ABS transaction, 2016-5, that consisted entirely of 100% rehabilitated loans totaling $1 billion in bonds in the quarter. We are seeing an increase in demand for FFELP ABS and investors' willingness to participate in this market. Compared to our prior deal, this transaction saw both an increase in the size of issuance by nearly $0.5 billion, and pricing improved by 13 basis points.
It has now been a few months since Moody's and Fitch have released their final updated cash flow assumptions on FFELP back -- asset-backed securities. As of June 30, these 2 rating agencies have had $56 billion and $51 billion, respectively, of Navient-sponsored bonds on watch for downgrade. Fitch has since affirmed or upgraded $6 billion of bonds and downgraded $0.5 billion of bonds to below investment grade.
Subsequent to the downgrade to non-investment grade, we were able to successfully extend the legal final maturity date on those particular bonds, and Fitch has since upgraded those bonds to AAA. Since the end of the second quarter, Fitch has affirmed or upgraded $4 billion of bonds and have downgraded $1.2 billion of bonds to below investment grade. 
While we continue to wait for Moody's and Fitch to complete their final ratings outcomes, we have been actively extending the legal final maturity date on previously issued bonds. In total, we have now extended the legal final maturity dates on $7.3 billion of bonds.
In the quarter, we completed 2 issuances of unsecured debt totaling $1.3 billion, with maturities in 2021 and 2023. The proceeds of these transactions were used to reduce our unsecured debt by $625 million during the quarter. $538 million of this reduction came through repurchases in the open market.
Additionally, we issued a make-whole call that will be effective on October 25 for an additional $691 million of our unsecured debt that will be due in January 2017. Including this call, we will have reduced our total unsecured debt maturities by $2.1 billion and our near-term maturities in 2017 and '18 by $1.8 billion from the prior year.
In the quarter, we repurchased 14.3 million shares for $200 million at an average price of $13.95. And at quarter end, we have a remaining authority of $180 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaking while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.24.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 11. We recorded third quarter GAAP net income of $230 million or $0.73 a share, and that's compared with; net income of $237 million or $0.63 per share in the third quarter of 2015. The primary differences between the core earnings and GAAP results are the [ph] March-related to our derivative positions and [ph] expenses related to the restructuring of the organization coming from the spin transaction.
I would now open the call for questions."

We actually would break our opportunities for growth into a couple of different buckets here. And certainly there's an opportunity to add to our existing student loan holdings by purchasing legacy assets. This would include both federal and private. And as we said, we think we believe we'll see some significant opportunities in the next several quarters to acquire portfolios in that space and add to the portfolios that we own. Those are, obviously, easy transactions to understand and easy to understand where the value is created there. As we've said all along, however, our view is that we're buying cash flows and so any activity to acquire assets here is going to be extremely disciplined. That if it doesn't add value, we don't buy it. And so those are the kind of the parameters in that space. We also see some opportunity to acquire student loan portfolios that are not legacy performance but ongoing kind of origination activities. These are private loans, and they include both perhaps campus originated loans as well as refinancing loans. And that piece of the opportunity grows -- is a growing opportunity, it's also one that, as you point out, the non-compete issues expire at the end of 2018, and give us some flexibility to back into that space, or total flexibility I should say, if we so choose. That opportunity I think is one that we're interested in. But it is -- it's certainly it's little bit longer out in terms of the time horizon. And then finally, where we really have been focusing our activities operation is taking advantage of the scales and capabilities that we've developed in our operating environments, our operations areas, to leverage those 2 different areas and other asset classes. And so we've been doing that in the municipal and state area. And this is primarily kind of a combination of processing kind of asset recovery work-related work. And the same for the healthcare arena, where it is mostly a processing type business. These are -- both of these areas are ones that we think we can grow in double digits, and we'll continue to work in that space. Adding to that would be opportunities in the federal space. We just recently were awarded the IRS contract, that's something we're very excited about. And we are actively pursuing the Department of Education loan servicing contract, which has moved at a slower pace than they had originally indicated, but still seems to be on track for being really sometime in the fourth quarter."

Buying private loan performing puts much higher demand on capital than a FFELP portfolio does. So it depends a lot on what the opportunities are. But as I said earlier in this call, as I said consistently in the past, buying portfolios has to make sense against all of the alternative activities that we can do, which would include share repurchases."

I think the transaction, the accounts that we acquire the Lowe's transaction and successfully moved to our portfolio as we've indicated before we had actually met more customer confidence than kind of questions or complaints in the process. That gets noticed by not only regulators, it get noticed by sellers. Finally I think the third pieces, of course, is our loan performance. If we can drive moving on to our servicing platform, we can materially differ from as of those both the legacy and default perspective, helping borrowers, become better take advantage of the friend repayment options so that they can successfully repay their loans.

A lot of the recommendations or policy recommendations in that report are actually very consistent with ones that we made almost 2 years ago now. And in terms of creating a more seamless approach of taking a borrower from the reasonable affordable repayments that are required under the rehab program into an income driven repayment plan upon successful completion. We do -- when we take rehab accounts that we acquire in the FFELP space, this is one of the areas that we worked extremely hard at in terms of connecting with borrowers, immediately upon conversion because we don't -- a lot of the data doesn't transfer from the collector to the servicer. It doesn't at all on the Ed side and on the FFELP side, it depends on the guarantor, whether they provide that information to us or not. But we work with those customers to make sure that they are successfully -- that they remain as successful at loan repayment as they did in the rehabilitation process. Our delinquency rates for rehab accounts are substantially better than national averages. And so some of the statistics and projections quoted in the CFPB report will be much, much higher than what we would see in our own service portfolio. This really goes to the data driven approach that we apply to help these customers rehab customers would be considered high risk customer, and they're going to get a unique set of treatments and efforts that result, as we said earlier, in higher rates of right party contacts so that we can walk them through their options and keep them on track."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and support. This quarter's results continue to reflect the strength of our business model and the value it delivers for our investors.Earlier this year,",1170,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and support. This quarter's results continue to reflect the strength of our business model and the value it delivers for our investors.
Earlier this year, market conditions presented questions on a few items, including credit and access to funding, that placed significant pressure on our funding spreads and our stock price. Our deliberate and directed actions and our performance this quarter should indisputably put these questions to rest. Our actions also contributed to this quarter's strong results and put us in excellent position to continue to execute on our business plan and deliver value.
I plan to focus my comment this morning on credit performance, funding, including the rating agency, legal final maturity topic, new business opportunities and creating shareholder value.
Our results this quarter were particularly strong at $0.51 adjusted core earnings per share. The clear standout this quarter and this year has been credit performance. For our private loan portfolio, we have seen consistent and significant improvement in year-over-year delinquency and default trends. 
Credit charges this quarter were down 24% versus last year, and the charge-off rate for the quarter fell to 1.9%. The federal loans we service are also experiencing strong credit performance trends. While the continued recovery in the economy and the jobs market are the prime drivers here, our data-driven approach to loan servicing helps us identify and increase contact rates without risk borrowers. Once in contact, we can help identify solutions, including income-driven repayment programs, that allow borrowers to successfully stay on track.
As an example, the Department of Education released its latest 3-year cohort default data last month. Once again, Navient service borrowers experienced significantly lower default rates, 31% lower than all other servicers.
We're also a leader in enrolling federal loan customers into income-driven repayment plans. We are proud of these positive borrower experiences and outcomes and welcome policymakers to visit one of our servicing centers to see firsthand how we consistently deliver superior results.
A major priority this year was to demonstrate our access to a broad array of funding options and to materially reduce our near-term unsecured debt maturities. With a well-designed plan and clear demonstration of strong credit and liquidity, we completed new financings in every area of our liability structure, including our first secured financings of new loan types and assets. This activity was capped this quarter with our successful return to the unsecured debt markets, with both a 5-year and later, a 7-year issuance.
Earlier this year, we demonstrated our ability to issue FFELP ABS despite rating agency uncertainty on legacy deals. Year-to-date, we have now completed 6 FFELP deals totaling $4.9 billion using different structures and funding all loan types, including our first bond backed 100% by federal rehabilitation loans. Investor participation has been strong and growing, and funding spreads improved with each deal.
This summer, both Moody's and Fitch announced their new criteria for rating FFELP ABS transactions and have recently begun to apply their criteria to bonds previously placed on watch. While their modeling is complex, and we do not always agree with their predicted impact on cash flows, the issue is finally coming to a close.
While Somsak will cover the details in his comments, we remain committed to working with the rating agencies and investors to minimize ratings impact. Our steady progress and track record in this area is a clear demonstration of this commitment.
As I mentioned, one of our goals this year was to reduce our near-term unsecured debt maturities. Overall, our new financing activity and strong cash flow has allowed us to reduce our 2016 to 2018 unsecured debt maturities by 50%. Including our announced make-whole call of a January 2017 bond later this month, unsecured debt maturities are $700 million next year and $2.1 billion in 2018, well below our projected cash flow.
On the revenue front, our proactive management of interest rate and basis risk has allowed us to earn stable margins on both our federal and private loan portfolios this quarter. We are not, however, immune from market conditions, and so we expect to see a larger impact next quarter as spreads between 1-month and 3-month LIBOR are at historically wide levels. That said, we do believe the current environment is technically driven and short term.  Somsak will provide more detail on this area and our management of the conditions in his remarks.
Fee revenue was $179 million this quarter, up from $166 million in the year-ago quarter. We continue to see good growth opportunities that leverage our skills and services, particularly in noneducation-related areas.
I was particularly pleased to win a new contract this quarter to work for the IRS. And while we don't expect to receive first placements until the spring of next year, all of us are excited to put our expertise to work for the IRS and create value for taxpayers and even more employment opportunities at our New York centers.
The acquisition of federal and private loan portfolios is another priority. Year-to-date, we have acquired nearly $3 billion in loans, including $662 million this quarter. And we continue to see opportunities to add to these totals this year and next.
We also continue to aggressively pursue cost savings, particularly efficiency gains. And while we made good progress here in 2016, we have more work to do. Sometimes, these efforts require us to spend more now to create greater savings in the future. One such effort involves moving third-party service loans that we own to our in-house platform. Bringing servicing in-house drives down our future costs and drives up loan performance. We're beginning a new effort here this quarter to move $2.7 billion of loans, and so we will incur higher upfront operating expense in the fourth quarter as we move this portfolio in-house.
We also create value for our investors through our share repurchase program. With a lower stock price, we were able to purchase more shares than we had planned this year. Year-to-date, we have retired 13% of common shares at an average price of $12.21 per share, a price well below our view of intrinsic value. While I would much rather that our stock price traded at intrinsic value, the consolation has been the ability to buy shares at a discount, a significant discount, and to capture that value for our shareholders.
Finally, tomorrow, we will release Money Under 35, our second annual study on millennial financial health. The national survey examines who is faring well and who is struggling in today's economy and drills down on the details by education level, debt and other measures. We conduct the study as part of our efforts to inform policy and identify the groups most in need of help. I hope you watch for the study on Thursday.
I'll now turn the call over to Somsak to provide a deeper look at our financial results, and I look forward to taking your questions later. Somsak?"
260005529,403851830,1056796,"Navient Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Navient Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll review the strong third quarter results that we reported last night as well as an update on our earnings guidance for the full year. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation,",1593,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll review the strong third quarter results that we reported last night as well as an update on our earnings guidance for the full year. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on the company's website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the third quarter, we reported adjusted core EPS of $0.51, and that's compared to $0.48 from a year-ago quarter. Our third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $222 million versus $220 million from a year-ago quarter. This slight increases in expenses is primarily related to the additional operating costs of Gila and Xtend Healthcare acquisitions. Excluding the expenses associated with these 2 acquisitions, our operating expenses were 7% lower than a year ago.
As Jack mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we will transfer $2.7 billion of Navient-owned FFELP loans that are currently being serviced by a third-party for Navient servicing platform. As a result of this transfer, we will incur an additional $7 million of one-time operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Even though these additional expenses were not included in our previous operating expense guidance, we remain on pace to beat our adjusted annual operating expense guidance of $930 million.
Before I go into more detail on our quarterly results, I would like to discuss on Slide 5 the recent widening of the 3-month LIBOR that we saw during the quarter compared to the 1-month LIBOR and the prime rate and how we manage this basis risk.
Approximately $85 billion of our FFELP Loans are indexed to the 1-month LIBOR that reset daily. After the impact of hedges, about $30 billion of these assets are funded with 3-month LIBOR that resets quarterly. Historically, the spread between these 2 indices have averaged around 11 basis points. In the quarter, the average spread widened to 28 basis points. And today, the spread is closer to 35 basis points.
We believe the recent increase in the average spread is a result of an ongoing anticipation of rate hikes that have yet to occur and the recent money market fund reforms. The spread widening of the 2 indices did not fully impact the third quarter NIM due to the timing of resets associated with our 3-month LIBOR debt.
Approximately $19 billion of this debt had already reset in July before the significant increase in the spread occurred and will reset again on October 25. The remaining $11 billion of debt reset late in the third quarter and had minimal impact to the third quarter FFELP NIM.
Our Private Education Loan net interest margin is impacted by the timing of when our $15 billion of prime-based earning assets reset versus when our LIBOR-based debt reset. $8 billion of these assets are funded with 3-month LIBOR, and $7 billion of these assets are funded with 1-month LIBOR.
Since the last prime reset in December 2015, we've seen LIBOR increase without a corresponding increase in the prime rate. And our guidance will assume LIBOR -- higher LIBOR cost of funds for the fourth quarter without an increase in the prime rate.
Due to the impact of the LIBOR basis risk and the additional one-time $7 million servicing expense, which were not included in our previous EPS guidance, I expect us to be at the midpoint of our previously issued 2016 core EPS guidance of $1.82 to $1.87.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $69 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $70 million in the third quarter of 2015. The FFELP net interest margin improved to 87 basis points due to higher hedge and unhedged floor income during the quarter.
While the impact of the widening 1-month to 3-month LIBOR spread will be larger in the fourth quarter, we still expect the FFELP net interest margin to remain in the low to mid-80s for the full year and in the low 80s for the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we acquired $596 million of FFELP student loans, bringing the year-to-date total acquisitions to $2.7 billion.
We are optimistic that we will see larger portfolio start to move now that Moody's and Fitch have released their final criterias and have started taking action. We saw significant year-over-year improvement in the credit quality of our FFELP portfolio as late-stage delinquency rates declined by 20%, and the total delinquency rate declined by nearly 30%.
Let's now move to Slide 7 to review our Private Education Loans segment results. Core earnings in this segment declined by $17 million from the year-ago quarter to $60 million. In the quarter, the net interest margin was 348 basis points. And our guidance for the full year NIM in the mid-340s remain intact, but we expect our fourth quarter NIM to be in the low 320s. This guidance includes updated repayment assumptions, our cost of funds from our LIBOR-based debt and no increases in the prime rate during the fourth quarter.
Our provision for Private Education Loan losses continue and improve as a result of the overall improvement in delinquency and charge-off trends. Charge-offs declined $36 million or 24% from the prior year, and loans greater than 90 days delinquent have decreased by $129 million or 15%. The improved performance demonstrates the strong and improving credit quality of our portfolio.
And Slide 8 highlights some of these improvement -- improving trends that we're seeing over the last 5 years. Our third quarter charge-off rate fell to 1.9%, and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.9%.
The chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits, the improved performance is having on our borrowers' most recent FICO scores. FICO scores have improved by 36 basis points over nontraditional loans and 24 points for the entire portfolio on average over the last 5 years. And we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this area.
Let's turn to Slide 9 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter, and that's compared with $79 million in the third quarter of 2015. Noneducation loan-related asset recovery revenues increased $18 million from the year-ago quarter to $46 million. This increase in revenues is primarily related to the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015. Overall, we expect our consolidated Business Services revenue to come in between $620 million and $625 million for the full year.
I would like to highlight our financing activity that took place in the third quarter and give a brief update on the recent actions from the rating agencies on Slide 10. We just issued our second FFELP ABS transaction, 2016-5, that consisted entirely of 100% rehabilitated loans totaling $1 billion in bonds in the quarter. We are seeing an increase in demand for FFELP ABS and investors' willingness to participate in this market. Compared to our prior deal, this transaction saw both an increase in the size of issuance by nearly $0.5 billion, and pricing improved by 13 basis points.
It has now been a few months since Moody's and Fitch have released their final updated cash flow assumptions on FFELP back -- asset-backed securities. As of June 30, these 2 rating agencies have had $56 billion and $51 billion, respectively, of Navient-sponsored bonds on watch for downgrade. Fitch has since affirmed or upgraded $6 billion of bonds and downgraded $0.5 billion of bonds to below investment grade.
Subsequent to the downgrade to non-investment grade, we were able to successfully extend the legal final maturity date on those particular bonds, and Fitch has since upgraded those bonds to AAA. Since the end of the second quarter, Fitch has affirmed or upgraded $4 billion of bonds and have downgraded $1.2 billion of bonds to below investment grade. 
While we continue to wait for Moody's and Fitch to complete their final ratings outcomes, we have been actively extending the legal final maturity date on previously issued bonds. In total, we have now extended the legal final maturity dates on $7.3 billion of bonds.
In the quarter, we completed 2 issuances of unsecured debt totaling $1.3 billion, with maturities in 2021 and 2023. The proceeds of these transactions were used to reduce our unsecured debt by $625 million during the quarter. $538 million of this reduction came through repurchases in the open market.
Additionally, we issued a make-whole call that will be effective on October 25 for an additional $691 million of our unsecured debt that will be due in January 2017. Including this call, we will have reduced our total unsecured debt maturities by $2.1 billion and our near-term maturities in 2017 and '18 by $1.8 billion from the prior year.
In the quarter, we repurchased 14.3 million shares for $200 million at an average price of $13.95. And at quarter end, we have a remaining authority of $180 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaking while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.24.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 11. We recorded third quarter GAAP net income of $230 million or $0.73 a share, and that's compared with; net income of $237 million or $0.63 per share in the third quarter of 2015. The primary differences between the core earnings and GAAP results are the march related to our derivative positions and any expenses related to the restructuring of the organization coming from the spin transaction.
I would now open the call for questions."

I think we actually would break our opportunities for growth into a couple of different buckets here. And certainly, there's an opportunity to add to our existing student loan holdings by purchasing legacy assets. This would include both federal and private. And as we've said, we think -- we believe we'll see some significant opportunities in the next several quarters to acquire portfolios in that space and add to the portfolios that we own. Those are, obviously, easy transactions to understand and easy to understand where the value is created there. As we've said all along, however, our view is that we're buying cash flows, and so any activity to acquire assets here is going to be extremely disciplined that if it doesn't add value, we don't buy it. And so those are the kind of the parameters in that space. We also see some opportunity to acquire student loan portfolios that are not legacy portfolios but ongoing kind of origination activities. These are private loans, and they include both perhaps campus-originated loans as well as refinancing loans. And that piece of the opportunity grows -- is a growing opportunity. It's also one that, as you point out, the non-compete issues expire at the end of 2018 and give us some flexibility to back into that space -- or total flexibility, I should say, if we so choose. That opportunity, I think, is one that we are interested in. But it is -- it's certainly -- it's a little bit longer out in terms of the time horizon. And then finally, where we really have been focusing our activities is this operation is taking advantage of the scales and capabilities that we've developed in our operating environments, our operations areas, to leverage those 2 different areas in other asset classes. And so we've been doing that in the municipal and state area. And this is primarily kind of a combination of processing kind of asset recovery work-related work. And the same for the health care arena, where it is mostly a processing type business. These are -- both of these areas are ones that we think we can grow in double-digits. And we'll continue to work in that space. Adding to that would be opportunities in the federal space. We just recently were awarded the IRS contract. That's something we're very excited about. And we are actively pursuing the Department of Education loan servicing contract, which has moved at a slower pace than they had originally indicated, but still seems to be on track for being released sometime in the fourth quarter."

And so as you get back to the par type of marketplace, you have that -- you have a different environment. We think the opportunity -- why we think FFELP opportunities will be there is that the majority of portfolios that are available are serviced by third parties. And the regulatory requirements associated with kind of monitoring third parties and managing that process can start to make some of these deals less attractive, the portfolio is less attractive to hold. And hopefully, it will result in us seeing opportunities to acquire those in the near term, as we said."

And our share repurchase authority is something that will be presented and discussed with the board in upcoming meetings. There's been no discussion to date. Historically, though we have set that level of capital return to be a function of the capital we generate, from our business, that is not required to support balance sheet growth or other operating activity growth. It also would include any capital release from the amortization of the portfolios. As you know, buying FFELP portfolios puts very little demand on capital. Buying private loan portfolios puts much higher demand on capital than a FFELP portfolio does. So it depends a lot on what the opportunities are. But as I said earlier in this call and as said consistently in the past, buying portfolios has to make sense against all of the alternative activities that we can do, which would include share repurchases."

I think the transaction -- the accounts that we acquire through the lowest transaction and successfully moved to our portfolio, as we've indicated before, we had actually met more customer compliments than kind of questions or complaints in that process. That gets noticed by not only regulators, it gets noticed by sellers. And then finally, I think the third piece is, of course, is our loan performance.

That was priced at a reoffer rate of around L plus 115, which was a 10% -- or a 10 basis point improvement over our last FFELP deal. So it's continue -- sequentially, from deal to deal, it's come in from 10 to 13 basis points."

And those strengths are really a data-driven kind of approach so that we are -- this is not just a pure kind of dialing for dialing activity that we pursue. We actually worked to identify the right contact methods for customers based on all of the historical success rates we've had in this particular area and used those to minimize the number of attempts that we make to contact the customer and do so in a way that creates a higher right-party contact rate.

And in terms of creating a more seamless approach of taking a borrower from the reasonable affordable repayments that are required under the rehab program into an income-driven repayment plan upon successful completion. We do -- when we take rehab accounts that we acquire in the FFELP space, this is one of the areas that we work extremely hard at in terms of connecting with borrowers immediately upon conversion as we don't -- a lot of the data doesn't transfer from the collector to the servicer. It doesn't at all on the Ed side. And on the FFELP side, it depends on the guarantor, whether they provide that information to us or not. But we work with those customers to make sure that they are successfully -- that they remain as successful at loan repayment as they did in the rehabilitation process. Our delinquency rates for rehab accounts are substantially better than the national averages. And so some of the statistics and projections quoted in the CFPB report would be much, much higher than what we would see in our own service portfolio. This really goes to the data-driven approach that we apply to help these customers. Rehab customers would be considered a high-risk customer, and they're going to get a unique set of treatments and efforts that result, as we said earlier, in higher rates of right-party contacts so that we can walk them through their options and keep them on track."

With me today are Jack Remondi, our CEO; and Somsak Chivavibul, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.
Before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors in the company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.
During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP measures we call our core earnings. A description of core earnings, a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the third quarter 2016 supplemental earnings disclosure. This is posted on the Investor page at navient.com.
Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Jack."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and support. This quarter's results continue to reflect the strength of our business model and the value it delivers for our investors.Earlier this year,",1169,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and support. This quarter's results continue to reflect the strength of our business model and the value it delivers for our investors.
Earlier this year, market conditions presented questions on a few items, including credit and access to funding, that placed significant pressure on our funding spreads and our stock price. Our deliberate and directed actions and our performance this quarter should indisputably put these questions to rest. Our actions also contributed to this quarter's strong results and put us in excellent position to continue to execute on our business plan and deliver value.
I plan to focus my comments this morning on credit performance, funding, including the rating agency, legal final maturity topic, new business opportunities and creating shareholder value.
Our results this quarter were particularly strong at $0.51 adjusted core earnings per share. The clear standout this quarter and this year has been credit performance. For our private loan portfolio, we have seen consistent and significant improvement in year-over-year delinquency and default trends. 
Credit charges this quarter were down 24% versus last year, and the charge-off rate for the quarter fell to 1.9%. The federal loans we service are also experiencing strong credit performance trends. While the continued recovery in the economy and the jobs market are the prime drivers here, our data-driven approach to loan servicing helps us identify and increase contact rates without risk borrowers. Once in contact, we can help identify solutions, including income-driven repayment programs, that allow borrowers to successfully stay on track.
As an example, the Department of Education released its latest 3-year cohort default data last month. Once again, Navient service borrowers experienced significantly lower default rates, 31% lower than all other servicers.
We're also a leader in enrolling federal loan customers into income-driven repayment plans. We are proud of these positive borrower experiences and outcomes and welcome policymakers to visit one of our servicing centers to see firsthand how we consistently deliver superior results.
A major priority this year was to demonstrate our access to a broad array of funding options and to materially reduce our near-term unsecured debt maturities. With a well-designed plan and clear demonstration of strong credit and liquidity, we completed new financings in every area of our liability structure, including our first secured financings of new loan types and assets. This activity was capped this quarter with our successful return to the unsecured debt markets, with both a 5-year and later 7-year issuance.
Earlier this year, we demonstrated our ability to issue FFELP ABS despite rating agency uncertainty on legacy deals. Year-to-date, we have now completed 6 FFELP deals totaling $4.9 billion using different structures and funding all loan types, including our first bond backed 100% by federal rehabilitation loans. Investor participation has been strong and growing, and funding spreads improved with each deal.
This summer, both Moody's and Fitch announced their new criteria for rating FFELP ABS transactions and have recently begun to apply their criteria to bonds previously placed on watch. While their modeling is complex, and we do not always agree with their predicted impact on cash flows, the issue is finally coming to a close.
While Somsak will cover the details in his comments, we remain committed to working with the rating agencies and investors to minimize ratings impact. Our steady progress and track record in this area is a clear demonstration of this commitment.
As I mentioned, one of our goals this year was to reduce our near-term unsecured debt maturities. Overall, our new financing activity and strong cash flow has allowed us to reduce our 2016 to 2018 unsecured debt maturities by 50%. Including our announced make-whole call of a January 2017 bond later this month, unsecured debt maturities are $700 million next year and $2.1 billion in 2018, well below our projected cash flow.
On the revenue front, our proactive management of interest rate and basis risk has allowed us to earn stable margins on both our federal and private loan portfolios this quarter. We are not, however, immune from market conditions, and so we expect to see a larger impact next quarter as spreads between 1-month and 3-month LIBOR are at historically wide levels. That said, we do believe the current environment is technically driven and short term.  Somsak will provide more detail on this area and our management of the conditions in his remarks.
Fee revenue was $179 million this quarter, up from $166 million in the year-ago quarter. We continue to see good growth opportunities that leverage our skills and services, particularly in noneducation-related areas.
I was particularly pleased to win a new contract this quarter to work for the IRS. And while we don't expect to receive first placements until the spring of next year, all of us are excited to put our expertise to work for the IRS and create value for taxpayers and even more employment opportunities at our New York centers.
The acquisition of federal and private loan portfolios is another priority. Year-to-date, we have acquired nearly $3 billion in loans, including $662 million this quarter. And we continue to see opportunities to add to these totals this year and next.
We also continue to aggressively pursue cost savings, particularly efficiency gains. And while we made good progress here in 2016, we have more work to do. Sometimes, these efforts require us to spend more now to create greater savings in the future. One such effort involves moving third-party service loans that we own to our in-house platform. Bringing servicing in-house drives down our future costs and drives up loan performance. We're beginning a new effort here this quarter to move $2.7 billion of loans, and so we will incur higher upfront operating expense in the fourth quarter as we move this portfolio in-house.
We also create value for our investors through our share repurchase program. With a lower stock price, we were able to purchase more shares than we had planned this year. Year-to-date, we have retired 13% of common shares at an average price of $12.21 per share, a price well below our view of intrinsic value. While I would much rather that our stock price traded at intrinsic value, the consolation has been the ability to buy shares at a discount, a significant discount, and to capture that value for our shareholders.
Finally, tomorrow, we will release Money Under 35, our second annual study on millennial financial health. The national survey examines who is faring well and who is struggling in today's economy and drills down on the details by education level, debt and other measures. We conduct the study as part of our efforts to inform policy and identify the groups most in need of help. I hope you watch for the study on Thursday.
I'll now turn the call over to Somsak to provide a deeper look at our financial results, and I look forward to taking your questions later. Somsak?"
260005529,403851830,1056894,"Navient Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Navient Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll review the strong third quarter results that we reported last night as well as an update on our earnings guidance for the full year. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation,",1593,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll review the strong third quarter results that we reported last night as well as an update on our earnings guidance for the full year. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on the company's website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the third quarter, we reported adjusted core EPS of $0.51, and that's compared to $0.48 from a year-ago quarter. Our third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $222 million versus $220 million from a year-ago quarter. This slight increases in expenses is primarily related to the additional operating costs of Gila and Xtend Healthcare acquisitions. Excluding the expenses associated with these 2 acquisitions, our operating expenses were 7% lower than a year ago.
As Jack mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we will transfer $2.7 billion of Navient-owned FFELP loans that are currently being serviced by a third-party for Navient servicing platform. As a result of this transfer, we will incur an additional $7 million of one-time operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Even though these additional expenses were not included in our previous operating expense guidance, we remain on pace to beat our adjusted annual operating expense guidance of $930 million.
Before I go into more detail on our quarterly results, I would like to discuss on Slide 5 the recent widening of the 3-month LIBOR that we saw during the quarter compared to the 1-month LIBOR and the prime rate and how we manage this basis risk.
Approximately $85 billion of our FFELP Loans are indexed to the 1-month LIBOR that reset daily. After the impact of hedges, about $30 billion of these assets are funded with 3-month LIBOR that resets quarterly. Historically, the spread between these 2 indices have averaged around 11 basis points. In the quarter, the average spread widened to 28 basis points. And today, the spread is closer to 35 basis points.
We believe the recent increase in the average spread is a result of an ongoing anticipation of rate hikes that have yet to occur and the recent money market fund reforms. The spread widening of the 2 indices did not fully impact the third quarter NIM due to the timing of resets associated with our 3-month LIBOR debt.
Approximately $19 billion of this debt had already reset in July before the significant increase in the spread occurred and will reset again on October 25. The remaining $11 billion of debt reset late in the third quarter and had minimal impact to the third quarter FFELP NIM.
Our Private Education Loan net interest margin is impacted by the timing of when our $15 billion of prime-based earning assets reset versus when our LIBOR-based debt reset. $8 billion of these assets are funded with 3-month LIBOR, and $7 billion of these assets are funded with 1-month LIBOR.
Since the last prime reset in December 2015, we've seen LIBOR increase without a corresponding increase in the prime rate. And our guidance will assume LIBOR -- higher LIBOR cost of funds for the fourth quarter without an increase in the prime rate.
Due to the impact of the LIBOR basis risk and the additional one-time $7 million servicing expense, which were not included in our previous EPS guidance, I expect us to be at the midpoint of our previously issued 2016 core EPS guidance of $1.82 to $1.87.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $69 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $70 million in the third quarter of 2015. The FFELP net interest margin improved to 87 basis points due to higher hedge and unhedged floor income during the quarter.
While the impact of the widening 1-month to 3-month LIBOR spread will be larger in the fourth quarter, we still expect the FFELP net interest margin to remain in the low to mid-80s for the full year and in the low 80s for the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we acquired $596 million of FFELP student loans, bringing the year-to-date total acquisitions to $2.7 billion.
We are optimistic that we will see larger portfolio start to move now that Moody's and Fitch have released their final criterias and have started taking action. We saw significant year-over-year improvement in the credit quality of our FFELP portfolio as late-stage delinquency rates declined by 20%, and the total delinquency rate declined by nearly 30%.
Let's now move to Slide 7 to review our Private Education Loans segment results. Core earnings in this segment declined by $17 million from the year-ago quarter to $60 million. In the quarter, the net interest margin was 348 basis points. And our guidance for the full year NIM in the mid-340s remain intact, but we expect our fourth quarter NIM to be in the low 320s. This guidance includes updated repayment assumptions, our cost of funds from our LIBOR-based debt and no increases in the prime rate during the fourth quarter.
Our provision for Private Education Loan losses continue and improve as a result of the overall improvement in delinquency and charge-off trends. Charge-offs declined $36 million or 24% from the prior year, and loans greater than 90 days delinquent have decreased by $129 million or 15%. The improved performance demonstrates the strong and improving credit quality of our portfolio.
And Slide 8 highlights some of these improvement -- improving trends that we're seeing over the last 5 years. Our third quarter charge-off rate fell to 1.9%, and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.9%.
The chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits, the improved performance is having on our borrowers' most recent FICO scores. FICO scores have improved by 36 basis points over nontraditional loans and 24 points for the entire portfolio on average over the last 5 years. And we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this area.
Let's turn to Slide 9 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter, and that's compared with $79 million in the third quarter of 2015. Noneducation loan-related asset recovery revenues increased $18 million from the year-ago quarter to $46 million. This increase in revenues is primarily related to the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015. Overall, we expect our consolidated Business Services revenue to come in between $620 million and $625 million for the full year.
I would like to highlight our financing activity that took place in the third quarter and give a brief update on the recent actions from the rating agencies on Slide 10. We just issued our second FFELP ABS transaction, 2016-5, that consisted entirely of 100% rehabilitated loans totaling $1 billion in bonds in the quarter. We are seeing an increase in demand for FFELP ABS and investors' willingness to participate in this market. Compared to our prior deal, this transaction saw both an increase in the size of issuance by nearly $0.5 billion, and pricing improved by 13 basis points.
It has now been a few months since Moody's and Fitch have released their final updated cash flow assumptions on FFELP back -- asset-backed securities. As of June 30, these 2 rating agencies have had $56 billion and $51 billion, respectively, of Navient-sponsored bonds on watch for downgrade. Fitch has since affirmed or upgraded $6 billion of bonds and downgraded $0.5 billion of bonds to below investment grade.
Subsequent to the downgrade to non-investment grade, we were able to successfully extend the legal final maturity date on those particular bonds, and Fitch has since upgraded those bonds to AAA. Since the end of the second quarter, Fitch has affirmed or upgraded $4 billion of bonds and have downgraded $1.2 billion of bonds to below investment grade. 
While we continue to wait for Moody's and Fitch to complete their final ratings outcomes, we have been actively extending the legal final maturity date on previously issued bonds. In total, we have now extended the legal final maturity dates on $7.3 billion of bonds.
In the quarter, we completed 2 issuances of unsecured debt totaling $1.3 billion, with maturities in 2021 and 2023. The proceeds of these transactions were used to reduce our unsecured debt by $625 million during the quarter. $538 million of this reduction came through repurchases in the open market.
Additionally, we issued a make-whole call that will be effective on October 25 for an additional $691 million of our unsecured debt that will be due in January 2017. Including this call, we will have reduced our total unsecured debt maturities by $2.1 billion and our near-term maturities in 2017 and '18 by $1.8 billion from the prior year.
In the quarter, we repurchased 14.3 million shares of $200 million at an average price of $13.95. And at quarter end, we have a remaining authority of $180 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaking while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.24.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 11. We recorded third quarter GAAP net income of $230 million or $0.73 a share, and that's compared with net income of $237 million or $0.63 per share in the third quarter of 2015. The primary differences between the core earnings and GAAP results are the march related to our derivative positions and any expenses related to the restructuring of the organization coming from the spin transaction.
I would now open the call for questions."

I think we actually would break our opportunities for growth into a couple of different buckets here. And certainly, there's an opportunity to add to our existing student loan holdings by purchasing legacy assets. This would include both federal and private. And as we've said, we think -- we believe we'll see some significant opportunities in the next several quarters to acquire portfolios in that space and add to the portfolios that we own. Those are, obviously, easy transactions to understand and easy to understand where the value is created there. As we've said all along, however, our view is that we're buying cash flows, and so any activity to acquire assets here is going to be extremely disciplined that if it doesn't add value, we don't buy it. And so those are the kind of the parameters in that space. We also see some opportunity to acquire student loan portfolios that are not legacy portfolios but ongoing kind of origination activities. These are private loans, and they include both perhaps campus-originated loans as well as refinancing loans. And that piece of the opportunity grows -- is a growing opportunity. It's also one that, as you point out, the non-compete issues expire at the end of 2018 and give us some flexibility to back into that space -- or total flexibility, I should say, if we so choose. That opportunity, I think, is one that we are interested in. But it is -- it's certainly -- it's a little bit longer route in terms of the time horizon. And then finally, where we really have been focusing our activities is this operation is taking advantage of the scales and capabilities that we've developed in our operating environments, our operations areas, to leverage those 2 different areas in other asset classes. And so we've been doing that in the municipal and state area. And this is primarily kind of a combination of processing kind of asset recovery work-related work. And the same for the health care arena, where it is mostly a processing type business. These are -- both of these areas are ones that we think we can grow in double-digits. And we'll continue to work in that space. Adding to that would be opportunities in the federal space. We just recently were awarded the IRS contract. That's something we're very excited about. And we are actively pursuing the Department of Education loan servicing contract, which has moved at a slower pace than they had originally indicated, but still seems to be on track for being released sometime in the fourth quarter."

And for our government-guaranteed loan, that's just a difficult transaction for sellers to get excited about. And so as you get back to the par type of marketplace, you have that -- you have a different environment. We think the opportunity -- why we think FFELP opportunities will be there is that the majority of portfolios that are available are serviced by third parties. And the regulatory requirements associated with kind of monitoring third parties and managing that process can start to make some of these deals less attractive, the portfolio is less attractive to hold. And hopefully, it will result in seeing opportunities to acquire those in the near term, as we said."

And our share repurchase authority is something that will be presented and discussed with the board in upcoming meetings. There's been no discussion to date. Historically, though we have set that level of capital return to be a function of the capital we generate, from our business, that is not required to support balance sheet growth or other operating activity growth. It also would include any capital release from the amortization of the portfolios. As you know, buying FFELP portfolios puts very little demand on capital. Buying private loan portfolios puts much higher demand on capital than a FFELP portfolio does. So it depends a lot on what the opportunities are. But as I said earlier in this call and as said consistently in the past, buying portfolios has to make sense against all of the alternative activities that we can do, which would include share repurchases."

I think the transaction -- the accounts that we acquire through the lowest transaction and successfully moved to our portfolio, as we've indicated before, we had actually met more customer compliments than kind of questions or complaints in that process. That gets noticed by not only regulators, it gets noticed by sellers. And then finally, I think the third piece is, of course, is our loan performance. If we can drive -- if I move in loans onto our servicing platform, we can materially improve the performance of loans from both a delinquency and default perspective, helping borrowers become -- better take advantage of different repayment options so that they can successfully repay their loans.

It's not just as a recovery that we see the opportunity, but actually being more of a processing partner with the entity so that we can manage the end-to-end process of everything, from billing to payment processing, to pursuing recovery of the payment on the invoice. The IRS contract is a good example. It's certainly larger than the education-related space and is something that we're pretty excited about. And then finally, I think some of the changes in the regulatory environment and requirements that are coming from rules and regulations here really play to our strengths. And those strengths are really a data-driven kind of approach so that we are -- this is not just a pure kind of dialing for dialing activity that we pursue. We actually worked to identify the right contact methods for customers based on all of the historical success rates we've had in this particular area and used those to minimize the number of attempts that we make to contact the customer and do so in a way that creates a higher right-party contact rate. And that is the key to default prevention in the student loan space, and it's the key to the recovery rates by being able to get a customer on the phone and explain their options to them and work with them to find a solution that fits their budgets."

A lot of the recommendations or policy recommendations in that report are actually very consistent with one that we made almost 2 years ago now. And in terms of creating a more seamless approach of taking a borrower from the reasonable affordable repayments that are required under the rehab program into an income-driven repayment plan upon successful completion. We do -- when we take rehab accounts that we acquire in the FFELP space, this is one of the areas that we work extremely hard at in terms of connecting with borrowers immediately upon conversion cause we don't -- a lot of the data doesn't transfer from the collector to the servicer. It doesn't at all on the Ed side. And on the FFELP side, it depends on the guarantor, whether they provide that information to us or not. But we work with those customers to make sure that they are successfully -- that they remain as successful at loan repayment as they did in the rehabilitation process. Our delinquency rates for rehab accounts are substantially better than the national averages. And so some of the statistics and projections quoted in the CFPB report would be much, much higher than what we would see in our own service portfolio. This really goes to the data-driven approach that we apply to help these customers. Rehab customers would be considered a high-risk customer, and they're going to get a unique set of treatments and efforts that result, as we said earlier, in higher rates of right-party contacts so that we can walk them through their options and keep them on track."

This quarter's results continue to reflect the strength of our business model and the value it delivers for our investors.Earlier this year,",1169,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and support. This quarter's results continue to reflect the strength of our business model and the value it delivers for our investors.
Earlier this year, market conditions presented questions on a few items, including credit and access to funding, that placed significant pressure on our funding spreads and our stock price. Our deliberate and directed actions and our performance this quarter should indisputably put these questions to rest. Our actions also contributed to this quarter's strong results and put us in excellent position to continue to execute on our business plan and deliver value.
I plan to focus my comments this morning on credit performance, funding, including the rating agency, legal final maturity topic, new business opportunities and creating shareholder value.
Our results this quarter were particularly strong at $0.51 adjusted core earnings per share. The clear standout this quarter and this year has been credit performance. For our private loan portfolio, we have seen consistent and significant improvement in year-over-year delinquency and default trends. 
Credit charges this quarter were down 24% versus last year, and the charge-off rate for the quarter fell to 1.9%. The federal loans we service are also experiencing strong credit performance trends. While the continued recovery in the economy and the jobs market are the prime drivers here, our data-driven approach to loan servicing helps us identify and increase contact rates without risk borrowers. Once in contact, we can help identify solutions, including income-driven repayment programs, that allow borrowers to successfully stay on track.
As an example, the Department of Education released its latest 3-year cohort default data last month. Once again, Navient service borrowers experienced significantly lower default rates, 31% lower than all other servicers.
We're also a leader in enrolling federal loan customers into income-driven repayment plans. We are proud of these positive borrower experiences and outcomes and welcome policymakers to visit one of our servicing centers to see firsthand how we consistently deliver superior results.
A major priority this year was to demonstrate our access to a broad array of funding options and to materially reduce our near-term unsecured debt maturities. With a well-designed plan and clear demonstration of strong credit and liquidity, we completed new financings in every area of our liability structure, including our first secured financings of new loan types and assets. This activity was capped this quarter with our successful return to the unsecured debt markets, with both a 5-year and later 7-year issuance.
Earlier this year, we demonstrated our ability to issue FFELP ABS despite rating agency uncertainty on legacy deals. Year-to-date, we have now completed 6 FFELP deals totaling $4.9 billion using different structures and funding all loan types, including our first bond backed 100% by federal rehabilitation loans. Investor participation has been strong and growing, and funding spreads improved with each deal.
This summer, both Moody's and Fitch announced their new criteria for rating FFELP ABS transactions and have recently begun to apply their criteria to bonds previously placed on watch. While their modeling is complex, and we do not always agree with their predicted impact on cash flows, the issue is finally coming to a close.
While Somsak will cover the details in his comments, we remain committed to working with the rating agencies and investors to minimize ratings impact. Our steady progress and track record in this area is a clear demonstration of this commitment.
As I mentioned, one of our goals this year was to reduce our near-term unsecured debt maturities. Overall, our new financing activity and strong cash flow has allowed us to reduce our 2016 to 2018 unsecured debt maturities by 50%. Including our announced make-whole call of a January 2017 bond later this month, unsecured debt maturities are $700 million next year and $2.1 billion in 2018, well below our projected cash flow.
On the revenue front, our proactive management of interest rate and basis risk has allowed us to earn stable margins on both our federal and private loan portfolios this quarter. We are not, however, immune from market conditions, and so we expect to see a larger impact next quarter as spreads between 1-month and 3-month LIBOR are at historically wide levels. That said, we do believe the current environment is technically driven and short term.  Somsak will provide more detail on this area and our management of the conditions in his remarks.
Fee revenue was $179 million this quarter, up from $166 million in the year-ago quarter. We continue to see good growth opportunities that leverage our skills and services, particularly in noneducation-related areas.
I was particularly pleased to win a new contract this quarter to work for the IRS. And while we don't expect to receive first placements until the spring of next year, all of us are excited to put our expertise to work for the IRS and create value for taxpayers and even more employment opportunities at our New York centers.
The acquisition of federal and private loan portfolios is another priority. Year-to-date, we have acquired nearly $3 billion in loans, including $662 million this quarter. And we continue to see opportunities to add to these totals this year and next.
We also continue to aggressively pursue cost savings, particularly efficiency gains. And while we made good progress here in 2016, we have more work to do. Sometimes, these efforts require us to spend more now to create greater savings in the future. One such effort involves moving third-party service loans that we own to our in-house platform. Bringing servicing in-house drives down our future costs and drives up loan performance. We're beginning a new effort here this quarter to move $2.7 billion of loans, and so we will incur higher upfront operating expense in the fourth quarter as we move this portfolio in-house.
We also create value for our investors through our share repurchase program. With a lower stock price, we were able to purchase more shares than we had planned this year. Year-to-date, we have retired 13% of common shares at an average price of $12.21 per share, a price well below our view of intrinsic value. While I would much rather that our stock price traded at intrinsic value, the consolation has been the ability to buy shares at a discount, a significant discount, and to capture that value for our shareholders.
Finally, tomorrow, we will release Money Under 35, our second annual study on millennial financial health. The national survey examines who is faring well and who is struggling in today's economy and drills down on the details by education level, debt and other measures. We conduct the study as part of our efforts to inform policy and identify the groups most in need of help. I hope you watch for the study on Thursday.
I'll now turn the call over to Somsak to provide a deeper look at our financial results, and I look forward to taking your questions later. Somsak?"

During my prepared remarks, I'll review the strong third quarter results that we reported last night as well as an update on our earnings guidance for the full year. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation,",1593,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll review the strong third quarter results that we reported last night as well as an update on our earnings guidance for the full year. I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on the company's website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the third quarter, we reported adjusted core EPS of $0.51, and that's compared to $0.48 from a year-ago quarter. Our third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $222 million versus $220 million from a year-ago quarter. This slight increases in expenses is primarily related to the additional operating costs of Gila and Xtend Healthcare acquisitions. Excluding the expenses associated with these 2 acquisitions, our operating expenses were 7% lower than a year ago.
As Jack mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we will transfer $2.7 billion of Navient-owned FFELP loans that are currently being serviced by a third-party for Navient servicing platform. As a result of this transfer, we will incur an additional $7 million of one-time operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Even though these additional expenses were not included in our previous operating expense guidance, we remain on pace to beat our adjusted annual operating expense guidance of $930 million.
Before I go into more detail on our quarterly results, I would like to discuss on Slide 5 the recent widening of the 3-month LIBOR that we saw during the quarter compared to the 1-month LIBOR and the prime rate and how we manage this basis risk.
Approximately $85 billion of our FFELP Loans are indexed to the 1-month LIBOR that reset daily. After the impact of hedges, about $30 billion of these assets are funded with 3-month LIBOR that resets quarterly. Historically, the spread between these 2 indices have averaged around 11 basis points. In the quarter, the average spread widened to 28 basis points. And today, the spread is closer to 35 basis points.
We believe the recent increase in the average spread is a result of an ongoing anticipation of rate hikes that have yet to occur and the recent money market fund reforms. The spread widening of the 2 indices did not fully impact the third quarter NIM due to the timing of resets associated with our 3-month LIBOR debt.
Approximately $19 billion of this debt had already reset in July before the significant increase in the spread occurred and will reset again on October 25. The remaining $11 billion of debt reset late in the third quarter and had minimal impact to the third quarter FFELP NIM.
Our Private Education Loan net interest margin is impacted by the timing of when our $15 billion of prime-based earning assets reset versus when our LIBOR-based debt reset. $8 billion of these assets are funded with 3-month LIBOR, and $7 billion of these assets are funded with 1-month LIBOR.
Since the last prime reset in December 2015, we've seen LIBOR increase without a corresponding increase in the prime rate. And our guidance will assume LIBOR -- higher LIBOR cost of funds for the fourth quarter without an increase in the prime rate.
Due to the impact of the LIBOR basis risk and the additional one-time $7 million servicing expense, which were not included in our previous EPS guidance, I expect us to be at the midpoint of our previously issued 2016 core EPS guidance of $1.82 to $1.87.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $69 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $70 million in the third quarter of 2015. The FFELP net interest margin improved to 87 basis points due to higher hedge and unhedged floor income during the quarter.
While the impact of the widening 1-month to 3-month LIBOR spread will be larger in the fourth quarter, we still expect the FFELP net interest margin to remain in the low to mid-80s for the full year and in the low 80s for the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we acquired $596 million of FFELP student loans, bringing the year-to-date total acquisitions to $2.7 billion.
We are optimistic that we will see larger portfolio start to move now that Moody's and Fitch have released their final criterias and have started taking action. We saw significant year-over-year improvement in the credit quality of our FFELP portfolio as late-stage delinquency rates declined by 20%, and the total delinquency rate declined by nearly 30%.
Let's now move to Slide 7 to review our Private Education Loans segment results. Core earnings in this segment declined by $17 million from the year-ago quarter to $60 million. In the quarter, the net interest margin was 348 basis points. And our guidance for the full year NIM in the mid-340s remain intact, but we expect our fourth quarter NIM to be in the low 320s. This guidance includes updated repayment assumptions, our cost of funds from our LIBOR-based debt and no increases in the prime rate during the fourth quarter.
Our provision for Private Education Loan losses continue and improve as a result of the overall improvement in delinquency and charge-off trends. Charge-offs declined $36 million or 24% from the prior year, and loans greater than 90 days delinquent have decreased by $129 million or 15%. The improved performance demonstrates the strong and improving credit quality of our portfolio.
And Slide 8 highlights some of these improvement -- improving trends that we're seeing over the last 5 years. Our third quarter charge-off rate fell to 1.9%, and our total delinquency rate declined to 6.9%.
The chart on the bottom of the slide demonstrates the benefits, the improved performance is having on our borrowers' most recent FICO scores. FICO scores have improved by 36 basis points over nontraditional loans and 24 points for the entire portfolio on average over the last 5 years. And we expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in this area.
Let's turn to Slide 9 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $81 million in the quarter, and that's compared with $79 million in the third quarter of 2015. Noneducation loan-related asset recovery revenues increased $18 million from the year-ago quarter to $46 million. This increase in revenues is primarily related to the acquisitions of Gila and Xtend Healthcare in 2015. Overall, we expect our consolidated Business Services revenue to come in between $620 million and $625 million for the full year.
I would like to highlight our financing activity that took place in the third quarter and give a brief update on the recent actions from the rating agencies on Slide 10. We just issued our second FFELP ABS transaction, 2016-5, that consisted entirely of 100% rehabilitated loans totaling $1 billion in bonds in the quarter. We are seeing an increase in demand for FFELP ABS and investors' willingness to participate in this market. Compared to our prior deal, this transaction saw both an increase in the size of issuance by nearly $0.5 billion, and pricing improved by 13 basis points.
It has now been a few months since Moody's and Fitch have released their final updated cash flow assumptions on FFELP back -- asset-backed securities. As of June 30, these 2 rating agencies have had $56 billion and $51 billion, respectively, of Navient-sponsored bonds on watch for downgrade. Fitch has since affirmed or upgraded $6 billion of bonds and downgraded $0.5 billion of bonds to below investment grade.
Subsequent to the downgrade to non-investment grade, we were able to successfully extend the legal final maturity date on those particular bonds, and Fitch has since upgraded those bonds to AAA. Since the end of the second quarter, Fitch has affirmed or upgraded $4 billion of bonds and have downgraded $1.2 billion of bonds to below investment grade. 
While we continue to wait for Moody's and Fitch to complete their final ratings outcomes, we have been actively extending the legal final maturity date on previously issued bonds. In total, we have now extended the legal final maturity dates on $7.3 billion of bonds.
In the quarter, we completed 2 issuances of unsecured debt totaling $1.3 billion, with maturities in 2021 and 2023. The proceeds of these transactions were used to reduce our unsecured debt by $625 million during the quarter. $538 million of this reduction came through repurchases in the open market.
Additionally, we issued a make-whole call that will be effective on October 25 for an additional $691 million of our unsecured debt that will be due in January 2017. Including this call, we will have reduced our total unsecured debt maturities by $2.1 billion and our near-term maturities in 2017 and '18 by $1.8 billion from the prior year.
In the quarter, we repurchased 14.3 million shares of $200 million at an average price of $13.95. And at quarter end, we have a remaining authority of $180 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaking while maintaining a strong capital position and a tangible net asset ratio of 1.24.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 11. We recorded third quarter GAAP net income of $230 million or $0.73 a share, and that's compared with net income of $237 million or $0.63 per share in the third quarter of 2015. The primary differences between the core earnings and GAAP results are the march related to our derivative positions and any expenses related to the restructuring of the organization coming from the spin transaction.
I would now open the call for questions."

I think we actually would break our opportunities for growth into a couple of different buckets here. And certainly, there's an opportunity to add to our existing student loan holdings by purchasing legacy assets. This would include both federal and private. And as we've said, we think -- we believe we'll see some significant opportunities in the next several quarters to acquire portfolios in that space and add to the portfolios that we own. Those are, obviously, easy transactions to understand and easy to understand where the value is created there. As we've said all along, however, our view is that we're buying cash flows, and so any activity to acquire assets here is going to be extremely disciplined that if it doesn't add value, we don't buy it. And so those are the kind of the parameters in that space. We also see some opportunity to acquire student loan portfolios that are not legacy portfolios but ongoing kind of origination activities. These are private loans, and they include both perhaps campus-originated loans as well as refinancing loans. And that piece of the opportunity grows -- is a growing opportunity. It's also one that, as you point out, the non-compete issues expire at the end of 2018 and give us some flexibility to back into that space -- or total flexibility, I should say, if we so choose. That opportunity, I think, is one that we are interested in. But it is -- it's certainly -- it's a little bit longer route in terms of the time horizon. And then finally, where we really have been focusing our activities is this operation is taking advantage of the scales and capabilities that we've developed in our operating environments, our operations areas, to leverage those 2 different areas in other asset classes. And so we've been doing that in the municipal and state area. And this is primarily kind of a combination of processing kind of asset recovery work-related work. And the same for the health care arena, where it is mostly a processing type business. These are -- both of these areas are ones that we think we can grow in double-digits. And we'll continue to work in that space. Adding to that would be opportunities in the federal space. We just recently were awarded the IRS contract. That's something we're very excited about. And we are actively pursuing the Department of Education loan servicing contract, which has moved at a slower pace than they had originally indicated, but still seems to be on track for being released sometime in the fourth quarter."

It also would include any capital release from the amortization of the portfolios. As you know, buying FFELP portfolios puts very little demand on capital. Buying private loan portfolios puts much higher demand on capital than a FFELP portfolio does. So it depends a lot on what the opportunities are.

We are, first of all, capable of executing on very large transactions in single bites rather than having to deal with this over an elongated period of time, one. Two, we have demonstrated an ability, a superior ability, to deal with customer acquisitions and make sure that those customers are properly informed and understand the changes that will take place in a portfolio acquisition, including a servicing conversion. I think the transaction -- the accounts that we acquire through the lowest transaction and successfully moved to our portfolio, as we've indicated before, we had actually met more customer compliments than kind of questions or complaints in that process. That gets noticed by not only regulators, it gets noticed by sellers. And then finally, I think the third piece is, of course, is our loan performance. If we can drive -- if I move in loans onto our servicing platform, we can materially improve the performance of loans from both a delinquency and default perspective, helping borrowers become -- better take advantage of different repayment options so that they can successfully repay their loans. All of those things point to us as a preferred, I would say, obviously I'm a little biased here, but the preferred buyer of FFELP portfolios."

Yes, this is -- the annual -- the CFPB's annual report on student loans came out, and the exception of it was dedicated to the federal rehabilitation marketplace. A lot of the recommendations or policy recommendations in that report are actually very consistent with one that we made almost 2 years ago now. And in terms of creating a more seamless approach of taking a borrower from the reasonable affordable repayments that are required under the rehab program into an income-driven repayment plan upon successful completion. We do -- when we take rehab accounts that we acquire in the FFELP space, this is one of the areas that we work extremely hard at in terms of connecting with borrowers immediately upon conversion because we don't -- a lot of the data doesn't transfer from the collector to the servicer. It doesn't at all on the Ed side. And on the FFELP side, it depends on the guarantor, whether they provide that information to us or not. But we work with those customers to make sure that they are successfully -- that they remain as successful at loan repayment as they did in the rehabilitation process. Our delinquency rates for rehab accounts are substantially better than the national averages. And so some of the statistics and projections quoted in the CFPB report would be much, much higher than what we would see in our own service portfolio. This really goes to the data-driven approach that we apply to help these customers. Rehab customers would be considered a high-risk customer, and they're going to get a unique set of treatments and efforts that result, as we said earlier, in higher rates of right-party contacts so that we can walk them through their options and keep them on track."

So -- and that's really where our focus has been. Our efforts have really been to help -- it's been to explain how -- what we do that's unique in this space and how that drives higher rates of customer success. And we can see it in the numbers that are published by the Department of Ed, in terms of 31% lower delinquency, lower default rates in the federal programs that we service. You can see it in the higher rates of enrollment we have in income-driven repayment plans. 40% of the dollars we service for the Department of Ed, for example, are in income-driven repayment programs. You see it in overall delinquency rates, severe delinquency rates for Navient service borrowers are the best in the industry. And it's really -- it's those combination of efforts and activities that we're doing is what we're communicating and sharing with regulators to kind of guide some of the direction. I think most of where -- what they're interested in is helping set better, more uniform standards for servicing federal and private loans. And we certainly are willing to share our best practices. But any new rules or regulations, we believe, should be industry-wide, and that's kind of the direction of where things are at this moment."
