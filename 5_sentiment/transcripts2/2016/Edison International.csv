In my remarks today, I will touch briefly on our 2015 performance and then focus on Southern California Edison's and Edison Energy groups long-term growth opportunity. Closing out 1 year and starting a new one is a natural time to reflect on some of the longer term themes. 
Full year 2015 core earnings were $4.10 per share, $0.23 above the high end of our core earnings guidance range. We also introduced today our 2016 core earnings guidance range of $3.81 to $4.01 per share, which reflects SCE's strong rate base growth, the continuing focus on improvements and operational efficiency and ongoing energy efficiency incentives.
We believe that SCE's rate base is the best proxy for long-term earnings growth potential. As Jim will soon describe in more detail, we have updated our forecast of SCE's rate base through 2017. Rate base for 2015 increased $300 million and our forecast for 2016 rate base also increased by $300 million. The rate base for 2017 increased by $100 million. 
It seems some investors have been expecting a substantial decline in rate base due to bonus depreciation, but the effect of bonus depreciation is less and there are other offsets. 
Bonus depreciation do not have any significant impact on 2015. Impacts pick up somewhat in 2016 and '17. Bonus depreciation impacts are more than offset by higher rate base from our distribution pull loading program on which we earn a rate of return as prescribed in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case. Jim will provide a more fulsome explanation but the bottom line is that we expect rate base to be slightly higher in 2017 than our previous forecast after taking into account a final General Rate Case decision and the full effect of bonus depreciation. 
Customers will see the benefits of SCE's continuing efforts to reduce costs. Through these efforts, together with lower fuel and purchase power costs, the NEIL insurance settlement of our San Onofre claims and the 2015 GRC, customers will receive, on average, a reduction in 2016 rates of 8%. This is a significant benefit for our customers and something we are very pleased to deliver to them.
SCE's share of the $400 million NEIL settlement was $313 million. After legal expenses, 95% went to customers. This is another example of the benefits of the San Onofre settlement unanimously approved by the CPUC in 2014. For the last major step in implementing the settlement will be resolution of our pending arbitration case with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Hearings before the 3 judge panel are expected this spring. We still expect a decision late this year. As we've said previously, we are under confidentiality provisions during the litigation process, so we don't expect to have further updates unless there is some material development.
The CPUC's December decision on ex parte communications completed its consideration of the matters of the SONGS OII. The challenges to the commission's approval of the settlement remained pending. We have no estimates on the time frame to decide those challenges. In the meantime, we are focused on the safe decommissioning of San Onofre. Based on our current decommissioning cost estimates, our decommissioning trust funds are adequately funded and not expected to require any further customer contributions.
Our December dividend increase of $0.25, the second in as many years, equates to a 47% payout based on the midpoint of our 2016 SCE earnings guidance. We continue to see an excellent dividend growth opportunity as we grow SCE earnings and move up through our current targeted payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings. I won't attempt a prediction of future dividend increases, but I will describe our thinking. Our earnings growth is largely driven by long-term rate base growth. After depreciation, capital spending of approximately $4 billion a year will translate into rate base growing by roughly $2 billion a year. This would yield a 7% annual rate base growth potential for some years to come and if we have higher annual CapEx, we will have a higher rate base growth rate. Additionally, moving the dividend payout ratio further up in our targeted 45% to 55% range only adds to the potential annual dividend growth rate. 
We believe that we are well positioned for sustained growth in rate base and earnings at SCE. We have positioned SCE as a wires-focused business, consistent with our views on industry transformation and in alignment with California's public policy objectives to move the state to a low-carbon economy. 
We see more opportunities for growth than we do threats in the changes occurring in our industry. Recently, we have taken steps to further position Edison Energy group to develop those opportunities. We are focused on finding those areas where customers' needs are unmet that match well with our competitive advantages and that hold promise for scaling up sufficiently. Edison Energy group continues to expand into businesses that meet this profile, including distributed solar generation, energy services for commercial and industrial companies, providing new sources of water and competitive transmission.
Our SoCore Energy subsidiary added more commercial rooftop solar customers in 2015 and now has nearly 250 projects operating in 16 states. It has expanded beyond rooftop installations to ground-mounted projects, serving both community solar and rural electric cooperatives. SoCore also piloted an innovated project for Cinemark [ph] theaters that combined its rooftop solar panels with energy storage from Tesla Energy. 
We continue to build out an integrated energy services platform, which we call Edison Energy to address the needs of commercial and industrial companies. Our market research has led us to conclude that the largest commercial and industrial companies with multistate operations are underserved nationally in their energy needs and struggle to deal locally with many different utilities, tariffs and new technologies. We believe we possess several competitive advantages to succeed with customers in this new and quickly evolving power environment. 
Our roots are as developers, operators and investors in complex infrastructure. We have deep technical, commercial and regulatory experience and knowledge of the power system. Our brand and substantial size gives customers confidence in our ability to deliver and in contrast with the dizzying array of untested start-ups.
Our platform was expanded through some recent smaller acquisitions in the area of energy engineering and in consulting, that was interactive solutions; energy procurement advisory services, which was Delta Energy; and sourcing offsite renewable energy, which was Ultinex [ph]. Edison Energy now counts 1/4 of the Fortune 50 companies as clients, including General Motors, Microsoft and Proctor & Gamble. Next month, Edison Energy will launch marketing efforts to larger C&I companies, emphasizing its ability as a comprehensive integrated energy service solution provider. 
Today, these new businesses are small, even though we think the opportunities could be significant. Currently, the vast majority of our capital is dedicated to our core business, modernizing the electric grid at SCE and to moving up our dividend ratio, the payout ratio, closer to the industry norm. Our approach to these a new businesses will be disciplined, focused on small initial investments that understand strategic fit, profit drivers and scalability. We have allocated some capital to testing and building our new businesses, but it is currently only around 1% to 2% of the total capital deployed at Edison International. 
We are gaining confidence that there is indeed a market need for these new businesses and that they can be profitable. The major question is whether these businesses can be scaled up sufficiently to be significant to a company our size. If performance warrants and the opportunities continue to look sizable, we are in a position to increase our commitment. We are encouraged that ultimately, we will be driven by results.
So to summarize, our strategy has 3 themes. Theme 1, operate with excellence, meaning we operate our existing business with a focus on controlling costs and customer rates and improving service to our utility customers. Theme 2, build the 21st century power network. This means we invest in our existing business and manage the unprecedented changes in policy and technology. And Theme 3, is to expand our growth potential. We systematically explore new growth opportunities by making disciplined investments where industry changes are producing unmet customer need, where we believe Edison has competitive advantages and where scalable opportunities exist. 
Concentrating on these 3 strategic themes will allow us to remain relevant to our existing customers, produce higher than industry average growth in earnings and dividends and provide the flexibility to adapt and grow in a climate of rapid change. 
So that's it for the big themes. Let me now turn the call over to Jim."
301891,322788367,938638,"Edison International, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My remarks will [indiscernible] fourth quarter and full year results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecasts and our 2016 earnings guidance. I'll start with SCE's fourth quarter operating results. Ple",1927,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My remarks will [indiscernible] fourth quarter and full year results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecasts and our 2016 earnings guidance. 
I'll start with SCE's fourth quarter operating results. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. SCE's fourth quarter 2015 earnings are $0.89 per share, down $0.20 per share from last year, but well ahead of the $0.66 per share implied by the midpoint of our 2015 earnings guidance. 
Looking at the year-over-year comparison, 2 items from last year stand out. First is the $0.15 per share income tax variance as shown in the right table. As part of the 2015 General Rate Case decision, differences in tax repair benefits for 2015 through 2017 flow through the tax accounting memorandum account, or TAMA, do not affect earnings. Second is last year's $0.05 per share benefit from resolution of an income tax item from the 2012 GRC. This was recorded in revenues last year and is part of the $0.15 per share revenue variance. 
A key item and something that was not included in our 2015 earnings guidance is an $0.08 per share benefit from a new balancing account for SCE's distribution pull inspection and replacement program. Let me provide some additional background. The 2015 GRC established a new balancing account to track cost to inspect distribution poles and to repair or replace them as needed. This is called a pole loading and deteriorated pole balancing account or simply the pole loading balancing account. Balancing account allows SCE to true up from actual O&M and capital expenditures. For 2015, actual capital expenditures substantially exceeded amounts included in the GRC decision. Because of the lateness of the GRC decision, the commission did not limit expenditures for '15, but did limit expenditures for 2016 and 2017. 
Switching now from pole capital expenditures to rate base. The 2015 GRC decision included a pole loading rate base forecasts of $296 million. Based on actual expenditures since the inception of the program, the 2015 rate base for poles increased to $625 million. As a result of the higher rate base, SCE recorded additional revenues through the pole loading balancing account to earn its authorized rate of return on the incremental rate base of $329 million. The additional $0.08 per share of earnings is based on both equity and debt returns at the blended authorized rate of 7.9%. The balancing account impact was finalized as part of our year-end reporting cycle and was not previously included in our earnings guidance. The balance of the revenue variance largely reflects the implementation of the 2015 GRC, which is lowered authorized revenues as expected. 
For the fourth quarter, O&M is a net positive $0.07 per share. O&M includes both the ex parte penalty of $0.05 per share and $0.03 for additional severance cost as part of SCE's ongoing operational excellence efforts. The balance of O&M benefits are from lower transmission, distribution and legal cost. Lower net financing costs are a benefit of $0.03 per share. The incremental tax benefits from 2014 that I mentioned drive the unfavorable tax comparison. 
One important item that was not a key earnings driver in the quarter is bonus depreciation from the 2015 tax law change. Bonus depreciation did reduce average rate base but only by a nominal amount or a net $31 million. The nominal impact is much less than our general statement that a 50% bonus extension could reduce rate base by $400 million each year. I've come to the conclusion that it's very difficult to effectively estimate the impact of bonus extension until you do the detailed analysis. The fact is there are second and third order effects that can occur making our general statement accurate only with a controlled set of assumptions. 
With this preamble, there are 3 primary factors that reduce the impact of the bonus depreciation on '15 versus our prior forecast. First, under normalization rules, bonus depreciation is prorated in the first year in which capital additions are estimated to put into service. Second, certain 2015 capital additions relate to work that began in 2014 and are eligible under 2014 bonus depreciation and thus, were included in our prior rate case forecast. Third, the shift in tax payments caused 2015 working cash to increase. For ratemaking purposes, working cash is a component of a rate base. Later in my presentation, I will provide a complete reconciliation of rate base changes for 2015 through 2017. 
As part of the key earnings drivers, revenues and income tax are lower due to the higher tax repair deductions recorded through the pole loading and demo accounts. The higher tax repair deductions in '15 do not affect earnings and are not shown on the right side of the slide as they are netted out. The total impact for the quarter is $0.45 per share in lower revenues and income taxes. 
For the holding company, costs are unchanged at a $0.01 per share. For SCE noncore items in the quarter include previously announced $1.18 per share charge related to the write-down of the regulatory assets for incremental tax repair deductions for the 2012 through 2014 period. It also includes a $0.04 per share benefit from a NEIL insurance settlement and legal costs recoveries related to SONGS. Holding company noncore items included $0.03 per share gain on the sale of Edison Capital's affordable housing portfolio at year-end and $0.01 per share related to an account -- to accounting for income tax attributes related to SoCore's tax equity financings. 
Discounted operations include a $0.02 per share EME related cost for changes in net liabilities for retirement plans and additional insurance recoveries. Page 15 has a detailed summary of all noncore items.
Please turn to Page 3. Full year 2015 core earnings are $4.10 per share, down $0.49 from a year ago. SCE's 2015 earnings largely reflect the impact of the 2015 GRC decision, especially the treatment of excess tax repair deductions, together with the other fourth quarter key drivers I mentioned earlier. 
Excluding the tax repair deductions now attract in the pole loading and TAMA accounts, CPUC jurisdiction in revenue is down $0.39 per share, while FERC revenue is up $0.14 per share. 
Among the key cost components, the favorable O&M trend relates largely to the positive fourth quarter factors discussed previously. The favorable net financing cost are mainly from higher AFUDC earnings that had been reporting all year. The major driver of lower earnings this year is the loss of tax repair benefits. In 2014, we recognized $0.41 of tax repair benefits. In 2013, these benefits either flow through the pole loading or TAMA accounts without impacting earnings. Full year holding company costs are $0.01 per share above last year due to higher income taxes and expenses. 
Please turn to Page 4. This slide walks through the key differences between our 2015 core earnings of $4.10 per share versus the midpoint of our guidance of $3.82. First, you'll see the $0.08 per share related to the $329 million increase in pole loading rate base I discussed earlier. The additional equity return is $0.05 and the debt preferred return is $0.03 per share. O&M is favorable $0.08 per share due mainly to the factors I mentioned earlier. The other financing benefit is AFUDC at $0.01 per share. Taxes are the other driver due to the implementation of TAMA account and clarification of treatment of tax items that would otherwise negatively impact earnings but now flow-through this account. Holding company costs are at $0.05 per share positive variance due to higher income from Edison Capital and income tax benefits. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast increased slightly, adding $300 million in '16 and $100 million in 2017, as Ted has already mentioned. The 2016 change principally relates to an updated for pole loading expenditures up to the cap provided in the 2015 GRC decision and for cumulative spending in '16 and 2017. This incremental spend will flow into rate base as you will see in a minute. 
The 2017 increase relates to modest changes in the scope and timing of FERC transmission investments. SCE's current forecast does not include any incremental spending on distribution resources plan activities. The forecast also excludes any energy storage investments or Phase 2 of the Charge Ready program.
Please turn to Page 6. A third major transmission project, the Mesa substation, has been included in our capital spending forecast for some time but has advanced sufficiently through the regulatory approval process that we felt it appropriate to describe more fully. This is a replacement of a 220 kV substation with a 500 kV substation. It will provide additional transmission import capability, allowing greater flexibility in the siting new generation and reducing the amount of new generation required to meet local reliability needs in the Western Los Angeles basin. This is the approved project. 
Please turn to Page 7. This page shows the increase in SCE's rate base forecast that Ted mentioned. I will explain the changes in a moment. The 2-year compound annual growth rate for both the outlook and range cases is 7%. With the complexity associated with the extension of bonus depreciation and the normal changes to our capital expenditures flowing in the rate base, we felt it'd be couple to provide a fulsome reconciliation of rate base changes. 
Please turn to Page 8. For 2015, we ended the year with $329 million of additional rate base from pole loading capital expenditures. As I had mentioned earlier, the extension of bonus for 2015 is lost in the rounding. We estimate the impact of bonus depreciation to be about $300 million in '16 and $700 million in '17, relative to our prior forecast. The incremental additions to rate base from a pole loading account activity is about $600 million in '16 and about $700 million in '17. And effect, the impact of the bonus is offset by the change in the pole loading rate base. Net-net-net, relative to our prior forecast, rate base increases $300 million in '16 and $100 million in 2017. 
Lastly, we plan to update our capital spending and rate base forecasts through 2020 when we file our next General Rate Case in early September.
Please turn to Page 9. Today, we introduced 2016 earnings guidance with the midpoint of $3.91 per share with a range of plus or minus $0.10 per share. For SCE, we start with a rate base forecast of $25.1 billion, shown on Page 7. The rate base math yields earnings of $3.81 per share. While the number of positive variance in 2015 may not recur in '16, we do expect additional earnings contribution from energy efficiency of $0.05 per share. We also anticipate incremental productivity and financing benefits of $0.17 per share. This implies earnings of $4.09 per share at SCE. 
Lastly, we deduct $0.18 per share for holding company cost with no range. In the past, I've talked about holding company cost of roughly $0.15 per year and on our last call, we pointed out that the sale of Edison Capital would eliminate the earnings contribution this business provided. 
The $0.10 per share loss for 2015 included $0.06 of income from Edison Capital. The increase over 2015 relates primarily to higher financing cost. 
Please turn to Page 10. The last slide reinforces our view that EIX is one of the better opportunities among large cap utilities for rate base, earnings and dividend growth. 
Thanks, and I'll now turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A."

There's a number of things that really offset it, the biggest piece being proration, bonus depreciation in the first year and the overlap of those that flowed from '14 into '15 of that we had already accounted for. And the biggest thing here is the pole loading program. We picked up little over $300 million of rate base from pole loading that was not included in our prior forecast that we included now based on our year-end review. And that's the biggest offset for '15. And you can see bonus growing in '16 and '17 as you expect it would be at 50% and it reaches up to $700 million impact by '17. But really what's happening in the pole loading program in a sense is offsetting the bonus depreciation and it gets up to pole loading gets up to $700 million. And so the only changes are really going on are the small changes in and around what's happening with FERC and a little bit of the CPUC. So we do have an increase in rate base ultimately through '16 and '17. But the bonus depreciation is offset by the pole loading program. So Page 8, if you don't have it there, really disclose the full details of how rate base changed over this 3-year period and it's probably the most helpful tool."

Depending on where earnings actually come out, depending on how we would look at moving our way through the 45% to 55%, we would kind of view that 7% as more of a floor than anything else. So that was the principal point that I was trying to insinuate in there. In terms of whether we're trying to get to a specific point in the 45% to 55%, I clearly was not trying to give a specific point that we would target in there. 45% to 55%, we feel has been the appropriate range given that we have a higher than industry average rate base growth and higher than industry average earnings growth rate. These things kind of ultimately balance together but for the foreseeable future, we think we'll have -- we'll continue to have a higher than industry average rate base in earnings growth and so 45% to 55% seems still to be about the right range."

And there's some other things that are pluses and minuses, Ted mentioned it I had it in my script. We've got the charge program that's flowing through, that's on a separate track and we need to get through the Phase I before we can add the additional $300 million, potentially up to $300 million of capital expenditures for that program. Also, said we didn't have any storage related expenditures in there. So there's a number of things that are in the mix. And when you get into a GRC, you take a look at all the factors. You want to make sure that rates are appropriate, that you're not looking up -- pushing out the outer edge of what you can afford from an affordability perspective.

I think while the virus points with investors is, at the high level and without getting lost too much in any specifics for 1 year versus another, things are in equilibrium, assuming around this 50% equity debt capital structure and around a 45% to 55% dividend payout. You're about equilibrium when you have long-term growth in the 6% to 8% range. You start getting much higher than that, it starts getting -- you start -- you need other things to help out. And in the past, when we had an extremely high growth rate, when we were in that the 12%, we did have a number of unusual things, that's where the global tax settlement deal really helped us out, the bonus depreciation, those types of things. Absent, we would have really run too hot than we would have had to issue equity. The other part that you mentioned, which I think is really worth emphasizing again here, increasingly, I think, the focus is to try to really hold the line on customer rates. If we look at the long-term trajectory, the history here, last 20 years, we've actually managed to keep customer rates at or below the rate of inflation and we definitely want to continue that if anything, we'd like to be able to have rates stay flat. But fundamentally, our goal is to try to keep it more around the rate of inflation or lower. If you get too hot growth rate in here, especially given the relatively modest growth in energy consumption, you're going to really put pressure on rates. So that becomes as much as anything else kind of the governor on what we want to have in the way of growth. So customer rates, equity, long-term growth rate, all of that kind of that boils down to you to focus to stay somewhere in the kind of 6% to 8%. Gets much hotter than that you have to issue equity or have pressure on rates."

In my remarks today, I will touch briefly on our 2015 performance and then focus on Southern California Edison's and Edison Energy Group's long-term growth opportunity. Closing out 1 year and starting a new one is a natural time to reflect on some of the longer-term themes.
Full year 2015 core earnings were $4.10 per share, $0.23 above the high-end of our core earnings guidance range. We also introduced today our 2016 core earnings guidance range of $3.81 to $4.01 per share, which reflects SCE's strong rate base growth, a continuing focus on improvements in operational efficiency, and ongoing energy efficiency incentives.
We believe that SCE's rate base is the best proxy for long-term earnings growth potential. As Jim will soon describe in more detail, we have updated our forecast of SCE's rate base through 2017. Rate base for 2015 increased $300 million, and our forecast for 2016 rate base also increased by $300 million. The rate base for 2017 increased by $100 million. 
It seems some investors have been expecting a substantial decline in rate base due to bonus depreciation, but the effect of bonus depreciation is less and there are other offsets. 
Bonus depreciation did not have any significant impact on 2015. Impacts pick up somewhat in 2016 and '17. Bonus depreciation impacts are more than offset by higher rate base from our distribution pole loading program on which we earn a rate of return, as prescribed in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case. Jim will provide a more fulsome explanation, but the bottom line is that we expect rate base to be slightly higher in 2017 than our previous forecast after taking into account the final General Rate Case decision and the full effect of bonus depreciation.
Customers will see the benefits of SCE's continuing efforts to reduce costs. Through these efforts, together with lower fuel and purchased power costs, the NEIL insurance settlement of our San Onofre claims and the 2015 GRC, customers will receive, on average, a reduction in 2016 rates of 8%. This is a significant benefit for our customers and something we are very pleased to deliver to them.
SCE's share of the $400 million NEIL settlement was $313 million. After legal expenses, 95% went to customers. This is another example of the benefits of the San Onofre settlement unanimously approved by the CPUC in 2014. The last major step in implementing the settlement will be resolution of our pending arbitration case with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Hearings before the 3 judge panel are expected this spring. We still expect a decision late this year. As we've said previously, we are under confidentiality provisions during the litigation process, so we don't expect to have further updates unless there is some material development.
The CPUC's December decision on ex parte communications completed its consideration of the matters of the SONGS OII. The challenges to the commission's approval of the settlement remain pending. We have no estimates on the time frame to decide those challenges. In the meantime, we are focused on the safe decommissioning of San Onofre. Based on our current decommissioning cost estimates, our decommissioning trust funds are adequately funded and not expected to require any further customer contributions.
Our December dividend increase of $0.25, the second in as many years, equates to a 47% payout based on the midpoint of our 2016 SCE earnings guidance. We continue to see an excellent dividend growth opportunity as we grow SCE earnings and move up through our current targeted payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings. I won't attempt a prediction of future dividend increases, but I will describe our thinking. Our earnings growth is largely driven by long-term rate base growth. After depreciation, capital spending of approximately $4 billion a year will translate into rate base growing by roughly $2 billion a year. This would yield a 7% annual rate base growth potential for some years to come, and if we have higher annual CapEx, we will have a higher rate base growth rate. Additionally, moving the dividend payout ratio further up in our targeted 45% to 55% range only adds to the potential annual dividend growth rate. 
We believe that we are well positioned for sustained growth in rate base and earnings at SCE. We have positioned SCE as a wires-focused business, consistent with our views on industry transformation and in alignment with California's public policy objectives to move the state to a low-carbon economy.
We see more opportunities for growth than we do threats in the changes occurring in our industry. Recently, we have taken steps to further position Edison Energy group to develop those opportunities. We are focused on finding those areas where customers' needs are unmet, that match well with our competitive advantages, and that hold promise for scaling-up sufficiently. Edison Energy group continues to expand into businesses that meet this profile, including distributed solar generation, energy services for commercial and industrial companies, providing new sources of water and competitive transmission.
Our SoCore Energy subsidiary added more commercial rooftop solar customers in 2015, and now has nearly 250 projects operating in 16 states. It has expanded beyond rooftop installations to ground-mounted projects, serving both community solar and rural electric cooperatives. SoCore also piloted an innovative project for Cinemark Theaters that combined its rooftop solar panels with energy storage from Tesla Energy.
We continue to build out an integrated energy services platform, which we call Edison Energy to address the needs of commercial and industrial companies. Our market research has led us to conclude that the largest commercial and industrial companies with multi-state operations are underserved nationally in their energy needs and struggle to deal locally with many different utilities, tariffs and new technologies. We believe we possess several competitive advantages to succeed with customers in this new and quickly evolving power environment.
Our roots are as developers, operators and investors in complex infrastructure. We have deep technical, commercial and regulatory experience and knowledge of the power system. Our brand and substantial size gives customers confidence in our ability to deliver and in contrast with the dizzying array of untested start-ups.
Our platform was expanded through some recent smaller acquisitions in the area of energy engineering and consulting, that was interactive solutions; energy procurement advisory services, which was Delta Energy; and sourcing offsite renewable energy, which was Altenex. Edison Energy now counts 1/4 of the Fortune 50 companies as clients, including General Motors, Microsoft and Procter & Gamble. Next month, Edison Energy will launch marketing efforts to larger C&I companies, emphasizing its abilities as a comprehensive, integrated energy service solution provider. 
Today, these new businesses are small, even though we think the opportunities could be significant. Currently, the vast majority of our capital is dedicated to our core business, modernizing the electric grid at SCE and to moving up our dividend ratio, the payout ratio, closer to the industry norm. Our approach to these new businesses will be disciplined; focused on small initial investments to understand strategic fit, profit drivers and scalability. We have allocated some capital to testing and building our new businesses, but it is currently only around 1% to 2% of the total capital deployed at Edison International. 
We are gaining confidence that there is indeed a market need for these new businesses and that they can be profitable. The major question is whether these businesses can be scaled up sufficiently to be significant to a company our size. If performance warrants and the opportunities continue to look sizeable, we are in a position to increase our commitment. We are encouraged, but ultimately, we will be driven by results.
So to summarize, our strategy has 3 themes. Theme 1, operate with excellence, meaning we operate our existing business with a focus on controlling costs and customer rates and improving service to our utility customers. Theme 2, build the 21st century power network. This means we invest in our existing business and manage the unprecedented changes in policy and technology. And Theme 3, is to expand our growth potential. We systematically explore new growth opportunities by making disciplined investments where industry changes are producing unmet customer need, where we believe Edison has competitive advantages and where scalable opportunities exist. 
Concentrating on these 3 strategic themes will allow us to remain relevant to our existing customers, produce higher than industry-average growth in earnings and dividends, and provide the flexibility to adapt and grow in a climate of rapid change. 
So that's it for the big themes. Let me now turn the call over to Jim."
301891,322788367,938782,"Edison International, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My remarks will cover fourth quarter and full year results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecasts and our 2016 earnings guidance. I'll start with SCE's fourth quarter operating results. Please turn t",1931,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My remarks will cover fourth quarter and full year results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecasts and our 2016 earnings guidance. 
I'll start with SCE's fourth quarter operating results. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. SCE's fourth quarter 2015 earnings are $0.89 per share, down $0.20 per share from last year, but well ahead of the $0.66 per share implied by the midpoint of our 2015 earnings guidance. 
Looking at the year-over-year comparison, 2 items from last year stand out. First is the $0.15 per share income tax variance as shown in the right table. As part of the 2015 General Rate Case decision, differences in tax repair benefits for 2015 through 2017 flow through the tax accounting memorandum account, or TAMA, do not affect earnings. Second is last year's $0.05 per share benefit from resolution of an income tax item from the 2012 GRC. This was recorded in revenues last year and is part of the $0.15 per share revenue variance. 
A key item, and something that was not included in our 2015 earnings guidance is an $0.08 per share benefit from a new balancing account for SCE's distribution pole inspection and replacement program. Let me provide some additional background. The 2015 GRC established a new balancing account to track costs to inspect distribution poles and to repair or replace them as needed. This is called a pole loading and deteriorated pole balancing account or simply the pole loading balancing account. Balancing account allows SCE to true up from actual O&M and capital expenditures. For 2015, actual capital expenditures substantially exceeded amounts included in the GRC decision. Because of the lateness of the GRC decision, the commission did not limit expenditures for '15, but did limit expenditures for 2016 and 2017. 
Switching now from pole capital expenditures to rate base. The 2015 GRC decision included a pole loading rate base forecast of $296 million. Based on actual expenditures since the inception of the program, the 2015 rate base for poles increased to $625 million. As a result of the higher rate base, SCE recorded additional revenues through the pole loading balancing account to earn its authorized rate of return on the incremental rate base of $329 million. The additional $0.08 per share of earnings is based on both equity and debt returns at the blended authorized rate of 7.9%. The balancing account impact was finalized as part of our year-end reporting cycle and was not previously included in our earnings guidance. The balance of the revenue variance largely reflects the implementation of the 2015 GRC, which lowered authorized revenues, as expected. 
For the fourth quarter, O&M is a net positive $0.07 per share. O&M includes both the ex parte penalty of $0.05 per share and $0.03 for additional severance costs as part of SCE's ongoing operational excellence efforts. The balance of O&M benefits are from lower transmission, distribution and legal costs. Lower net financing costs are a benefit of $0.03 per share. The incremental tax benefits from 2014 that I mentioned drive the unfavorable tax comparison. 
One important item that was not a key earnings driver in the quarter is bonus depreciation from the 2015 tax law change. Bonus depreciation did reduce average rate base, but only by a nominal amount or a net $31 million. The nominal impact is much less than our general statement that a 50% bonus extension could reduce rate base by $400 million each year. I've come to the conclusion that it's very difficult to effectively estimate the impact of bonus extension until you do the detailed analysis. The fact is there are second and third order effects that can occur, making our general statement accurate only with a controlled set of assumptions. 
With this preamble, there are 3 primary factors that reduce the impact of the bonus depreciation on '15 versus our prior forecast. First, under normalization rules, bonus depreciation is pro-rated in the first year in which capital additions are estimated to be put into service. Second, certain 2015 capital additions relate to work that began in 2014 and are eligible under 2014 bonus depreciation and thus, were included in our prior rate case forecast. Third, the shift in tax payments caused 2015 working cash to increase. For ratemaking purposes, working cash is a component of a rate base. Later in my presentation, I will provide a complete reconciliation of rate base changes for 2015 through 2017. 
As part of the key earnings drivers, revenues and income taxes are lower due to the higher tax repair deductions recorded through the pole loading and TAMA accounts. The higher tax repair deductions in '15 do not affect earnings and are not shown on the right side of the slide as they are netted out. The total impact for the quarter is $0.45 per share in lower revenues and income taxes. 
For the holding company, costs are unchanged at a $0.01 per share. For SCE noncore items in the quarter include the previously announced $1.18 per share charge related to the write-down of the regulatory assets for incremental tax repair deductions for the 2012 through 2014 period. It also includes a $0.04 per share benefit from a NEIL insurance settlement and legal cost recoveries related to SONGS. Holding company noncore items included $0.03 per share gain on the sale of Edison Capital's affordable housing portfolio at year-end and $0.01 per share related to an account -- to accounting for income tax attributes related to SoCore's tax equity financings. 
Discounted operations include a $0.02 per share EME-related cost for changes in net liabilities for retirement plans and additional insurance recoveries. Page 15 has a detailed summary of all noncore items.
Please turn to Page 3. Full year 2015 core earnings are $4.10 per share, down $0.49 from a year ago. SCE's 2015 earnings largely reflect the impact of the 2015 GRC decision, especially the treatment of excess tax repair deductions, together with the other fourth quarter key drivers I mentioned earlier.
Excluding the tax repair deductions now tracked in the pole loading and TAMA accounts, CPUC jurisdictional in revenue is down $0.39 per share while FERC revenue is up $0.14 per share. 
Among the key cost components, the favorable O&M trend relates largely to the positive fourth quarter factors discussed previously. The favorable net financing costs are mainly from higher AFUDC earnings that we have been reporting all year. The major driver of lower earnings this year is the loss of tax repair benefits. In 2014, we recognized $0.41 of tax repair benefits. In 2015, these benefits either flow through the pole loading or TAMA accounts without impacting earnings. Full year holding company costs are $0.01 per share above last year due to higher income taxes and expenses. 
Please turn to Page 4. This slide walks through the key differences between our 2015 core earnings of $4.10 per share versus the midpoint of our guidance of $3.82. First, you'll see the $0.08 per share related to the $329 million increase in pole loading rate base I discussed earlier. The additional equity return is $0.05 and the debt and preferred return is $0.03 per share. O&M is favorable $0.08 per share due mainly to the factors I mentioned earlier. The other financing benefit is AFUDC at $0.01 per share. Taxes are the other driver due to the implementation of the TAMA account and clarification of treatment of tax items that would otherwise negatively impact earnings but now flow-through this account. Holding company costs are at $0.05 per share positive variance due to higher income from Edison Capital and income tax benefits. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast increased slightly, adding $300 million in '16 and $100 million in 2017, as Ted has already mentioned. The 2016 change principally relates to an updated estimate for pole loading expenditures up to the cap provided in the 2015 GRC decision and for cumulative spending in '16 and 2017. This incremental spend will flow into rate base as you will see in a minute. 
The 2017 increase relates to modest changes in the scope and timing of FERC transmission investments. SCE's current forecast does not include any incremental spending on distribution resources plan activities. The forecast also excludes any energy storage investments or Phase 2 of the Charge Ready program.
Please turn to Page 6. A third major transmission project, the Mesa substation, has been included in our capital spending forecast for some time, but has advanced sufficiently through the regulatory approval process that we felt it appropriate to describe more fully. This is a replacement of a 220 kV substation with a 500 kV substation. It will provide additional transmission import capability, allowing greater flexibility in the siting of new generation and reducing the amount of new generation required to meet local reliability needs in the Western Los Angeles basin. This is Cal ISO approved project.
Please turn to Page 7. This page shows the increase in SCE's rate base forecast that Ted mentioned. I will explain the changes in a moment. The 2-year compound annual growth rate for both the outlook and range cases is 7%. With the complexity associated with the extension of bonus depreciation and the normal changes to our capital expenditures flowing into rate base, we felt it would be helpful to provide a more fulsome reconciliation of rate base changes. 
Please turn to Page 8. For 2015, we ended the year with $329 million of additional rate base from pole loading capital expenditures. As I mentioned earlier, the extension of bonus for 2015 is lost in the rounding. We estimate the impact of bonus depreciation to be about $300 million in '16 and $700 million in '17, relative to our prior forecast. The incremental additions to rate base from the pole loading account activity is about $600 million in '16 and about $700 million in '17. In effect, the impact of bonus is offset by the change in the pole loading rate base. Net-net-net, relative to our prior forecast, rate base increases $300 million in '16 and $100 million in 2017. 
Lastly, we plan to update our capital spending and rate base forecasts through 2020 when we file our next General Rate Case in early September.
Please turn to Page 9. Today, we introduced 2016 earnings guidance with a midpoint of $3.91 per share with a range of plus or minus $0.10 per share. For SCE, we start with a rate base forecast of $25.1 billion, shown on Page 7. The rate base math yields earnings of $3.81 per share. While the number of positive variance in 2015 may not recur in '16, we do expect additional earnings contribution from energy efficiency of $0.05 per share. We also anticipate incremental productivity and financing benefits of $0.17 per share. This implies earnings of $4.09 per share at SCE. 
Lastly, we deduct $0.18 per share for holding company cost with no range. In the past, I've talked about holding company cost of roughly $0.15 per year and on our last call, we pointed out that the sale of Edison Capital would eliminate the earnings contribution this business provided. 
The $0.10 per share loss for 2015 included $0.06 of income from Edison Capital. The increase over 2015 relates primarily to higher financing costs. 
Please turn to Page 10. The last slide reinforces our view that EIX has one of the better opportunities among large-cap utilities for rate base, earnings and dividend growth. 
Thanks, and I'll now turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A."

Assuming it's scalable, assuming we could make those kinds of investments that would really allow us to fully capture the opportunity, to be relevant, to accompany our size. We've generally thought that the suite of businesses on the Edison Energy side, so not just energy services stuff that I spent a lot of my comment on, but really the whole group of companies here, this probably got to be just as a general rule of thumb, I'd say, it's got to be somewhere in the 10% to be significant or meaningful to a company of our size. So I think we want to see steady progress in that direction.

Bonus depreciation did not have an impact in '15 because of the items that I ticked through. There's a number of things that really offset it, the biggest piece being proration, bonus depreciation in the first year and the overlap of those that flowed from '14 into '15, that we had already accounted for. And the biggest thing here is the pole loading program. We picked up little over $300 million of rate base from pole loading that was not included in our prior forecast that we included now, based on our year-end review. And that's the biggest offset for '15. And you can see bonus growing in '16 and '17 as you expect it would be at 50%, and it reaches up to $700 million impact by '17. But really what's happening in the pole loading program, in a sense, is offsetting the bonus depreciation and it gets up to -- pole loading gets up to $700 million. And so the only changes are really going on are the small changes in and around what's happening with FERC and a little bit of the CPUC. So we do have an increase in rate base, ultimately through '16 and '17. But the bonus depreciation is offset by the pole loading program. So Page 8, if you don't have it there, really kind of describes the full details of how rate base changed over this 3-year period, I think, it's probably the most helpful tool."

But we're at the bottom end of the range based on the midpoint of the 2016 earnings guidance range that we just gave. Depending on where earnings actually come out, depending on how we would look at moving our way through the 45% to 55%, we would kind of view that 7% as more of a floor than anything else. So that was the principal point that I was trying to insinuate in there. In terms of whether we're trying to get to a specific point in the 45% to 55%, I clearly was not trying to give a specific point that we would target in there. 45% to 55%, we feel has been the appropriate range given that we have a higher than industry average rate base growth and higher than industry average earnings growth rate. These things kind of ultimately balance together but for the foreseeable future, we think we'll have a -- we'll continue to have a higher than industry average rate base in earnings growth and so 45% to 55% seems still to be about the right range."

And there's some other things that are pluses and minuses, Ted mentioned it I had it in my script. We've got the Charge Ready program that's flowing through, that's on a separate track and we need to get through the Phase I before we can add the additional $300 million, potentially up to $300 million of capital expenditures for that program. Also I also said, we didn't have any storage-related expenditures in there. So there's a number of things in the mix. And when you get into a GRC, you take a look at all the factors. You want to make sure that your rates are appropriate, that you're not looking up -- pushing out the outer edge of what you can afford from an affordability perspective.

I think one piece that we've said it at various points with investors is, at the high level and without getting lost too much in any specifics for 1 year versus another, things are in equilibrium, assuming around this 50% equity debt capital structure and around a 45% to 55% dividend payout. You're about in equilibrium when you have long-term growth in the 6% to 8% range. You start getting much higher than that, it starts getting -- you start -- you need other things to help out. And in the past, when we had an extremely high growth rate, when we were in that 10% to 12%, we did have a number of unusual things, that's where the global tax settlement deal really helped us out, the bonus depreciation, those types of things. Absent those, we would have really run too hot and we would have had to issue equity. The other part that you mentioned, which I think is really worth emphasizing again here, increasingly, I think, the focus is to try to really hold the line on customer rates. If we look at the long-term trajectory, the history here, last 20 years, we've actually managed to keep customer rates at or below the rate of inflation and we definitely want to at least continue that if anything, we'd like to be able to have rates stay flat. But fundamentally, our goal is to try to keep it more around the rate of inflation or lower. If you get too hot growth rate in here, especially given the relatively modest growth in energy consumption, you're going to really put pressure on rates. So that becomes as much as anything else kind of the governor on what we want to have in the way of growth. So customer rates, equity, long-term growth rate, all of that kind of that boils down to you want to focus to stay somewhere in this kind of 6% to 8%.

In my remarks today, I will touch briefly on our 2015 performance and then focus on Southern California Edison's and Edison Energy group's long-term growth opportunity.

In my remarks today, I will touch briefly on our 2015 performance and then focus on Southern California Edison's and Edison Energy group's long-term growth opportunity. Closing out 1 year and starting a new one is a natural time to reflect on some of the longer-term themes.
Full year 2015 core earnings were $4.10 per share, $0.23 above the high-end of our core earnings guidance range. We also introduced today our 2016 core earnings guidance range of $3.81 to $4.01 per share, which reflects SCE's strong rate base growth, a continuing focus on improvements in operational efficiency, and ongoing energy efficiency incentives.
We believe that SCE's rate base is the best proxy for long-term earnings growth potential. As Jim will soon describe in more detail, we have updated our forecast of SCE's rate base through 2017. Rate base for 2015 increased $300 million, and our forecast for 2016 rate base also increased by $300 million. The rate base for 2017 increased by $100 million. 
It seems some investors have been expecting a substantial decline in rate base due to bonus depreciation, but the effect of bonus depreciation is less and there are other offsets. 
Bonus depreciation did not have any significant impact on 2015. Impacts pick up somewhat in 2016 and '17. Bonus depreciation impacts are more than offset by higher rate base from our distribution pole loading program on which we earn a rate of return, as prescribed in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case. Jim will provide a more fulsome explanation, but the bottom line is that we expect rate base to be slightly higher in 2017 than our previous forecast after taking into account the final General Rate Case decision and the full effect of bonus depreciation.
Customers will see the benefits of SCE's continuing efforts to reduce costs. Through these efforts, together with lower fuel and purchased power costs, the NEIL insurance settlement of our San Onofre claims and the 2015 GRC, customers will receive, on average, a reduction in 2016 rates of 8%. This is a significant benefit for our customers and something we are very pleased to deliver to them.
SCE's share of the $400 million NEIL settlement was $313 million. After legal expenses, 95% went to customers. This is another example of the benefits of the San Onofre settlement unanimously approved by the CPUC in 2014. The last major step in implementing the settlement will be resolution of our pending arbitration case with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Hearings before the 3 judge panel are expected this spring. We still expect a decision late this year. As we've said previously, we are under confidentiality provisions during the litigation process, so we don't expect to have further updates unless there is some material development.
The CPUC's December decision on ex-parte communications completed its consideration of the matters of the SONGS OII. The challenges to the commission's approval of the settlement remain pending. We have no estimates on the time frame to decide those challenges. In the meantime, we are focused on the safe decommissioning of San Onofre. Based on our current decommissioning cost estimates, our decommissioning trust funds are adequately funded and not expected to require any further customer contributions.
Our December dividend increase of $0.25, the second in as many years, equates to a 47% payout based on the midpoint of our 2016 SCE earnings guidance. We continue to see an excellent dividend growth opportunity as we grow SCE earnings and move up through our current targeted payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings. I won't attempt a prediction of future dividend increases, but I will describe our thinking. Our earnings growth is largely driven by long-term rate base growth. After depreciation, capital spending of approximately $4 billion a year will translate into rate base growing by roughly $2 billion a year. This would yield a 7% annual rate base growth potential for some years to come, and if we have higher annual CapEx, we will have a higher rate base growth rate. Additionally, moving the dividend payout ratio further up in our targeted 45% to 55% range only adds to the potential annual dividend growth rate. 
We believe that we are well positioned for sustained growth in rate base and earnings at SCE. We have positioned SCE as a wires-focused business, consistent with our views on industry transformation and in alignment with California's public policy objectives to move the state to a low-carbon economy.
We see more opportunities for growth than we do threats in the changes occurring in our industry. Recently, we have taken steps to further position Edison Energy group to develop those opportunities. We are focused on finding those areas where customers' needs are unmet, that match well with our competitive advantages, and that hold promise for scaling-up sufficiently. Edison Energy group continues to expand into businesses that meet this profile, including distributed solar generation, energy services for commercial and industrial companies, providing new sources of water and competitive transmission.
Our SoCore Energy subsidiary added more commercial rooftop solar customers in 2015, and now has nearly 250 projects operating in 16 states. It has expanded beyond rooftop installations to ground-mounted projects, serving both community solar and rural electric cooperatives. SoCore also piloted an innovative project for Cinemark Theaters that combined its rooftop solar panels with energy storage from Tesla Energy.
We continue to build out an integrated energy services platform, which we call Edison Energy to address the needs of commercial and industrial companies. Our market research has led us to conclude that the largest commercial and industrial companies with multi-state operations are underserved nationally in their energy needs and struggle to deal locally with many different utilities, tariffs and new technologies. We believe we possess several competitive advantages to succeed with customers in this new and quickly evolving power environment.
Our roots are as developers, operators and investors in complex infrastructure. We have deep technical, commercial and regulatory experience and knowledge of the power system. Our brand and substantial size gives customers confidence in our ability to deliver and contrasts with the dizzying array of untested start-ups.
Our platform was expanded through some recent smaller acquisitions in the area of energy engineering and consulting, that was Eneractive Solutions; energy procurement advisory services, which was Delta Energy; and sourcing offsite renewable energy, which was Altenex. Edison Energy now counts 1/4 of the Fortune 50 companies as clients, including General Motors, Microsoft and Procter & Gamble. Next month, Edison Energy will launch marketing efforts to larger C&I companies, emphasizing its abilities as a comprehensive, integrated energy service solution provider. 
Today, these new businesses are small, even though we think the opportunities could be significant. Currently, the vast majority of our capital is dedicated to our core business, modernizing the electric grid at SCE and to moving up our dividend ratio, the payout ratio, closer to the industry norm. Our approach to these new businesses will be disciplined; focused on small initial investments to understand strategic fit, profit drivers and scalability. We have allocated some capital to testing and building our new businesses, but it is currently only around 1% to 2% of the total capital deployed at Edison International. 
We are gaining confidence that there is indeed a market need for these new businesses and that they can be profitable. The major question is whether these businesses can be scaled up sufficiently to be significant to a company our size. If performance warrants and the opportunities continue to look sizeable, we are in a position to increase our commitment. We are encouraged, but ultimately, we will be driven by results.
So to summarize, our strategy has 3 themes. Theme 1, operate with excellence, meaning we operate our existing business with a focus on controlling costs and customer rates and improving service to our utility customers. Theme 2, build the 21st century power network. This means we invest in our existing business and manage the unprecedented changes in policy and technology. And Theme 3 is to expand our growth potential. We systematically explore new growth opportunities by making disciplined investments where industry changes are producing unmet customer need, where we believe Edison has competitive advantages and where scalable opportunities exist. 
Concentrating on these 3 strategic themes will allow us to remain relevant to our existing customers, produce higher than industry average growth in earnings and dividends, and provide the flexibility to adapt and grow in a climate of rapid change. 
So that's it for the big themes. Let me now turn the call over to Jim."
301891,322788367,938906,"Edison International, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My remarks will cover fourth quarter and full year results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecasts and our 2016 earnings guidance. I'll start with SCE's fourth quarter operating results. Please turn t",1933,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My remarks will cover fourth quarter and full year results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecasts and our 2016 earnings guidance. 
I'll start with SCE's fourth quarter operating results. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. SCE's fourth quarter 2015 earnings are $0.89 per share, down $0.20 per share from last year, but well ahead of the $0.66 per share implied by the midpoint of our 2015 earnings guidance. 
Looking at the year-over-year comparison, 2 items from last year stand out. First is the $0.15 per share income tax variance as shown in the right table. As part of the 2015 General Rate Case decision, differences in tax repair benefits for 2015 through 2017 flow through the tax accounting memorandum account, or TAMA, and do not affect earnings. Second is last year's $0.05 per share benefit from resolution of an income tax item from the 2012 GRC. This was recorded in revenues last year and is part of the $0.15 per share revenue variance. 
A key item, and something that was not included in our 2015 earnings guidance, is an $0.08 per share benefit from a new balancing account for SCE's distribution pole inspection and replacement program. Let me provide some additional background. The 2015 GRC established a new balancing account to track costs to inspect distribution poles and to repair or replace them as needed. This is called a pole loading and deteriorated pole balancing account or simply the pole loading balancing account. Balancing account allows SCE to true up from actual O&M and capital expenditures. For 2015, actual capital expenditures substantially exceeded amounts included in the GRC decision. Because of the lateness of the GRC decision, the commission did not limit expenditures for '15, but did limit expenditures for 2016 and 2017. 
Switching now from pole capital expenditures to rate base. The 2015 GRC decision included a pole loading rate base forecast of $296 million. Based on actual expenditures since the inception of the program, the 2015 rate base for poles increased to $625 million. As a result of the higher rate base, SCE recorded additional revenues through the pole loading balancing account to earn its authorized rate of return on the incremental rate base of $329 million. The additional $0.08 per share of earnings is based on both equity and debt returns at the blended authorized rate of 7.9%. The balancing account impact was finalized as part of our year-end reporting cycle and was not previously included in our earnings guidance. The balance of the revenue variance largely reflects the implementation of the 2015 GRC, which lowered authorized revenues, as expected. 
For the fourth quarter, O&M is a net positive $0.07 per share. O&M includes both the ex-parte penalty of $0.05 per share and $0.03 for additional severance costs as part of SCE's ongoing operational excellence efforts. The balance of O&M benefits are from lower transmission, distribution and legal costs. Lower net financing costs are a benefit of $0.03 per share. The incremental tax benefits from 2014 that I mentioned drive the unfavorable tax comparison. 
One important item that was not a key earnings driver in the quarter is bonus depreciation from the 2015 tax law change. Bonus depreciation did reduce average rate base, but only by a nominal amount or a net $31 million. The nominal impact is much less than our general statement that a 50% bonus extension could reduce rate base by $400 million each year. I've come to the conclusion that it's very difficult to effectively estimate the impact of bonus extension until you do the detailed analysis. The fact is there are second and third order effects that can occur, making our general statement accurate only with a controlled set of assumptions. 
With this preamble, there are 3 primary factors that reduce the impact of the bonus depreciation on '15 versus our prior forecast. First, under normalization rules, bonus depreciation is pro-rated in the first year in which capital additions are estimated to be put into service. Second, certain 2015 capital additions relate to work that began in 2014 and are eligible under 2014 bonus depreciation and thus, were included in our prior rate case forecast. Third, the shift in tax payments caused 2015 working cash to increase. For ratemaking purposes, working cash is a component of a rate base. Later in my presentation, I will provide a complete reconciliation of rate base changes for 2015 through 2017. 
As part of the key earnings drivers, revenues and income taxes are lower due to the higher tax repair deductions recorded through the pole loading and TAMA accounts. The higher tax repair deductions in '15 do not affect earnings and are not shown on the right side of the slide as they are netted out. The total impact for the quarter is $0.45 per share in lower revenues and income taxes. 
For the holding company, costs are unchanged at a $0.01 per share. For SCE noncore items in the quarter include the previously announced $1.18 per share charge related to the write-down of the regulatory assets for incremental tax repair deductions for the 2012 through 2014 period. It also includes a $0.04 per share benefit from a NEIL insurance settlement and legal cost recoveries related to SONGS. Holding company noncore items include a $0.03 per share gain on the sale of Edison Capital's affordable housing portfolio at year-end and $0.01 per share related to an account -- to accounting for income tax attributes related to SoCore's tax equity financings. 
Discontinued operations include a $0.02 per share EME-related cost for changes in net liabilities for retirement plans and additional insurance recoveries. Page 15 has a detailed summary of all noncore items.
Please turn to Page 3. Full year 2015 core earnings are $4.10 per share, down $0.49 from a year ago. SCE's 2015 earnings largely reflect the impact of the 2015 GRC decision, especially the treatment of excess tax repair deductions, together with the other fourth quarter key drivers I mentioned earlier.
Excluding the tax repair deductions now tracked in the pole loading and TAMA accounts, CPUC jurisdictional revenue is down $0.39 per share while FERC revenue is up $0.14 per share. 
Among the key cost components, the favorable O&M trend relates largely to the positive fourth quarter factors discussed previously. The favorable net financing costs are mainly from higher AFUDC earnings that we have been reporting all year. The major driver of lower earnings this year is the loss of tax repair benefits. In 2014, we recognized $0.41 of tax repair benefits. In 2015, these benefits either flow through the pole loading or TAMA accounts without impacting earnings. Full year holding company costs are $0.01 per share above last year due to higher income taxes and expenses. 
Please turn to Page 4. This slide walks through the key differences between our 2015 core earnings of $4.10 per share versus the midpoint of our guidance of $3.82. First, you'll see the $0.08 per share related to the $329 million increase in pole loading rate base I discussed earlier. The additional equity return is $0.05 and the debt and preferred return is $0.03 per share. O&M is favorable $0.08 per share due mainly to the factors I mentioned earlier. The other financing benefit is AFUDC at $0.01 per share. Taxes are the other driver due to the implementation of the TAMA account and clarification of treatment of tax items that would otherwise negatively impact earnings but now flow through this account. Holding company costs are at $0.05 per share positive variance due to higher income from Edison Capital and income tax benefits. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast increased slightly, adding $300 million in '16 and $100 million in 2017, as Ted has already mentioned. The 2016 change principally relates to an updated estimate for pole loading expenditures up to the cap provided in the 2015 GRC decision and for cumulative spending in '16 and 2017. This incremental spend will flow into rate base as you will see in a minute. 
The 2017 increase relates to modest changes in the scope and timing of FERC transmission investments. SCE's current forecast does not include any incremental spending on distribution resources plan activities. The forecast also excludes any energy storage investments or Phase 2 of the Charge Ready program.
Please turn to Page 6. A third major transmission project, the Mesa substation, has been included in our capital spending forecast for some time, but has advanced sufficiently through the regulatory approval process that we felt it appropriate to describe more fully. This is a replacement of a 220 kV substation with a 500 kV substation. It will provide additional transmission import capability, allowing greater flexibility in the siting of new generation and reducing the amount of new generation required to meet local reliability needs in the Western Los Angeles basin. This is the Cal ISO approved project.
Please turn to Page 7. This page shows the increase in SCE's rate base forecast that Ted mentioned. I will explain the changes in a moment. The 2-year compound annual growth rate for both the outlook and range cases is 7%. With the complexity associated with the extension of bonus depreciation and the normal changes to our capital expenditures flowing into rate base, we felt it would be helpful to provide a more fulsome reconciliation of rate base changes. 
Please turn to Page 8. For 2015, we ended the year with $329 million of additional rate base from pole loading capital expenditures. As I mentioned earlier, the extension of bonus for 2015 is lost in the rounding. We estimate the impact of bonus depreciation to be about $300 million in '16 and $700 million in '17, relative to our prior forecast. The incremental additions to rate base from the pole loading account activity is about $600 million in '16 and about $700 million in '17. In effect, the impact of bonus is offset by the change in the pole loading rate base. Net-net-net, relative to our prior forecast, rate base increases $300 million in '16 and $100 million in 2017. 
Lastly, we plan to update our capital spending and rate base forecasts through 2020 when we file our next General Rate Case in early September.
Please turn to Page 9. Today, we introduced 2016 earnings guidance with a midpoint of $3.91 per share with a range of plus or minus $0.10 per share. For SCE, we start with a rate base forecast of $25.1 billion, shown on Page 7. The rate base math yields earnings of $3.81 per share. While a number of positive variances in 2015 may not recur in '16, we do expect additional earnings contribution from energy efficiency of $0.05 per share. We also anticipate incremental productivity and financing benefits of $0.17 per share. This implies earnings of $4.09 per share at SCE. 
Lastly, we deduct $0.18 per share for holding company cost with no range. In the past, I've talked about holding company cost of roughly $0.15 per year and on our last call, we pointed out that the sale of Edison Capital would eliminate the earnings contribution this business provided. 
The $0.10 per share loss for 2015 included $0.06 of income from Edison Capital. The increase over 2015 relates primarily to higher financing costs. 
Please turn to Page 10. The last slide reinforces our view that EIX has one of the better opportunities among large-cap utilities for rate base, earnings and dividend growth. 
Thanks, and I'll now turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A."

To be relevant to a company our size, we've generally thought that the suite of businesses on the Edison Energy side, so not just energy services stuff that I spent a lot of my comments on, but really the whole group of companies here, it's probably got to be just as a general rule of thumb, I'd say, it's got to be somewhere in the 10% to be significant or meaningful to a company of our size. So I think we want to see steady progress in that direction. We want to see that these things are capable of actually scaling to that size but assuming that things continue on in the path, at least we see in these very early days, that's the type of magnitude that we would be looking for."

Bonus depreciation did not have an impact in '15 because of the items that I ticked through. There's a number of things that really offset it, the biggest piece being the proration, bonus depreciation in the first year and the overlap of those that flowed from '14 into '15, that we had already accounted for. And the biggest thing here is the pole loading program. We picked up little over $300 million of rate base from pole loading that was not included in our prior forecast that we included now, based on our year-end review. And that's the biggest offset for '15. And you can see bonus growing in '16 and '17 as you expect it would be at 50%, and it reaches up to $700 million impact by '17. But really what's happening in the pole loading program, in a sense, is offsetting the bonus depreciation and it gets up to -- pole loading gets up to $700 million. And so the only changes that are really going on are the small changes in and around what's happening with FERC and a little bit of the CPUC. So we do have an increase in rate base, ultimately through '16 and '17. But the bonus depreciation is offset by the pole loading program. So Page 8, if you don't have it there, really kind of describes the full details of how rate base changed over this 3-year period, I think, it's probably the most helpful tool."

In terms of whether we're trying to get to a specific point in the 45% to 55%, I clearly was not trying to give a specific point that we would target in there. 45% to 55%, we feel has been the appropriate range given that we have a higher than industry average rate base growth and higher than industry average earnings growth rate.

Also I also said, we didn't have any storage-related expenditures in there. So there's a number of things in the mix. And when you get into a GRC, you take a look at all the factors.

So it's a very complicated set of factors that the important thing, the management team here will do between now and September is try to get all these dials just right, and as we prepare for and file our '18 GRC.

I think one piece that we've said it at various points with investors is, at the high level and without getting lost too much in any specifics for 1 year versus another, things are in equilibrium, assuming around this 50% equity debt capital structure and around a 45% to 55% dividend payout. You're about in equilibrium when you have long-term growth in the 6% to 8% range. You start getting much higher than that, it starts getting -- you start -- you need other things to help out. And in the past, when we had an extremely high growth rate, when we were in that 10% to 12%, we did have a number of unusual things, that's where the global tax settlement deal really helped us out, the bonus depreciation, those types of things. Absent those, we would have really run too hot and we would have had to issue equity. The other part that you mentioned, which I think is really worth emphasizing again here, increasingly, I think, the focus is to try to really hold the line on customer rates. If we look at the long-term trajectory, the history here, last 20 years, we've actually managed to keep customer rates at or below the rate of inflation and we definitely want to at least continue that if anything, we'd like to be able to have rates stay flat. But fundamentally, our goal is to try to keep it more around the rate of inflation or lower. If you get too hot growth rate in here, especially given the relatively modest growth in energy consumption, you're going to really put pressure on rates. So that becomes as much as anything else kind of the governor on what we want to have in the way of growth. So customer rates, equity, long-term growth rate, all of that kind of that boils down to you want to focus to stay somewhere in this kind of 6% to 8%. Get much hotter than that, you're going to have to issue equity or have pressure on rates."

In my remarks today, I will touch briefly on our 2015 performance and then focus on Southern California Edison's and Edison Energy group's long-term growth opportunity. Closing out 1 year and starting a new",1431,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will touch briefly on our 2015 performance and then focus on Southern California Edison's and Edison Energy group's long-term growth opportunity. Closing out 1 year and starting a new one is a natural time to reflect on some of the longer-term themes.
Full year 2015 core earnings were $4.10 per share, $0.23 above the high-end of our core earnings guidance range. We also introduced today our 2016 core earnings guidance range of $3.81 to $4.01 per share, which reflects SCE's strong rate base growth, a continuing focus on improvements in operational efficiency, and ongoing energy efficiency incentives.
We believe that SCE's rate base is the best proxy for long-term earnings growth potential. As Jim will soon describe in more detail, we have updated our forecast of SCE's rate base through 2017. Rate base for 2015 increased $300 million, and our forecast for 2016 rate base also increased by $300 million. The rate base for 2017 increased by $100 million. 
It seems some investors have been expecting a substantial decline in rate base due to bonus depreciation, but the effect of bonus depreciation is less and there are other offsets. 
Bonus depreciation did not have any significant impact on 2015. Impacts pick up somewhat in 2016 and '17. Bonus depreciation impacts are more than offset by higher rate base from our distribution pole loading program on which we earn a rate of return, as prescribed in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case. Jim will provide a more fulsome explanation, but the bottom line is that we expect rate base to be slightly higher in 2017 than our previous forecast after taking into account the final General Rate Case decision and the full effect of bonus depreciation.
Customers will see the benefits of SCE's continuing efforts to reduce costs. Through these efforts, together with lower fuel and purchased power costs, the NEIL insurance settlement of our San Onofre claims and the 2015 GRC, customers will receive, on average, a reduction in 2016 rates of 8%. This is a significant benefit for our customers and something we are very pleased to deliver to them.
SCE's share of the $400 million NEIL settlement was $313 million. After legal expenses, 95% went to customers. This is another example of the benefits of the San Onofre settlement unanimously approved by the CPUC in 2014. The last major step in implementing the settlement will be resolution of our pending arbitration case with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Hearings before the 3 judge panel are expected this spring. We still expect a decision late this year. As we've said previously, we are under confidentiality provisions during the litigation process, so we don't expect to have further updates unless there is some material development.
The CPUC's December decision on ex-parte communications completed its consideration of the matters of the SONGS OII. The challenges to the commission's approval of the settlement remain pending. We have no estimates on the time frame to decide those challenges. In the meantime, we are focused on the safe decommissioning of San Onofre. Based on our current decommissioning cost estimates, our decommissioning trust funds are adequately funded and not expected to require any further customer contributions.
Our December dividend increase of $0.25, the second in as many years, equates to a 47% payout based on the midpoint of our 2016 SCE earnings guidance. We continue to see an excellent dividend growth opportunity as we grow SCE earnings and move up through our current targeted payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings. I won't attempt a prediction of future dividend increases, but I will describe our thinking. Our earnings growth is largely driven by long-term rate base growth. After depreciation, capital spending of approximately $4 billion a year will translate into rate base growing by roughly $2 billion a year. This would yield a 7% annual rate base growth potential for some years to come, and if we have higher annual CapEx, we will have a higher rate base growth rate. Additionally, moving the dividend payout ratio further up in our targeted 45% to 55% range only adds to the potential annual dividend growth rate. 
We believe that we are well positioned for sustained growth in rate base and earnings at SCE. We have positioned SCE as a wires-focused business, consistent with our views on industry transformation and in alignment with California's public policy objectives to move the state to a low-carbon economy.
We see more opportunities for growth than we do threats in the changes occurring in our industry. Recently, we have taken steps to further position Edison Energy group to develop those opportunities. We are focused on finding those areas where customers' needs are unmet, that match well with our competitive advantages, and that hold promise for scaling-up sufficiently. Edison Energy group continues to expand into businesses that meet this profile, including distributed solar generation, energy services for commercial and industrial companies, providing new sources of water and competitive transmission.
Our SoCore Energy subsidiary added more commercial rooftop solar customers in 2015, and now has nearly 250 projects operating in 16 states. It has expanded beyond rooftop installations to ground-mounted projects, serving both community solar and rural electric cooperatives. SoCore also piloted an innovative project for Cinemark Theaters that combined its rooftop solar panels with energy storage from Tesla Energy.
We continue to build out an integrated energy services platform, which we call Edison Energy to address the needs of commercial and industrial companies. Our market research has led us to conclude that the largest commercial and industrial companies with multi-state operations are underserved nationally in their energy needs and struggle to deal locally with many different utilities, tariffs and new technologies. We believe we possess several competitive advantages to succeed with customers in this new and quickly evolving power environment.
Our roots are as developers, operators and investors in complex infrastructure. We have deep technical, commercial and regulatory experience and knowledge of the power system. Our brand and substantial size gives customers confidence in our ability to deliver and contrasts with the dizzying array of untested start-ups.
Our platform was expanded through some recent smaller acquisitions in the area of energy engineering and consulting, that was Eneractive Solutions; energy procurement advisory services, which was Delta Energy; and sourcing offsite renewable energy, which was Altenex. Edison Energy now counts 1/4 of the Fortune 50 companies as clients, including General Motors, Microsoft and Procter & Gamble. Next month, Edison Energy will launch marketing efforts to larger C&I companies, emphasizing its abilities as a comprehensive, integrated energy service solution provider. 
Today, these new businesses are small, even though we think the opportunities could be significant. Currently, the vast majority of our capital is dedicated to our core business, modernizing the electric grid at SCE and to moving up our dividend ratio, the payout ratio, closer to the industry norm. Our approach to these new businesses will be disciplined; focused on small initial investments to understand strategic fit, profit drivers and scalability. We have allocated some capital to testing and building our new businesses, but it is currently only around 1% to 2% of the total capital deployed at Edison International. 
We are gaining confidence that there is indeed a market need for these new businesses and that they can be profitable. The major question is whether these businesses can be scaled up sufficiently to be significant to a company our size. If performance warrants and the opportunities continue to look sizeable, we are in a position to increase our commitment. We are encouraged, but ultimately, we will be driven by results.
So to summarize, our strategy has 3 themes. Theme 1, operate with excellence, meaning we operate our existing business with a focus on controlling costs and customer rates and improving service to our utility customers. Theme 2, build the 21st century power network. This means we invest in our existing business and manage the unprecedented changes in policy and technology. And Theme 3 is to expand our growth potential. We systematically explore new growth opportunities by making disciplined investments where industry changes are producing unmet customer need, where we believe Edison has competitive advantages and where scalable opportunities exist. 
Concentrating on these 3 strategic themes will allow us to remain relevant to our existing customers, produce higher than industry average growth in earnings and dividends, and provide the flexibility to adapt and grow in a climate of rapid change. 
So that's it for the big themes. Let me now turn the call over to Jim."
301891,322788367,940045,"Edison International, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My remarks will cover fourth quarter and full year results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecasts and our 2016 earnings guidance. I'll start with SCE's fourth quarter operating results. Please turn t",1933,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My remarks will cover fourth quarter and full year results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecasts and our 2016 earnings guidance. 
I'll start with SCE's fourth quarter operating results. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. SCE's fourth quarter 2015 earnings are $0.89 per share, down $0.20 per share from last year, but well ahead of the $0.66 per share implied by the midpoint of our 2015 earnings guidance. 
Looking at the year-over-year comparison, 2 items from last year stand out. First is the $0.15 per share income tax variance as shown in the right table. As part of the 2015 General Rate Case decision, differences in tax repair benefits for 2015 through 2017 flow through the tax accounting memorandum account, or TAMA, and do not affect earnings. Second is last year's $0.05 per share benefit from resolution of an income tax item from the 2012 GRC. This was recorded in revenues last year and is part of the $0.15 per share revenue variance. 
A key item, and something that was not included in our 2015 earnings guidance, is an $0.08 per share benefit from a new balancing account for SCE's distribution pole inspection and replacement program. Let me provide some additional background. The 2015 GRC established a new balancing account to track costs to inspect distribution poles and to repair or replace them as needed. This is called a pole loading and deteriorated pole balancing account or simply the pole loading balancing account. Balancing account allows SCE to true up from actual O&M and capital expenditures. For 2015, actual capital expenditures substantially exceeded amounts included in the GRC decision. Because of the lateness of the GRC decision, the commission did not limit expenditures for '15, but did limit expenditures for 2016 and 2017. 
Switching now from pole capital expenditures to rate base. The 2015 GRC decision included a pole loading rate base forecast of $296 million. Based on actual expenditures since the inception of the program, the 2015 rate base for poles increased to $625 million. As a result of the higher rate base, SCE recorded additional revenues through the pole loading balancing account to earn its authorized rate of return on the incremental rate base of $329 million. The additional $0.08 per share of earnings is based on both equity and debt returns at the blended authorized rate of 7.9%. The balancing account impact was finalized as part of our year-end reporting cycle and was not previously included in our earnings guidance. The balance of the revenue variance largely reflects the implementation of the 2015 GRC, which lowered authorized revenues, as expected. 
For the fourth quarter, O&M is a net positive $0.07 per share. O&M includes both the ex-parte penalty of $0.05 per share and $0.03 for additional severance costs as part of SCE's ongoing operational excellence efforts. The balance of O&M benefits are from lower transmission, distribution and legal costs. Lower net financing costs are a benefit of $0.03 per share. The incremental tax benefits from 2014 that I mentioned drive the unfavorable tax comparison. 
One important item that was not a key earnings driver in the quarter is bonus depreciation from the 2015 tax law change. Bonus depreciation did reduce average rate base, but only by a nominal amount or a net $31 million. The nominal impact is much less than our general statement that a 50% bonus extension could reduce rate base by $400 million each year. I've come to the conclusion that it's very difficult to effectively estimate the impact of bonus extension until you do the detailed analysis. The fact is there are second and third order effects that can occur, making our general statement accurate only with a controlled set of assumptions. 
With this preamble, there are 3 primary factors that reduce the impact of the bonus depreciation on '15 versus our prior forecast. First, under normalization rules, bonus depreciation is pro-rated in the first year in which capital additions are estimated to be put into service. Second, certain 2015 capital additions relate to work that began in 2014 and are eligible under 2014 bonus depreciation and thus, were included in our prior rate case forecast. Third, the shift in tax payments caused 2015 working cash to increase. For ratemaking purposes, working cash is a component of a rate base. Later in my presentation, I will provide a complete reconciliation of rate base changes for 2015 through 2017. 
As part of the key earnings drivers, revenues and income taxes are lower due to the higher tax repair deductions recorded through the pole loading and TAMA accounts. The higher tax repair deductions in '15 do not affect earnings and are not shown on the right side of the slide as they are netted out. The total impact for the quarter is $0.45 per share in lower revenues and income taxes. 
For the holding company, costs are unchanged at a $0.01 per share. For SCE noncore items in the quarter include the previously announced $1.18 per share charge related to the write-down of the regulatory assets for incremental tax repair deductions for the 2012 through 2014 period. It also includes a $0.04 per share benefit from a NEIL insurance settlement and legal cost recoveries related to SONGS. Holding company noncore items include a $0.03 per share gain on the sale of Edison Capital's affordable housing portfolio at year-end and $0.01 per share related to an account -- to accounting for income tax attributes related to SoCore's tax equity financings. 
Discontinued operations include a $0.02 per share EME-related cost for changes in net liabilities for retirement plans and additional insurance recoveries. Page 15 has a detailed summary of all noncore items.
Please turn to Page 3. Full year 2015 core earnings are $4.10 per share, down $0.49 from a year ago. SCE's 2015 earnings largely reflect the impact of the 2015 GRC decision, especially the treatment of excess tax repair deductions, together with the other fourth quarter key drivers I mentioned earlier.
Excluding the tax repair deductions now tracked in the pole loading and TAMA accounts, CPUC jurisdictional revenue is down $0.39 per share while FERC revenue is up $0.14 per share. 
Among the key cost components, the favorable O&M trend relates largely to the positive fourth quarter factors discussed previously. The favorable net financing costs are mainly from higher AFUDC earnings that we have been reporting all year. The major driver of lower earnings this year is the loss of tax repair benefits. In 2014, we recognized $0.41 of tax repair benefits. In 2015, these benefits either flow through the pole loading or TAMA accounts without impacting earnings. Full year holding company costs are $0.01 per share above last year due to higher income taxes and expenses. 
Please turn to Page 4. This slide walks through the key differences between our 2015 core earnings of $4.10 per share versus the midpoint of our guidance of $3.82. First, you'll see the $0.08 per share related to the $329 million increase in pole loading rate base I discussed earlier. The additional equity return is $0.05 and the debt and preferred return is $0.03 per share. O&M is favorable $0.08 per share due mainly to the factors I mentioned earlier. The other financing benefit is AFUDC at $0.01 per share. Taxes are the other driver due to the implementation of the TAMA account and clarification of treatment of tax items that would otherwise negatively impact earnings but now flow through this account. Holding company costs are at $0.05 per share positive variance due to higher income from Edison Capital and income tax benefits. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast increased slightly, adding $300 million in '16 and $100 million in 2017, as Ted has already mentioned. The 2016 change principally relates to an updated estimate for pole loading expenditures up to the cap provided in the 2015 GRC decision and for cumulative spending in '16 and 2017. This incremental spend will flow into rate base as you will see in a minute. 
The 2017 increase relates to modest changes in the scope and timing of FERC transmission investments. SCE's current forecast does not include any incremental spending on distribution resources plan activities. The forecast also excludes any energy storage investments or Phase 2 of the Charge Ready program.
Please turn to Page 6. A third major transmission project, the Mesa substation, has been included in our capital spending forecast for some time, but has advanced sufficiently through the regulatory approval process that we felt it appropriate to describe more fully. This is a replacement of a 220 kV substation with a 500 kV substation. It will provide additional transmission import capability, allowing greater flexibility in the siting of new generation and reducing the amount of new generation required to meet local reliability needs in the Western Los Angeles basin. This is the Cal ISO approved project.
Please turn to Page 7. This page shows the increase in SCE's rate base forecast that Ted mentioned. I will explain the changes in a moment. The 2-year compound annual growth rate for both the outlook and range cases is 7%. With the complexity associated with the extension of bonus depreciation and the normal changes to our capital expenditures flowing into rate base, we felt it would be helpful to provide a more fulsome reconciliation of rate base changes. 
Please turn to Page 8. For 2015, we ended the year with $329 million of additional rate base from pole loading capital expenditures. As I mentioned earlier, the extension of bonus for 2015 is lost in the rounding. We estimate the impact of bonus depreciation to be about $300 million in '16 and $700 million in '17, relative to our prior forecast. The incremental additions to rate base from the pole loading account activity is about $600 million in '16 and about $700 million in '17. In effect, the impact of bonus is offset by the change in the pole loading rate base. Net-net-net, relative to our prior forecast, rate base increases $300 million in '16 and $100 million in 2017. 
Lastly, we plan to update our capital spending and rate base forecasts through 2020 when we file our next General Rate Case in early September.
Please turn to Page 9. Today, we introduced 2016 earnings guidance with a midpoint of $3.91 per share with a range of plus or minus $0.10 per share. For SCE, we start with a rate base forecast of $25.1 billion, shown on Page 7. The rate base math yields earnings of $3.81 per share. While a number of positive variances in 2015 may not recur in '16, we do expect additional earnings contribution from energy efficiency of $0.05 per share. We also anticipate incremental productivity and financing benefits of $0.17 per share. This implies earnings of $4.09 per share at SCE. 
Lastly, we deduct $0.18 per share for holding company cost with no range. In the past, I've talked about holding company cost of roughly $0.15 per year and on our last call, we pointed out that the sale of Edison Capital would eliminate the earnings contribution this business provided. 
The $0.10 per share loss for 2015 included $0.06 of income from Edison Capital. The increase over 2015 relates primarily to higher financing costs. 
Please turn to Page 10. The last slide reinforces our view that EIX has one of the better opportunities among large-cap utilities for rate base, earnings and dividend growth. 
Thanks, and I'll now turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A."

It's that last part that I think we're spending most of our time on now. Assuming it's scalable, and assuming we could make those kinds of investments that would really allow us to fully capture the opportunity. To be relevant to a company our size, we've generally thought that the suite of businesses on the Edison Energy side, so not just energy services stuff that I spent a lot of my comments on, but really the whole group of companies here, it's probably got to be just as a general rule of thumb, I'd say, it's got to be somewhere in the 10% to be significant or meaningful to a company of our size. So I think we want to see steady progress in that direction. We want to see that these things are capable of actually scaling to that size but assuming that things continue on in the path, at least we see in these very early days, that's the type of magnitude that we would be looking for."

Bonus depreciation did not have an impact in '15 because of the items that I ticked through. There's a number of things that really offset it, the biggest piece being the proration, bonus depreciation in the first year and the overlap of those that flowed from '14 into '15, that we had already accounted for. And the biggest thing here is the pole loading program. We picked up little over $300 million of rate base from pole loading that was not included in our prior forecast that we included now, based on our year-end review. And that's the biggest offset for '15. And you can see bonus growing in '16 and '17 as you expect it would be at 50%, and it reaches up to $700 million impact by '17. But really what's happening in the pole loading program, in a sense, is offsetting the bonus depreciation and it gets up to -- pole loading gets up to $700 million. And so the only changes that are really going on are the small changes in and around what's happening with FERC and a little bit of the CPUC. So we do have an increase in rate base, ultimately through '16 and '17. But the bonus depreciation is offset by the pole loading program. So Page 8, if you don't have it there, really kind of describes the full details of how rate base changed over this 3-year period, I think, it's probably the most helpful tool."

In terms of whether we're trying to get to a specific point in the 45% to 55%, I clearly was not trying to give a specific point that we would target in there. 45% to 55%, we feel has been the appropriate range given that we have a higher than industry average rate base growth and higher than industry average earnings growth rate.

Also I also said, we didn't have any storage-related expenditures in there. So there's a number of things in the mix. And when you get into a GRC, you take a look at all the factors.

I think one piece that we've said it at various points with investors is, at the high level and without getting lost too much in any specifics for 1 year versus another, things are in equilibrium, assuming around this 50% equity debt capital structure and around a 45% to 55% dividend payout. You're about in equilibrium when you have long-term growth in the 6% to 8% range. You start getting much higher than that, it starts getting -- you start -- you need other things to help out. And in the past, when we had an extremely high growth rate, when we were in that 10% to 12%, we did have a number of unusual things, that's where the global tax settlement deal really helped us out, the bonus depreciation, those types of things. Absent those, we would have really run too hot and we would have had to issue equity. The other part that you mentioned, which I think is really worth emphasizing again here, increasingly, I think, the focus is to try to really hold the line on customer rates. If we look at the long-term trajectory, the history here, last 20 years, we've actually managed to keep customer rates at or below the rate of inflation and we definitely want to at least continue that if anything, we'd like to be able to have rates stay flat. But fundamentally, our goal is to try to keep it more around the rate of inflation or lower. If you get too hot growth rate in here, especially given the relatively modest growth in energy consumption, you're going to really put pressure on rates. So that becomes as much as anything else kind of the governor on what we want to have in the way of growth. So customer rates, equity, long-term growth rate, all of that kind of that boils down to you want to focus to stay somewhere in this kind of 6% to 8%. Get much hotter than that, you're going to have to issue equity or have pressure on rates."

Our first quarter core earnings were $0.82 per share, $0.08 per share lower than last year's first quarter. Most of this decline was due to timing differences at SCE during 2015, which were caused by the delay in receiving the 2015 to 2017 General Rate Case. The underlying earnings in the first quarter of 2016 are consistent with the profile we expect for the year. Therefore, today, we are reaffirming our 2016 core earnings guidance of $3.81 to $4.01 per share. Jim will elaborate on all of this in his remarks. 
I will focus most of my comments today on SCE's long-term growth potential. This is particularly relevant as we prepare for our 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case filing in September and as the dialogue continues before the CPUC on the distribution resources plan and related proceedings. We believe that if there is good visibility to long-term sustained investment of at least $4 billion annually, this should in turn yield rate base growth of approximately $2 billion a year. 
We have confidence in these levels of investment for several complementary reasons. First, our strategy is very much aligned with California's goals of creating a low-carbon economy and providing customers with energy technology choices. Second, we see several different infrastructure areas that require years of continued investment, all of which can be expanded further from today's levels and can be flexibility substituted for each other. Third, we have been steadily improving our ability to control overheads and fuel and purchase power costs in order to keep customer rates increases though, even with higher capital expenditures. And finally, as our rate base continues to grow, higher levels of investment can be more easily digested without stressing equity levels or our ability to execute the work. I will expend in each of these points further. 
As we look at the potential investments on the horizon, they support, and are supported by, several critical public policy initiatives. The overarching policy support comes from California's desire to create a vibrant, low-carbon economy. This is not solely a goal of policymakers, but rooted in strong public support across income and ethnic divides. It is well understood that the state's low-carbon goals cannot be met without substantially greater electrification of stationary and mobile sources of energy use. E-carbonization is supported by California's existing carbon cap and trade system, which does not rely on USCPA's new carbon rules to be implemented. 
There is also strong support for clean energy technology development in the state, driven in part by the importance of Silicon Valley to the state's economy and its political influence. Importantly, Edison supplies the critical electric infrastructure investment needed to meet the state's low-carbon goals and facilitate customer choice of new clean energy technologies. 
Let me discuss the areas of infrastructure investment needed to meet the goals of providing safe, reliable and low-emitting power to our customers. Starting with the basics, reliability of the core electric infrastructure requires routine replacement of aging poles, transformers, underground cable and so on. Our system grew rapidly after World War II through the 1970s. Therefore, many components are reaching their meantime to failure and must be replaced. SCE's infrastructure replacement program alone, represents more than half of our total distribution system capital expenditures. 
To give you an idea of the size of this task, each year, we replace, on average, 24,000 distribution poles, 4,000 transmission poles, 500 miles of underground cable, and 225 substation circuit breakers. Complementing basic infrastructure replacement is the need to adapt our power grid to changing customer preferences and to new technologies. This evolution to a technologically advanced electric delivery system was outlined in the distribution resources plan, or DRP, that SCE filed last summer. Many of these potential investments are incremental to the investments that make up our current $4 billion annual CapEx. This vision for modernizing the grid, will be an important principle as SCE develops its upcoming General Rate Case filing. 
The CPUC is regulatory proceedings and committed energy resources are still in the early stages.
Initial insights from the preceding appear to endorse some of the approaches we recommended in our DRP finally, while suggesting different approaches in other areas. SCE's General Rate Case filing will be made well before the CPUC has made its full recommendations in the DRP and related proceedings. As a result, SCE will be making its best adjustments on the scope and approach to grid modernization in its GRC filing. During the General Rate Case preceding, SCE's fuse will be synchronized with those of other stakeholders, informed by the discussions taking place in the CPUC's broader distribution resources plan proceedings. 
The GRC will be the cornerstone proceeding for determining SCE's distribution system investment program. However, there are several complementary initiatives that represent additional investments in the power grid of the future and that are not part of the current $4 billion annual CapEx. The first is electric vehicle charging. Last month, the CPUC officially authorized SCE to commence spending under the Charge Ready pilot program they previously approved. The pilot covers the first 1,500 stations of an eventual plan for 30,000 charging systems. The total program is estimated to provide roughly 1/3 of the charging infrastructure needed in SCE service territory for autos and light vehicle at multifamily dwellings and public locations. While the rate base opportunity for the full program is approximately $225 million over several years, it is possible that the CPUC will consider higher levels of utility investment in charging infrastructure.
Longer term, we think it is likely that additional opportunities for vehicle charging and other infrastructure may result from the transportation electrification initiative included in Senate Bill 350 signed into law last year. The bill is better known for establishing the mandate for electric utilities to deliver 50% of their customer load from renewable resources by 2030, but it also expanded the potential scope and scale of transportation electrification, which could support investments beyond SCE's current Charge Ready light-duty vehicle initiative. The objective is to support California meeting its long-term carbon reduction targets and federal Clean Air Act standards. The electric sector in California, especially the 3 investor-owned utilities, have become very low-carbon emitting, while the transportation sector has not. The result is that today, nearly 40% of total carbon emissions in the state comes from the transportation sector compared to less than 20% for the electric sector. 
As part of the implementation of SB 350, this fall, the CPUC is expected to order investor-owned electric power companies to submit proposals for investments in programs that will accelerate widespread adoption of transportational electrification. This would include potentially higher levels of light-duty vehicle charging infrastructure than SCU's current target of providing 30,000 chargers. It could also include charging infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, such as electric buses, trucks and tractors, which are especially important in meeting increasingly stringent air quality requirements in the L.A. basin. These early concepts were part of the agenda at a CPUC workshop in San Francisco last Friday posted by assigned Commissioner Peterman. 
Another potential investment class not included in our $4 billion annual CapEx is the CPUC's energy storage initiative. SCE has the opportunity to build half of its required 580 megawatts of energy storage and place it in its rate base by 2024. We have yet to attempt to estimate the potential capital spending rate base or timing of this investment. However, storage is a mandated program and could be significant. The DRP process may spell out a greater role for storage solutions located in the distribution systems as the economics improve and the carbon reduction attributes of storage relative to gas power generation become more apparent. 
Transmission investments remain an important complement to SCE's distribution system investment program, though the planning process and scale are quite different. SCE continues to implement 3 major California ISO-approved investments. These projects are needed for transmission reliability and support the state's renewable portfolio mandate. 
On April 11, SCE received a proposed decision to approve the $1.1 billion West of Devers project recommended by SCE and the California ISO. You may recall that we informed you last November of delays in the regulatory approvals of this project due to consideration of an alternative staged project. The proposed decision largely adopts the project as we originally proposed. It could be approved as early as May 12. Assuming the PD is adopted by the commission and once the required federal approvals are received, the project will be ready to begin construction. The West of Devers project will help California meet its 50% renewables portfolio standard.
California ISO is in the early stages of planning for the transmission infrastructure to meet the expanded renewables requirement. This will be integrated with efforts underway to extend the span of the ISO to include adjacent electric power companies in other states. There is likely to be a continuing debate about whether the future resource mix should favor more utility scale renewables with expanded transmission capacity or distributed resources enabled by an advanced distribution system. I expect it will be a mix of the 2 models. 
SCE is positioned to participate in both models. We expect either approach will expand the investment opportunity at SCE beyond the current $4 billion annual level. 
While it is difficult to predict the exact trajectory of investment levels required to support California's policy objectives, our general belief is that investment levels could potentially grow beyond current CapEx levels. A critical objective that we and the CPUC share is to avoid causing customer rates from becoming unaffordable due to this expanded infrastructure investment. Our objective has been to keep customer rate increases at or below the rate of inflation in our service territory. To-date, our record of accomplishing this goal is quite good. The compound annual growth rate of SCE's system average rate has consistently stayed below that of the consumer price index for our service territory. This is true whether you look at the last 5 years, 10 years, 15 years or even the last 20 years. It is especially notable that this has occurred when kilowatt hour usage since 2007 has been flat to declining. Indeed, our system average rate in 2016 has dropped 8% from 2015 levels.  Importantly, customers react mostly to their monthly bill, not kilowatt hour rates, and our average monthly residential electric bill last year was $94, meaningfully below the national average of $127 a month.
We have accomplished this through a sharp focus on reducing overhead cost, creating efficiencies and due to the benefits of the SONGS settlement as well as declines in fuel cost. 
A concluding thoughts on keeping rates affordable longer-term. I believe the growing percentage of renewables in our generation mix is creating an excellent hedge against potential future spikes in natural gas prices. Although, I don't expect much upward pressure on natural gas prices in the near to intermediate term, it is difficult to imagine much room for prices to go lower. SCE's generation mix will move up from the current level of roughly 25% renewables to 50%. The cost of renewables newbuild is increasingly becoming equal to or better than natural gas newbuild. Also, since renewables have no fuel cost, customer rates are increasingly less exposed to future natural gas price spikes. All of this helps to keep our rate increases modest and electricity affordable, while we increase our investment in building an advanced electric delivery system. 
As I've discussed, SCE has several potential areas of incremental investment, which gives us flexibility to ramp up one program if another starts to lag. This, along with a steadily expanding rate base, earnings and cash flow, allows us to maintain a reasonable and growing total investment program without creating pressure to issue equity or having customer rates rise beyond inflation rates. A balanced program like this should also allow us to continue to provide higher than average -- higher than industry average growth in earnings and dividends. 
I'd like to conclude with a brief discussion of power grid reliability this summer in the wake of the canyon shutdown. SCE is working closely with California regulators and Sempra's Southern California gas company on impacts from potential delays and returning the canyon gas storage facility to use. Canyon provides pipeline pressure balancing to the Los Angeles Basin year-round. It also provides additional supplies in the winter when heating needs increase demand beyond the capability of interstate pipeline deliveries. SCE is one of SoCal gases largest customers and very focused on this issue. Because of the shutdown, the risk to electric reliability has increased, which presents its own public safety implications. As we see it the best scenario for electric reliability is still expeditiously complete inspections of a few of the more important wells to determine if they could be safely returned to service in time for summer peak power use. 
SCE is also working on contingency plans to reduce demand and maximize generation flexibility. At the CPUC's direction, SCE has requested a memorandum account to track any unusual costs related to Aliso Canyon. These include costs related to demand response, energy efficiency, power contracts, et cetera. These costs are not expected to be sizable. Any extra customer costs related to inefficient power plant dispatch will be captured as part of the ERRA, or Era balancing account mechanism. Although this situation shouldn't create financial risk for SCE, it is a potential reliability issue for our customers. 
Okay, that's it for me. I'll now turn it over to Jim for his financial report."

I want to emphasize the quarterly earnings profile would be difficult to model given 2 primary factors: SCE's delay in",1084,"Okay, thank you, Ted. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. As Ted indicated, today, we are reaffirming our core earnings guidance. I want to emphasize the quarterly earnings profile would be difficult to model given 2 primary factors: SCE's delay in receiving its 2015 GRC decision and because revenues are generally weighted towards the third quarter of the year.
As discussed when we introduced our 2016 earnings guidance, a simplified rate base approach is the best way to think about SCE's earnings power on an annual basis. SCE's rate base is growing and this implies increasing earnings. However, anticipated revenue increases from both the CPUC and FERC were massed by the timing of revenues recognized in 2015. You will recall that until SCE received its 2015 GRC proposed decision, revenues were largely based on 2014 authorized levels. SCE recorded a significant year-to-date revenue adjustment in the third quarter of 2015 and a large regulatory asset write-off in the fourth quarter in connection with the final decision. 
With that in mind, let's look at SCE's earnings drivers. To simplify the earnings explanation, we removed the impact of San Onofre and tax repair and pole loading deductions. On a GAAP basis as shown in the 10-Q, revenues are down $41 million, which is equivalent to $0.08 per share. As explained in Footnote 4, the 2016 revenue reduction relates to incremental tax repair and cost removal deductions for the pole loading program in excess of levels authorized in the 2015 GRC. As we have previously explained, the GRC decision established balancing accounts to track forecast differences compared to actuals. Importantly, with these balancing accounts, there is no impact on earnings. Lastly, this is also the main driver for the low effective income tax rate for the quarter. 
After the adjustments, revenues are net $0.04 per share positive contribution on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Breaking revenues down, there is an $0.08 per share GRC attrition mechanism increase. This mechanism provides per increases in revenues after the 2015 test year. Largely offsetting this is a $0.06 per share timing issue on a GRC decision. As I mentioned earlier, reductions in authorized revenues from the GRC decisions are not reflected in the first or second quarter 2015 results and were adjusted in the third quarter with the proposed decision and then again in the fourth quarter with the final GRC decision. 
To finish up on revenues. FERC revenues are $0.02 per share higher largely for higher depreciation expense. This nets to a positive $0.04 per share earnings contribution from revenues.
Moving to O&M. Costs are $0.04 per share higher than last year. A significant factor in this was planned El Niño preparation cost where SCE stage equipment, such as portable generators in areas that could be sensitive to storm-related outages as well as costs associated with responses to storms. While the Southern California El Niño phenomena did not materialized at the level that had been predicted by many, we did see more significant storm activity than we experienced in 2015.
Other important items include planned higher costs for distribution system inspections as well as higher severance costs resulting from ongoing efforts to drive increased productivity and efficiency. 
Higher depreciation of $0.02 per share reflects the normal trends supporting SCE's wired focus capital spending program. Income taxes, excluding the tax balancing account related items, I've already discussed are $0.02 per share higher than last year. The effective tax rate in the quarter is 14% compared to 24% last year. As I said previously, the lower rate largely reflects the incremental tax benefits above authorized levels. Excluding the $0.13 per share incremental tax benefits, the effective tax rate would have been 34%.
Turning to Edison International earnings drivers strivers. Overall costs are higher by $0.03 per share. Holding company costs are comparable to last year. We had no affordable housing earnings this year since the portfolio was sold last December, while in Q1 of 2015, we recorded a $0.01 per share of earnings. Edison Energy's net loss of $0.02 per share higher than last year. This reflects expected development and operating cost of Edison Energy's businesses and timing of revenues from the newly acquired businesses. Revenues are $6 million in the first quarter of 2016. Our reported sales from last year were $3 million and only included SoCore Energy and not the recently acquired companies. I'd also like to remind investors that our financing strategy for SoCore Energy's commercial solar program, primarily uses third-party tax equity and project financing. As a result, a portion of the project economics go to the tax equity investors.
Holding company results on a core basis, exclude earnings related to the hypothetical liquidation and book value accounting method for SoCore Energy's tax equity financings. This is a $0.01 per share this year versus $0.02 per share last year, so overall, Edison International core earnings are down $0.08 per share. 
Please turn to Page 3. SCE's capital spending forecast is unchanged from our last call. First quarter and actual SCE spending of $1 billion is consistent with 2016 authorized levels. Keep in mind that this forecast does not include any DRP-related spending. SCE will continue to evaluate whether to pursue any early-stage work this year. Page 4 shows SCE's rate base forecast, which is also unchanged.
Please turn to Page 5. The West of Devers project, ed mentioned, is 1 of the 2 large transmission projects where most of the investments will be on the current rates base guidance period. Some of you may have followed this proceeding and there's one unique aspect to the project, some of the West of Devers route transits the Indian reservation and the Coachella Valley. As discussed in our 10-K, transmission entity has an option to invest $400 million or up to 1/2 the $1.1 billion project at commercial operation, which SCE expects to be in 2021. For internal planning purposes, SCE assumes that the option will be exercised. The 2018 GRC will include capital expenditures through 2020, with the option exercise date filing just outside the period of time, we will be providing more visibility on. We thought it was important to bring this option to the attention of investors and analysts. 
Please turn to Page 6. We have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance for the full year at $3.81 to $4.01 per share and updated our GAAP guidance for first quarter noncore items. Our key assumptions are also unchanged. That's it for me.

And as soon as we get to the pilot phase, we will go back to the PUC with a report and have a seek authorization to take on the balance of the up to 30,000 charges covered by the charge rating program. So I think you'll have visibility into that and of the into regulatory time line for that I think the pilot might take up to 12 months. We will go to the PUC as soon as we have enough data from the pilot. And it's tough to forecast how long it might take the PUC to provide approval for the balance of a charge rating program, but we would be going back as soon as we have our data. Separate from that come in terms of additional opportunities, I think in Ted's remarks, he commented how it is possible that the PUC might envision a further role for us, I think a couple of directions for that. One, could be that with the charge rating program, we've estimated those 30,000 chargers would cover about 1/3 of the need for your charging infrastructure to meet the state's objectives for electric vehicle deployment. So one potential for us would be whether the PUC might support us going in further than the charge rating program to find Africa's or anything like that it there, but that is one potential directions. The other one is SB 350 that talks about support for a broader utility role in transportation and electrification and that code go beyond like to let the other forms of transportation. Again, tough to put our arms around what that could be intersect with the integrated resource by proceeding that's also called for the SB 350, that's just undergoing scoping at the PUC now. So while we can't point precisely to a specific program or specific a numbers but I think the theme is that there's a general recognition in the state of the transportation electrification whether light-duty vehicles or heavier transports is going to be a big part of achieving greenhouse start target and it's likely some profitability for further utility roles there."

I think if you look at vehicle charging, today, it has -- we've been able to accommodate the number of vehicles that have come on the grid without any new impact of the system. I think this is one of these items where we'd expect to have planning visibility into what the needs are as the market continues to grow, so I don't think once that lends itself to a dramatic spike. I'd also point out that from a system perspective, the California system overall, still enjoyed some pretty healthy margins. And then, so expect that certainly over the next several years to be the ability to accommodate that. And then the final point I'd make is that as the load from electric vehicles increases, that is happening in the context though of the net load for the system, which we continue to see moving in a generally flat to even potential decline as we have other offsetting factors, increased energy efficiency, increased demand response, so we'll have to continue to watch this from a planning perspective as the market develops. But today, we're not seeing any undue impact difficult to manage. Maybe one last little quote on it is that as we get more vehicles on the system, we want to be working with the regulators to have the right to sort of signals and incentives to encourage charging helps overall system perspective. So you guys are all pretty familiar with the concept of the fact that we have a lot more solar on the system today and the ISO expected to grow. To so extent we can accommodate electric vehicles with current resources, will be assisted by having charging align better with time periods during the day when we have more energy flowing out of solar panels."

But over time, I think as the general trend, we like to see it come in from that inflation level."

Then at the end, you talked about maybe some programs could lag over time and the like and so I'm just overall, are you kind of sending a message that we're likely to see higher capital spend over this future period than we've had in the past given these variety of new programs?"

So the point we're really trying to make is that there are many levers, but there's also a balancing act. So under the many levers part of the equation, if for some reason one or more of these potential capital spends lags or we need to pull it back, there are substitute capital spending that can be pushed into its place. So I think we feel confident about the -- certainly feel confident about the $4 billion and believe that there is upside. Let's say the second part is the balancing act element where you've heard me on this a lot of times before, if you get this thing growing too fast, you end up putting pressure, first, on customer rates then secondly on the ability of the underlying business to support the equity requirement of the new investment. So it's a matter of trying to get it in the sweet spot where you're getting kind of the maximum benefit from the growth but not so fast that it puts pressure on the need to issue equity or on customer rates. And that was the second kind of main point I was trying to get across here is as the rate base growth, earnings, cash grow along with it. We feel comfortable about being able to support a greater than $4 billion number without having to issue equity. And secondly, as we tried to spend a quite of time on here in the remarks, we actually have a really good track record of keeping customer rates below the rate of inflation in our service territory. And that, coupled with the fact that our average residential bill is considerably lower than the national average, and that's what customers really see, we feel we've kind of got the cost side under control and that it will support the ability to have this expanded investment opportunity. So those are kind of all the main points that I was really trying to make."

So this is going to be a little bit of a couple of things happening at the same time. We will do our best to articulate those in the General Rate Case. And there are other things kind of third point, there are other things above and beyond strictly what's in the DRP or what you would find in the General Rate Case, and that's what we're alluding to with some of the electrification -- transportation electrification initiatives embedded in SB 350 and things of that sort, storage, another piece of it would be probably outside of that. And then, of course, as more things develop with the transmission spending as we look towards moving to 50% renewables and then expanded ISO -- California ISO scope, there may very well be other investment opportunities embedded in that, but also are not going to be in the GRC or some of these other proceedings. So I think the general point here is there's, we feel, a robust opportunity but, of course, we want to make sure we're doing that in a good balanced way so it doesn't put pressure on equity, it doesn't put pressure on customers."

Our first quarter core earnings were $0.82 per share, $0.08 per share lower than last year's first quarter. Most of this decline was due to timing differences at SCE during 2015, which were caused by the delay in receiving the 2015 to 2017 General Rate Case. The underlying earnings in the first quarter of 2016 are consistent with the profile we expect for the year. Therefore, today, we are reaffirming our 2016 core earnings guidance of $3.81 to $4.01 per share. Jim will elaborate on all of this in his remarks. 
I will focus most of my comments today on SCE's long-term growth potential. This is particularly relevant as we prepare for our 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case filing in September and as the dialogue continues before the CPUC on the distribution resources plan and related proceedings. We believe that there is good visibility to long-term sustained investment of at least $4 billion annually. This should in turn yield rate base growth of approximately $2 billion a year. 
We have confidence in these levels of investment for several complementary reasons. First, our strategy is very much aligned with California's goals of creating a low-carbon economy and providing customers with energy technology choices. Second, we see several different infrastructure areas that require years of continued investment, all of which can be expanded further from today's levels and can be flexibly substituted for each other. Third, we have been steadily improving our ability to control overheads and fuel and purchase power costs in order to keep customer rate increases low, even with higher capital expenditures. And finally, as our rate base continues to grow, higher levels of investment can be more easily digested without stressing equity levels or our ability to execute the work. I will expand on each of these points further. 
As we look at the potential investments on the horizon, they support, and are supported by, several critical public policy initiatives. The overarching policy support comes from California's desire to create a vibrant, low-carbon economy. This is not solely a goal of policymakers, but rooted in strong public support across income and ethnic divides. It is well understood that the state's low-carbon goals cannot be met without substantially greater electrification of stationary and mobile sources of energy use. E-carbonization is supported by California's existing carbon cap and trade system, which does not rely on USCPA's new carbon rules to be implemented. 
There is also strong support for clean energy technology development in the state, driven in part by the importance of Silicon Valley to the state's economy and its political influence. Importantly, Edison supplies the critical electric infrastructure investment needed to meet the state's low-carbon goals and facilitate customer choice of new clean energy technology. 
Let me discuss the areas of infrastructure investment needed to meet the goals of providing safe, reliable and low-emitting power to our customers. Starting with the basics, reliability of the core electric infrastructure requires routine replacement of aging poles, transformers, underground cable and so on. Our system grew rapidly after World War II through the 1970s. Therefore, many components are reaching their mean time to failure and must be replaced. SCE's infrastructure replacement program alone represents more than half of our total distribution system capital expenditures. 
To give you an idea of the size of this task, each year, we replace, on average, 24,000 distribution poles, 4,000 transmission poles, 500 miles of underground cable and 225 substation circuit breakers. Complementing basic infrastructure replacement is the need to adapt our power grid to changing customer preferences and to new technologies. This evolution to a technologically advanced electric delivery system was outlined in the distribution resources plan, or DRP, that SCE filed last summer. Many of these potential investments are incremental to the investments that make up our current $4 billion annual CapEx. This vision for modernizing the grid will be an important principle, as SCE develops its upcoming General Rate Case filing. 
The CPUC's regulatory proceedings on distributed energy resources are still in the early stages.
Initial insights from the proceeding appear to endorse some of the approaches we recommended in our DRP filing, while suggesting different approaches in other areas. SCE's General Rate Case filing will be made well before the CPUC has made its full recommendations in the DRP and related proceedings. As a result, SCE will be making its best judgments on the scope and approach to grid modernization in its GRC filing. During the General Rate Case proceeding, SCE's views will be synchronized with those of other stakeholders, informed by the discussions taking place in the CPUC's broader distribution resources plan proceedings. 
The GRC will be the cornerstone proceeding for determining SCE's distribution system investment program. However, there are several complementary initiatives that represent additional investment in the power grid of the future and that are not part of the current $4 billion annual CapEx. The first is electric vehicle charging. Last month, the CPUC officially authorized SCE to commence spending under the Charge Ready pilot program they previously approved. The pilot covers the first 1,500 stations of an eventual plan for 30,000 charging systems. The total program is estimated to provide roughly 1/3 of the charging infrastructure needed in SCE service territory for autos and light-duty vehicles at multifamily dwellings and public locations. While the rate base opportunity for the full program is approximately $225 million over several years, it is possible that the CPUC will consider higher levels of utility investment in charging infrastructure.
Longer term, we think it is likely that additional opportunities for vehicle charging and other infrastructure may result from the transportation electrification initiative included in Senate Bill 350 signed into law last year. The bill is better known for establishing the mandate for electric utilities to deliver 50% of their customer load from renewable resources by 2030. But it also expanded the potential scope and scale of transportation electrification, which could support investments beyond SCE's current Charge Ready light-duty vehicle initiative. The objective is to support California meeting its long-term carbon reduction targets and federal Clean Air Act standards. The electric sector in California, especially the 3 investor-owned utilities, have become very low-carbon emitting, while the transportation sector has not. The result is that today, nearly 40% of total carbon emissions in the state comes from the transportation sector compared to less than 20% for the electric sector. 
As part of the implementation of SB 350, this fall, the CPUC is expected to order investor-owned electric power companies to submit proposals for investments in programs that will accelerate widespread adoption of transportation electrification. This would include potentially higher levels of light-duty vehicle charging infrastructure than SCU's current target of providing 30,000 chargers. It could also include charging infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, such as electric buses, trucks and tractors, which are especially important in meeting increasingly stringent air quality requirements in the L.A. basin. These early concepts were part of the agenda at a CPUC workshop in San Francisco last Friday hosted by assigned Commissioner Peterman. 
Another potential investment class not included in our $4 billion annual CapEx is the CPUC's energy storage initiative. SCE has the opportunity to build half of its required 580 megawatts of energy storage and place it in its rate base by 2024. We have yet to attempt to estimate the potential capital spending rate base or timing of this investment. However, storage is a mandated program and could be significant. The DRP process may spell out a greater role for storage solutions located in the distribution systems, as the economics improve and the carbon reduction attributes of storage relative to gas power generation become more apparent. 
Transmission investments remain an important complement to SCE's distribution system investment program, though the planning process and scale are quite different. SCE continues to implement 3 major California ISO-approved investments. These projects are needed for transmission reliability and support the state's renewable portfolio mandate. 
On April 11, SCE received a proposed decision to approve the $1.1 billion West of Devers project recommended by SCE and the California ISO. You may recall that we informed you last November of delays in the regulatory approvals of this project due to consideration of an alternative staged project. The proposed decision largely adopts the project as we originally proposed. It could be approved as early as May 12. Assuming the PD is adopted by the commission and once the required federal approvals are received, the project will be ready to begin construction. The West of Devers project will help California meet its 50% renewables portfolio standard.
California ISO is in the early stages of planning for the transmission infrastructure to meet the expanded renewables requirement. This will be integrated with efforts underway to extend the span of the ISO to include adjacent electric power companies in other states. There is likely to be a continuing debate about whether the future resource mix should favor more utility scale renewables with expanded transmission capacity or distributed resources enabled by an advanced distribution system. I expect it will be a mix of the 2 models. 
SCE is positioned to participate in both models. We expect either approach will expand the investment opportunity at SCE beyond the current $4 billion annual level. 
While it is difficult to predict the exact trajectory of investment levels required to support California's policy objectives, our general belief is that investment levels could potentially grow beyond current CapEx levels. A critical objective that we and the CPUC share is to avoid causing customer rates from becoming unaffordable due to this expanded infrastructure investment. Our objective has been to keep customer rate increases at or below the rate of inflation in our service territory. To-date, our record of accomplishing this goal is quite good. The compound annual growth rate of SCE's system average rate has consistently stayed below that of the consumer price index for our service territory. This is true whether you look at the last 5 years, 10 years, 15 years or even the last 20 years. It is especially notable that this has occurred when kilowatt hour usage since 2007 has been flat to declining. Indeed, our system average rate in 2016 has dropped 8% from 2015 levels.  Importantly, customers react mostly to their monthly bill, not kilowatt hour rates, and our average monthly residential electric bill last year was $94, meaningfully below the national average of $127 a month.
We have accomplished this through a sharp focus on reducing overhead costs, creating efficiencies and due to the benefits of the SONGS settlement as well as declines in fuel costs. 
A concluding thought on keeping rates affordable longer-term. I believe the growing percentage of renewables in our generation mix is creating an excellent hedge against potential future spikes in natural gas prices. Although, I don't expect much upward pressure on natural gas prices in the near to intermediate term, it is difficult to imagine much room for prices to go lower. SCE's generation mix will move up from the current level of roughly 25% renewables to 50%. The cost of renewables newbuild is increasingly becoming equal to or better than natural gas newbuild. Also, since renewables have no fuel cost, customer rates are increasingly less exposed to future natural gas price spikes. All of this helps to keep our rate increases modest and electricity affordable, while we increase our investment in building an advanced electric delivery system. 
As I've discussed, SCE has several potential areas of incremental investment, which gives us flexibility to ramp up one program if another starts to lag. This, along with a steadily expanding rate base, earnings and cash flow, allows us to maintain a reasonable and growing total investment program without creating pressure to issue equity or having customer rates rise beyond inflation rates. A balanced program like this should also allow us to continue to provide higher than average -- higher than industry average growth in earnings and dividends. 
I'd like to conclude with a brief discussion of power grid reliability this summer in the wake of the Aliso Canyon shutdown. SCE is working closely with California regulators and Sempra's Southern California Gas Company on impacts from potential delays in returning the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility to use. Aliso Canyon provides pipeline pressure balancing to the Los Angeles Basin year-round. It also provides additional supplies in the winter when heating needs increase demand beyond the capability of interstate pipeline deliveries. SCE is one of SoCal gas' largest customers and very focused on this issue. Because of the shutdown, the risk to electric reliability has increased, which presents its own public safety implications. As we see it, the best scenario for electric reliability is to expeditiously complete inspections of a few of the more important wells to determine if they could be safely returned to service in time for summer peak power use. 
SCE is also working on contingency plans to reduce demand and maximize generation flexibility. At the CPUC's direction, SCE has requested a memorandum account to track any unusual costs related to Aliso Canyon. These include costs related to demand response, energy efficiency, power contracts, et cetera. These costs are not expected to be sizable. Any extra customer costs related to inefficient power plant dispatch will be captured as part of the E-R-R-A, or ERRA balancing account mechanism. Although this situation shouldn't create financial risk for SCE, it is a potential reliability issue for our customers. 
Okay, that's it from me. I'll now turn it over to Jim for his financial report."

As Ted indicated, today, we are reaffirming our core earnings guidance. I want to emphasize the quarterly earnings profile would be difficult to model given 2 primary factors: SCE's delay in receiving its 2015 GRC decision and because revenues are generally weighted towards the third quarter of the year.
As discussed when we introduced our 2016 earnings guidance, a simplified rate base approach is the best way to think about SCE's earnings power on an annual basis. SCE's rate base is growing, and this implies increase in earnings. However, anticipated revenue increases from both the CPUC and FERC were masked by the timing of revenues recognized in 2015. You will recall that until SCE received its 2015 GRC proposed decision, revenues were largely based on 2014 authorized levels. SCE recorded a significant year-to-date revenue adjustment in the third quarter of 2015 and a large regulatory asset write-off in the fourth quarter in connection with the final decision. 
With that in mind, let's look at SCE's earnings drivers. To simplify the earnings explanation, we removed the impact of San Onofre and tax repair and pole loading deductions. On a GAAP basis, as shown in the 10-Q, revenues are down $41 million, which is equivalent to $0.08 per share. As explained in Footnote 4, the 2016 revenue reduction relates to incremental tax repair and cost removal deductions for the pole loading program in excess of levels authorized in the 2015 GRC. As we have previously explained, the GRC decision established balancing accounts to track forecast differences compared to actuals. Importantly, with these balancing accounts, there is no impact on earnings. Lastly, this is also the main driver for the low effective income tax rate for the quarter. 
After the adjustments, revenues are net $0.04 per share positive contribution on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Breaking revenues down, there is an $0.08 per share GRC attrition mechanism increase. This mechanism provides for increases in revenues after the 2015 test year. Largely offsetting this is a $0.06 per share timing issue on the GRC decision. As I mentioned earlier, reductions in authorized revenues from the GRC decisions are not reflected in the first or second quarter 2015 results and were adjusted in the third quarter with the proposed decision and then again in the fourth quarter with the final GRC decision. 
To finish up on revenues. FERC revenues are $0.02 per share higher, largely for higher depreciation expense. This nets to a positive $0.04 per share earnings contribution from revenues.
Moving to O&M. Costs are $0.04 per share higher than last year. A significant factor in this was planned El Niño preparation costs where SCE stage equipment, such as portable generators in areas that could be sensitive to storm-related outages as well as costs associated with responses to storms. While the Southern California El Niño phenomena did not materialize at the level that had been predicted by many, we did see more significant storm activity than we experienced in 2015.
Other important items include planned higher costs for distribution system inspections as well as higher severance costs resulting from ongoing efforts to drive increased productivity and efficiency. 
Higher depreciation of $0.02 per share reflects the normal trends supporting SCE's wired focus capital spending program. Income taxes, excluding the tax balancing account-related items I've already discussed, are $0.02 per share higher than last year. The effective tax rate in the quarter is 14% compared to 24% last year. As I said previously, the lower rate largely reflects the incremental tax benefits above authorized levels. Excluding the $0.13 per share incremental tax benefits, the effective tax rate would have been 34%.
Turning to Edison International earnings drivers. Overall costs are higher by $0.03 per share. Holding company costs are comparable to last year. We had no affordable housing earnings this year since the portfolio was sold last December, while in Q1 of 2015, we recorded a $0.01 per share of earnings. Edison Energy's net loss of $0.02 per share higher than last year. This reflects expected development and operating cost of Edison Energy's businesses and timing of revenues from the newly acquired businesses. Revenues are $6 million in the first quarter of 2016. Our reported sales from last year were $3 million and only included SoCore Energy and not the recently acquired companies. I'd also like to remind investors that our financing strategy for SoCore Energy's commercial solar program, primarily uses third-party tax equity and project financing. As a result, a portion of the project economics go to the tax equity investors.
Holding company results on a core basis, exclude earnings related to the hypothetical liquidation at book value accounting method for SoCore Energy's tax equity financings. This is a $0.01 per share this year versus $0.02 per share last year. So overall, Edison International core earnings are down $0.08 per share. 
Please turn to Page 3. SCE's capital spending forecast is unchanged from our last call. First quarter and actual SCE spending of $1 billion is consistent with 2016 authorized levels. Keep in mind that this forecast does not include any DRP-related spending. SCE will continue to evaluate whether to pursue any early-stage work this year. Page 4 shows SCE's rate base forecast, which is also unchanged.
Please turn to Page 5. West of Devers project, Ted mentioned, is 1 of the 2 large transmission projects where most of the investment will be on the current rates base guidance period. Some of you may have followed this proceeding, and there's one unique aspect to the project. Some of the West of Devers route transits the Morongo Indian reservation and the Coachella Valley. As discussed in our 10-K, a transmission entity has an option to invest $400 million or up to 1/2 the $1.1 billion project at commercial operation, which SCE expects to be in 2021. For internal planning purposes, SCE assumes that the option will be exercised. The 2018 GRC will include capital expenditures through 2020, with the option exercise date falling just outside of the period of time we will be providing more visibility on. We thought it was important to bring this option to the attention of investors and analysts. 
Please turn to Page 6. We have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance for the full year at $3.81 to $4.01 per share and updated our GAAP guidance for first quarter noncore items. Our key assumptions are also unchanged. That's it from me.

And as soon as we get to the pilot phase, we will go back to the PUC with a report and have it proceeded and seek authorization to take on the balance of the up to 30,000 chargers covered by the Charge Ready program. So I think you'll have visibility into that and in terms of the regulatory time line for that, I think it's envisioned that the pilot might take up to 12 months. We will go to the PUC as soon as we have enough data from the pilot. And it's tough to forecast how long it might take the PUC to provide approval for the balance of the Charge Ready program, but we would be going back as soon as we have our data. Separate from that, in terms of additional opportunities, I think in Ted's remarks, he commented how it is possible that the PUC might envision a further role for us, I think a couple directions for that. One, could be that with the charge rating program, we've estimated those 30,000 chargers would cover about 1/3 of the need for your charging infrastructure to meet the state's objectives for electric vehicle deployment. So one potential for us would be whether the PUC might support us going even further than the Charge Ready program. They want to finally forecast or anything like that it there, but that is one potential directions. The other one is SB 350 that talks about support for a broader utility role in transportation and electrification and that could go beyond like to let the other forms of transportation. Again, tough to put our arms around what that could be intersect with the integrated resource by proceeding that's also called for the SB 350, that's just undergoing scoping at the PUC now. So while we can't point precisely to a specific program or specific numbers out of it, I think the theme is that there's a general recognition in the state that transportation electrification, whether light-duty vehicles or heavier transport, is going to be a big part of achieving greenhouse gas targets and it's likely some profitability for further utility roles there."

I think if you look at electric vehicle charging, today, it has -- we've been able to accommodate the number of vehicles that have come on the grid without any new impact on the system. I think this is one of these items where we'd expect to have planning visibility into what the needs are, as the market continues to grow, So I don't think it's one that lends itself to a dramatic spike. I'd also point out that from a system perspective, the California system overall, still enjoys some pretty reserve margins. And then, so you'd expect that certainly over the next several years to be the ability to accommodate that. And then the final point I'd make is that as the load from electric vehicles increases, that is happening in the context though of the net load for the system, which we continue to see moving in a generally flat to even potential decline as we have other offsetting factors, increased energy efficiency, increased demand response. So we'll have to continue to watch this from a planning perspective as the market develops. But today, we're not seeing any undue impact difficult to manage. Maybe one last little quote on it is that as we get more vehicles on the system, we want to be working with the regulators to have the right to sort of signals and incentives to encourage charging when it helps from an overall system perspective. So you guys are all pretty familiar with the concept of the [indiscernible], the fact that we have a lot more solar on the system today and the ISO expects that to grow. So the extent to which we can accommodate electric vehicles with current resources, will be assisted by having charging a line better with time periods during the day when we have more energy flowing out of solar panels."

So we're trying to balance all those factors, and the goal is to try to keep that the rates in and around the inflation level. And so I think Ted's point were real clear that over longer periods of time, we've had acceleration in capital expenditures and we've had lower gas prices and all these different factors over quite a long period of time. And more importantly, in the shorter term, the cost focus, the reduction in cost because O&M obviously reduces rates dollar-per-dollar where capital is on a smaller percentage. So we'll continue to monitor it. Obviously, from year-to-year, you probably -- we make exceed it or go underneath it like this last year was 8% reduction. But over time, I think as the general trend, we'd like to see it come in around that inflation level."

So the point we're really trying to make is there are many levers, there's also a balancing act. So under the many levers part of the equation, if for some reason one or more of these potential capital spends lags or we need to pull it back, there are substitute capital spending that can be pushed into its place. So I think we feel confident about the -- certainly feel confident about the $4 billion and believe that there is upside. But see, the second part is the balancing act element where you've heard me on this a lot of times before, if you get this thing growing too fast, you end up putting pressure, first, on customer rates then secondly, on the ability of the underlying business to support the equity requirement of the new investment. So it's a matter of trying to get it in the sweet spot where you're getting kind of the maximum benefit from the growth but not so fast that it puts pressure on the need to issue equity or on customer rates. And that was the second kind of main point I was trying to get across here is as the rate base grows, earnings, cash grow along with it. We feel comfortable about being able to support a greater than $4 billion number without having to issue equity. And secondly, as we tried to spend a quite of time on here in the remarks, we actually have a really good track record of keeping customer rates below the rate of inflation in our service territory. And that, coupled with the fact our average residential bill is considerably lower than the national average, and that's what customers really see, we feel we've kind of got the cost side under control and that it will support the ability to have this expanded investment opportunity. So those are kind of all the main points that I was really trying to make."

So this was going to be a little bit of a couple of things happening at the same time. We will do our best to articulate those in the General Rate Case. And there are other things -- kind of the third point. There are other things above and beyond strictly what's in the DRP or what you would find in the General Rate Case, and that's what we're alluding to with some of the electrification -- transportation electrification initiatives embedded in SB 350 and things of that sort, storage, another piece would probably largely be outside of that. And then, of course, as more things develop with the transmission spending as we look towards moving to 50% renewables and then expanded ISO -- California ISO scope, there may very well be other investment opportunities embedded in that, that also are not going to be in the GRC or some of these other proceedings. So I think the general point here is there's, we feel, a robust opportunity but, of course, we want to make sure we're doing that in a good balanced way so it doesn't put pressure on equity and doesn't put pressure on customer rates."

But I think at the core, certainly from the utility perspective, we have a strong interest in seeing the market for solar be supported, and we're doing our part. We want to make sure that our grid is getting continuously worked on more to be more of a 2-way plug-and-play grid that can support solar resources. And we've done things like work on our own internal processes to shorten the time frame for customers who want to interconnect to our system use to take us a lot of months to process application, we've it down 1.5 now We've done a lot of things that we believe are constructive and supported bringing solar online be any in California and other states has been more about what's at a cost responsibility and the level of subsidy.

It's a -- I mean, it's a fair question, but I think without trying to be weeble wobble about it, the way we see it is we have a significant investment opportunity. We actually think it's an expanding investment opportunity. Because the rate case is expanding, which means cash production is expanding, that this, as we see it, allows us to keep the growth rate in balance with our retained earnings and existing equity so that we would not need to issue additional equity. Obviously, if the commission or somehow we're ordered to do something really dramatic, we're going to maintain our required equity ratio, but I think that's such a remote risk that I feel comfortable saying that the way we've said it. But the key here is to keep the growth rate in balance with keeping customer rate increases at or below the rate of inflation and as we've evidenced here, we've done, I think, a really great job of that and we intend to continue to do that and such that we don't have to issue equity. I think we can keep that balance. We've done it even when we had 12% annual rates of growth in CapEx and earnings, yet we were able to pull in a lot of rabbits out of the hat. We were able to avoid any equity issuance and that was a very strong commitment that Jim and I had all through that period of time.

Our first quarter core earnings were $0.82 per share, $0.08 per share lower than last year's first quarter. Most of this decline was due to timing differences at SCE during 2015, which were caused by the delay in receiving the 2015 to 2017 General Rate Case. The underlying earnings in the first quarter of 2016 are consistent with the profile we expect for the year. Therefore, today, we are reaffirming our 2016 core earnings guidance of $3.81 to $4.01 per share. Jim will elaborate on all of this in his remarks. 
I will focus most of my comments today on SCE's long-term growth potential. This is particularly relevant as we prepare for our 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case filing in September and as the dialogue continues before the CPUC on the distribution resources plan and related proceedings. We believe that there is good visibility to long-term sustained investment of at least $4 billion annually. This should in turn yield rate base growth of approximately $2 billion a year. 
We have confidence in these levels of investment for several complementary reasons. First, our strategy is very much aligned with California's goals of creating a low-carbon economy and providing customers with energy technology choices. Second, we see several different infrastructure areas that require years of continued investment, all of which can be expanded further from today's levels and can be flexibly substituted for each other. Third, we have been steadily improving our ability to control overheads and fuel and purchase power costs in order to keep customer rate increases low, even with higher capital expenditures. And finally, as our rate base continues to grow, higher levels of investment can be more easily digested without stressing equity levels or our ability to execute the work. I will expand on each of these points further. 
As we look at the potential investments on the horizon, they support and are supported by several critical public policy initiatives. The overarching policy support comes from California's desire to create a vibrant, low-carbon economy. This is not solely a goal of policymakers, but rooted in strong public support across income and ethnic divides. It is well understood that the state's low-carbon goals cannot be met without substantially greater electrification of stationary and mobile sources of energy use. Decarbonization is supported by California's existing carbon cap and trade system, which does not rely on U.S. EPA's new carbon rules to be implemented. 
There is also strong support for clean energy technology development in the state, driven in part by the importance of Silicon Valley to the state's economy and its political influence. Importantly, Edison supplies the critical electric infrastructure investment needed to meet the state's low-carbon goals and facilitate customer choice of new clean energy technologies. 
Let me discuss the areas of infrastructure investment needed to meet the goals of providing safe, reliable and low-emitting power to our customers. Starting with the basics, reliability of the core electric infrastructure requires routine replacement of aging poles, transformers, underground cable and so on. Our system grew rapidly after World War II through the 1970s. Therefore, many components are reaching their mean time to failure and must be replaced. SCE's infrastructure replacement program alone represents more than half of our total distribution system capital expenditures. 
To give you an idea of the size of this task, each year, we replace, on average, 24,000 distribution poles, 4,000 transmission poles, 500 miles of underground cable and 225 substation circuit breakers. Complementing basic infrastructure replacement is the need to adapt our power grid to changing customer preferences and to new technologies. This evolution to a technologically advanced electric delivery system was outlined in the distribution resources plan, or DRP, that SCE filed last summer. Many of these potential investments are incremental to the investments that make up our current $4 billion annual CapEx. This vision for modernizing the grid will be an important principle, as SCE develops its upcoming General Rate Case filing. 
The CPUC's regulatory proceedings on distributed energy resources are still in the early stages.
Initial insights from the proceeding appear to endorse some of the approaches we recommended in our DRP filing, while suggesting different approaches in other areas. SCE's General Rate Case filing will be made well before the CPUC has made its full recommendations in the DRP and related proceedings. As a result, SCE will be making its best judgments on the scope and approach to grid modernization in its GRC filing. During the General Rate Case proceeding, SCE's views will be synchronized with those of other stakeholders, informed by the discussions taking place in the CPUC's broader distribution resources plan proceedings. 
The GRC will be the cornerstone proceeding for determining SCE's distribution system investment program. However, there are several complementary initiatives that represent additional investment in the power grid of the future and that are not part of the current $4 billion annual CapEx. The first is electric vehicle charging. Last month, the CPUC officially authorized SCE to commence spending under the Charge Ready pilot program they previously approved. The pilot covers the first 1,500 stations of an eventual plan for 30,000 charging systems. The total program is estimated to provide roughly 1/3 of the charging infrastructure needed in SCE service territory for autos and light-duty vehicles at multifamily dwellings and public locations. While the rate base opportunity for the full program is approximately $225 million over several years, it is possible that the CPUC will consider higher levels of utility investment in charging infrastructure.
Longer term, we think it is likely that additional opportunities for vehicle charging and other infrastructure may result from the transportation electrification initiative included in Senate Bill 350 signed into law last year. The bill is better known for establishing the mandate for electric utilities to deliver 50% of their customer load from renewable resources by 2030. But it also expanded the potential scope and scale of transportation electrification, which could support investments beyond SCE's current Charge Ready light-duty vehicle initiative. The objective is to support California meeting its long-term carbon reduction targets and federal Clean Air Act standards. The electric sector in California, especially the 3 investor-owned utilities, have become very low-carbon emitting, while the transportation sector has not. The result is that today, nearly 40% of total carbon emissions in the state comes from the transportation sector compared to less than 20% for the electric sector. 
As part of the implementation of SB 350, this fall, the CPUC is expected to order investor-owned electric power companies to submit proposals for investments in programs that will accelerate widespread adoption of transportation electrification. This would include potentially higher levels of light-duty vehicle charging infrastructure than SCU's current target of providing 30,000 chargers. It could also include charging infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, such as electric buses, trucks and tractors, which are especially important in meeting increasingly stringent air quality requirements in the L.A. basin. These early concepts were part of the agenda at a CPUC workshop in San Francisco last Friday hosted by assigned Commissioner Peterman. 
Another potential investment class not included in our $4 billion annual CapEx is the CPUC's energy storage initiative. SCE has the opportunity to build half of its required 580 megawatts of energy storage and place it in its rate base by 2024. We have yet to attempt to estimate the potential capital spending rate base or timing of this investment. However, storage is a mandated program and could be significant. The DRP process may spell out a greater role for storage solutions located in the distribution systems as the economics improve and the carbon reduction attributes of storage relative to gas-fired generation become more apparent. 
Transmission investments remain an important complement to SCE's distribution system investment program, though the planning process and scale are quite different. SCE continues to implement 3 major California ISO-approved investments. These projects are needed for transmission reliability and support the state's renewable portfolio mandate. 
On April 11, SCE received a proposed decision to approve the $1.1 billion West of Devers project recommended by SCE and the California ISO. You may recall that we informed you last November of delays in the regulatory approvals of this project due to consideration of an alternative staged project. The proposed decision largely adopts the project as we originally proposed. It could be approved as early as May 12. Assuming the PD is adopted by the commission and once the required federal approvals are received, the project will be ready to begin construction. The West of Devers project will help California meet its 50% renewables portfolio standard.
California ISO is in the early stages of planning for the transmission infrastructure to meet the expanded renewables requirement. This will be integrated with efforts underway to extend the span of the ISO to include adjacent electric power companies in other states. There is likely to be a continuing debate about whether the future resource mix should favor more utility scale renewables with expanded transmission capacity or distributed resources enabled by an advanced distribution system. I expect it will be a mix of the 2 models. 
SCE is positioned to participate in both models. We expect either approach will expand the investment opportunity at SCE beyond the current $4 billion annual level. 
While it is difficult to predict the exact trajectory of investment levels required to support California's policy objectives, our general belief is that investment levels could potentially grow beyond current CapEx levels. A critical objective that we and the CPUC share is to avoid causing customer rates from becoming unaffordable due to this expanded infrastructure investment. Our objective has been to keep customer rate increases at or below the rate of inflation in our service territory. To-date, our record of accomplishing this goal is quite good. The compound annual growth rate of SCE's system average rate has consistently stayed below that of the consumer price index for our service territory. This is true whether you look at the last 5 years, 10 years, 15 years or even the last 20 years. It is especially notable that this has occurred when kilowatt hour usage since 2007 has been flat to declining. Indeed, our system average rate in 2016 has dropped 8% from 2015 levels.  Importantly, customers react mostly to their monthly bill, not kilowatt hour rates, and our average monthly residential electric bill last year was $94, meaningfully below the national average of $127 a month.
We have accomplished this through a sharp focus on reducing overhead costs, creating efficiencies and due to the benefits of the SONGS settlement as well as declines in fuel costs. 
A concluding thought on keeping rates affordable longer-term. I believe the growing percentage of renewables in our generation mix is creating an excellent hedge against potential future spikes in natural gas prices. Although, I don't expect much upward pressure on natural gas prices in the near to intermediate term, it is difficult to imagine much room for prices to go lower. SCE's generation mix will move up from the current level of roughly 25% renewables to 50%. The cost of renewables newbuild is increasingly becoming equal to or better than natural gas newbuild. Also, since renewables have no fuel cost, customer rates are increasingly less exposed to future natural gas price spikes. All of this helps to keep our rate increases modest and electricity affordable, while we increase our investment in building an advanced electric delivery system. 
As I've discussed, SCE has several potential areas of incremental investment, which gives us flexibility to ramp up one program if another starts to lag. This, along with a steadily expanding rate base, earnings and cash flow, allows us to maintain a reasonable and growing total investment program without creating pressure to issue equity or having customer rates rise beyond inflation rates. A balanced program like this should also allow us to continue to provide higher than average -- higher than industry average growth in earnings and dividends. 
I'd like to conclude with a brief discussion of power grid reliability this summer in the wake of the Aliso Canyon shutdown. SCE is working closely with California regulators and Sempra's Southern California Gas Company on impacts from potential delays in returning the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility to use. Aliso Canyon provides pipeline pressure balancing to the Los Angeles Basin year-round. It also provides additional supplies in the winter when heating needs increase demand beyond the capability of interstate pipeline deliveries. SCE is one of SoCal Gas' largest customers and very focused on this issue. Because of the shutdown, the risk to electric reliability has increased, which presents its own public safety implications. As we see it, the best scenario for electric reliability is to expeditiously complete inspections of a few of the more important wells to determine if they could be safely returned to service in time for summer peak power use. 
SCE is also working on contingency plans to reduce demand and maximize generation flexibility. At the CPUC's direction, SCE has requested a memorandum account to track any unusual costs related to Aliso Canyon. These include costs related to demand response, energy efficiency, power contracts, et cetera. These costs are not expected to be sizable. Any extra customer costs related to inefficient power plant dispatch will be captured as part of the E-R-R-A, or ERRA balancing account mechanism. Although this situation shouldn't create financial risk for SCE, it is a potential reliability issue for our customers. 
Okay, that's it for me. I'll now turn it over to Jim for his financial report."

As Ted indicated, today, we are reaffirming our core earnings guidance. I want to emphasize the quarterly earnings profile will be difficult to model given 2 primary factors: SCE's delay in receiving its 2015 GRC decision and because revenues are generally weighted towards the third quarter of the year.
As discussed when we introduced our 2016 earnings guidance, a simplified rate base approach is the best way to think about SCE's earnings power on an annual basis. SCE's rate base is growing, and this implies increasing earnings. However, anticipated revenue increases from both the CPUC and FERC were masked by the timing of revenues recognized in 2015. You will recall that until SCE received its 2015 GRC proposed decision, revenues were largely based on 2014 authorized levels. SCE recorded a significant year-to-date revenue adjustment in the third quarter of 2015 and a large regulatory asset write-off in the fourth quarter in connection with the final decision. 
With that in mind, let's look at SCE's earnings drivers. To simplify the earnings explanation, we removed the impact of San Onofre and tax repair and pole loading deductions. On a GAAP basis, as shown in the 10-Q, revenues are down $41 million, which is equivalent to $0.08 per share. As explained in Footnote 4, the 2016 revenue reduction relates to incremental tax repair and cost removal deductions for the pole loading program in excess of levels authorized in the 2015 GRC. As we have previously explained, the GRC decision established balancing accounts to track forecast differences compared to actuals. Importantly, with these balancing accounts, there is no impact on earnings. Lastly, this is also the main driver for the low effective income tax rate for the quarter. 
After the adjustments, revenues are a net $0.04 per share positive contribution on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Breaking revenues down, there is an $0.08 per share GRC attrition mechanism increase. This mechanism provides for increases in revenues after the 2015 test year. Largely offsetting this is a $0.06 per share timing issue on the GRC decision. As I mentioned earlier, reductions in authorized revenues from the GRC decisions are not reflected in the first or second quarter 2015 results and were adjusted in the third quarter with the proposed decision and then again in the fourth quarter with the final GRC decision. 
To finish up on revenues. FERC revenues are $0.02 per share higher, largely for higher depreciation expense. This nets to a positive $0.04 per share earnings contribution from revenues.
Moving to O&M. Costs are $0.04 per share higher than last year. A significant factor in this was planned El Niño preparation costs where SCE staged equipment, such as portable generators, in areas that could be sensitive to storm-related outages as well as costs associated with responses to storms. While the Southern California El Niño phenomena did not materialize at the level that had been predicted by many, we did see more significant storm activity than we experienced in 2015.
Other important items include planned higher costs for distribution system inspections as well as higher severance costs resulting from ongoing efforts to drive increased productivity and efficiency. 
Higher depreciation of $0.02 per share reflects the normal trends supporting SCE's wire-focused capital spending program. Income taxes, excluding the tax balancing account related items I've already discussed, are $0.02 per share higher than last year. The effective tax rate in the quarter is 14% compared to 24% last year. As I said previously, the lower rate largely reflects the incremental tax benefits above authorized levels. Excluding the $0.13 per share incremental tax benefits, the effective tax rate would have been 34%.
Turning to Edison International earnings drivers. Overall costs are higher by $0.03 per share. Holding company costs are comparable to last year. We had no affordable housing earnings this year since the portfolio was sold last December, while in Q1 of 2015, we recorded a $0.01 per share of earnings. Edison Energy's net loss of $0.02 per share higher than last year. This reflects expected development and operating costs of Edison Energy's businesses and timing of revenues from the newly acquired businesses. Revenues are $6 million in the first quarter of 2016. Our reported sales from last year were $3 million and only included SoCore Energy and not the recently acquired companies. I'd also like to remind investors that our financing strategy for SoCore Energy's commercial solar program, primarily uses third-party tax equity and project financing. As a result, a portion of the project economics go to the tax equity investors.
Holding company results on a core basis, exclude earnings related to the hypothetical liquidation at book value accounting method for SoCore Energy's tax equity financings. This is a $0.01 per share this year versus $0.02 per share last year. So overall, Edison International core earnings are down $0.08 per share. 
Please turn to Page 3. SCE's capital spending forecast is unchanged from our last call. First quarter and actual SCE spending of $1 billion is consistent with 2016 authorized levels. Keep in mind that this forecast does not include any DRP-related spending. SCE will continue to evaluate whether to pursue any early-stage work this year. Page 4 shows SCE's rate base forecast, which is also unchanged.
Please turn to Page 5. The West of Devers project, Ted mentioned, is 1 of the 2 large transmission projects where most of the investment will be on the current rate base guidance period. Some of you may have followed this proceeding, and there's one unique aspect to the project. Some of the West of Devers route transits the Morongo Indian reservation and the Coachella Valley. As discussed in our 10-K, a Morongo transmission entity has an option to invest $400 million or up to 1/2 the $1.1 billion project at commercial operation, which SCE expects to be in 2021. For internal planning purposes, SCE assumes that the option will be exercised. The 2018 GRC will include capital expenditures through 2020. With the option exercise date falling just outside of the period of time we will be providing more visibility on, we thought it was important to bring this option to the attention of investors and analysts. 
Please turn to Page 6. We have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance for the full year at $3.81 to $4.01 per share and updated our GAAP guidance for first quarter noncore items. Our key assumptions are also unchanged. That's it for me.

And as soon as we get to the pilot phase, we will go back to the PUC with a report and have that proceeded and seek authorization to take on the balance of the up to 30,000 chargers covered by the Charge Ready program. So I think you'll all have visibility into that and, in terms of the regulatory time line for that, I think it's envisioned that the pilot might take up to 12 months. We will go to the PUC as soon as we have enough data from the pilot. And it's tough to forecast how long it might take the PUC to provide approval for the balance of the Charge Ready program, but we would be going back as soon as we have pilot data. Separate from that, in terms of additional opportunities, I think in Ted's remarks, he commented how it is possible that the PUC might envision a further role for us, I think a couple directions for that. One, could be that with the charge rating program, we've estimated those 30,000 chargers would cover about 1/3 of the need for your charging infrastructure to meet the state's objectives for electric vehicle deployment. So one potential thrust would be whether the PUC might support us going even further than the Charge Ready program. They'll want to find a forecast or anything like that there, but that is one potential direction. The other one is SB 350 does talks about support for a broader utility role in transportation and electrification and that could go beyond light-duty vehicles, that could go to other forms of transportation. Again, tough to put our arms around what that could be. We'll intersect with the integrated resource plan proceeding that's also called for by SB 350, that's just undergoing scoping at the PUC now. So while we can't point precisely to a specific program or specific numbers out of it, I think the theme is that there's a general recognition in the state that transportation electrification, whether light-duty vehicles or heavier transport, is going to be a big part of achieving greenhouse gas targets and it's likely some there's some possibility for further utility roles there."

I think if you look at electric vehicle charging, today, it has -- we've been able to accommodate the number of vehicles that have come on the grid without any new impact on the system. I think this is one of these items where we'd expect to have planning visibility into what the needs are, as the market continues to grow, So I don't think it's one that lends itself to a dramatic spike. I'd also point out that from a system perspective, the California system overall, still enjoys some pretty healthy reserve margins. And then -- so expect that certainly over the next several years to be the ability to accommodate that. And then the final point I'd make is that as the load from electric vehicles increases, that is happening in the context though of the net load for the system, which we continue to see moving in a generally flat to even potential decline as we have other offsetting factors, increased energy efficiency, increased demand response. So we'll have to continue to watch this from a planning perspective as the market develops. But today, we're not seeing any undue impact that would be difficult to manage. Maybe one last little coda on it is that as we get more vehicles on the system, we want to be working with the regulators to have the right to sort of signals and incentives to encourage charging when it helps from an overall system perspective. So you guys are all pretty familiar with the concept of the duck curve, the fact that we have a lot more solar on the system today and the ISO expects that to grow. So the extent to which we can accommodate electric vehicles with current resources, will be assisted by having charging align better with time periods during the day when we have more energy flowing out of solar panels."

You're watching what's happening with fuel and purchased power. I mean, we're watching our sales. Obviously, that's what you're getting at. Obviously, electric vehicle charging helps others detract from it, that would be solar rooftop or potentially energy efficiency. So we're trying to balance all those factors, and the goal is to try to keep the rates in and around the inflation level. And so I think Ted's points were real clear that over longer periods of time, we've had acceleration in capital expenditures and we've had lower gas prices and all these different factors over quite a long period of time. And more importantly, in the shorter term, the cost focus, the reduction in costs, because O&M obviously reduces rates dollar-per-dollar, where capital is at a smaller percentage. So we'll continue to monitor it. Obviously, from year-to-year, you probably -- we make exceed it or go underneath it like this last year was 8% reduction. But over time, I think as the general trend, we'd like to see it come in around that inflation level."

So the point we're really trying to make is there are many levers, there's also a balancing act. So under the many levers part of the equation, if, for some reason, one or more of these potential capital spends lags or we need to pull it back, there are substitute capital spending that can be pushed into its place. So I think we feel confident about the -- certainly feel confident about the $4 billion and believe that there is upside. But see, the second part is the balancing act element where you've heard me on this a lot of times before, if you get this thing growing too fast, you end up putting pressure, first, on customer rates then secondly, on the ability of the underlying business to support the equity requirement of the new investment. So it's a matter of trying to get it in the sweet spot where you're getting kind of the maximum benefit from the growth but not so fast that it puts pressure on the need to issue equity or on customer rates. And that was the second kind of main point I was trying to get across here is as the rate base grows, earnings, cash grow along with it. We feel comfortable about being able to support a greater than $4 billion number without having to issue equity. And secondly, as we tried to spend quite a bit of time on here in the remarks, we actually have a really good track record of keeping customer rates below the rate of inflation in our service territory. And that, coupled with the fact our average residential bill is considerably lower than the national average, and that's what customers really see, we feel we've kind of got the cost side under control and that it will support the ability to have this expanded investment opportunity.

So this is going to be a little bit of a couple of things happening at the same time. We will do our best to articulate those in the General Rate Case. And there are other things -- kind of the third point. There are other things above and beyond strictly what's in the DRP or what you would find in the General Rate Case, and that's what we were alluding to with some of the electrification -- transportation electrification initiatives embedded in SB 350 and things of that sort, storage, another piece that would probably largely be outside of that. And then, of course, as more things develop with the transmission spending as we look towards moving to 50% renewables and then expanded ISO -- California ISO scope, there may very well be other investment opportunities embedded in that, that also are not going to be in the GRC or some of these other proceedings.

Obviously, we proceeded through the NEM portion, NEM 2.0 proceeding here earlier this year. We did file a limited application for rehearing on the topic, don't have a time line at this point in terms of the when the PUC might consider that. But I think at the core, certainly from the utility perspective, we have a strong interest in seeing the market for solar be supported, and we're doing our part. We want to make sure that our grid is getting continuously worked on more to be more of a 2-way plug-and-play grid that can support solar resources. And we've done things like work on our own internal processes to shorten the time frame for customers who want to interconnect to our system. It used to take us about 1 month to process applications, we've got that down to 1.5 days now. We're doing a lot of things that we believe are constructive and supportive of bringing solar online. I think the NEM debate in California and other states has been more about what's the cost responsibility and the level of subsidy. And so, to the extent that parties can come together and have creative approaches towards resolving some of those differences, that's great. I don't think we're there in California today, but we'll continue to engage constructively with parties and listen to ideas."

301891,369548897,1016142,"Edison International, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter results were below last year's results as we expected. You will recall that we told investors in our First Quarter Earnings Call that quarterly year-over-year comparisons would not be all that",1608,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter results were below last year's results as we expected. You will recall that we told investors in our First Quarter Earnings Call that quarterly year-over-year comparisons would not be all that meaningful. This is primarily due to timing mismatches, including: Impacts from the delayed decision on SCE's 2015 to '17 rate case; the significant SCE tax benefits recorded last year but not repeated this year; no Edison capital asset sales this year versus last year; and the timing of Edison Energy costs versus revenues.
The larger point that I want to leave with you is that core earnings are on track for the full year. That is why today we reaffirmed our full year core earnings guidance range of $3.81 to $4.01 earnings per share. In fact, based on second quarter results, although there are various puts and takes amongst the businesses, our current outlook indicates that consolidated results for the full year are in the top half of our guidance range. However, consistent with what we have done in several of the past years, we will hold off until our third quarter results are in to decide if we should adjust our core earnings guidance. 
We are in the final half of our 2015 to '17 CPUC rate case period. We have communicated to investors that based on CPUC-approved capital spending and expected spending on FERC jurisdictional transmission projects, we expect rate base growth -- rate base to grow approximately 7% in the 2016 to '17 period. This still seems appropriate. We have communicated several times in the past that there is relatively little variance expected in the timing of CPUC jurisdictional spending for the 2016 to '17 period, but more variability is possible in the timing but less likely in the ultimate amount of our FERC jurisdictional transmission spending. Remember, SCE's transmission investment is to improve system reliability and bring online utility scale wind and solar resources to meet California's aggressive renewable energy targets. Most of the transmission CapEx spending variability occurs due to delays in routing decisions and permitting approvals at the state and federal levels. A recent example was the $1.1 billion West of Devers project, which is something of a moving target with CPUC staff even with KISO [ph] support, but appears ready for final CPUC approval with a supportive alternate proposed decision pending.
We see scheduled challenges of this sort for other lesser transmission projects as well. Net-net, we don't expect meaningful impacts to our total transmission spend expectations over the medium-term 3- to 5-year period, but likely some shifting between the years. Said differently, our current view is that 2016 rate base will not be materially different than forecasted. 2017 could be slightly lower, but recovered in the 2018 to 2020 period. 
On the last earnings call, most of my comments were devoted to outlining the future SCE growth opportunity. I'd like to provide some additional comments today, keeping in mind that we will be able to elaborate more on this when SCE makes its general rate case filing on September 1. 
In the broadest sense, the capital spending request in our 2018 to 2020 general rate case is designed to help California achieve its low carbon policy objectives and to enable customer choice while continuing to focus on reliable and affordable service for all customers. Keeping it simple, the requested investment can be lumped into 2 buckets. The first bucket is comprised of grid investments we have traditionally requested in past rate cases. The second bucket is made up of new grid modernization investments. Let me expand further on these 2 areas. 
The traditional investments we will propose in the first bucket represent the vast majority of our total rate case capital spending request. The areas of spending encompass 5 basic elements: Replacement of aging infrastructure; new customer connections and demand growth on certain circuits; investments in information technology to improve customer service and cost efficiency; maintenance capital spending on SCE's generation fleet; and other core investments such as in our operations facilities.
This first bucket of requested spending, together with other non-GRC spending such as SCE's electric vehicle charging program and FERC transmission spending, is expected to total more than $4 billion in CapEx per year. It is difficult to handicap how much of our requested investment in this first bucket of capital spending will ultimately be approved. However, investors have some history to observe in this regard. SCE received 81% of its requested capital spending in the 2009 to '11 rate case, 89% of its 2012 to '14 general rate case requests, and 92% of its 2015 to '17 requests. 
The smaller second bucket of spending we will request is new. It is for modernization of the distribution system and is part of SCE's strategy to facilitate the growth of distributed energy resources. Governor Brown and the California legislature have stated their strong desire for California to lead the nation in developing policies to create a low carbon economy while creating jobs and prosperity for its citizens. SB 350, signed into law last year, stated the goal of making the electric grid a key enabler of California's low carbon policy ambitions, including by electrifying transportation. The CPUC has 2 active proceedings underway, which together will help shape the long-term planning for this vision. 
From a capital investment perspective, the most important is the distribution resources plan proceeding. In this proceeding, the CPUC's stated goal is to modernize the distribution system during the next decade, but it provided only some early direction on preferred technologies and required investments.
SCE, through its 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case, will be the first electric utility to provide specificity for how this technology evolution should unfold. This will be the new element of our September 1 filing. We need to wait until that filing to be specific about the amount and details of our investment request, but you should expect that the overall level of the request will be roughly consistent with our DRP filing last summer. At this time, based on the pace of grid modernization that SCE will described in its 2018 GRC filing, it is expected that grid modernization capital expenditures and rate base growth will continue beyond 2025. 
Some of the requested grid modernization investment would be better characterized as reinforcing the existing system, such as upgrading low voltage circuits in order to accommodate higher penetration of distributed energy resources. But other parts really have no precedent, and therefore we do not know how to handicap how much of our request might finally be approved. 
Like any technology evolution, there are certain initial investments that need to be made to create the foundational infrastructure that will support systemwide grid modernization. SCE has identified the critical path that it believes needs to get started sooner rather than later. That is what led SCE to file on July 13 for a memorandum account requesting authority from the CPUC to track certain early-stage investment cost ahead of its 2018 General Rate Case filing. The July 13's request points out that the process of modernizing the distribution grid requires some near-term planning, engineering, procurement and installation of certain distribution system upgrades before the 2018 SCE-GRC period. SCE's July 13 filing request authority to track the revenue requirement of approximately $100 million of capital spending to be placed in service in 2017 that is critical to meeting the CPUC's overall timeline for grid modernization. If the memorandum account is approved and expenditures are deemed prudent, the associated rate base will be included in either the 2018 or perhaps the 2021 General Rate Case filing.
I'll finish with comments on 2 other matters. The first is SONG. Last week we, and other parties, completed briefings requested by the CPUC. The Court question was whether the SONG settlement, unanimously approved by the CPUC, was still reasonable given the various disclosures about ex-parte communications made last year. There were 6 signatories to the SONG settlement. 4 of the 6 settling parties, San Diego Gas and Electric, Friends of the Earth, The Coalition of California Utility Employees and SCE, submitted filings that made clear why these communications had no impact on the settlement process and why the settlement remains reasonable, lawful and in the public interest. Two of the settling parties turned an ROA are seeking on their filings to impose additional penalties on SCE. We strongly believe this is opportunistic and inappropriate. We also note that before approving the settlement, the commission asked the settling parties to amend the settlement in meaningful ways, all of which were more favorable for customers, which the parties ultimately did. The commission then unanimously approved that amended settlement. 
While there remains no timeline for further action, we are hopeful that the commission will see the record as demonstrating the validity and appropriateness of the settlement by reaffirming the settlement and dismissing the pending appeals. 
The final item is the important CPUC reforms announced in late June by the governor and key legislators and subsequently, endorsed by the CPUC. These reforms largely address a series of principles the governor has advocated while balancing sensitivities over the role of the executive and legislative branches in designing and implementing these reforms. While there are many details yet to be finalized, the overall approach appears responsive. If implemented as described, it should continue to provide broad public access to the decision-making process, accelerate timely decision-making, address important CPUC staffing and recruiting issues and allow CPUC commissioners more leeway to discuss important topics amongst themselves. 
This concludes my remarks. Jim will now provide his financial update."

My comments today will cover second quarter and year-to-date results, earnings guidance and our updated capital expenditures and rate base forecasts. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation.
As a brief reminder, comparisons to 2015 will not be meaningful, primarily because of the timing of the 2015 GRC decision and the impact of taxes. I also explained last quarter how we've removed, in a variance analysis, the impact of prepared deductions, pole loading and incented on free tax items because these revenue items have offsets within the income statement. 
EIX's basic and core earnings per share are $0.85 for the second quarter or $0.31 per share less than the same quarter last year. SCE's second quarter basic and core earnings are $0.21 per share lower and EIX Parent and other are $0.10 per share lower. The lower earnings are primarily due to $0.31 per share of income tax benefits recorded in the second quarter of last year. 
Focusing on the SCE key EPS drivers column, the utilities revenue was $0.10 per share higher quarter-over-quarter. This increase includes $0.09 per share from a GRC attrition mechanism, which automatically adjusts authorized revenue following the 2015 test year. This is largely offset by a $0.06 per share timing issue with the 2015 GRC decision. As I discussed last quarter, authorized revenue reductions from the 2015 GRC decision are not reflected in results for the first four second quarter of this year. You'll see the reversed in the third and fourth quarters of this year. There is also a $0.03 per share positive variance from the pole loading balancing account. This balancing account was created with the final 2015 GRC decision, so the $0.08 of pole loading earnings we had last year was all recorded in the fourth quarter. FERC revenue are $0.03 per share higher. This is largely related to revenues associated with a higher operating costs and abandoned plant recoveries for the canceled Coolwater-Lugo transmission project. The recovery of Coolwater-Lugo cost will continue through 2016 and has no impact on earnings. Together, these revenue items net to a positive $0.10 per share. 
O&M was not a major driver in the second quarter as lower legal and labor costs, due to workforce reductions, are mostly offset by a planned outage and upgrades at the Mountain View Generation Plant and higher pole loading costs. Results included $0.02 per share of severance costs comparable to what was recorded last year. Three of the $0.04 of higher depreciation are amortization of the Coolwater-Lugo cost discussed above. 
Net financing cost are $0.02 per share higher due primarily to an increase in the amount of preferred stock outstanding. The CPUC and FERC rate maintenance include funding for new debt and preferred stock to finance rate base growth. As indicated above, there was a $0.31 per share benefit from a change in uncertain tax positions in 2015. There is no comparable change in the second quarter of this year. Partially offsetting this item is a $0.04 per share benefit this year from tax depreciation and balancing accounts, bringing the net impact from income taxes to a negative $0.27.
The second quarter effective tax rate for SCE is a negative 9%, due primarily to a $133 million flow-through tax refund to customers for repair benefits from 2012 through 2014. The refund of tax repair benefits has no earnings impact. 
Higher insurance benefits primarily drive the $0.02 per share contribution from other income and expenses. This gets us to the $0.21 per share decline in the second quarter SCE earnings. 
I will turn next to EIX Parent and other. Losses increased by $0.10 per share overall from last quarter -- last quarter of last year. A key driver is a $0.04 per share buyout of an earnout provision with former shareholders and their current employees of a company acquired by Edison Energy at the end of 2015. The buyout was completed along with modification of employment contracts to align Edison Energy's incentive compensation with EIX's. The results are a penny per share of higher business development and operating costs. Comparisons are also affected by a $0.03 per share gain on the sale of a portion of Edison Capital's affordable housing portfolio during the second quarter of last year. 
Parent holding company costs increase by $0.02 per share due to higher interest expense as we termed out $400 million of holding company commercial paper debt and the impact of strong stock price performance on compensation expense. Core earnings exclude $0.01 per share of tax-related losses and discontinued operations related to the Edison Mission Energy getting to the net $0.10 per share of holding company losses. That, with a SCE variance, gets you to the $0.31 per share reduction in EIX earnings. 
Please turn to Page 3. I won't go into detail on the year-to-date results, but then to remind everyone that SCE's performance for the first half of 2016 is consistent with our full year SCE outlook which look stronger than our original guidance levels. At the same time, holding company costs are already at full year guidance levels or $0.18 per share. We've built both factors into our reaffirmed full year guidance. 
Please turn to Page 4. On top of this slide it shows our reaffirmed GAAP and core earnings guidance. However, our internal SCE earnings outlook will be above its $4.09 guidance midpoint, and holding company costs outlook will be higher than its guidance midpoint. We're comfortable reaffirming overall EIX earnings guidance for the full year based on this internal view. However, we have not updated our SCE and holding company guidance elements other than to indicate their directional trends. We are mindful that the third quarter is typically SCE's strongest of the year and we will continue our practice of looking to update guidance when we report third quarter results on November 1. 
As I previously mentioned, holding company year-to-date costs, including Edison Energy group, are at a full year guidance level of $0.18. Adjusting for an earnout agreement, which was not part of the original guidance, was lower year-to-date cost of $0.14. The important thing is that we do anticipate an increase in revenue during the second half of 2016 based on book deals and expected sales. I also want to point out that our guidance does not include any recoveries from the MHI arbitration. As a reminder, we are expensing all costs related to the arbitration as incurred through core earnings. For 2016 alone, we incurred $23 million of cost and a total of $76 million, including prior periods. As part of the SONGS settlement, we can recover our reasonable arbitration cost from MHI recoveries before sharing.
I will next touch on SCE's balance sheet strength. On June 30, SCE's weighted average common equity ratio was 50.3% versus the authorized level of 48%. This helps provide financial flexibility as the utility continues to fund growth with operating cash flow and retain earnings and without the need of new common equity. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE has updated its capital spending forecast. We expect that 2016 will be lower by $300 million, and '17 will be $100 million higher. The biggest factor change, forecast change, is $375 million of transmission spending, mostly due to licensing delays of projects like Aubur Hill [ph], Mesa and the City of Riverside projects. As Ted has highlighted, we firmly believe these projects will ultimately move forward, and the balance of their capital spending will be shifted into our 2018 through '20 period.
We have also adjusted the utility's CPUC capital expenditures to more closely align with what the commission has authorized for the 3-year General Rate Case cycle. The net result of these changes is a reduction of approximately $200 million. 
Please turn to Page 6. You'll see that rate base has a directionally similar adjustment with the 2017 rate base forecast to be lower by $200 million. Because of the transmission delays, the reduction in rate base will be shifted into the 2018 through '20 period. As I mentioned earlier, we don't see this having any impact on 2016 earnings as the modest rate base reduction has more than offset in other areas based on SCE's current outlook.
I would like to add a short addendum to my prepared remarks. This earnings call is my 32nd and last CFO of EIX. It's been a great 8-year run. There's a lot of work that goes into each one of these calls and I'd like to recognize our Edison team that makes these calls happen. Personally, I think our disclosures and investment materials are among the best. This job falls to our lawyers, accountants, corporate communications folks and IR staff. In particular, our attorneys, Adam, Russ, Barbara, Kathleen, do a great job of converting accounting English into plain English. Our accountants, Aaron, Connie, Mark and Tricia make sure our books and SEC filings are in top shape. Our IR staff, Scott and Ally, do a fantastic job. As many of you know, Scott is a highly regarded IR professional and Ally has done a great job since joining us a year ago. 
I have always enjoyed the interaction with investors and analysts over the years. Hopefully you have earned our respect by the way we conduct our communications. Early on, Ted advised me, when communicating with investors and analysts, I should strive to keep my comments down at middle to fairway. Ted said if I push my comments left or right of center, you folks will sniff it out and our credibility will be called into question. I have tried to follow this solid advice and I hope Pedro and Maria will do the same. 
As you know, Ted and I are heading out on September 30. I don't have any plans for retirement yet, but there are many things that I want to do. The one thing that I would really like to do, though, is finally learn how to drive my golf balls down the middle of the fairway. 
Thank you, all. Operator, it's question time."

I think we've been fairly open with investors over the years about our prospects. In a weird way, the most difficult element is we have tremendous growth prospects here at Southern California, Edison. So our organic growth and the expected CAGRs from rate base and ultimately earnings really make looking at other utilities outside of our territory as more often than not looking dilutive, either to the underlying strategic approach that we have, which is, as you know, a wires-based focus or a delivery of electricity focus, rather than a heavy involvement in some of the other parts of the business, or dilutive from an earnings growth perspective.

What I was really trying to do in the prepared remarks is say just kind of keeping this thing simple. You should expect in our 2018 General Rate Case to see expenses kind of in 2 very broad buckets. One bucket is what I call pretty much traditional the meat and potato type investment request that we make every general rate case. So that covers kind of standard stuff, infrastructure replacement, expected demand, increases on certain of our circuits, new connections, so on and so forth. When you take that chunk together with the things that aren't in the GRC, such as the Charge Ready program and FERC Jurisdictional Transmission Spend, you should expect to see a number, generally in the neighborhood, maybe a little bit higher than what we have traditionally kind of talked about. So I'll just call that broadly the $4-billion-plus type of base number. Then, there's the second smaller bucket that you will see in the 2018 General Rate Case request, which will really going to be the first attempt to try to put some specificity around what is required to really modernize the distribution system, such that it can facilitate the state's carbon reduction goals and customer choice on technology. So distributed energy resources. And that's a lot harder for us at this early juncture to be able to handicap, one of that would ultimately be approved. So there's kind of the standard stuff, which when you lump it together with transmission spending and the like, it's going to look pretty similar to what you've seen in the past from us, maybe little bit higher. And then there's a new layer of stuff that really this rate case will kind of start that conversation about what that might look like. And that would be additive to the kind of base level. So this is what I signaled last earnings call and what we've elaborated on a little bit more in this earnings call."

And if you",255,"Yes, in a nutshell -- I didn't do it again here on this call, but last earnings call, I made a fairly evolved discussion about what has been the pace of electric rate increases relative to the pace of underlying consumer price index increases. And if you -- a lot of this depends in what you're starting with and where you're ending with. But as I said in the last call, when you look at the 1 year, the 5-year, the 10, the 20, the rate of increase in customer rates, the system average rate, has actually been at or below the rate of inflation, the Southern California Area CPI. I remember the 20 year number because that's kind of the most relevant one. So over the longer-term, that CPI increase, from '95 to '15, was 2.4% compound annual growth rate. The rate of increase in electric rates over that same '95 to '15 period was 2.0% CAGR compound annual growth rate. So as it kind of demonstrates over the long haul, we've been able to manage the price of electricity at or below the rate of inflation and that continues to be kind of our overall goal. Now you have periods where you get more of a surge and you get other periods where you end up consolidating some of those increases. But the key, I think, over the long haul is to have the price of electricity stay at or below the rate of inflation. That's our overall goal. That remains our goal."

First, it has been a true honor to be the CEO of Edison international. This company has been an essential part of the economic fabric of this region for 130 years, during which we provided the most essential of goods for modern society to function and prosper, that is electricity. Being a part of this great company is truly humbling. I'm exceptionally proud of what this management team and our employees have accomplished these last years. I'm sincerely grateful for the wisdom, advice, counsel of our Board of Directors that they've provided. I particularly want to single out Jim Scilacci, just because it's so much fun, for a huge thank you. He, above all, will tell me like it is. Tell me what I must hear, not what I might like to hear. And he does it with such glee. He's been a great friend and a great colleague. So thanks, Jim. I believe we have crafted a strong strategy for success and value creation here at Edison. We have overcome many obstacles. You might say we're still getting our training leg over a couple of hurdles. We have repositioned SCE to be a wires-focused electric utility, in-sync with and essential to California's low-carbon policy objectives. Edison Energy has the potential to create a new business model, concentrating mostly on commercial and industrial customers and grid edge customer-focused energy services. We continue to gain confidence that both Edison Energy and SCE are pioneers in their respective business. We may even look back one day and conclude that both were disrupters of a sort. 
I'm unabashedly bullish on this company's strategy and its prospects. But a good strategy doesn't stand alone. It must have exceptional execution and leadership to be successful, and that is why I am so excited by the new leadership team who will be taking the reins in a couple of months. 
In my opinion, Pedro is an exceptional leader. He understands our business and our industry well, and has the skills, the attitude and the discipline to navigate our complex environment. I look forward to Pedro, along with Kevin Payne and Ron Nichols at SCE; Ron Litzinger at Edison Energy; Maria Rigatti as the CFO; and the rest of the senior leadership team taking this great company to the next level of performance. I'm confident that they can. 
Finally, it has been a real pleasure working with many of you as investors in Edison International. We have many stakeholders in this business, but investors are certainly one of the most important. We provide society with an essential service. But none of our investment and critical infrastructure is possible without the capital that you provide. I hope you feel we have rewarded your faith and confidence in us with superior performance and attractive returns. 
I will speak for Jim and myself here by saying we look forward to participating in future earnings calls as interested parties and investors, but in listen-only mode. So many thanks to all of you, both around this table here as well as you on the phone. 
And with that, Scott, you want to wrap this up?"

301891,369548897,1016519,"Edison International, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter results were below last year's results as we expected. You will recall that we told investors in our first quarter earnings call that quarterly year-over-year comparisons would not be all that",1611,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter results were below last year's results as we expected. You will recall that we told investors in our first quarter earnings call that quarterly year-over-year comparisons would not be all that meaningful. This is primarily due to timing mismatches, including: impacts from the delayed decision on SCE's 2015 to '17 rate case; significant SCE tax benefits recorded last year, but not repeated this year; no Edison capital asset sales this year versus last year; and the timing of Edison Energy costs versus revenues.
The larger point that I want to leave with you is that core earnings are on track for the full year. That is why today we reaffirmed our full year core earnings guidance range of $3.81 to $4.01 earnings per share. In fact, based on second quarter results, although there are various puts and takes amongst the businesses, our current outlook indicates that consolidated results for the full year are in the top half of our guidance range. However, consistent with what we have done in several of the past years, we will hold off until our third quarter results are in to decide if we should adjust our core earnings guidance. 
We are in the final half of our 2015 to '17 CPUC rate case period. We have communicated to investors that based on CPUC-approved capital spending and expected spending on FERC jurisdictional transmission projects, we expect rate base growth -- rate base to grow approximately 7% in the 2016 to '17 period. This still seems appropriate. We have communicated several times in the past that there is relatively little variance expected in the timing of CPUC jurisdictional spending for the 2016 to '17 period, but more variability is possible in the timing, but less likely in the ultimate amount of our FERC jurisdictional transmission spending. Remember, SCE's transmission investment is to improve system reliability and bring online utility scale wind and solar resources to meet California's aggressive renewable energy targets. Most of the transmission CapEx spending variability occurs due to delays in routing decisions and permitting approvals at the state and federal levels. A recent example was the $1.1 billion West of Devers project, which has been something of a moving target with CPUC staff even with CAISO support, but appears ready for final CPUC approval with a supportive alternate proposed decision pending.
We see scheduled challenges of this sort for other lesser transmission projects as well. Net-net, we don't expect meaningful impacts to our total transmission spend expectations over the medium-term 3- to 5-year period, but likely some shifting between the years. Said differently, our current view is that 2016 rate base will not be materially different than forecasted. 2017 could be slightly lower, but recovered in the 2018 to 2020 period. 
On the last earnings call, most of my comments were devoted to outlining the future SCE growth opportunity. I'd like to provide some additional comments today, keeping in mind that we will be able to elaborate more on this when SCE makes its General Rate Case filing on September 1. 
In the broadest sense, the capital spending request in our 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case is designed to help California achieve its low carbon policy objectives and to enable customer choice, while continuing to focus on reliable and affordable service for all customers. Keeping it simple, the requested investment can be lumped into 2 buckets. The first bucket is comprised of grid investments we have traditionally requested in the past rate cases. The second bucket is made up of new grid modernization investments. Let me expand further on these 2 areas. 
The traditional investments we will propose in the first bucket represent the vast majority of our total rate case capital spending request. The areas of spending encompass 5 basic elements: replacement of aging infrastructure; new customer connections and demand growth on certain circuits; investments in information technology to improve customer service and cost efficiency; maintenance capital spending on SCE's generation fleet; and other core investments such as in our operations facilities.
This first bucket of requested spending, together with other non-GRC spending, such as SCE's electric vehicle charging program and FERC transmission spending, is expected to total more than $4 billion in CapEx per year. It is difficult to handicap how much of our requested investment in this first bucket of capital spending will ultimately be approved. However, investors have some history to observe in this regard. SCE received 81% of its requested capital spending in the 2009 to '11 General Rate Case, 89% of its 2012 to '14 General Rate Case request, and 92% of its 2015 to '17 request. 
The smaller second bucket of spending we will request is new. It is for modernization of the distribution system and is part of SCE's strategy to facilitate the growth of distributed energy resources. Governor Brown and the California legislature have stated their strong desire for California to lead the nation in developing policies to create a low carbon economy, while creating jobs and prosperity for its citizens. SB 350, signed into law last year, stated the goal of making the electric grid a key enabler of California's low carbon policy ambitions, including by electrifying transportation. The CPUC has 2 active proceedings underway, which together will help shape the long-term planning for this vision. 
From a capital investment perspective, the most important is the distribution resources plan proceeding. In this proceeding, the CPUC's stated goal is to modernize the distribution system during the next decade, but it provided only some early direction on preferred technologies and required investments.
SCE, through its 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case, will be the first electric utility to provide specificity for how this technology evolution should unfold. This will be the new element of our September 1 filing. We need to wait until that filing to be specific about the amount and details of our investment request, but you should expect that the overall level of the request will be roughly consistent with our DRP filing last summer. At this time, based on the pace of grid modernization that SCE will describe in its 2018 GRC filing, it is expected that grid modernization capital expenditures and rate base growth will continue beyond 2025. 
Some of the requested grid modernization investment would be better characterized as reinforcing the existing system, such as upgrading low voltage circuits in order to accommodate higher penetration of distributed energy resources. But other parts really have no precedent, and therefore, we do not know how to handicap how much of our request might finally be approved. 
Like any technology evolution, there are certain initial investments that need to be made to create the foundational infrastructure that will support system-wide grid modernization. SCE has identified the critical path that it believes needs to get started sooner rather than later. That has what led SCE to file on July 13 for a memorandum account, requesting authority from the CPUC to track certain early-stage investment cost ahead of its 2018 General Rate Case filing. The July 13 request points out that the process of modernizing the distribution grid requires some near-term planning, engineering, procurement and installation of certain distribution system upgrades before the 2018 SCE-GRC period. SCE's July 13 filing requests authority to track the revenue requirement of approximately $100 million of capital spending to be placed in service in 2017, that is critical to meeting the CPUC's overall time line for grid modernization. If the memorandum account is approved and expenditures are deemed prudent, the associated rate base will be included in either the 2018 or perhaps the 2021 General Rate Case filing.
I'll finish with comments on 2 other matters. The first is SONGS. Last week we, and other parties, completed briefings requested by the CPUC. The court question was whether the SONGS settlement, unanimously approved by the CPUC, was still reasonable given the various disclosures about ex-parte communications made last year. There were 6 signatories to the SONGS settlement. 4 of the 6 settling parties, San Diego Gas & Electric, Friends of the Earth, The Coalition of California Utility Employees and SCE, submitted filings that made clear why these communications had no impact on the settlement process and why the settlement remains reasonable, lawful and in the public interest. Two of the settling parties turned an ORA are seeking in their filings to impose additional penalties on SCE. We strongly believe this is opportunistic and inappropriate. We also note that before approving the settlement, the commission asked the settling parties to amend the settlement in meaningful ways, all of which were more favorable for customers, which the parties ultimately did. The commission then unanimously approved that amended settlement. 
While there remains no time line for further action, we are hopeful that the commission will see the record as demonstrating the validity and appropriateness of the settlement by reaffirming the settlement and dismissing the pending appeals. 
The final item is the important CPUC reforms announced in late June by the governor and key legislators, and subsequently, endorsed by the CPUC. These reforms largely address a series of principles the governor has advocated, while balancing sensitivities over the role of the executive and legislative branches in designing and implementing these reforms. While there are many details yet to be finalized, the overall approach appears responsive. If implemented as described, it should continue to provide broad public access to the decision-making process, accelerate timely decision-making, address important CPUC staffing and recruiting issues and allow CPUC commissioners more leeway to discuss important topics amongst themselves. 
This concludes my remarks. Jim will now provide his financial update."

Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation.As a brief reminder, compar",1692,"Thanks, Ted, and hello, everyone. My comments today will cover second quarter and year-to-date results, earnings guidance and our updated capital expenditures and rate base forecasts. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation.
As a brief reminder, comparisons to 2015 will not be meaningful, primarily because of the timing of the 2015 GRC decision and the impact of taxes. I also explained last quarter how we removed, in a variance analysis, the impact of repair deductions, pole loading and San Onofre tax items because these revenue items have offsets within the income statement. 
EIX' basic and core earnings per share are $0.85 for the second quarter or $0.31 per share less than the same quarter last year. SCE's second quarter basic and core earnings are $0.21 per share lower and EIX Parent and Other are $0.10 per share lower. The lower earnings are primarily due to $0.31 per share of income tax benefits recorded in the second quarter of last year. 
Focusing on the SCE key EPS drivers column, the utilities revenue was $0.10 per share higher quarter-over-quarter. This increase includes $0.09 per share from a GRC attrition mechanism, which automatically adjusts authorized revenue following the 2015 test year. This is largely offset by a $0.06 per share timing issue with the 2015 GRC decision. As I discussed last quarter, authorized revenue reductions from the 2015 GRC decision are not reflected in results for the first or second quarter of this year. You'll see this reverse in the third and fourth quarters of this year. There is also a $0.03 per share positive variance from the pole loading balancing account. This balancing account was created with the final 2015 GRC decision, so the $0.08 of pole loading earnings we had last year were all -- was all recorded in the fourth quarter. FERC revenues are $0.03 per share higher. This is largely related to revenues associated with the higher operating costs and abandoned plant recoveries for the canceled Coolwater-Lugo transmission project. The recovery of Coolwater-Lugo cost will continue through 2016 and has no impact on earnings. Together, these revenue items net to a positive $0.10 per share. 
O&M was not a major driver in the second quarter as lower legal and labor costs, due to workforce reductions, are mostly offset by a planned outage and upgrades at the Mountainview Generation Plant and higher pole loading costs. Results included $0.02 per share of severance costs comparable to what was recorded last year. $0.03 of the $0.04 of higher depreciation are amortization of the Coolwater-Lugo cost discussed above. 
Net financing costs are $0.02 per share higher, due primarily to an increase in the amount of preferred stock outstanding. The CPUC and FERC rate [indiscernible] include funding for new debt and preferred stock to finance rate base growth. As indicated above, there was a $0.31 per share benefit from a change in an uncertain tax positions in 2015. There is no comparable change in the second quarter of this year. Partially offsetting this item is a $0.04 per share benefit this year from tax depreciation and balancing accounts, bringing the net impact from income taxes to a negative $0.27.
The second quarter effective tax rate for SCE is a negative 9%, due primarily to a $133 million flow-through tax refund to customers for repair benefits from 2012 through 2014. The refunded tax repair benefits has no earnings impact. 
Higher insurance benefits primarily drive the $0.02 per share contribution from other income and expenses. This gets us to the $0.21 per share decline in the second quarter SCE earnings.
I will turn next to EIX Parent and Other. Losses increased by $0.10 per share overall from last quarter -- last quarter of last year. A key driver is a $0.04 per share buyout of an earn-out provision with former shareholders and their current employees of a company acquired by Edison Energy at the end of 2015. The buyout was completed along with modification of employment contracts to align Edison Energy's incentive compensation with EIX'. There is also a $0.01 per share of higher business development and operating costs. Comparisons are also affected by a $0.03 per share gain on the sale of a portion of Edison Capital's affordable housing portfolio during the second quarter of last year. 
Parent holding company costs increased by $0.02 per share due to higher interest expense as we termed out $400 million of holding company commercial paper debt and the impact of strong stock price performance on compensation expense. Core earnings exclude a $0.01 per share of tax-related losses and discontinued operations related to the Edison Mission Energy getting to the net $0.10 per share of holding company losses. That, with the SCE variance, gets you to the $0.31 per share reduction in EIX earnings. 
Please turn to Page 3. I won't go into detail on the year-to-date results, other than to remind everyone that SCE's performance for the first half of 2016 is consistent with our full year SCE outlook, which look stronger than our original guidance levels. At the same time, holding company costs are already at full year guidance levels or $0.18 per share. We've built both factors into our reaffirmed full year guidance. 
Please turn to Page 4. On the top of this slide, it shows our reaffirmed GAAP and core earnings guidance. However, our internal SCE earnings outlook will be above its $4.09 per share guidance midpoint, and holding company costs outlook will be higher than its guidance midpoint. We're comfortable reaffirming overall EIX earnings guidance for the full year based on this internal view. However, we have not updated our SCE and holding company guidance elements other than to indicate their directional trends. We are mindful that the third quarter is typically SCE's strongest of the year, and we will continue our practice of looking to update guidance when we report third quarter results on November 1. 
As I previously mentioned, holding company year-to-date costs, including Edison Energy Group, are at a full year guidance level of $0.14 -- excuse me, at $0.18. Adjusting for an earn-out agreement, which was not part of the original guidance, was lower year-to-date cost of $0.14. The important thing is that we do anticipate an increase in revenue during the second half of 2016 based on booked deals and expected sales. I also want to point out that our guidance does not include any recoveries from the MHI arbitration. As a reminder, we are expensing all costs related to the arbitration as incurred through core earnings. For 2016 alone, we incurred $23 million of costs and a total of $76 million, including prior periods. As part of the SONGS settlement, we can recover our reasonable arbitration cost from MHI recoveries before sharing.
I will next touch on SCE's balance sheet strength. On June 30, SCE's weighted average common equity ratio was 50.3% versus the authorized level of 48%. This helps provide financial flexibility as the utility continues to fund growth with operating cash flow and retain earnings and without the need of new common equity. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE has updated its capital spending forecast. We expect that 2016 will be lower by $300 million, and '17 will be $100 million higher. The biggest factor change -- forecast change is $375 million of transmission spending, mostly due to licensing delays of projects like Alberhill, Mesa and the City of Riverside projects. As Ted has highlighted, we firmly believe these projects will ultimately move forward, and the balance of their capital spending will be shifted into our 2018 through '20 period.
We have also adjusted the utility's CPUC capital expenditures to more closely align with what the commission has authorized for the 3-year General Rate Case cycle. The net result of these changes is a reduction of approximately $200 million. 
Please turn to Page 6. You'll see that rate base has a directionally similar adjustment with the 2017 rate base forecast to be lower by $200 million. Because of the transmission delays, the reduction in rate base will be shifted into the 2018 through '20 period. As I mentioned earlier, we don't see this having any impact on 2016 earnings, as the modest rate base reduction has more than offset in other areas based on SCE's current outlook.
I would like to add a short addendum to my prepared remarks. This earnings call is my 32nd and last CFO of EIX. It's been a great 8-year run. There's a lot of work that goes into each one of these calls and I'd like to recognize our Edison team that makes these calls happen. Personally, I think our disclosures and investment materials are among the best. This job falls to our lawyers, accountants, corporate communications folks and IR staff. In particular, our attorneys, Adams -- Adam, Russ, Barbara, Kathleen, do a great job of converting accounting English into plain English. Our accountants, Aaron, Connie, Mark and Trisha make sure our books and SEC filings are in top shape. Our IR staff, Scott and Ally, do a fantastic job. As many of you know, Scott is a highly regarded IR professional and Ally has done a great job since joining us a year ago. 
I have always enjoyed the interaction with investors and analysts over the years. Hopefully, you have earned our respect by the way we conduct our communications. Early on, Ted advised me, when communicating with investors and analysts, I should strive to keep my comments down at middle of the fairway. Ted said if I push my comments left or right of center, you folks will sniff it out and our credibility will be called into question. I have tried to follow this solid advice, and I hope Pedro and Maria do the same. 
As you know, Ted and I are heading out on September 30. I don't have any plans for retirement yet, but there are many things that I want to do. The one thing I would really like to do, though, is finally learn how to drive my golf balls down the middle of the fairway.

So our organic growth and the expected CAGRs from rate base and ultimately earnings really make looking at other utilities outside of our territory as more often than not looking dilutive, either to the underlying strategic approach that we have, which is, as you know, a wires-based focus or a delivery of electricity focus, rather than a heavy involvement in some of the other parts of the business, or dilutive from an earnings growth perspective. So as a result of that, we've continued to focus primarily on where we see the best opportunities, and those are really our organic growth opportunities. I'd like to keep it at the 100,000-foot level. I certainly don't want to engage in speculation on any specific thing."

What I was really trying to do in the prepared remarks is say just kind of keeping this thing simple. You should expect in our 2018 general rate case to see expenses kind of in two very broad buckets. One bucket is what I call pretty much traditional meat and potato type investment request that we make every general rate case. So that covers kind of standard stuff, infrastructure replacement, expected demand, increases on certain of our circuits, new connections, so on and so forth. When you take that chunk together with the things that aren't in the GRC, such as the Charge Ready program and FERC jurisdictional transmission spend, you should expect to see a number, generally in the neighborhood, maybe a little bit higher than what we have traditionally kind of talked about. So I'll just call that broadly the $4-billion-plus type of base number. Then there's the second smaller bucket that you will see in the 2018 general rate case request, which will really going to be the first attempt to try to put some specificity around what is required to really modernize the distribution system, such that it can facilitate the state's carbon reduction goals and customer choice on technology. So distributed energy resources. And that's a lot harder for us at this early juncture to be able to handicap, one of that would ultimately be approved. So there's kind of the standard stuff, which when you lump it together with transmission spending and the like, it's going to look pretty similar to what you've seen in the past from us, maybe a little bit higher. And then there's a new layer of stuff that, really, this rate case will kind of start that conversation about what that might look like. And that would be additive to that kind of base level. So this is what I signaled last earnings call and what we've elaborated on a little bit more in this earnings call."

And if you -- a lot of this depends on what you're starting with and what you are ending with. But as I said in the last call, whether you looked at the 1-year, the 5-year, the 10, the 20, the rate of increase in customer rates, the system average rate, has actually been at or below the rate of inflation, the Southern California area CPI. I think I remember the 20 year number because that's kind of the probably the most relevant one. So over the long-term, that CPI increase, from '95 to '15, was 2.4% compound annual growth rate. The rate of increase in electric rates over that same '95 to '15 period was 2.0% CAGR, compound annual growth rate. So as it kind of demonstrates over the long haul, we've been able to manage the price of electricity at or below the rate of inflation and that continues to be kind of our overall goal. Now you have periods where you get more of a surge and you get other periods where you end up consolidating some of those increases. But the key, I think, over the long haul is to have the price of electricity stay at or below the rate of inflation. That's our overall goal. That remains our goal."

Obviously, you know this is my last earnings call with Edison and just ask you to indulge me while I make a few closing comments. 
First, it is been a true honor to be the CEO of Edison international. This company has been an essential part of the economic fabric of this region for 130 years, during which we've provided the most essential of goods for modern society to function and prosper, that is electricity. To have been a part of this great company is truly humbling. I'm exceptionally proud of what this management team and our employees have accomplished these last years. I'm sincerely grateful for the wisdom, advice, counsel of our Board of Directors that they've provided. I particularly want to single out Jim Scilacci, just cause it's so much fun, for a huge thank you. He, above all, will tell me like it is. Tell me what I must hear, not what I might like to hear. And he does it with such glee. He's been a great friend and a great colleague. So thank you, Jim. I believe we have crafted a strong strategy for success and value creation here at Edison. We have overcome many obstacles. You might say we're still getting our trailing leg over a couple of hurdles. We have repositioned SCE to be a wires-focused electric utility, in sync with and essential to California's low carbon policy objectives. Edison Energy has the potential to create a new business model, concentrating mostly on commercial and industrial customers and grid edge customer-focused energy services. We continue to gain confidence that both Edison Energy and SCE are pioneers in their respective business. We may even look back one day and conclude that both were disrupters of a sort.
I'm unabashedly bullish on this company's strategy and its prospects. But a good strategy doesn't stand alone. It must have exceptional execution and leadership to be successful, and that is why I am so excited by the new leadership team who will be taking the reins in a couple of months. 
In my opinion, Pedro is an exceptional leader. He understands our business and our industry well, and has the skills, the attitude and the discipline to navigate our complex environment. I look forward to Pedro, along with Kevin Payne and Ron Nichols at SCE; Ron Litzinger at Edison Energy; Maria Rigatti as the CFO; and the rest of the senior leadership team taking this great company to the next level of performance. I'm confident that they can.
Finally, it has been a real pleasure working with many of you as investors in Edison International. We have many stakeholders in this business, but investors are certainly one of the most important. We provide society with an essential service. But none of our investment and critical infrastructure is possible without the capital that you provide. I hope you feel we have rewarded your faith and confidence in us with superior performance and attractive returns.
I will speak for Jim and myself here by saying we look forward to participating in future earnings calls as interested parties and investors but in listen-only mode. So many thanks to all of you, both around this table here as well as you on the phone.

301891,369548897,1017057,"Edison International, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter results were below last year's results as we expected. You will recall that we told investors in our first quarter earnings call that quarterly year-over-year comparisons would not be all that",1610,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter results were below last year's results as we expected. You will recall that we told investors in our first quarter earnings call that quarterly year-over-year comparisons would not be all that meaningful. This is primarily due to timing mismatches, including: impacts from the delayed decision on SCE's 2015 to '17 rate case; the significant SCE tax benefits recorded last year but not repeated this year; no Edison capital asset sales this year versus last year; and the timing of Edison Energy costs versus revenues.
The larger point that I want to leave with you is that core earnings are on track for the full year. That is why today we reaffirmed our full year core earnings guidance range of $3.81 to $4.01 earnings per share. In fact, based on second quarter results, although there are various puts and takes amongst the businesses, our current outlook indicates that consolidated results for the full year are in the top half of our guidance range. However, consistent with what we have done in several of the past years, we will hold off until our third quarter results are in to decide if we should adjust our core earnings guidance. 
We are in the final half of our 2015 to '17 CPUC rate case period. We have communicated to investors that based on CPUC-approved capital spending and expected spending on FERC jurisdictional transmission projects, we expect rate base growth -- rate base to grow approximately 7% in the 2016 to '17 period. This still seems appropriate. We have communicated several times in the past that there is relatively little variance expected in the timing of CPUC jurisdictional spending for the 2016 to '17 period, but more variability is possible in the timing but less likely in the ultimate amount of our FERC jurisdictional transmission spending. Remember, SCE's transmission investment is to improve system reliability and bring online utility scale wind and solar resources to meet California's aggressive renewable energy targets. Most of the transmission CapEx spending variability occurs due to delays in routing decisions and permitting approvals at the state and federal levels. A recent example was the $1.1 billion West of Devers project, which has been something of a moving target with CPUC staff even with CAISO support, but appears ready for final CPUC approval with a supportive alternate proposed decision pending.
We see schedule challenges of this sort for other lesser transmission projects as well. Net-net, we don't expect meaningful impacts to our total transmission spend expectations over the medium-term 3- to 5-year period, but likely some shifting between the years. Said differently, our current view is that 2016 rate base will not be materially different than forecasted. 2017 could be slightly lower, but recovered in the 2018 to 2020 period. 
On the last earnings call, most of my comments were devoted to outlining the future SCE growth opportunity. I'd like to provide some additional comments today, keeping in mind that we will be able to elaborate more on this when SCE makes its General Rate Case filing on September 1. 
In the broadest sense, the capital spending request in our 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case is designed to help California achieve its low carbon policy objectives and to enable customer choice, while continuing to focus on reliable and affordable service for all customers. Keeping it simple, the requested investment can be lumped into 2 buckets. The first bucket is comprised of grid investments we have traditionally requested in past rate cases. The second bucket is made up of new grid modernization investments. Let me expand further on these 2 areas. 
The traditional investments we will propose in the first bucket represent the vast majority of our total rate case capital spending request. The areas of spending encompass 5 basic elements: replacement of aging infrastructure; new customer connections and demand growth on certain circuits; investments in information technology to improve customer service and cost efficiency; maintenance capital spending on SCE's generation fleet; and other core investments such as in our operations facilities.
This first bucket of requested spending, together with other non-GRC spending, such as SCE's electric vehicle charging program and FERC transmission spending, is expected to total more than $4 billion in CapEx per year. It is difficult to handicap how much of our requested investment in this first bucket of capital spending will ultimately be approved. However, investors have some history to observe in this regard. SCE received 81% of its requested capital spending in the 2009 to '11 General Rate Case, 89% of its 2012 to '14 General Rate Case request, and 92% of its 2015 to '17 request. 
The smaller second bucket of spending we will request is new. It is for modernization of the distribution system and is part of SCE's strategy to facilitate the growth of distributed energy resources. Governor Brown and the California legislature have stated their strong desire for California to lead the nation in developing policies to create a low carbon economy, while creating jobs and prosperity for its citizens. SB 350, signed into law last year, stated the goal of making the electric grid a key enabler of California's low carbon policy ambitions, including by electrifying transportation. The CPUC has 2 active proceedings underway, which together will help shape the long-term planning for this vision. 
From a capital investment perspective, the most important is the distribution resources plan proceeding. In this proceeding, the CPUC's stated goal is to modernize the distribution system during the next decade, but it provided only some early direction on preferred technologies and required investments.
SCE, through its 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case, will be the first electric utility to provide specificity for how this technology evolution should unfold. This will be the new element of our September 1 filing. We need to wait until that filing to be specific about the amount and details of our investment request, but you should expect that the overall level of the request will be roughly consistent with our DRP filing last summer. At this time, based on the pace of grid modernization that SCE will describe in its 2018 GRC filing, it is expected that grid modernization capital expenditures and rate base growth will continue beyond 2025. 
Some of the requested grid modernization investment would be better characterized as reinforcing the existing system, such as upgrading low voltage circuits in order to accommodate higher penetration of distributed energy resources. But other parts really have no precedent, and therefore, we do not know how to handicap how much of our request might finally be approved. 
Like any technology evolution, there are certain initial investments that need to be made to create the foundational infrastructure that will support system-wide grid modernization. SCE has identified the critical path that it believes needs to get started sooner rather than later. That has what led SCE to file on July 13 for a memorandum account, requesting authority from the CPUC to track certain early-stage investment cost ahead of its 2018 General Rate Case filing. The July 13 request points out that the process of modernizing the distribution grid requires some near-term planning, engineering, procurement and installation of certain distribution system upgrades before the 2018 SCE-GRC period. SCE's July 13 filing requests authority to track the revenue requirement of approximately $100 million of capital spending to be placed in service in 2017 that is critical to meeting the CPUC's overall timeline for grid modernization. If the memorandum account is approved and expenditures are deemed prudent, the associated rate base will be included in either the 2018 or perhaps the 2021 General Rate Case filing.
I'll finish with comments on 2 other matters. The first is SONGS. Last week we, and other parties, completed briefings requested by the CPUC. The core question was whether the SONGS settlement, unanimously approved by the CPUC, was still reasonable given the various disclosures about ex-parte communications made last year. There were 6 signatories to the SONGS settlement. 4 of the 6 settling parties, San Diego Gas & Electric, Friends of the Earth, The Coalition of California Utility Employees and SCE, submitted filings that made clear why these communications had no impact on the settlement process and why the settlement remains reasonable, lawful and in the public interest. Two of the settling parties TURN and ORA, are seeking in their filings to impose additional penalties on SCE. We strongly believe this is opportunistic and inappropriate. We also note that before approving the settlement, the commission asked the settling parties to amend the settlement in meaningful ways, all of which were more favorable for customers, which the parties ultimately did. The commission then unanimously approved that amended settlement. 
While there remains no time line for further action, we are hopeful that the commission will see the record as demonstrating the validity and appropriateness of the settlement by reaffirming the settlement and dismissing the pending appeals. 
The final item is the important CPUC reforms announced in late June by the governor and key legislators, and subsequently endorsed by the CPUC. These reforms largely address a series of principles the governor has advocated, while balancing sensitivities over the role of the executive and legislative branches in designing and implementing these reforms. While there are many details yet to be finalized, the overall approach appears responsive. If implemented as described, it should continue to provide broad public access to the decision-making process, accelerate timely decision-making, address important CPUC staffing and recruiting issues and allow CPUC commissioners more leeway to discuss important topics amongst themselves. 
This concludes my remarks. Jim will now provide his financial update."

My comments today will cover second quarter and year-to-date results, earnings guidance and our updated capital expenditures and rate base forecasts. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation.
As a brief reminder, comparisons to 2015 will not be meaningful, primarily because of the timing of the 2015 GRC decision and the impact of taxes. I also explained last quarter how we removed, in a variance analysis, the impact of repair deductions, pole loading and San Onofre tax items because these revenue items have offsets within the income statement. 
EIX' basic and core earnings per share are $0.85 for the second quarter or $0.31 per share less than the same quarter last year. SCE's second quarter basic and core earnings are $0.21 per share lower and EIX Parent and Other are $0.10 per share lower. The lower earnings are primarily due to $0.31 per share of income tax benefits recorded in the second quarter of last year. 
Focusing on the SCE key EPS drivers column, the utilities revenue was $0.10 per share higher quarter-over-quarter. This increase includes $0.09 per share from a GRC attrition mechanism, which automatically adjusts authorized revenue following the 2015 test year. This is largely offset by a $0.06 per share timing issue with the 2015 GRC decision. As I discussed last quarter, authorized revenue reductions from the 2015 GRC decision are not reflected in results for the first or second quarter of this year. You'll see this reverse in the third and fourth quarters of this year. There is also a $0.03 per share positive variance from the pole loading balancing account. This balancing account was created with the final 2015 GRC decision, so the $0.08 of pole loading earnings we had last year were all -- was all recorded in the fourth quarter. FERC revenues are $0.03 per share higher. This is largely related to revenues associated with the higher operating costs and abandoned plant recoveries for the canceled Coolwater-Lugo transmission project. The recovery of Coolwater-Lugo cost will continue through 2016 and has no impact on earnings. Together, these revenue items net to a positive $0.10 per share. 
O&M was not a major driver in the second quarter as lower legal and labor costs, due to workforce reductions, are mostly offset by a planned outage and upgrades at the Mountainview Generation Plant and higher pole loading costs. Results included $0.02 per share of severance costs, comparable to what was recorded last year. $0.03 of the $0.04 of higher depreciation are amortization of the Coolwater-Lugo cost discussed above. 
Net financing costs are $0.02 per share higher, due primarily to an increase in the amount of preferred stock outstanding. The CPUC and FERC rate cases include funding for new debt and preferred stock to finance rate base growth. As indicated above, there was a $0.31 per share benefit from a change in an uncertain tax positions in 2015. There is no comparable change in the second quarter of this year. Partially offsetting this item is a $0.04 per share benefit this year from tax depreciation and balancing accounts, bringing the net impact from income taxes to a negative $0.27.
The second quarter effective tax rate for SCE is a negative 9%, due primarily to a $133 million flow-through tax refund to customers for repair benefits from 2012 through 2014. The refunded tax repair benefits has no earnings impact. 
Higher insurance benefits primarily drive the $0.02 per share contribution from other income and expenses. This gets us to the $0.21 per share decline in the second quarter SCE earnings.
I will turn next to EIX Parent and Other. Losses increased by $0.10 per share overall from last quarter -- last quarter of last year. A key driver is a $0.04 per share buyout of an earn-out provision with former shareholders and the current employees of a company acquired by Edison Energy at the end of 2015. The buyout was completed along with modification of employment contracts to align Edison Energy's incentive compensation with EIX's. There is also a $0.01 per share of higher business development and operating costs. Comparisons are also affected by a $0.03 per share gain on the sale of a portion of Edison Capital's affordable housing portfolio during the second quarter of last year. 
Parent holding company costs increased by $0.02 per share due to higher interest expense as we termed out $400 million of holding company commercial paper debt and the impact of strong stock price performance on compensation expense. Core earnings exclude a $0.01 per share of tax-related losses and discontinued operations related to the Edison Mission Energy getting to the net $0.10 per share of holding company losses. That, with the SCE variance, gets you to the $0.31 per share reduction in EIX earnings. 
Please turn to Page 3. I won't go into detail on the year-to-date results, other than to remind everyone that SCE's performance for the first half of 2016 is consistent with our full year SCE outlook, which looks stronger than our original guidance levels. At the same time, holding company costs are already at full year guidance levels or $0.18 per share. We've built both factors into our reaffirmed full year guidance. 
Please turn to Page 4. On the top of this slide, it shows our reaffirmed GAAP and core earnings guidance. However, our internal SCE earnings outlook will be above its $4.09 per share guidance midpoint, and holding company cost outlook will be higher than its guidance midpoint. We're comfortable reaffirming overall EIX earnings guidance for the full year based on this internal view. However, we have not updated our SCE and holding company guidance elements other than to indicate their directional trends. We are mindful that the third quarter is typically SCE's strongest of the year, and we will continue our practice of looking to update guidance when we report third quarter results on November 1. 
As I previously mentioned, holding company year-to-date costs, including Edison Energy Group, are at a full year guidance level of $0.14 -- excuse me, at $0.18. Adjusting for an earn-out agreement, which was not part of the original guidance, would lower year-to-date cost of $0.14. The important thing is that we do anticipate an increase in revenue during the second half of 2016 based on booked deals and expected sales. I also want to point out that our guidance does not include any recoveries from the MHI arbitration. As a reminder, we are expensing all costs related to the arbitration as incurred through core earnings. For 2016 alone, we incurred $23 million of costs and a total of $76 million, including prior periods. As part of the SONGS settlement, we can recover our reasonable arbitration cost from MHI recoveries before sharing.
I will next touch on SCE's balance sheet strength. On June 30, SCE's weighted average common equity ratio was 50.3% versus the authorized level of 48%. This helps provide financial flexibility as the utility continues to fund growth with operating cash flow and retain earnings and without the need of new common equity. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE has updated its capital spending forecast. We expect that 2016 will be lower by $300 million, and '17 will be $100 million higher. The biggest factor change -- forecast change is $375 million of transmission spending, mostly due to licensing delays of projects like Alberhill, Mesa and the City of Riverside projects. As Ted has highlighted, we firmly believe these projects will ultimately move forward, and the balance of their capital spending will be shifted into our 2018 through '20 period.
We have also adjusted the utility's CPUC capital expenditures to more closely align with what the commission has authorized for the 3-year General Rate Case cycle. The net result of these changes is a reduction of approximately $200 million. 
Please turn to Page 6. You'll see that rate base has a directionally similar adjustment with the 2017 rate base forecast to be lower by $200 million. Because of the transmission delays, the reduction in rate base will be shifted into the 2018 through '20 period. As I mentioned earlier, we don't see this having any impact on 2016 earnings, as the modest rate base reduction is more than offset in other areas based on SCE's current outlook.
I would like to add a short addendum to my prepared remarks. This earnings call is my 32nd and last as CFO of EIX. It's been a great 8-year run. There's a lot of work that goes into each one of these calls and I'd like to recognize our Edison team that makes these calls happen. Personally, I think our disclosures and investment materials are among the best. This job falls to our lawyers, accountants, corporate communications folks and IR staff. In particular, our attorneys, Adams -- Adam, Russ, Barbara, Kathleen, do a great job of converting accounting English into plain English. Our accountants, Aaron, Connie, Mark and Trisha make sure our books and SEC filings are in top shape. Our IR staff, Scott and Ally, do a fantastic job. As many of you know, Scott is a highly regarded IR professional and Ally has done a great job since joining us a year ago. 
I have always enjoyed the interaction with investors and analysts over the years. Hopefully, you have earned our respect by the way we conduct our communications. Early on Ted advised me, when communicating with investors and analysts, I should strive to keep my comments down the middle of the fairway. Ted said if I push my comments left or right of center, you folks will sniff it out and our credibility will be called into question. I have tried to follow this solid advice, and I hope Pedro and Maria do the same. 
As you know, Ted and I are heading out on September 30. I don't have any plans for retirement yet, but there are many things that I want to do. The one thing I would really like to do, though, is finally learn how to drive my golf balls down the middle of the fairway. 
Thank you, all. Operator, it's question time."

I think we've been fairly open with investors over the years about our prospects and, in a weird way, the most difficult element is we have tremendous growth prospects here at Southern California Edison. So our organic growth and the expected CAGRs from rate base and ultimately earnings really make looking at other utilities outside of our territory as more often than not looking dilutive, either to the underlying strategic approach that we have, which is, as you know, a wires-based focus or a delivery of electricity focus, rather than a heavy involvement in some of the other parts of the business, or dilutive from an earnings growth perspective. So as a result of that, we've continued to focus primarily on where we see the best opportunities, and those are really our organic growth opportunities. I'd like to keep it at the 100,000-foot level. I certainly don't want to engage in speculation on any specific thing."

What I was really trying to do in the prepared remarks is say -- just kind of keeping this thing simple. You should expect in our 2018 general rate case to see expenses kind of in two very broad buckets. One bucket is what I'll call pretty much traditional meat and potato type investment request that we make every general rate case. So that covers kind of standard stuff, infrastructure replacement, expected demand, increases on certain of our circuits, new connections, so on and so forth. When you take that chunk together with the things that aren't in the GRC, such as the Charge Ready program and FERC jurisdictional transmission spend, you should expect to see a number generally in the neighborhood, maybe a little bit higher than what we have traditionally kind of talked about. So I'll just call that broadly the $4-billion-plus type of base number. Then there's a second smaller bucket that you will see in the 2018 general rate case request, which will really going to be the first attempt to try to put some specificity around what is required to really modernize the distribution system such that it can facilitate the state's carbon reduction goals and customer choice on technology. So distributed energy resources. And that's a lot harder for us at this early juncture to be able to handicap, what of that would ultimately be approved. So there's kind of the standard stuff, which when you lump it together with transmission spending and the like, it's going to look pretty similar to what you've seen in the past from us, maybe a little bit higher. And then there's a new layer of stuff that, really, this rate case will kind of start that conversation about what that might look like. And that would be additive to that kind of base level. So this is what I signaled last earnings call and what we've elaborated on a little bit more in this earnings call."

And if you -- a lot of this depends on what you're starting with and what you are ending with. But as I said in the last call, whether you looked at the 1-year, the 5-year, the 10, the 20, the rate of increase in customer rates, the system average rate, has actually been at or below the rate of inflation, the Southern California area CPI. And then I remember the 20 year number because that's kind of the -- probably the most relevant one. So over the long-term, that CPI increase, from '95 to '15, was 2.4% compound annual growth rate. The rate of increase in electric rates over that same '95 to '15 period was 2.0% CAGR, compound annual growth rate. So as it kind of demonstrates over the long haul, we've been able to manage the price of electricity at or below the rate of inflation and that continues to be kind of our overall goal. Now you have periods where you get more of a surge and you get other periods where you end up consolidating some of those increases. But the key, I think, over the long haul is to have the price of electricity stay at or below the rate of inflation. That's our overall goal. That remains our goal."

To have been a part of this great company is truly humbling. I'm exceptionally proud of what this management team and our employees have accomplished these last years. I'm sincerely grateful for the wisdom, advice, counsel of our Board of Directors that they've provided. I particularly want to single out Jim Scilacci, just cause it's so much fun, for a huge thank you. He, above all, will tell me like it is. Tell me what I must hear, not what I might like to hear. And he does it with such glee. He's been a great friend and a great colleague. So thank you, Jim. I believe we have crafted a strong strategy for success and value creation here at Edison. We have overcome many obstacles. You might say we're still getting our trailing leg over a couple of hurdles yet. We have repositioned SCE to be a wires-focused electric utility, in sync with and essential to California's low carbon policy objectives. Edison Energy has the potential to create a new business model, concentrating mostly on commercial and industrial customers and grid edge customer-focused energy services. We continue to gain confidence that both Edison Energy and SCE are pioneers in their respective business. We may even look back one day and conclude that both were disrupters of a sort.
I'm unabashedly bullish on this company's strategy and its prospects. But a good strategy doesn't stand alone. It must have exceptional execution and leadership to be successful, and that is why I am so excited by the new leadership team who will be taking the reins in a couple of months. 
In my opinion, Pedro is an exceptional leader. He understands our business and our industry well, and has the skills, the attitude and the discipline to navigate our complex environment. I look forward to Pedro, along with Kevin Payne and Ron Nichols at SCE; Ron Litzinger at Edison Energy; Maria Rigatti as the CFO; and the rest of the senior leadership team taking this great company to the next level of performance. I'm confident that they can.
Finally, it has been a real pleasure working with many of you as investors in Edison International. We have many stakeholders in this business, but investors are certainly one of the most important. We provide society with an essential service. But none of our investment and critical infrastructure is possible without the capital that you provide. I hope you feel we have rewarded your faith and confidence in us with superior performance and attractive returns.
I will speak for Jim and myself here by saying we look forward to participating in future earnings calls as interested parties and investors but in listen-only mode. So many thanks to all of you, both around this table here as well as you on the phone.
And with that, Scott, you want to wrap this up?"

301891,369548897,1018343,"Edison International, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter results were below last year's results as we expected. You will recall that we told investors in our first quarter earnings call that quarterly year-over-year comparisons would not be all that",1610,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter results were below last year's results as we expected. You will recall that we told investors in our first quarter earnings call that quarterly year-over-year comparisons would not be all that meaningful. This is primarily due to timing mismatches, including: impacts from the delayed decision on SCE's 2015 to '17 rate case; the significant SCE tax benefits recorded last year but not repeated this year; no Edison capital asset sales this year versus last year; and the timing of Edison Energy costs versus revenues.
The larger point that I want to leave with you is that core earnings are on track for the full year. That is why today we reaffirmed our full year core earnings guidance range of $3.81 to $4.01 earnings per share. In fact, based on second quarter results, although there are various puts and takes amongst the businesses, our current outlook indicates that consolidated results for the full year are in the top half of our guidance range. However, consistent with what we have done in several of the past years, we will hold off until our third quarter results are in to decide if we should adjust our core earnings guidance. 
We are in the final half of our 2015 to '17 CPUC rate case period. We have communicated to investors that based on CPUC-approved capital spending and expected spending on FERC jurisdictional transmission projects, we expect rate base growth -- rate base to grow approximately 7% in the 2016 to '17 period. This still seems appropriate. We have communicated several times in the past that there is relatively little variance expected in the timing of CPUC jurisdictional spending for the 2016 to '17 period, but more variability is possible in the timing but less likely in the ultimate amount of our FERC jurisdictional transmission spending. Remember, SCE's transmission investment is to improve system reliability and bring online utility scale wind and solar resources to meet California's aggressive renewable energy targets. Most of the transmission CapEx spending variability occurs due to delays in routing decisions and permitting approvals at the state and federal levels. A recent example was the $1.1 billion West of Devers project, which has been something of a moving target with CPUC staff even with CAISO support, but appears ready for final CPUC approval with a supportive alternate proposed decision pending.
We see schedule challenges of this sort for other lesser transmission projects as well. Net-net, we don't expect meaningful impacts to our total transmission spend expectations over the medium-term 3- to 5-year period, but likely some shifting between the years. Said differently, our current view is that 2016 rate base will not be materially different than forecasted. 2017 could be slightly lower, but recovered in the 2018 to 2020 period. 
On the last earnings call, most of my comments were devoted to outlining the future SCE growth opportunity. I'd like to provide some additional comments today, keeping in mind that we will be able to elaborate more on this when SCE makes its General Rate Case filing on September 1. 
In the broadest sense, the capital spending request in our 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case is designed to help California achieve its low carbon policy objectives and to enable customer choice, while continuing to focus on reliable and affordable service for all customers. Keeping it simple, the requested investment can be lumped into 2 buckets. The first bucket is comprised of grid investments we have traditionally requested in past rate cases. The second bucket is made up of new grid modernization investments. Let me expand further on these 2 areas. 
The traditional investments we will propose in the first bucket represent the vast majority of our total rate case capital spending request. The areas of spending encompass 5 basic elements: replacement of aging infrastructure; new customer connections and demand growth on certain circuits; investments in information technology to improve customer service and cost efficiency; maintenance capital spending on SCE's generation fleet; and other core investments such as in our operations facilities.
This first bucket of requested spending, together with other non-GRC spending, such as SCE's electric vehicle charging program and FERC transmission spending, is expected to total more than $4 billion in CapEx per year. It is difficult to handicap how much of our requested investment in this first bucket of capital spending will ultimately be approved. However, investors have some history to observe in this regard. SCE received 81% of its requested capital spending in the 2009 to '11 General Rate Case, 89% of its 2012 to '14 General Rate Case request, and 92% of its 2015 to '17 request. 
The smaller second bucket of spending we will request is new. It is for modernization of the distribution system and is part of SCE's strategy to facilitate the growth of distributed energy resources. Governor Brown and the California legislature have stated their strong desire for California to lead the nation in developing policies to create a low carbon economy, while creating jobs and prosperity for its citizens. SB 350, signed into law last year, stated the goal of making the electric grid a key enabler of California's low carbon policy ambitions, including by electrifying transportation. The CPUC has 2 active proceedings underway, which together will help shape the long-term planning for this vision. 
From a capital investment perspective, the most important is the distribution resources plan proceeding. In this proceeding, the CPUC's stated goal is to modernize the distribution system during the next decade, but it provided only some early direction on preferred technologies and required investments.
SCE, through its 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case, will be the first electric utility to provide specificity for how this technology evolution should unfold. This will be the new element of our September 1 filing. We need to wait until that filing to be specific about the amount and details of our investment request, but you should expect that the overall level of the request will be roughly consistent with our DRP filing last summer. At this time, based on the pace of grid modernization that SCE will describe in its 2018 GRC filing, it is expected that grid modernization capital expenditures and rate base growth will continue beyond 2025. 
Some of the requested grid modernization investment would be better characterized as reinforcing the existing system, such as upgrading low voltage circuits in order to accommodate higher penetration of distributed energy resources. But other parts really have no precedent, and therefore, we do not know how to handicap how much of our request might finally be approved. 
Like any technology evolution, there are certain initial investments that need to be made to create the foundational infrastructure that will support system-wide grid modernization. SCE has identified the critical path that it believes needs to get started sooner rather than later. That has what led SCE to file on July 13 for a memorandum account, requesting authority from the CPUC to track certain early-stage investment cost ahead of its 2018 General Rate Case filing. The July 13 request points out that the process of modernizing the distribution grid requires some near-term planning, engineering, procurement and installation of certain distribution system upgrades before the 2018 SCE-GRC period. SCE's July 13 filing requests authority to track the revenue requirement of approximately $100 million of capital spending to be placed in service in 2017 that is critical to meeting the CPUC's overall timeline for grid modernization. If the memorandum account is approved and expenditures are deemed prudent, the associated rate base will be included in either the 2018 or perhaps the 2021 General Rate Case filing.
I'll finish with comments on 2 other matters. The first is SONGS. Last week we, and other parties, completed briefings requested by the CPUC. The core question was whether the SONGS settlement, unanimously approved by the CPUC, was still reasonable given the various disclosures about ex-parte communications made last year. There were 6 signatories to the SONGS settlement. 4 of the 6 settling parties, San Diego Gas & Electric, Friends of the Earth, The Coalition of California Utility Employees and SCE, submitted filings that made clear why these communications had no impact on the settlement process and why the settlement remains reasonable, lawful and in the public interest. Two of the settling parties TURN and ORA, are seeking in their filings to impose additional penalties on SCE. We strongly believe this is opportunistic and inappropriate. We also note that before approving the settlement, the commission asked the settling parties to amend the settlement in meaningful ways, all of which were more favorable for customers, which the parties ultimately did. The commission then unanimously approved that amended settlement. 
While there remains no time line for further action, we are hopeful that the commission will see the record as demonstrating the validity and appropriateness of the settlement by reaffirming the settlement and dismissing the pending appeals. 
The final item is the important CPUC reforms announced in late June by the governor and key legislators, and subsequently endorsed by the CPUC. These reforms largely address a series of principles the governor has advocated, while balancing sensitivities over the role of the executive and legislative branches in designing and implementing these reforms. While there are many details yet to be finalized, the overall approach appears responsive. If implemented as described, it should continue to provide broad public access to the decision-making process, accelerate timely decision-making, address important CPUC staffing and recruiting issues and allow CPUC commissioners more leeway to discuss important topics amongst themselves. 
This concludes my remarks. Jim will now provide his financial update."

My comments today will cover second quarter and year-to-date results, earnings guidance and our updated capital expenditures and rate base forecasts. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation.
As a brief reminder, comparisons to 2015 will not be meaningful, primarily because of the timing of the 2015 GRC decision and the impact of taxes. I also explained last quarter how we removed, in a variance analysis, the impact of repair deductions, pole loading and San Onofre tax items because these revenue items have offsets within the income statement. 
EIX' basic and core earnings per share are $0.85 for the second quarter or $0.31 per share less than the same quarter last year. SCE's second quarter basic and core earnings are $0.21 per share lower and EIX Parent and Other are $0.10 per share lower. The lower earnings are primarily due to $0.31 per share of income tax benefits recorded in the second quarter of last year. 
Focusing on the SCE key EPS drivers column, the utilities revenue was $0.10 per share higher quarter-over-quarter. This increase includes $0.09 per share from a GRC attrition mechanism, which automatically adjusts authorized revenue following the 2015 test year. This is largely offset by a $0.06 per share timing issue with the 2015 GRC decision. As I discussed last quarter, authorized revenue reductions from the 2015 GRC decision are not reflected in results for the first or second quarter of this year. You'll see this reverse in the third and fourth quarters of this year. There is also a $0.03 per share positive variance from the pole loading balancing account. This balancing account was created with the final 2015 GRC decision, so the $0.08 of pole loading earnings we had last year were all -- was all recorded in the fourth quarter. FERC revenues are $0.03 per share higher. This is largely related to revenues associated with the higher operating costs and abandoned plant recoveries for the canceled Coolwater-Lugo transmission project. The recovery of Coolwater-Lugo cost will continue through 2016 and has no impact on earnings. Together, these revenue items net to a positive $0.10 per share. 
O&M was not a major driver in the second quarter as lower legal and labor costs, due to workforce reductions, are mostly offset by a planned outage and upgrades at the Mountainview Generation Plant and higher pole loading costs. Results included $0.02 per share of severance costs, comparable to what was recorded last year. $0.03 of the $0.04 of higher depreciation are amortization of the Coolwater-Lugo cost discussed above. 
Net financing costs are $0.02 per share higher, due primarily to an increase in the amount of preferred stock outstanding. The CPUC and FERC rate cases include funding for new debt and preferred stock to finance rate base growth. As indicated above, there was a $0.31 per share benefit from a change in an uncertain tax positions in 2015. There is no comparable change in the second quarter of this year. Partially offsetting this item is a $0.04 per share benefit this year from tax depreciation and balancing accounts, bringing the net impact from income taxes to a negative $0.27.
The second quarter effective tax rate for SCE is a negative 9%, due primarily to a $133 million flow-through tax refund to customers for repair benefits from 2012 through 2014. The refunded tax repair benefits has no earnings impact. 
Higher insurance benefits primarily drive the $0.02 per share contribution from other income and expenses. This gets us to the $0.21 per share decline in the second quarter SCE earnings.
I will turn next to EIX Parent and Other. Losses increased by $0.10 per share overall from last quarter -- last quarter of last year. A key driver is a $0.04 per share buyout of an earn-out provision with former shareholders and the current employees of a company acquired by Edison Energy at the end of 2015. The buyout was completed along with modification of employment contracts to align Edison Energy's incentive compensation with EIX's. There is also a $0.01 per share of higher business development and operating costs. Comparisons are also affected by a $0.03 per share gain on the sale of a portion of Edison Capital's affordable housing portfolio during the second quarter of last year. 
Parent holding company costs increased by $0.02 per share due to higher interest expense as we termed out $400 million of holding company commercial paper debt and the impact of strong stock price performance on compensation expense. Core earnings exclude a $0.01 per share of tax-related losses and discontinued operations related to the Edison Mission Energy getting to the net $0.10 per share of holding company losses. That, with the SCE variance, gets you to the $0.31 per share reduction in EIX earnings. 
Please turn to Page 3. I won't go into detail on the year-to-date results, other than to remind everyone that SCE's performance for the first half of 2016 is consistent with our full year SCE outlook, which looks stronger than our original guidance levels. At the same time, holding company costs are already at full year guidance levels or $0.18 per share. We've built both factors into our reaffirmed full year guidance. 
Please turn to Page 4. On the top of this slide, it shows our reaffirmed GAAP and core earnings guidance. However, our internal SCE earnings outlook will be above its $4.09 per share guidance midpoint, and holding company cost outlook will be higher than its guidance midpoint. We're comfortable reaffirming overall EIX earnings guidance for the full year based on this internal view. However, we have not updated our SCE and holding company guidance elements other than to indicate their directional trends. We are mindful that the third quarter is typically SCE's strongest of the year, and we will continue our practice of looking to update guidance when we report third quarter results on November 1. 
As I previously mentioned, holding company year-to-date costs, including Edison Energy Group, are at a full year guidance level of $0.14 -- excuse me, at $0.18. Adjusting for an earn-out agreement, which was not part of the original guidance, would lower year-to-date cost of $0.14. The important thing is that we do anticipate an increase in revenue during the second half of 2016 based on booked deals and expected sales. I also want to point out that our guidance does not include any recoveries from the MHI arbitration. As a reminder, we are expensing all costs related to the arbitration as incurred through core earnings. For 2016 alone, we incurred $23 million of costs and a total of $76 million, including prior periods. As part of the SONGS settlement, we can recover our reasonable arbitration cost from MHI recoveries before sharing.
I will next touch on SCE's balance sheet strength. On June 30, SCE's weighted average common equity ratio was 50.3% versus the authorized level of 48%. This helps provide financial flexibility as the utility continues to fund growth with operating cash flow and retain earnings and without the need of new common equity. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE has updated its capital spending forecast. We expect that 2016 will be lower by $300 million, and '17 will be $100 million higher. The biggest factor change -- forecast change is $375 million of transmission spending, mostly due to licensing delays of projects like Alberhill, Mesa and the City of Riverside projects. As Ted has highlighted, we firmly believe these projects will ultimately move forward, and the balance of their capital spending will be shifted into our 2018 through '20 period.
We have also adjusted the utility's CPUC capital expenditures to more closely align with what the commission has authorized for the 3-year General Rate Case cycle. The net result of these changes is a reduction of approximately $200 million. 
Please turn to Page 6. You'll see that rate base has a directionally similar adjustment with the 2017 rate base forecast to be lower by $200 million. Because of the transmission delays, the reduction in rate base will be shifted into the 2018 through '20 period. As I mentioned earlier, we don't see this having any impact on 2016 earnings, as the modest rate base reduction is more than offset in other areas based on SCE's current outlook.
I would like to add a short addendum to my prepared remarks. This earnings call is my 32nd and last as CFO of EIX. It's been a great 8-year run. There's a lot of work that goes into each one of these calls and I'd like to recognize our Edison team that makes these calls happen. Personally, I think our disclosures and investment materials are among the best. This job falls to our lawyers, accountants, corporate communications folks and IR staff. In particular, our attorneys, Adams -- Adam, Russ, Barbara, Kathleen, do a great job of converting accounting English into plain English. Our accountants, Aaron, Connie, Mark and Trisha make sure our books and SEC filings are in top shape. Our IR staff, Scott and Ally, do a fantastic job. As many of you know, Scott is a highly regarded IR professional and Ally has done a great job since joining us a year ago. 
I have always enjoyed the interaction with investors and analysts over the years. Hopefully, you have earned our respect by the way we conduct our communications. Early on Ted advised me, when communicating with investors and analysts, I should strive to keep my comments down the middle of the fairway. Ted said if I push my comments left or right of center, you folks will sniff it out and our credibility will be called into question. I have tried to follow this solid advice, and I hope Pedro and Maria do the same. 
As you know, Ted and I are heading out on September 30. I don't have any plans for retirement yet, but there are many things that I want to do. The one thing I would really like to do, though, is finally learn how to drive my golf balls down the middle of the fairway.

So as a result of that, we've continued to focus primarily on where we see the best opportunities, and those are really our organic growth opportunities.

What I was really trying to do in the prepared remarks is say -- just kind of keeping this thing simple. You should expect in our 2018 general rate case to see expenses kind of in two very broad buckets. One bucket is what I'll call pretty much traditional meat and potato type investment request that we make every general rate case. So that covers kind of standard stuff, infrastructure replacement, expected demand, increases on certain of our circuits, new connections, so on and so forth. When you take that chunk together with the things that aren't in the GRC, such as the Charge Ready program and FERC jurisdictional transmission spend, you should expect to see a number generally in the neighborhood, maybe a little bit higher than what we have traditionally kind of talked about. So I'll just call that broadly the $4-billion-plus type of base number. Then there's a second smaller bucket that you will see in the 2018 general rate case request, which will really going to be the first attempt to try to put some specificity around what is required to really modernize the distribution system such that it can facilitate the state's carbon reduction goals and customer choice on technology. So distributed energy resources. And that's a lot harder for us at this early juncture to be able to handicap, what of that would ultimately be approved. So there's kind of the standard stuff, which when you lump it together with transmission spending and the like, it's going to look pretty similar to what you've seen in the past from us, maybe a little bit higher. And then there's a new layer of stuff that, really, this rate case will kind of start that conversation about what that might look like. And that would be additive to that kind of base level. So this is what I signaled last earnings call and what we've elaborated on a little bit more in this earnings call."

And if you -- a lot of this depends on what you're starting with and what you are ending with. But as I said in the last call, whether you looked at the 1-year, the 5-year, the 10, the 20, the rate of increase in customer rates, the system average rate, has actually been at or below the rate of inflation, the Southern California area CPI. And then I remember the 20 year number because that's kind of the -- probably the most relevant one. So over the long-term, that CPI increase, from '95 to '15, was 2.4% compound annual growth rate. The rate of increase in electric rates over that same '95 to '15 period was 2.0% CAGR, compound annual growth rate. So as it kind of demonstrates over the long haul, we've been able to manage the price of electricity at or below the rate of inflation and that continues to be kind of our overall goal. Now you have periods where you get more of a surge and you get other periods where you end up consolidating some of those increases. But the key, I think, over the long haul is to have the price of electricity stay at or below the rate of inflation. That's our overall goal. That remains our goal."

So I'll just kind of leave it there. I don't think you should expect we'll be providing something every quarter on this. It's probably more likely to be maybe a couple of times a year as this thing progresses."

Obviously, you know this is my last earnings call with Edison and just ask you to indulge me while I make a few closing comments. 
First, it is been a true honor to be the CEO of Edison international. This company has been an essential part of the economic fabric of this region for 130 years, during which we've provided the most essential of goods for modern society to function and prosper, that is, electricity. To have been a part of this great company is truly humbling. I'm exceptionally proud of what this management team and our employees have accomplished these last years. I'm sincerely grateful for the wisdom, advice, counsel of our Board of Directors that they've provided. I particularly want to single out Jim Scilacci, just cause it's so much fun, for a huge thank you. He, above all, will tell me like it is. Tell me what I must hear, not what I might like to hear. And he does it with such glee. He's been a great friend and a great colleague. So thank you, Jim. I believe we have crafted a strong strategy for success and value creation here at Edison. We have overcome many obstacles. You might say we're still getting our trailing leg over a couple of hurdles yet. We have repositioned SCE to be a wires-focused electric utility, in sync with and essential to California's low carbon policy objectives. Edison Energy has the potential to create a new business model, concentrating mostly on commercial and industrial customers and grid edge customer-focused energy services. We continue to gain confidence that both Edison Energy and SCE are pioneers in their respective business. We may even look back one day and conclude that both were disrupters of a sort.
I'm unabashedly bullish on this company's strategy and its prospects. But a good strategy doesn't stand alone. It must have exceptional execution and leadership to be successful, and that is why I am so excited by the new leadership team who will be taking the reins in a couple of months. 
In my opinion, Pedro is an exceptional leader. He understands our business and our industry well, and has the skills, the attitude and the discipline to navigate our complex environment. I look forward to Pedro, along with Kevin Payne and Ron Nichols at SCE; Ron Litzinger at Edison Energy; Maria Rigatti as the CFO; and the rest of the senior leadership team taking this great company to the next level of performance. I'm confident that they can.
Finally, it has been a real pleasure working with many of you as investors in Edison International. We have many stakeholders in this business, but investors are certainly one of the most important. We provide society with an essential service. But none of our investment and critical infrastructure is possible without the capital that you provide. I hope you feel we have rewarded your faith and confidence in us with superior performance and attractive returns.
I will speak for Jim and myself here by saying we look forward to participating in future earnings calls as interested parties and investors but in listen-only mode. So many thanks to all of you, both around this table here as well as you on the phone.

I want to thank [indiscernible] and Jim for all of their help in our transition over the summer. I also thank many of you whom Ted and I had an opportunity to visit in September. While the main purpose of our visits was to share our key messages on continuity of leadership and continuity of strategy, I believe I benefited the most from the visits as the dialogue helped me a great deal. I look forward to our continued discussion, and our team will strive hard to maintain our commitment to transparency and full engagement with our investors. 
In today's call, Maria will cover the financial results, so I will focus on the recent strategic developments at SCE and in California that will help shape Edison International's long-term growth.
I'll start with SCE's 2018 General Rate Case filed September 1. This filing demonstrates SCE's commitment to 3 key strategy elements: First, maintain a safe and reliable wireless network; second, be a key enabler of California's commitment to addressing climate change through significant greenhouse gas reduction led by our proposed grid modernization efforts to support widespread adoption of solar, storage, electric vehicle charging and other technologies; and finally, continue our operational excellence journey to achieve top quartile performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and costs. We believe we have made a strong case for our strategy and for the requested funding level in our rate case filing. Recently, CPUC President, Picker [ph] and 2 administrative law judges were assigned to the case. President Ficker is also leading the broader proceeding looking at distribution resource plans which is addressing many of the policy and technical details of solar and other distributed energy resources. Having the same commissioner overseeing these 2 highly inter related proceedings should prove very constructive. We are also hopeful that the comments President Ficker made at the CPUC's June 23 meeting regarding the need for timelier General Rate Case decisions will set the tone for SCE's rate case. We will look to do our part.
Based on past practice, we should receive a proposed schedule shortly. Last week SCE held its first of several GRC workshops which was well attended, including by both the assigned ALJs. We had lots of good questions and comments their various parties regarding both traditional GRC elements as well as SCE's grid modernization proposals. The grid modernization efforts included in the GRC request will support California's implementation of Senate Bill 32 signed by Governor Brown in September 8. This legislation requires the states to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 in order to help address global climate change. California has led the way over the past decades with progressive policies across renewables, energy efficiency, vehicle fuel standards and cap and trade. According to the California air resources Board's more recent report using 2014 data, these actions have all helped California achieve greenhouse gas emissions that are only 3% higher than 1990 levels, over a time period when California's population grew 30%. Keeping greenhouse gas emissions roughly constant over 24 years of population and economic growth was a remarkable achievement, thanks to the very hard work, yet our state is now legally committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 42% from current levels by 2030. That is only 14 years from now. 
Grid modernization, which by the CPUC's estimate, will be an ongoing effort into the middle part of the next decade, is a very significant part of the needed solution. We believe that California will have to move much more aggressively and sooner rather than later to meet these new legislative mandates within a short 14 years. Many of California's policies to date had focused on electric power, but generation, both in-state and from imports, represents only an estimated 20% of current statewide greenhouse gas emissions. The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions is the transportation sector with an estimated 36% of current emissions. Industrial sources represent another 21%. We believe that significant new efforts across all sectors of the economy will be needed, and many of these efforts will require significant electrification of sectors that today rely on fossil fuels. We see ourselves as a key partner with California in this effort. 
Edison International is committed to being one of the most constructive agents of change in helping California meet its greenhouse gas objectives. I plan on talking in more detail in how to do this in my November 8 remarks at the Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference. 
Let me next anticipate your questions on 2 topics we're asked about regularly; namely, the status of the songs settlement and the MHI arbitration. SCE continuos to implement the settlement. We have reduced rates and refunded or will refund nearly $1.6 billion under the terms of the settlement. With respect to the pending appeals of the settlement decision, we can't predict when the CPUC will act. We continue to believe the settlement is lawful, fair and in the best interest of our customers. With respect to MHI, we remain hopeful that we will receive a decision later this year or early next year. Once we receive a decision from the International Chamber of Commerce panel, we will promptly disclose its key findings. In the spirit of transparency, SCE plans to make the actual decision public as soon as possible, though this will require agreement with MHI on what proprietary information must be kept confidential. 
Should the arbitration outcome be favorable to the song's owners, SCE will refund to customers under the SONGS settlement 50% of any proceeds that exceed legal expenses. SCE expects is its share of any recoveries the paid down or reduce the use of short-term debt needed to help finance SCE's capital spending program. 
I also want to comment on the CPUC proceeding examining the SCE customer outages in Long Beach in July 2015. You may recall that we had multiple underground volt fires and underground failures, which affected much of the downtown area and adjoining neighborhoods. The problem centered in a unique portion of SCE's distribution system that is arranged in a network configuration similar to those used in dense urban areas like Manhattan. Most of our systems has a radial design instead. 
SCE has made a number of changes in our systems and management processes as a result of these outages. The CPUC proceeding will determine if fines are warranted and proposed penalty amounts which could be significant but we are not able to estimate this at this early stage of the proceeding. Hearings are first scheduled for February of next year.
Turning briefly to our new business activities. We continue to develop energy advisory services and solutions for large commercial and industrial customers, which Edison Energy launched in March. Customer feedback has been quite encouraging, and our customers include a number of Fortune 1000 companies and a dozen of the Fortune 50. That said, we still have much work to do to flesh out a compelling value proposition that will grow this into a profitable business with meaningful scale.
We expect to complete evolving our initial business case into a detailed business plan with importantly, near-term milestones that our board, management and our investors can use to measure our progress. I expect this to be able to provide you this detail no later than the next 12 months. 
We are continuing to refine the scope and strategy for all our competitive business initiatives. We will concentrate on those that will give us the best opportunities to capture additional value and scale from the technology changes that are transforming the nature of our industry. Our focus is on a capital light business model that maximizes the opportunity for value creation and complements our core SCE utility business. At the same time, the cost to develop these businesses continue. While we have reaffirmed our 2016 earnings guidance, we expect to bound the costs of new business development for Edison Energy and provide additional detail in our guidance for 2017. I am committed to implementing our Edison Energy Group strategies at a pace that creates opportunities for meaningful growth, yet is disciplined and does not detract from Edison International's opportunity to deliver above industry earnings and dividend growth and resulting value for investors. 
I'll finish up with one last example of management continuity. A continued dividend growth opportunity in steps and overtime to continue our well-known phrase from prior earnings calls. Today, we are only of the low end of our target payout range of 45% to 55% of SCE earnings based on the midpoint of our earnings guidance. We want to continue to move well into the range, which means a dividend growth opportunity higher than our earnings growth. With the engagement and support of our employees, I expect we'll do great things together for our customers and our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn things over to Maria."

It is a privilege and honor to be here, and I look forward to working with everyone in my new role. Now let's review the numbers. The plan on following a format similar to what we've been using in prior earnings calls, commenting on the financial results, our updated guidance, our capital plan and a few other financial topics. I will try not to repeat the numbers you can see on the presentation, but rather focus on the underlying trends and explanation. 
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. As discussed in our prior investor call this, year quarterly earnings comparisons are awkward due to the timing of last year's rate case decision. SCE reflected the proposed decision in the third quarter of last year. At that time, SCE recorded most, but not all of the expected impacts of our proposed decision. Some of last year's third quarter impacts related to the first half of 2015, so the third quarter comparisons are not perfectly aligned. Comparisons to the prior year are clearer in the year-to-date information. Also, SCE now operates under the tax accounting memorandum accounts or TAMA approved in the 2015 rate case decision. This has reduced the variability around taxes. 
As we indicated on the last earnings call, SCE is doing better than our original earnings guidance. This is reflected in the updated guidance I will discuss shortly. Also, as expected, holding company costs are higher than our original guidance as we suggested last quarter. We continue to fine-tune the level of cost needed to successfully develop our new competitive businesses without undue drag on our consolidated results. With that background, let's look specifically at third quarter results. 
For SCE, the largest positive impact on revenue is the $0.13 per share benefit related to the timing of the GRC decision. Think of this as the amount that ideally would have been recorded in the first and second quarters of last year if the GRC decision had been in effect all of 2015. The other positive drivers are revenue escalation for growth provided for in the 2015 rate case decision as well as the return on poll loading rate base. You will recall that the poll loading program is handled through a separate balancing account in the current rate case, and received rate base treatment. 
On the cost side, we are seeing expected favorable earnings contribution from the operational improvement SCE has focused on for some time. Higher depreciation and financing costs reflect the normal trends supporting SCE's capital spending program. Income tax expense is higher on higher pretax income and lower income tax benefits on property related items. Overall, SCE earnings increased $0.15 per share or 13% to $1.34 per share. 
Let's turn to the Edison International holding company, which includes the costs for Edison Energy Group. Comparisons continued to reflect the absence of earnings from the affordable housing portfolio sold at the end of last year. We also see the higher levels of support for developing our new businesses along with the higher interest expense from churning out some of the holding company debt earlier this year. Core losses were $0.05 per share and $0.02 per share higher than last year. The increase in losses are driven equally by the absence of Edison Mission Group earnings and higher Edison Energy Group costs. Underlying holding company costs are generally comparable to last year's third quarter. 
GAAP comparisons are also impacted by income of $0.13 per share from discontinued operations in the third quarter of last year with no impact on core earnings. This was related to updated estimates and tax benefits and insurance proceeds. So net-net, core earnings came in at $1.29 per share, 11% above last year. 
Please turn to Page 3. Year-to-date results are a clear picture of underlying SCE performance as well as the holding company cost trends which are relevant to our we reaffirmed core earnings guidance. The underlying drivers for SCE are similar for those for the quarter, other than the release of reserves for uncertain tax decision for the second quarter 2015 of $0.31 per share. 
On a year-to-date basis, the timing of the 2015 GRC decision is no longer a significant factor and the earnings drivers do not include the $0.13 per share timing issue I mentioned earlier. The embedded escalation in revenues and the 2015 GRC decision and the return on poll-loading rate base are the 2 key drivers. FERC revenue increases mostly to fund higher O&M and capital continue on a year-to-date basis. 
The principal cost drivers are generally consistent through the year. As noted earlier, depreciation and financing costs reflect the higher capital associated with SCE's capital spending program as well as the recovery of transmission project costs. Taxes were impacted by last year's change in uncertain tax benefits, and the general trend of passing more tax benefits the customers through the tax memorandum accounts continues. 
Turning to the EIX holding company. We have increased costs of $0.14 per share excluding noncore items. $0.09 of this variance related to 2 discrete items. The first component is $0.05 per share-related to the absence of the Edison Mission Group portfolio earnings this year. The second component is the second quarter buyout of an earnout arrangement with former shareholders of a company acquired at the end of last year. This was $0.04 per share. Excluding these discrete items, there was $0.05 per share of higher costs, which breaks down to $0.01 per share at the holding company and $0.04 per share for Edison Energy Group. 
In absolute terms, total year-to-date core costs are $0.23 per share, which reflects $0.11 per share each as a holding company and Edison Energy Group. There was also $0.01 of costs related to the residual Edison Mission Group asset. I will come back to this topic later when I talk about our updated guidance. 
Please turn to Page 4. Today, we have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance at $3.91 per share. Last quarter, we indicated full year results should be in the top half of the guidance range, and we still see an opportunity to do that. We have narrowed the guidance range to plus or minus $0.05 per share consistent with our recent practice. At the midpoint of our guidance, the outlook for SCE is $0.09 per share higher than our original 2016 guidance, and the EIX holding company is $0.09 per share less favorable. 
For SCE, we see the improvement relating largely to the higher operational cost savings and financing benefits which have been more favorable than what we included in our initial guidance last February. The footnote recap have guidance elements have changed. Also, please note that our guidance for SCE energy efficiency earnings is now $0.04 per share. This is based on updated estimates of benefits included in our September CPC filing related to energy efficiency. 
Our updated holding company guidance follows the accounting categories in the 10-Q for the focus on core results. The first category is normal holding company costs, plus residual impact from what remains of Edison Mission Group. Corporate expenses and other costs are still a little more $0.01 a month per share based on our year-to-date results. This is consistent with what we have suggested for some time. Our full year guidance for holding company costs is $0.15 per share compared to $0.12 recorded year-to-date. 
The second category reflects Edison Energy Group with full year guidance at a $0.12 per share loss. This is aligned with the $0.02 to $0.03 per share we are seeing each quarter, or $0.07 per share so far this year, excluding the buyout of the earnout provision. While we develop these businesses, we do expect continued losses early on. 
Looking at overall holding company costs, including Edison Energy Group, we will be managing our near-term activities, such that 2017 costs do not exceed 2016 guidance levels of $0.27 per share, consistent with Pedro's earlier point. When we provide 2017 earnings guidance, we plan to provide refined cost estimates for these businesses that reflect the balance between the value creation opportunity we see in the long-term and the earnings impact in the near-term. 
Our guidance continues to exclude any recoveries related to the MHI arbitration. If we do receive any meaningful award, we will account for the recovery of legal and other costs incurred to obtain the award as core earnings. This is consistent with our core treatment of these costs over the last 3 years. While a portion of an award, depending upon the amount, will be treated as nonpoor, we didn't want to provide you with of core and noncore splits in the event an award is made. Net costs incurred and not recovered from MHI totaled $48 million or $0.09 per share. 
Please turn to Page 5. I will touch on a few other key topics. The capital spending and rate base forecasts that we provided in our September 1 GRC presentation are included in the appendix of today's presentation. SCE continuously assesses how best to optimize between new capital spending opportunities that may be identified and any changes in the schedules for existing projects for an overall capital spending. SCE continues to seek approval of the memorandum account to cover roughly $200 million of early stage grid modernization capital spending forecast in 2016 and '17. If approval is not granted by late this year or early next year, it could push out the time line for ramping up grid modernization spending under the 2018 GRC. 
Transmission permitting and regulatory review remains challenging here and for utilities in other parts of the country. The $1.1 billion West of Devers project was approved by the CPUC in August, but that decision was appealed in September on environment grounds. The approval stands pending appeal. Also, alternative designs have been proposed on the CPUC review of the $600 million Mesa Substation projects that were drilled for a significant reengineering. SCE and the California ISO continue to recommend the project. These permitting and approval challenges are increasingly typical of transmission planning and part of the process, although the need for these projects is not affected by the regulatory delays that impact initial timing.  Despite these challenges, we continue to see at least $4 billion in annual SCE capital spending and roughly $2 billion of annual rate base growth in 2017 and for the foreseeable future. With almost all of that investment in the lighter side of the business, we believe it has lower investment opportunity risk as compared to utilities with high percentages of growth tied to generation investment. 
On other financial matters, SCE has a full settlement in place at the current capital structure and cost of capital, including an ROE of 10.45% for 2017. SCE's cost of capital trigger mechanism ended its last measurement period at 4.91%, just below the 5% midpoint. Under our settlement, the operation of the mechanism is suspended at this time. However, utility interest rate trends remain relevant, looking ahead to the next capital proceedings in April of next year. The moving average restarted October 1 at the spot rate of 4.26%, against what is likely for a long-term interest rates in the current rate environment.
SCE remains open to another settlement for a further extension. SCE's equity ratio for regulatory purposes remain strong at 50.4% as of September 30. SCE remains comfortable with its 48% equity capital structure and has no plans to recommend any changes in the equity ratio to the CPUC. While conservative, it helps provide the flexibility we need to support our dividend growth objective.
I want to touch briefly on financing strategy if only to reaffirm our past statements. For SCE, we plan on funding our capital program with no new equity, relying on long-term debt and preferred stock financing, as well as operating cash flow and perhaps, short-term debt as needed. At the holding company, the principal financing need this quarter was for the last E&E bondholder settlement payment of $214 million. EIX retained plenty of financial flexibility and overall financing needs remain modest at this time. 
Finally, we plan on continuing our normal practice of providing 2017 earnings guidance when we report fourth quarter and full year financial results tentatively scheduled for February 21 of next year. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Christy, please open the line for questions."

I think what we said is we see a continued case supporting 4, at least $4 billion a year in CapEx. I think we've acknowledged in the past that assuming that, that continues which we see that opportunity, that provides a floor for growth. And to the extent that we're investing at that, call it $4 billion, $4 billion-ish level, the denominator grows, the percent increase from the denominator starts tailoring down. That's said, you saw in our rate case application that the request that we provided, if we got the total request, which we don't expect we'll go get 100% of that but we provided a very strong case, that rate case 4 request will take us to $5 billion, which will then be a step-up in that rate. So I guess that the final point I'll make you is think about it as a floor, but as we look up the California opportunity, that's a really interesting opportunity over certainly the decade ahead. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're still, not just we as SCE, but we, the state, are still trying to get their arms around what SP 32 really mean? What is the nature of that opportunity? When you have to reduce greenhouse gases more than 40% than from what we are today, that's going to work were amount of infrastructure. Early to say how much of that might be, no infrastructure translator rate case infrastructure on the customer side or by other entities. It will certainly imply a good opportunity in terms of the usage of the grid. But I think net-net, when you look at SP32, when you look at some of the other upsides around, items like the storage item that Julian asked about earlier, we do see continued support for investing at its least at floor $4 billion. And to the extent that we're only investing at that floor, then yes, you'll see the ratio ease up overtime. So does that make sense?"

The other comment I'd make, though, is beyond just looking at what it means for SCE today, to benchmark itself against the folks who are in the top quartile already or even best in class, that's where the while industry and frankly the whole economy has set it, certainly over the decade ahead for us here, technology is going to be opening up some pretty powerful opportunities to reshape how a lot of American work is done. And I think even the folks who are best-in-class in our industry or in other industries, are going to see continued opportunities for improvement, whether it's a back-office technologies, or an artificial intelligence or the impact of other hardware and software in various parts of our business, I just see that as a continuing opportunity for all of us in the industry and across the economy.

In a specific case of that is Edison Energy, this is getting a little ahead of our [indiscernible] here but just to provide a little bit of color. We view that as an energy as a service kind of business. The business that we have today basically have a number of customers, contracts can span from 1 to several years. We've expect that to be a book of business that we could describe to our investors and provide metrics around the texture of that portfolio, the tenure of it, what contract volumes or what years, measures of backlog, et cetera.

Perhaps, the 1 point of more interaction that's still being defined is around the whole topic of grid modernization. I think it's fair to say that in the beginning when the commission first set up the distribution resource plan proceeding or DRP, that was intended to provide policy level guidance that would then feed into the request of each utility in their general rate cases. We do have a unique situation with SCE's rate case in that just the timing of our rate case is such that we had to file a request before we have a final decision in the DRP proceeding. The commission has recognized that and so some interaction there, but in the meantime, we're very focused on providing the testimony and the high-quality testimony in the GRC proceedings. And again we're encouraged by the comment President Picker made about wanting to stay on the overall time lines. Looking at Kevin Pane and Ron in case they have anything to add there."

So I'll probably stop short on commenting on your specific scenario there. But really, come back to the basic message, which is no matter which way we cut it, and we're doing our own homework on this right now as they're state agencies, but no matter how we cut it, we see electrification of a lot of the economy being absolutely needed. Whether it's a you're a quick math there in terms of the impact in transportation and some of the other factors, whether it's different math, different proportions coming from different sectors, even within transportation, how much comes from passenger light-duty light vehicles, how much comes from heavier duty, lots of questions that the state needs grapple. With in the end, I mean which way you cut it, it will require a fair amount of electrification and therefore really, cement the absolute necessity of having a strong and modern grid as a center of it all to move that power around. So that's the focus and I think we will all be learning a lot over the course of the next 2 [ph] years here as we march our way to the state being able to meet the expectation of the law 14 years from now."

I want to thank Ted Craver and Jim Scilacci for all of their help in our transition over the summer. I also thank the many of you, whom Ted and I had an opportunity to visit in September. While the main purpose of our visits was to share our key messages on continuity of leadership and continuity of strategy, I believe I benefited the most from the visits as the dialogue helped me a great deal. I look forward to our continued discussion, and our team will strive hard to maintain our commitment to transparency and full engagement with our investors. 
In today's call, Maria will cover the financial results, so I will focus on the recent strategic developments at SCE and in California that will help shape Edison International's long-term growth.
I'll start with SCE's 2018 General Rate Case filed September 1. This filing demonstrates SCE's commitment to 3 key strategy elements: First, maintain a safe and reliable wireless network; second, be a key enabler of California's commitment to addressing climate change through significant greenhouse gas reduction led by our proposed grid modernization efforts to support widespread adoption of solar, storage, electric vehicle charging and other technologies; and finally, continue our operational excellence journey to achieve top quartile performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and costs. We believe we have made a strong case for our strategy and for the requested funding levels in our rate case filing. Recently, CPUC President, Picker, and 2 administrative law judges were assigned to the case. President Picker is also leading the broader proceeding looking at distribution resource plans, which is addressing many of the policy and technical details of solar and other distributed energy resources. Having the same commissioner overseeing these 2 highly interrelated proceedings should prove very constructive. We are also hopeful that the comments President Picker made at the CPUC's June 23 meeting regarding the need for timelier General Rate Case decisions will set the tone for SCE's rate case. We will look to do our part.
Based on past practice, we should receive a proposed schedule shortly. Last week, SCE held the first of several GRC workshops which was well attended, including by both the assigned ALJs. We had lots of good questions and comments by various parties regarding both the traditional GRC elements as well as the SCE's grid modernization proposals. The grid modernization efforts included in the GRC request will support California's implementation of Senate Bill 32 signed by Governor Brown on September 8. This legislation requires the states to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 in order to help address global climate change. California has led the way over the past decades with progressive policies across renewables, energy efficiency, vehicle fuel standards and cap and trade. According to the California Air Resources Board's more recent report using 2014 data, these actions have all helped California achieve greenhouse gas emissions that are only 3% higher than 1990 levels, over a time period when California's population grew 30%. Keeping greenhouse gas emissions roughly constant over 24 years of population and economic growth was a remarkable achievement, thanks to the very hard work, yet our state is now legally committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 42% from current levels by 2030. That is only 14 years from now.
Grid modernization, which by the CPUC's estimate, will be an ongoing effort into the middle part of the next decade, is a very significant part to the needed solution. We believe that California will have to move much more aggressively and sooner, rather than later, to meet these new legislative mandates within a short 14 years. Many of California's policies to date have focused on electric power. But generation, both in-state and from imports, represents only an estimated 20% of current statewide greenhouse gas emissions. The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions is the transportation sector with an estimated 36% of current emissions. Industrial sources represent another 21%. We believe that significant new efforts across all sectors of the economy will be needed, and many of these efforts will require significant electrification of sectors that today rely on fossil fuels. We see ourselves as a key partner with California in this effort.
Edison International is committed to be one of the most constructive agents of change in helping California meet its greenhouse gas objectives. I plan on talking in more detail on how we look to do this in my November 8 remarks at the Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference.
Let me next anticipate your questions on 2 topics we're asked about regularly; namely, the status of the SONGS settlement and the MHI arbitration. SCE continues to implement the settlement. We have reduced rates and refunded or will refund nearly $1.6 billion under the terms of the settlement. With respect to the pending appeals of the settlement decision, we can't predict when the CPUC will act. We continue to believe the settlement is lawful, fair and in the best interest of our customers. With respect to MHI, we remain hopeful that we will receive a decision later this year or early next year. Once we receive a decision from the International Chamber of Commerce panel, we will promptly disclose its key findings. In the spirit of transparency, SCE plans to make the actual decision public as soon as possible, though this will require agreement with MHI on what proprietary information must be kept confidential.
Should the arbitration outcome be favorable to the SONGS' owners, SCE will refund to customers under the SONGS settlement 50% of any proceeds that exceed legal expenses. SCE expects to use its share of any recoveries to pay down or reduce the use of short-term debt needed to help finance SCE's capital spending program.
I also want to comment on the CPUC proceeding examining the SCE customer outages in Long Beach in July 2015. You may recall that we had multiple underground volt fires and underground cable failures, which affected much of the downtown area and adjoining neighborhoods. The problem centered in a unique portion of SCE's distribution system that is arranged in a network configuration, similar to those used in dense urban areas like Manhattan. Most of our system has a radial design instead.
SCE has made a number of changes in our systems and management processes as a result of these outages. The CPUC proceeding will determine if fines are warranted and proposed penalty amounts, which could be significant, but we are not able to estimate these at this early stage of the proceeding. Hearings are scheduled for February of next year.
Turning briefly to our new business activities. We continue to develop energy advisory services and solutions for large commercial and industrial customers, which Edison Energy launched in March. Customer feedback has been quite encouraging, and our customers include a number of Fortune 1000 companies and a dozen of the Fortune 50. That said, we still have much work to do to flesh out a compelling value proposition that will grow this into a profitable business with meaningful scale.
We expect to complete evolving our initial business case into a detailed business plan with, importantly, near-term milestones that our board, management and our investors can use to measure our progress. I expect this to be able to provide you this detail, no later than the next 12 months.
We are continuing to refine the scope and strategy for all our competitive business initiatives. We will concentrate on those that will give us the best opportunities to capture additional value and scale from the technology changes that are transforming the nature of our industry. Our focus is on a capital light business model that maximizes the opportunity for value creation and complements our core SCE utility business. At the same time, the cost to develop these businesses continue. While we have reaffirmed our 2016 earnings guidance, we expect to bound to the costs of new business development for Edison Energy and provide additional detail in our guidance for 2017. I am committed to implementing our Edison Energy Group strategies at a pace that creates opportunities for meaningful growth, yet is disciplined and does not detract from Edison International's opportunity to deliver above industry average earnings and dividend growth and resulting value for investors.
I'll finish up with one last example of management continuity. A continued dividend growth opportunity in steps and overtime to continue a well-known phrase from prior earnings calls. Today, we are only at the low end of our target payout range of 45% to 55% of SCE earnings based on the midpoint of our earnings guidance. We want to continue to move well into the range, which means a dividend growth opportunity higher than our earnings growth. With the engagement and support of our employees, I expect we'll do great things together for our customers and our shareholders.
With that, let me turn things over to Maria."

It is a privilege and honor to be here, and I look forward to working with everyone in my new role. Now let's review the numbers. I plan following a format, similar to what we've been using in prior earnings calls, commenting on the financial results, our updated guidance, our capital plan and a few other financial topics. I will try not to repeat the numbers you can see on the presentation, but rather focus on the underlying trends and explanations.
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. As discussed in our prior investor calls this year, quarterly earnings comparisons are awkward due to the timing of last year's rate case decision. SCE reflected the proposed decision in the third quarter of last year. At that time, SCE recorded most, but not all, of the expected impacts of that proposed decision. Some of last year's third quarter impacts are related to the first half of 2015, so the third quarter comparisons are not perfectly aligned. Comparisons to the prior year are clearer in the year-to-date information. Also, SCE now operates under the tax accounting memorandum accounts or TAMA approved in the 2015 rate case decision. This has reduced the variability around taxes.
As we indicated on the last earnings call, SCE is doing better than our original earnings guidance. This is reflected in the updated guidance I will discuss shortly. Also, as expected, holding company costs are higher than our original guidance as we suggested last quarter. We continue to fine-tune the level of costs needed to successfully develop our new competitive businesses without undue drag on consolidated results. With that background, let's look specifically at third quarter results.
For SCE, the largest positive impact on revenue is the $0.13 per share benefit related to the timing of the GRC decision. Think of this as the amount that ideally would have been recorded in the first and second quarters of last year, if the GRC decision had been in effect all of 2015. The other positive drivers are revenue escalation for growth provided for in the 2015 rate case decision as well as the return on pole loading rate base. You will recall that the pole loading program is handled through a separate balancing account in the current rate case, and receives rate base treatment.
On the cost side, we are seeing the expected favorable earnings contribution from the operational improvement SCE has focused on for some time. Higher depreciation and financing costs reflect normal trends, supporting SCE's capital spending program. Income tax expense is higher on higher pretax income and lower income tax benefits on property-related items. Overall, SCE earnings increased $0.15 per share or 13% to $1.34 per share.
Let's turn to the Edison International holding company, which includes the costs for Edison Energy Group. Comparisons continue to reflect the absence of earnings from the affordable housing portfolio sold at the end of last year. We also see the higher levels of support for developing our new businesses along with the higher interest expense from churning out some of the holding company debt earlier this year. Core losses were $0.05 per share and $0.02 per share higher than last year. The increase in losses are driven equally by the absence of Edison Mission Group earnings and higher Edison Energy Group costs. Underlying holding company costs are generally comparable to last year's third quarter.
GAAP comparisons are also impacted by income of $0.13 per share from discontinued operations in the third quarter of last year with no impact on core earnings. This was related to updated estimates of tax benefits and insurance proceeds. So net-net, core earnings came in at $1.29 per share, 11% above last year.
Please turn to Page 3. Year-to-date results are a clear picture of underlying SCE performance as well as the holding company cost trends, which are relevant to our we reaffirmed core earnings guidance. The underlying drivers for SCE are similar for those for the quarter, other than the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions in the second quarter 2015 of $0.31 per share.
On a year-to-date basis, the timing of the 2015 GRC decision is no longer a significant factor and the earnings drivers do not include the $0.13 per share timing issue I mentioned earlier. The embedded escalation in revenues and the 2015 GRC decision and the return on pole loading rate base are the 2 key drivers. FERC revenue increases, mostly to fund higher O&M and capital, continue on a year-to-date basis. 
The principal cost drivers are generally consistent through the year. As noted earlier, depreciation and financing costs reflect the higher capital associated with SCE's capital spending program as well as the recovery of Coolwater-Lugo transmission project costs. Taxes were impacted by last year's change in uncertain tax benefits and the general trend of passing more tax benefits the customers through the tax memorandum accounts continues.
Turning to the EIX holding company. We have increased costs of $0.14 per share excluding noncore items. $0.09 of this variance related to 2 discrete items. The first component is $0.05 per share-related to the absence of the Edison Mission Group portfolio earnings this year. The second component is the second quarter buyout of an earn-out arrangement with former shareholders of a company acquired at the end of last year. This was $0.04 per share. Excluding these discrete items, there was $0.05 per share of higher costs, which breaks down to $0.01 per share at the holding company and $0.04 per share for Edison Energy Group.
In absolute terms, total year-to-date core costs are $0.23 per share, which reflects $0.11 per share each at the holding company and Edison Energy Group. There was also $0.01 of costs related to the residual Edison Mission Group asset. I will come back to this topic later when I talk about our updated guidance.
Please turn to Page 4. Today, we have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance at $3.91 per share. Last quarter, we indicated full year results should be in the top half of the guidance range, and we still see an opportunity to do that. We have narrowed the guidance range to plus or minus $0.05 per share, consistent with our recent practice. At the midpoint of our guidance, the outlook for SCE is $0.09 per share higher than our original 2016 guidance, and the EIX holding company is $0.09 per share less favorable.
For SCE, we see the improvement relating largely to higher operational cost savings and financing benefits, which have been more favorable than what we included in our initial guidance last February. The footnote recaps how guidance elements have changed. Also, please note that our guidance for SCE energy efficiency earnings is now $0.04 per share. This is based on updated estimates of benefits included in our September CPUC filing related to energy efficiency.
Our updated holding company guidance follows the accounting categories in the 10-Q with a focus on core results. The first category is normal holding company costs plus residual impact from what remains of Edison Mission Group. Corporate expenses and other costs are still trending at a little more than $0.01 a month per share, based on our year-to-date results. This is consistent with what we have suggested for some time. Our full year guidance for holding company costs is $0.15 per share compared to $0.12 recorded year-to-date. 
The second category reflects Edison Energy Group with full year guidance at a $0.12 per share loss. This is aligned with the $0.02 to $0.03 per share we are seeing in each quarter, or $0.07 per share so far this year, excluding the buyout of the earn-out provision. While we develop these businesses, we do expect continued losses early on.
Looking at overall holding company costs, including Edison Energy Group, we will be managing our near-term activities such that 2017 costs do not exceed 2016 guidance levels of $0.27 per share, consistent with Pedro's earlier point. When we provide 2017 earnings guidance, we plan to provide refined cost estimates for these businesses that reflect the balance between the value creation opportunity we see in the long-term and the earnings impact in the near-term.
Our guidance continues to exclude any recoveries related to the MHI arbitration. If we do receive any meaningful award, we will account for the recovery of legal and other costs incurred to obtain the award as core earnings. This is consistent with our core treatment of these costs over the last 3 years. While a portion of an award, depending upon the amount, will be treated as noncore, we did want to provide a view as to the core and noncore split, in the event an award is made. Net costs incurred and not recovered from MHI total $48 million or $0.09 per share.
Please turn to Page 5. I will touch on a few other key topics. The capital spending and rate base forecasts that we provided in our September 1 GRC presentation are included in the appendix of today's presentation. SCE continually assesses how best to optimize between new capital spending opportunities that may be identified and any changes in the schedules for existing projects or in overall capital spending. SCE continues to seek approval of the memorandum account to cover roughly $200 million of early stage grid modernization capital spending forecast in 2016 and '17. If approval is not granted by late this year or early next year, it could push out the time line for ramping up grid modernization spending under the 2018 GRC.
Transmission permitting and regulatory review remains challenging here and for utilities in other parts of the country. The $1.1 billion West of Devers project was approved by the CPUC in August, but that decision was appealed in September on environmental grounds. The approval decision stands pending appeal. Also, alternative designs have been proposed in the CPUC review of the $600 million Mesa substation project that would require significant reengineering. SCE and the California ISO continue to recommend the project. These permitting and approval challenges are increasingly typical of transmission planning and part of the process, although the need for these projects is not affected by the regulatory delays that impact initial timing.  Despite these challenges, we continue to see at least $4 billion in annual SCE capital spending and roughly $2 billion of annual rate base growth in 2017 and for the foreseeable future. With almost all of that investment in the wires side of the business, we believe it has lower investment opportunity risk as compared to utilities with a high percentage of growth tied to generation investment.
On other financial matters, SCE has a full settlement in place at the current capital structure and cost of capital, including an ROE of 10.45% for 2017. SCE's cost of capital trigger mechanism ended its last measurement period at 4.91%, just below the 5% midpoint. Under our settlement, the operation of the mechanism is suspended at this time. However, utility interest rate trends remain relevant, looking ahead to the next capital proceeding in April of next year. The moving average restarted October 1 at the spot rate of 4.26%, against what is a likely floor for long-term interest rates in the current rate environment.
SCE remains open to another settlement for a further extension. SCE's equity ratio for regulatory purposes remained strong at 50.4% as of September 30. SCE remains comfortable with its 48% equity capital structure and has no plans to recommend any changes in the equity ratio to the CPUC. While conservative, it helps provide the flexibility we need to support our dividend growth objective.
I want to touch briefly on financing strategy, if only to reaffirm our past statements. For SCE, we plan on funding our capital program with no new equity, relying on long-term debt and preferred stock financing as well as operating cash flow and, perhaps, short-term debt as needed. At the holding company, the principal financing need this quarter was for the last EME bondholder settlement payment of $214 million. EIX retained plenty of financial flexibility and overall financing needs remain modest at this time.
Finally, we plan on continuing our normal practice of providing 2017 earnings guidance when we report fourth quarter and full year financial results, tentatively scheduled for February 21 of next year.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Christy, please open the line for questions."

The numbers themselves are pretty immaterial relative to the overall Edison International structure. So I mean I think that kind of balance it for you. I don't know if it's an ironic thing [ph] to say."

But I think before we -- you're also getting to what's the nature of the business itself and what's more of a business model question. And that goes to providing a detailed business plan to our investors, which I mentioned in my comments, we expect to do no later than 12 months from now. So I think that will clarify our best thinking at that point and influenced by feedback we've been getting from customers over the last few months, thus thinking in terms of what is that model and what do we see as some of the key milestones and outlays over the years ahead."

I think what we said is we see a continued case supporting 4 -- at least $4 billion a year in CapEx. I think we've acknowledged in the past that assuming that, that continues, which we see that opportunity, that provides a floor for growth. And to the extent that we're investing at that, call it, $4 billion, $4 billion-ish level, as the denominator grows, the percent increase from the denominator starts tailoring down. That said, you saw in our General Rate Case application that the request that we provided, if we got the total request, which we don't expect we'll get 100% of that, but we think we've provided a very strong case, that rate case, for a request would take us to $4 billion to $5 billion, which would then be a step-up in that rate. So I guess the final point I'll make here is and as you think about it as a floor, but as we look at the California opportunity, that's a really interesting opportunity over certainly the decade ahead. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're still -- not just we as SCE, but we, the state, are still trying to get our arms around what SB 32 really mean. All right? What is the nature of that opportunity? When you have to reduce greenhouse gases by more than 40% from where we are today, that's going to work a fair amount of infrastructure. That -- early to say how much of that might be new infrastructure that translates into rate base, how much of that would be infrastructure that's done on the customer side or by other entities. It will certainly imply a good opportunity in terms of the usage of the grid. But I think net-net, when you look at SB 32, when you look at some of the other upsides around items like the storage item that Julien asked about earlier, we do see continued support for investing at, at least at floor $4 billion. And to the extent that we were only investing at that floor, then yes, you'd see the ratio ease off over time. So does that make sense?"

The other comment I'd make, though, is beyond just looking at what it means for SCE today, to benchmark itself against the folks who are in the top quartile already or even best-in-class, that versus where I think the whole industry, and frankly the whole economy has said it. Certainly over the decade ahead for us here, technology is going to be opening up some pretty powerful opportunities to reshape how a lot of American work is done. And I think even the folks who are best-in-class in our industry or in other industries, are going to see continued opportunities for improvement, whether it's back-office technologies or artificial intelligence or the impact of other hardware and software in various parts of our business, I just see that as a continuing opportunity for all of us in the industry and across the economy.

We are excited about the opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, we are sensitive and recognize that investors look at earnings in P/E. And as we develop that business plan that we'll share over the next 12 months, our goal is to make that as transparent as possible because we recognize that we have a responsibility here to explain the business case to investors and make it one that you all can get your arms around. In the specific case of Edison Energy, this is getting a little ahead of our ski tips here but just to provide a little bit of color, we view that as an energy as a service kind of business. The business that we have today basically have a number of customers, contracts that can span from 1 to several years. We'd expect it to be a book of business that we could describe to our investors and provide metrics around the texture of that portfolio, the tenure of it, what contract volumes or what years, measures of backlog, et cetera.

There are individual, special-purpose programs like a charge rating, which is going through a separate track. And so those are fairly independent. Perhaps, the one point of more interaction that's still being defined is around the whole topic of grid modernization. I think it's fair to say that in the beginning, when the commission first set up the distribution resource plan proceeding or DRP, that was intended to provide policy-level guidance that would then feed into the request of each utility in their General Rate Cases. We do have a unique situation with SCE's rate case in that just the timing of our rate case is such that we had to file a request before we have a final decision in the DRP proceeding. I believe the commission has recognized that. And so some interaction there, but in the meantime, we're very focused on providing the testimony and the high-quality testimony in the GRC proceedings.

That means 15% of that 40% has to come from the transportation area. And rough numbers suggest there are 10 million cars being taken off the road, which means several things: one, a massive increase in power generation, most likely on the renewables side; and two, massive transmission and distribution line expansion and massive infrastructure investments in electrical vehicle charging stations. Am I in the ballpark?"

And the reality is that the state is just starting to get its arms around how this all really will shakeout. And I'll tell you some of the interesting questions here are how much of this will be done by the state going to the kind of analysis that you just went through there and in allocating that out on a sector by sector basis, how much of it will be done by relying on more market forces and seeing how the markets brings out the best opportunities. So I'll probably stop short of commenting on your specific scenario there. But really, come back to the basic message which is no matter which way we cut it -- and we're doing our own homework on this right now as our various state agencies, but no matter which way we cut it, we see electrification of a lot of the economy being absolutely needed. Now, whether it's your quick math there in terms of the impact in transportation some of the other factors, whether it's different math, different proportions coming from different sectors, even within transportation, how much comes from passenger light-duty light vehicles, how much comes from heavier duty, lots of questions that the state needs to grapple with. But again, at any which way you cut it, it will require a fair amount of electrification and therefore really, cement the absolute necessity of having a strong and modern grid as a center of it all to move that power around. So that's the focus, and I think we will all be learning a lot over the course of the next 2 years here as we march our way to the state being able to meet the expectation of the law 14 years from now."

I want to thank Ted Craver and Jim Scilacci for all of their help in our transition over the summer. I also thank the many of you whom Ted and I had an opportunity to visit in September. While the main purpose of our visits was to share our key messages on continuity of leadership and continuity of strategy, I believe I benefited the most from the visits, as the dialogue helped me a great deal. I look forward to our continued discussion, and our team will strive hard to maintain our commitment to transparency and full engagement with our investors. 
In today's call, Maria will cover the financial results, so I will focus on the recent strategic developments at SCE and in California that will help shape Edison International's long-term growth.
I'll start with SCE's 2018 General Rate Case filed September 1. This filing demonstrates SCE's commitment to 3 key strategy elements: First, maintain a safe and reliable wireless network; second, be a key enabler of California's commitment to addressing climate change through significant greenhouse gas reduction led by our proposed grid modernization efforts to support widespread adoption of solar, storage, electric vehicle charging and other technologies; and finally, continue our operational excellence journey to achieve top-quartile performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and costs. We believe we have made a strong case for our strategy and for the requested funding levels in our rate case filing. Recently, CPUC President Picker and 2 administrative law judges were assigned to the case. President Picker is also leading the broader proceeding looking at distribution resource plans, which is addressing many of the policy and technical details of solar and other distributed energy resources. Having the same commissioner overseeing these 2 highly interrelated proceedings should prove very constructive. We are also hopeful that the comments President Picker made at the CPUC's June 23 meeting regarding the need for timelier General Rate Case decisions will set the tone for SCE's rate case. We will look to do our part.
Based on past practice, we should receive a proposed schedule shortly. Last week, SCE held the first of several GRC workshops, which was well attended, including by both of the assigned ALJs. We had lots of good questions and comments by various parties regarding both the traditional GRC elements as well as SCE's grid modernization proposals. The grid modernization efforts included in the GRC request will support California's implementation of Senate Bill 32 signed by Governor Brown on September 8. This legislation requires the state to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 in order to help address global climate change. California has led the way over the past decades with progressive policies across renewables, energy efficiency, vehicle fuel standards and cap and trade. According to the California Air Resources Board's most-recent report using 2014 data, these actions have all helped California achieve greenhouse gas emissions that are only 3% higher than 1990 levels, over a time period when California's population grew 30%. Keeping greenhouse gas emissions roughly constant over 24 years of population and economic growth was a remarkable achievement, thanks to the very hard work, yet our state is now legally committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 42% from current levels by 2030. That is only 14 years from now.
Grid modernization, which by the CPUC's estimate will be an ongoing effort into the middle part of the next decade, is a very significant part to the needed solution. We believe that California will have to move much more aggressively and sooner rather than later to meet these new legislative mandates within a short 14 years. Many of California's policies to date have focused on electric power. But generation, both in-state and from imports, represents only an estimated 20% of current statewide greenhouse gas emissions. The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions is the transportation sector, with an estimated 36% of current emissions. Industrial sources represent another 21%. We believe that significant new efforts across all sectors of the economy will be needed, and many of these efforts will require significant electrification of sectors that today rely on fossil fuels. We see ourselves as a key partner with California in this effort.
Edison International is committed to being one of the most constructive agents of change in helping California meet its greenhouse gas objectives. I plan on talking in more detail on how we look to do this in my November 8 remarks at the Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference.
Let me next anticipate your questions on 2 topics we're asked about regularly,  namely the status of the SONGS settlement and the MHI arbitration. SCE continues to implement the settlement. We have reduced rates and refunded or will refund nearly $1.6 billion under the terms of the settlement. With respect to the pending appeals of the settlement decision, we can't predict when the CPUC will act. We continue to believe the settlement is lawful, fair and in the best interest of our customers. With respect to MHI, we remain hopeful that we will receive a decision later this year or early next year. Once we receive a decision from the International Chamber of Commerce panel, we will promptly disclose its key findings. In the spirit of transparency, SCE plans to make the actual decision public as soon as possible, though this will require agreement with MHI on what proprietary information must be kept confidential.
Should the arbitration outcome be favorable to the SONGS' owners, SCE will refund to customers under the SONGS settlement 50% of any proceeds that exceed legal expenses. SCE expects to use its share of any recoveries to pay down or reduce the use of short-term debt needed to help finance SCE's capital spending program.
I also want to comment on the CPUC proceeding examining the SCE customer outages in Long Beach in July 2015. You may recall that we had multiple underground vault fires and underground cable failures, which affected much of the downtown area and adjoining neighborhoods. The problem centered in a unique portion of SCE's distribution system that is arranged in a network configuration, similar to those used in dense urban areas like Manhattan. Most of our system has a radial design instead.
SCE has made a number of changes in our systems and management processes as a result of these outages. The CPUC proceeding will determine if fines are warranted and proposed penalty amounts, which could be significant, but we are not able to estimate these at this early stage of the proceeding. Hearings are scheduled for February of next year.
Turning briefly to our new business activities. We continue to develop energy advisory services and solutions for large commercial and industrial customers, which Edison Energy launched in March. Customer feedback has been quite encouraging, and our customers include a number of Fortune 1000 companies and a dozen of the Fortune 50. That said, we still have much work to do to flesh out a compelling value proposition that will grow this into a profitable business with meaningful scale.
We expect to complete evolving our initial business case into a detailed business plan with, importantly, near-term milestones that our board, management and our investors can use to measure our progress. I expect us to be able to provide you this detail no later than the next 12 months.
We are continuing to refine the scope and strategy for all our competitive business initiatives. We will concentrate on those that will give us the best opportunities to capture additional value and scale from the technology changes that are transforming the nature of our industry. Our focus is on a capital-light business model that maximizes the opportunity for value creation and complements our core SCE utility business. At the same time, the cost to develop these businesses continue. While we have reaffirmed our 2016 earnings guidance, we expect to bound the costs of new business development for Edison Energy and provide additional detail in our guidance for 2017. I am committed to implementing our Edison Energy Group strategies at a pace that creates opportunities for meaningful growth yet is disciplined and does not detract from Edison International's opportunity to deliver above-industry average earnings and dividend growth and resulting value for investors.
I'll finish up with one last example of management continuity. A continued dividend growth opportunity in steps and over time, to continue a well-known phrase from prior earnings calls. Today, we are only at the low end of our target payout range of 45% to 55% of SCE earnings based on the midpoint of our earnings guidance. We want to continue to move well into the range, which means a dividend growth opportunity higher than our earnings growth. With the engagement and support of our employees, I expect we'll do great things together for our customers and our shareholders.
With that, let me turn things over to Maria."

It is a privilege and honor to be here, and I look forward to working with everyone in my new role. Now let's review the numbers. I plan on following a format similar to what we've been using in prior earnings calls, commenting on the financial results, our updated guidance, our capital plan and a few other financial topics. I will try not to repeat the numbers you can see on the presentation but rather focus on the underlying trends and explanations.
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. As discussed in our prior investor calls this year, quarterly earnings comparisons are awkward due to the timing of last year's rate case decision. SCE reflected the proposed decision in the third quarter of last year. At that time, SCE recorded most, but not all, of the expected impacts of that proposed decision. Some of last year's third quarter impacts related to the first half of 2015, so the third quarter comparisons are not perfectly aligned. Comparisons to the prior year are clearer in the year-to-date information. Also, SCE now operates under the tax accounting memorandum accounts or TAMA approved in the 2015 rate case decision. This has reduced the variability around taxes.
As we indicated on the last earnings call, SCE is doing better than our original earnings guidance. This is reflected in the updated guidance I will discuss shortly. Also, as expected, holding company costs are higher than our original guidance, as we suggested last quarter. We continue to fine-tune the level of costs needed to successfully develop our new competitive businesses without undue drag on consolidated results. With that background, let's look specifically at third quarter results.
For SCE, the largest positive impact on revenue is the $0.13 per share benefit related to the timing of the GRC decision. Think of this as the amount that ideally would have been recorded in the first and second quarters of last year if the GRC decision had been in effect all of 2015. The other positive drivers are revenue escalation for growth provided for in the 2015 rate case decision as well as the return on pole loading rate base. You will recall that the pole loading program is handled through a separate balancing account in the current rate case and receives rate base treatment.
On the cost side, we are seeing expected favorable earnings contribution from the operational improvement SCE has focused on for some time. Higher depreciation and financing costs reflect normal trends, supporting SCE's capital spending program. Income tax expense is higher on higher pretax income and lower income tax benefits on property-related items. Overall, SCE earnings increased $0.15 per share or 13% to $1.34 per share.
Let's turn to the Edison International holding company, which includes the costs for Edison Energy Group. Comparisons continue to reflect the absence of earnings from the affordable housing portfolio sold at the end of last year. We also see the higher levels of support for developing our new businesses along with the higher interest expense from churning out some of the holding company debt earlier this year. Core losses were $0.05 per share and $0.02 per share higher than last year. The increase in losses are driven equally by the absence of Edison Mission Group earnings and higher Edison Energy Group costs. Underlying holding company costs are generally comparable to last year's third quarter.
GAAP comparisons are also impacted by income of $0.13 per share from discontinued operations in the third quarter of last year, with no impact on core earnings. This was related to updated estimates and tax benefits and insurance proceeds. So net-net, core earnings came in at $1.29 per share, 11% above last year.
Please turn to Page 3. Year-to-date results are a clear picture of underlying SCE performance as well as the holding company cost trends, which are relevant to our we reaffirmed core earnings guidance. The underlying drivers for SCE are similar for those for the quarter, other than the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions in the second quarter 2015 of $0.31 per share.
On a year-to-date basis, the timing of the 2015 GRC decision is no longer a significant factor, and the earnings drivers do not include the $0.13 per share timing issue I mentioned earlier. The embedded escalation in revenues and the 2015 GRC decision and the return on pole-loading rate base are the 2 key drivers. FERC revenue increases, mostly to fund higher O&M and capital, continue on a year-to-date basis. 
The principal cost drivers are generally consistent through the year. As noted earlier, depreciation and financing costs reflect the higher capital associated with SCE's capital spending program as well as the recovery of Coolwater-Lugo transmission project costs. Taxes were impacted by last year's change in uncertain tax benefits and the general trend of passing more tax benefits to customers through the tax memorandum accounts continues.
Turning to the EIX holding company. We have increased costs of $0.14 per share excluding noncore items. $0.09 of this variance related to 2 discrete items. The first component is $0.05 per share related to the absence of the Edison Mission Group portfolio earnings this year. The second component is the second quarter buyout of an earn-out arrangement with former shareholders of a company acquired at the end of last year. This was $0.04 per share. Excluding these discrete items, there was $0.05 per share of higher costs, which breaks down to $0.01 per share at the holding company and $0.04 per share for Edison Energy Group.
In absolute terms, total year-to-date core costs are $0.23 per share, which reflects $0.11 per share each at the holding company and Edison Energy Group. There is also $0.01 of costs related to the residual Edison Mission Group asset. I will come back to this topic later when I talk about our updated guidance.
Please turn to Page 4. Today, we have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance at $3.91 per share. Last quarter, we indicated full year results should be in the top half of the guidance range, and we still see an opportunity to do that. We have narrowed the guidance range to plus or minus $0.05 per share, consistent with our recent practice. At the midpoint of our guidance, the outlook for SCE is $0.09 per share higher than our original 2016 guidance, and the EIX holding company is $0.09 per share less favorable.
For SCE, we see the improvement relating largely to higher operational cost savings and financing benefits, which have been more favorable than what we included in our initial guidance last February. The footnote recaps how guidance elements have changed. Also, please note that our guidance for SCE energy efficiency earnings is now $0.04 per share. This is based on updated estimates of benefits included in our September CPUC filing related to energy efficiency.
Our updated holding company guidance follows the accounting categories in the 10-Q, with a focus on core results. The first category is normal holding company costs plus residual impact from what remains of Edison Mission Group. Corporate expenses and other costs are still trending at a little more than $0.01 a month per share based on our year-to-date results. This is consistent with what we have suggested for some time. Our full year guidance for holding company costs is $0.15 per share compared to $0.12 recorded year-to-date. 
The second category reflects Edison Energy Group, with full year guidance at a $0.12 per share loss. This is aligned with the $0.02 to $0.03 per share we are seeing in each quarter or $0.07 per share so far this year, excluding the buyout of the earn-out provision. While we develop these businesses, we do expect continued losses early on.
Looking at overall holding company costs, including Edison Energy Group, we will be managing our near-term activities such that 2017 costs do not exceed 2016 guidance levels of $0.27 per share, consistent with Pedro's earlier point. When we provide 2017 earnings guidance, we plan to provide refined cost estimates for these businesses that reflect the balance between the value-creation opportunity we see in the long-term and the earnings impact in the near term.
Our guidance continues to exclude any recoveries related to the MHI arbitration. If we do receive any meaningful award, we will account for the recovery of legal and other costs incurred to obtain the award as core earnings. This is consistent with our core treatment of these costs over the last 3 years. While a portion of an award, depending upon the amount, will be treated as noncore, we did want to provide a view as to the core and noncore split in the event an award is made. Net costs incurred and not recovered from MHI total $48 million or $0.09 per share.
Please turn to Page 5. I will touch on a few other key topics. The capital spending and rate base forecasts that we provided in our September 1 GRC presentation are included in the appendix of today's presentation. SCE continually assesses how best to optimize between new capital spending opportunities that may be identified and any changes in the schedules for existing projects or in overall capital spending. SCE continues to seek approval of the memorandum account to cover roughly $200 million of early-stage grid modernization capital spending forecast in 2016 and '17. If approval is not granted by late this year or early next year, it could push out the timeline for ramping up grid modernization spending under the 2018 GRC.
Transmission permitting and regulatory review remains challenging here and for utilities in other parts of the country. The $1.1 billion West of Devers project was approved by the CPUC in August, but that decision was appealed in September on environmental grounds. The approval decision stands pending appeal. Also, alternative designs have been proposed in the CPUC review of the $600 million Mesa substation project that would require significant reengineering. SCE and the California ISO continue to recommend the project. These permitting and approval challenges are increasingly typical of transmission planning and part of the process, although the need for these projects is not affected by the regulatory delays that impact initial timing.  Despite these challenges, we continue to see at least $4 billion in annual SCE capital spending and roughly $2 billion of annual rate base growth in 2017 and for the foreseeable future. With almost all of that investment in the wires side of the business, we believe it has lowered investment opportunity risk as compared to utilities with a high percentage of growth tied to generation investment.
On other financial matters, SCE has a full settlement in place at the current capital structure and cost of capital, including an ROE of 10.45% for 2017. SCE's cost of capital trigger mechanism ended its last measurement period at 4.91%, just below the 5% midpoint. Under our settlement, the operation of the mechanism is suspended at this time. However, utility interest rate trends remain relevant, looking ahead to the next cost and capital proceeding in April of next year. The moving average restarted October 1 at the spot rate of 4.26%, against what is a likely floor for long-term interest rates in the current rate environment.
SCE remains open to another settlement for a further extension. SCE's equity ratio for regulatory purposes remains strong at 50.4% as of September 30. SCE remains comfortable with its 48% equity capital structure and has no plans to recommend any changes in the equity ratio to the CPUC. While conservative, it helps provide the flexibility we need to support our dividend growth objective.
I want to touch briefly on financing strategy, if only to reaffirm our past statements. For SCE, we plan on funding our capital program with no new equity, relying on long-term debt and preferred stock financing as well as operating cash flow and, perhaps, short-term debt as needed. At the holding company, the principal financing need this quarter was for the last EME bondholder settlement payment of $214 million. EIX retains plenty of financial flexibility, and overall financing needs remain modest at this time.
Finally, we plan on continuing our normal practice of providing 2017 earnings guidance when we report fourth quarter and full year financial results, tentatively scheduled for February 21 of next year.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Christy, please open the line for questions."

That said, you saw in our General Rate Case application that the request that we provided, if we got the total request, which we don't expect we'll get 100% of that, but we think we've provided a very strong case that rate case full request would take us on to $5 billion, which would then be a step-up in that rate. So I guess the final point I'll make here is -- and as you think about it as a floor, but as we look at the California opportunity, that's a really interesting opportunity over certainly the decade ahead. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're still -- not just we as SCE, but we the State, are still trying to get our arms around what SB 32 really mean. All right? What is the nature of that opportunity? When you have to reduce greenhouse gases by more than 40% from where we are today, that's going to require a fair amount of infrastructure. Now that -- early to say how much of that might be new infrastructure that translates into rate base, how much of that would be infrastructure that's done on the customer side or by other entities. It will certainly imply a good opportunity in terms of the usage of the grid. But I think net-net, when you look at SB 32, when you look at some of the other upsides around items like the storage item that Julien asked about earlier, we do see continued support for investing at, at least that floor of $4 billion. And to the extent that we were only investing at that floor, then yes, you'd see the ratio ease off over time. So does that make sense?"

Certainly over the decade ahead for us here, technology is going to be opening up some pretty powerful opportunities to reshape how a lot of American work is done. And I think even the folks who are best in class in our industry or in other industries are going to see continued opportunities for improvement, whether it's back-office technologies or artificial intelligence or the impact of other hardware and software in various parts of our business, I just see that as a continuing opportunity for all of us in the industry and across the economy.

As I mentioned earlier, we are sensitive, recognize that investors look at earnings in P/E. And as we develop that business plan that we'll share over the next 12 months, our goal is to make that as transparent as possible because we recognize that we have a responsibility here to explain the business case to investors and make it one that you all can get your arms around.

The business that we have today basically have a number of customers, contracts that can span from 1 to several years. We'd expect it to be a book of business that we could describe to our investors and provide metrics around the texture of that portfolio, the tenure of it, what contract volumes over what years, measures of backlog, et cetera. But at the end of the day, we would hope would and would expect it would provide some good level of confidence around continuing cash flow streams, continuing earning streams.

Perhaps, the one point of more interaction that's still being defined is around the whole topic of grid modernization. I think it's fair to say that in the beginning when the commission first set up the distribution resource plan proceeding or DRP that was intended to provide policy-level guidance that would then feed into the request of each utility in their General Rate Cases. We do have a unique situation with SCE's rate case in just the timing of our rate case is such that we had to file a request before we have a final decision in the DRP proceeding.

That means 15% of that 40% has to come from the transportation area.

But again, any which way you cut it, it will require a fair amount of electrification and therefore really cement the absolute necessity of having a strong and modern grid as the center of it all to move that power around. So that's the focus, and I think we will all be learning a lot over the course of the next 2 years here as we march our way to the state being able to meet the expectation of the law 14 years from now."

I want to thank Ted Craver and Jim Scilacci for all of their help in our transition over the summer. I also thank the many of you whom Ted and I had an opportunity to visit in September. While the main purpose of our visits was to share our key messages on continuity of leadership and continuity of strategy, I believe I benefited the most from the visits, as the dialogue helped me a great deal. I look forward to our continued discussion, and our team will strive hard to maintain our commitment to transparency and full engagement with our investors. 
In today's call, Maria will cover the financial results, so I will focus on the recent strategic developments at SCE and in California that will help shape Edison International's long-term growth.
I'll start with SCE's 2018 General Rate Case filed September 1. This filing demonstrates SCE's commitment to 3 key strategy elements: First, maintain a safe and reliable wireless network; second, be a key enabler of California's commitment to addressing climate change through significant greenhouse gas reduction led by our proposed grid modernization efforts to support widespread adoption of solar, storage, electric vehicle charging and other technologies; and finally, continue our operational excellence journey to achieve top-quartile performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and costs. We believe we have made a strong case for our strategy and for the requested funding levels in our rate case filing. Recently, CPUC President Picker and 2 administrative law judges were assigned to the case. President Picker is also leading the broader proceeding looking at distribution resource plans, which is addressing many of the policy and technical details of solar and other distributed energy resources. Having the same commissioner overseeing these 2 highly interrelated proceedings should prove very constructive. We are also hopeful that the comments President Picker made at the CPUC's June 23 meeting regarding the need for timelier General Rate Case decisions will set the tone for SCE's rate case. We will look to do our part.
Based on past practice, we should receive a proposed schedule shortly. Last week, SCE held the first of several GRC workshops, which was well attended, including by both of the assigned ALJs. We had lots of good questions and comments by various parties regarding both the traditional GRC elements as well as SCE's grid modernization proposals. The grid modernization efforts included in the GRC request will support California's implementation of Senate Bill 32 signed by Governor Brown on September 8. This legislation requires the state to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 in order to help address global climate change. California has led the way over the past decades with progressive policies across renewables, energy efficiency, vehicle fuel standards and cap and trade. According to the California Air Resources Board's most recent report using 2014 data, these actions have all helped California achieve greenhouse gas emissions that are only 3% higher than 1990 levels, over a time period when California's population grew 30%. Keeping greenhouse gas emissions roughly constant over 24 years of population and economic growth was a remarkable achievement, thanks to the very hard work, yet our state is now legally committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 42% from current levels by 2030. That is only 14 years from now.
Grid modernization, which by the CPUC's estimate will be an ongoing effort into the middle part of the next decade, is a very significant part to the needed solution. We believe that California will have to move much more aggressively and sooner rather than later to meet these new legislative mandates within a short 14 years. Many of California's policies to date have focused on electric power. But generation, both in-state and from imports, represents only an estimated 20% of current statewide greenhouse gas emissions. The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions is the transportation sector, with an estimated 36% of current emissions. Industrial sources represent another 21%. We believe that significant new efforts across all sectors of the economy will be needed, and many of these efforts will require significant electrification of sectors that today rely on fossil fuels. We see ourselves as a key partner with California in this effort.
Edison International is committed to being one of the most constructive agents of change in helping California meet its greenhouse gas objectives. I plan on talking in more detail on how we look to do this in my November 8 remarks at the Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference.
Let me next anticipate your questions on 2 topics we're asked about regularly,  namely the status of the SONGS settlement and the MHI arbitration. SCE continues to implement the settlement. We have reduced rates and refunded or will refund nearly $1.6 billion under the terms of the settlement. With respect to the pending appeals of the settlement decision, we can't predict when the CPUC will act. We continue to believe the settlement is lawful, fair and in the best interest of our customers. With respect to MHI, we remain hopeful that we will receive a decision later this year or early next year. Once we receive a decision from the International Chamber of Commerce panel, we will promptly disclose its key findings. In the spirit of transparency, SCE plans to make the actual decision public as soon as possible, though this will require agreement with MHI on what proprietary information must be kept confidential.
Should the arbitration outcome be favorable to the SONGS' owners, SCE will refund to customers under the SONGS settlement 50% of any proceeds that exceed legal expenses. SCE expects to use its share of any recoveries to pay down or reduce the use of short-term debt needed to help finance SCE's capital spending program.
I also want to comment on the CPUC proceeding examining the SCE customer outages in Long Beach in July 2015. You may recall that we had multiple underground vault fires and underground cable failures, which affected much of the downtown area and adjoining neighborhoods. The problem centered in a unique portion of SCE's distribution system that is arranged in a network configuration, similar to those used in dense urban areas like Manhattan. Most of our system has a radial design instead.
SCE has made a number of changes in our systems and management processes as a result of these outages. The CPUC proceeding will determine if fines are warranted and proposed penalty amounts, which could be significant, but we are not able to estimate these at this early stage of the proceeding. Hearings are scheduled for February of next year.
Turning briefly to our new business activities. We continue to develop energy advisory services and solutions for large commercial and industrial customers, which Edison Energy launched in March. Customer feedback has been quite encouraging, and our customers include a number of Fortune 1000 companies and a dozen of the Fortune 50. That said, we still have much work to do to flesh out a compelling value proposition that will grow this into a profitable business with meaningful scale.
We expect to complete evolving our initial business case into a detailed business plan with, importantly, near-term milestones that our board, management and our investors can use to measure our progress. I expect us to be able to provide you this detail no later than the next 12 months.
We are continuing to refine the scope and strategy for all our competitive business initiatives. We will concentrate on those that will give us the best opportunities to capture additional value and scale from the technology changes that are transforming the nature of our industry. Our focus is on a capital-light business model that maximizes the opportunity for value creation and complements our core SCE utility business. At the same time, the cost to develop these businesses continue. While we have reaffirmed our 2016 earnings guidance, we expect to bound the costs of new business development for Edison Energy and provide additional detail in our guidance for 2017. I am committed to implementing our Edison Energy Group strategies at a pace that creates opportunities for meaningful growth yet is disciplined and does not detract from Edison International's opportunity to deliver above-industry average earnings and dividend growth and resulting value for investors.
I'll finish up with one last example of management continuity. A continued dividend growth opportunity in steps and over time, to continue a well-known phrase from prior earnings calls. Today, we are only at the low end of our target payout range of 45% to 55% of SCE earnings based on the midpoint of our earnings guidance. We want to continue to move well into the range, which means a dividend growth opportunity higher than our earnings growth. With the engagement and support of our employees, I expect we'll do great things together for our customers and our shareholders.
With that, let me turn things over to Maria."

It is a privilege and honor to be here, and I look forward to working with everyone in my new role. Now let's review the numbers. I plan on following a format similar to what we've been using in prior earnings calls, commenting on the financial results, our updated guidance, our capital plan and a few other financial topics. I will try not to repeat the numbers you can see on the presentation but rather focus on the underlying trends and explanations.
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. As discussed in our prior investor calls this year, quarterly earnings comparisons are awkward due to the timing of last year's rate case decision. SCE reflected the proposed decision in the third quarter of last year. At that time, SCE recorded most, but not all, of the expected impacts of that proposed decision. Some of last year's third quarter impacts related to the first half of 2015, so the third quarter comparisons are not perfectly aligned. Comparisons to the prior year are clearer in the year-to-date information. Also, SCE now operates under the tax accounting memorandum accounts or TAMA approved in the 2015 rate case decision. This has reduced the variability around taxes.
As we indicated on the last earnings call, SCE is doing better than our original earnings guidance. This is reflected in the updated guidance I will discuss shortly. Also, as expected, holding company costs are higher than our original guidance, as we suggested last quarter. We continue to fine-tune the level of costs needed to successfully develop our new competitive businesses without undue drag on consolidated results. With that background, let's look specifically at third quarter results.
For SCE, the largest positive impact on revenue is the $0.13 per share benefit related to the timing of the GRC decision. Think of this as the amount that ideally would have been recorded in the first and second quarters of last year if the GRC decision had been in effect all of 2015. The other positive drivers are revenue escalation for growth provided for in the 2015 rate case decision as well as the return on pole loading rate base. You will recall that the pole loading program is handled through a separate balancing account in the current rate case and receives rate base treatment.
On the cost side, we are seeing expected favorable earnings contribution from the operational improvement SCE has focused on for some time. Higher depreciation and financing costs reflect normal trends, supporting SCE's capital spending program. Income tax expense is higher on higher pretax income and lower income tax benefits on property-related items. Overall, SCE earnings increased $0.15 per share or 13% to $1.34 per share.
Let's turn to the Edison International holding company, which includes the costs for Edison Energy Group. Comparisons continue to reflect the absence of earnings from the affordable housing portfolio sold at the end of last year. We also see the higher levels of support for developing our new businesses along with the higher interest expense from churning out some of the holding company debt earlier this year. Core losses were $0.05 per share and $0.02 per share higher than last year. The increase in losses are driven equally by the absence of Edison Mission Group earnings and higher Edison Energy Group costs. Underlying holding company costs are generally comparable to last year's third quarter.
GAAP comparisons are also impacted by income of $0.13 per share from discontinued operations in the third quarter of last year, with no impact on core earnings. This was related to updated estimates and tax benefits and insurance proceeds. So net-net, core earnings came in at $1.29 per share, 11% above last year.
Please turn to Page 3. Year-to-date results are a clear picture of underlying SCE performance as well as the holding company cost trends, which are relevant to our we reaffirmed core earnings guidance. The underlying drivers for SCE are similar for those for the quarter, other than the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions in the second quarter 2015 of $0.31 per share.
On a year-to-date basis, the timing of the 2015 GRC decision is no longer a significant factor, and the earnings drivers do not include the $0.13 per share timing issue I mentioned earlier. The embedded escalation in revenues and the 2015 GRC decision and the return on pole-loading rate base are the 2 key drivers. FERC revenue increases, mostly to fund higher O&M and capital, continue on a year-to-date basis. 
The principal cost drivers are generally consistent through the year. As noted earlier, depreciation and financing costs reflect the higher capital associated with SCE's capital spending program as well as the recovery of Coolwater-Lugo transmission project costs. Taxes were impacted by last year's change in uncertain tax benefits and the general trend of passing more tax benefits to customers through the tax memorandum accounts continues.
Turning to the EIX holding company. We have increased costs of $0.14 per share excluding noncore items. $0.09 of this variance related to 2 discrete items. The first component is $0.05 per share related to the absence of the Edison Mission Group portfolio earnings this year. The second component is the second quarter buyout of an earn-out arrangement with former shareholders of a company acquired at the end of last year. This was $0.04 per share. Excluding these discrete items, there was $0.05 per share of higher costs, which breaks down to $0.01 per share at the holding company and $0.04 per share for Edison Energy Group.
In absolute terms, total year-to-date core costs are $0.23 per share, which reflects $0.11 per share each at the holding company and Edison Energy Group. There is also $0.01 of costs related to the residual Edison Mission Group asset. I will come back to this topic later when I talk about our updated guidance.
Please turn to Page 4. Today, we have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance at $3.91 per share. Last quarter, we indicated full year results should be in the top half of the guidance range, and we still see an opportunity to do that. We have narrowed the guidance range to plus or minus $0.05 per share, consistent with our recent practice. At the midpoint of our guidance, the outlook for SCE is $0.09 per share higher than our original 2016 guidance, and the EIX holding company is $0.09 per share less favorable.
For SCE, we see the improvement relating largely to higher operational cost savings and financing benefits, which have been more favorable than what we included in our initial guidance last February. The footnote recaps how guidance elements have changed. Also, please note that our guidance for SCE energy efficiency earnings is now $0.04 per share. This is based on updated estimates of benefits included in our September CPUC filing related to energy efficiency.
Our updated holding company guidance follows the accounting categories in the 10-Q, with a focus on core results. The first category is normal holding company costs plus residual impact from what remains of Edison Mission Group. Corporate expenses and other costs are still trending at a little more than $0.01 a month per share based on our year-to-date results. This is consistent with what we have suggested for some time. Our full year guidance for holding company costs is $0.15 per share compared to $0.12 recorded year-to-date. 
The second category reflects Edison Energy Group, with full year guidance at a $0.12 per share loss. This is aligned with the $0.02 to $0.03 per share we are seeing in each quarter or $0.07 per share so far this year, excluding the buyout of the earn-out provision. While we develop these businesses, we do expect continued losses early on.
Looking at overall holding company costs, including Edison Energy Group, we will be managing our near-term activities such that 2017 costs do not exceed 2016 guidance levels of $0.27 per share, consistent with Pedro's earlier point. When we provide 2017 earnings guidance, we plan to provide refined cost estimates for these businesses that reflect the balance between the value-creation opportunity we see in the long-term and the earnings impact in the near term.
Our guidance continues to exclude any recoveries related to the MHI arbitration. If we do receive any meaningful award, we will account for the recovery of legal and other costs incurred to obtain the award as core earnings. This is consistent with our core treatment of these costs over the last 3 years. While a portion of an award, depending upon the amount, will be treated as noncore, we did want to provide a view as to the core and noncore split in the event an award is made. Net costs incurred and not recovered from MHI total $48 million or $0.09 per share.
Please turn to Page 5. I will touch on a few other key topics. The capital spending and rate base forecasts that we provided in our September 1 GRC presentation are included in the appendix of today's presentation. SCE continually assesses how best to optimize between new capital spending opportunities that may be identified and any changes in the schedules for existing projects or in overall capital spending. SCE continues to seek approval of the memorandum account to cover roughly $200 million of early-stage grid modernization capital spending forecast in 2016 and '17. If approval is not granted by late this year or early next year, it could push out the timeline for ramping up grid modernization spending under the 2018 GRC.
Transmission permitting and regulatory review remains challenging here and for utilities in other parts of the country. The $1.1 billion West of Devers project was approved by the CPUC in August, but that decision was appealed in September on environmental grounds. The approval decision stands pending appeal. Also, alternative designs have been proposed in the CPUC review of the $600 million Mesa substation project that would require significant reengineering. SCE and the California ISO continue to recommend the project. These permitting and approval challenges are increasingly typical of transmission planning and part of the process, although the need for these projects is not affected by the regulatory delays that impact initial timing.  Despite these challenges, we continue to see at least $4 billion in annual SCE capital spending and roughly $2 billion of annual rate base growth in 2017 and for the foreseeable future. With almost all of that investment in the wires side of the business, we believe it has lowered investment opportunity risk as compared to utilities with a high percentage of growth tied to generation investment.
On other financial matters, SCE has a full settlement in place at the current capital structure and cost of capital, including an ROE of 10.45% for 2017. SCE's cost of capital trigger mechanism ended its last measurement period at 4.91%, just below the 5% midpoint. Under our settlement, the operation of the mechanism is suspended at this time. However, utility interest rate trends remain relevant, looking ahead to the next cost and capital proceeding in April of next year. The moving average restarted October 1 at the spot rate of 4.26%, against what is a likely floor for long-term interest rates in the current rate environment.
SCE remains open to another settlement for a further extension. SCE's equity ratio for regulatory purposes remains strong at 50.4% as of September 30. SCE remains comfortable with its 48% equity capital structure and has no plans to recommend any changes in the equity ratio to the CPUC. While conservative, it helps provide the flexibility we need to support our dividend growth objective.
I want to touch briefly on financing strategy, if only to reaffirm our past statements. For SCE, we plan on funding our capital program with no new equity, relying on long-term debt and preferred stock financing as well as operating cash flow and, perhaps, short-term debt as needed. At the holding company, the principal financing need this quarter was for the last EME bondholder settlement payment of $214 million. EIX retains plenty of financial flexibility, and overall financing needs remain modest at this time.
Finally, we plan on continuing our normal practice of providing 2017 earnings guidance when we report fourth quarter and full year financial results, tentatively scheduled for February 21 of next year.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Christy, please open the line for questions."

I think what we said is we see a continued case supporting 4 -- at least $4 billion a year in CapEx. I think we've acknowledged in the past that assuming that, that continues, which we see that opportunity, that provides a floor for growth. And to the extent that we're investing at that, call it, $4 billion, $4 billion-ish level, as the denominator grows, the percent increase from the denominator starts tailoring down. That said, you saw in our General Rate Case application that the request that we provided, if we got the total request, which we don't expect we'll get 100% of that, but we think we've provided a very strong case that rate case full request would take us on to $5 billion, which would then be a step-up in that rate. So I guess the final point I'll make here is -- and as you think about it as a floor, but as we look at the California opportunity, that's a really interesting opportunity over certainly the decade ahead. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're still -- not just we as SCE, but we the State, are still trying to get our arms around what SB 32 really mean. All right? What is the nature of that opportunity? When you have to reduce greenhouse gases by more than 40% from where we are today, that's going to require a fair amount of infrastructure. Now that -- early to say how much of that might be new infrastructure that translates into rate base, how much of that would be infrastructure that's done on the customer side or by other entities. It will certainly imply a good opportunity in terms of the usage of the grid. But I think net-net, when you look at SB 32, when you look at some of the other upsides around items like the storage item that Julien asked about earlier, we do see continued support for investing at, at least that floor of $4 billion. And to the extent that we were only investing at that floor, then yes, you'd see the ratio ease off over time. So does that make sense?"

In the specific case of Edison Energy, this is getting a little ahead of our ski tips here but just to provide a little bit of color, we view that as an energy as a service kind of business. The business that we have today basically have a number of customers, contracts that can span from 1 to several years. We'd expect it to be a book of business that we could describe to our investors and provide metrics around the texture of that portfolio, the tenure of it, what contract volumes over what years, measures of backlog, et cetera. But at the end of the day, we would hope would and would expect it would provide some good level of confidence around continuing cash flow streams, continuing earning streams.

Perhaps, the one point of more interaction that's still being defined is around the whole topic of grid modernization. I think it's fair to say that in the beginning when the commission first set up the distribution resource plan proceeding or DRP that was intended to provide policy-level guidance that would then feed into the request of each utility in their General Rate Cases. We do have a unique situation with SCE's rate case in just the timing of our rate case is such that we had to file a request before we have a final decision in the DRP proceeding. I believe the commission has recognized that. And so some interaction there, but in the meantime, we're very focused on providing the testimony and high-quality testimony in the GRC proceedings.

And I've come to a very interesting conclusion, which is that the opportunity for investments in the electric grid infrastructure around electric vehicles is stunningly high, meaning 20% greenhouse gas emissions from power plants has to get cut in half by law. So that's 10% of the 40%. Let's assume industrial has contributed another 10% out of the 40%, and commercial customers contribute 5%, maybe 10% max. That means 15% of that 40% has to come from the transportation area. And rough numbers suggest that 10 million cars being taken off the road, which means several things: one, a massive increase in power generation, most likely on the renewables side; and two, massive transmission and distribution line expansion and massive infrastructure investments in electrical vehicle charging stations.

So I'll probably stop short of commenting on your specific scenario there. But really, come back to the basic message, which is no matter which way we cut it -- and we're doing our own homework on this right now as our various state agencies, but no matter which way we cut it, we see electrification of a lot of the economy being absolutely needed. Now whether it's your quick math there in terms of the impact in transportation some of the effectors or whether it's different math, different proportions coming from different sectors, even within transportation, how much comes from passenger light-duty light vehicles, how much comes from heavier duty. I think it's -- lots of questions that the State needs to grapple with. But again, any which way you cut it, it will require a fair amount of electrification and therefore really cement the absolute necessity of having a strong and modern grid as the center of it all to move that power around. So that's the focus, and I think we will all be learning a lot over the course of the next 2 years here as we march our way to the state being able to meet the expectation of the law 14 years from now."
