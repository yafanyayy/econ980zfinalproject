Altria had yet another year of excellent business results and outstanding shareholder returns in 2015. We continue to deliver against our 2 long-term financial goals. First, Altria grew adjusted diluted earnings",1023,"Thanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Altria had yet another year of excellent business results and outstanding shareholder returns in 2015. We continue to deliver against our 2 long-term financial goals. First, Altria grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by nearly 9%, in line with our long-term growth objective. Second, Altria paid nearly $4.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders, consistent with our goal of paying out approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS. Also during the year, we raised our dividend per share by 8.7%, aligned with our goal to raise the dividend in line with adjusted diluted EPS growth. This was the 49th time we have raised the dividend in the last 46 years.
We also completed our $1 billion share repurchase program and announced a new $1 billion program that we expect to complete by the end of 2016. 
And Altria, SABMiller's largest shareholder, supported the approximately $107 billion business combination between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller, which will create the first truly global beer company. We strongly believe that the deal is in the best interest of our shareholders, offering a significant premium on our very large beer investment and continued participation in the global beer profitable on attractive terms. The size of the premium we capture will ultimately depend on final closing prices, exchange rates and any proration that might occur. But as an example, as of the date of the agreement in November, the terms of the partial share alternative represented an approximate 43% premium to SABMiller's share price on September 14, 2015.
For 2015, Altria delivered a total shareholder return of more than 23%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Food, Beverage & Tobacco Index. And as a reminder, our total shareholder return was 29% in 2013 and 35% in 2014.
So let's turn to the businesses that supported those results. Our core tobacco companies delivered on their objectives by growing income and strengthening their market leadership positions. The smokeable products segment had a very strong 2015 with double-digit income growth in Marlboro's fourth consecutive year of modest retail share growth, in line with its strategy. Adjusted OCI grew nearly 11%, driven primarily by higher pricing, volume growth and the benefit of the federal tobacco quota buyout expiration. Fourth quarter adjusted OCI growth was more modest due primarily to trade inventory movements and lapping the end of the quota buyout payments. The segment also expanded adjusted OCI margins in both periods with full-year margins of more than 46%. Marlboro strengthened in 2015, gaining 2/10 of retail share in both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
In November, PM U.S.A. expanded distribution of Marlboro Midnight menthol nationally, offering adult menthol smokers a bold unique menthol flavor. While it's early, we expect Marlboro Midnight menthol to build on the very positive momentum we've seen from the Marlboro Black family, which now has grown for 20 consecutive quarters. 
Higher cigar shipment volume contributed to the smokable segment's performance in both periods. Middleton grew Black & Mild's volume by over 5% in the quarter and nearly 4% for the year, continuing to build on the brand's strength in the more profitable tip segment.
In our smokeless products segment, USSTC once again delivered on its strategy to increase income by growing volume and maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. Adjusted OCI grew more than 8% in the fourth quarter and nearly 5% for the full year. For the full year, higher pricing more than offset higher promotional spending and costs. Copenhagen and Skoal increased their combined retail share by 3/10 for the year. We are pleased with Copenhagen's continued strength, which grew nearly a full share point in 2015. Last year, Copenhagen was the fastest-growing smokeless brand in the category. And to build on this strength, USSTC is planning to expand Copenhagen Mint nationally later this quarter. Copenhagen Mint will be available at a popular price, and USSTC will support its expansion with a strong awareness and trial generating plan.
In innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continued building a portfolio of tobacco products using its strong internal capabilities and its partnership with Philip Morris International. In November, based on encouraging results from lead markets, Nu Mark continued its disciplined expansion of MarkTen XL e-vapor products to additional select retail chains. With respect to heat-not-burn products, we continue to support BMI as it prepares for a 2016 product application to the FDA for a Modified-Risk Tobacco Product designation, and we look forward to discussing more about our plans for U.S. commercialization at the appropriate time.
The wine business continued to perform well. Ste. Michelle grew OCI almost 4% in the fourth quarter and more than 13% for the year. Ste. Michelle's premium wines continue to be recognized as leaders in the industry, garnering more than 250 90-plus ratings in 2015, up nearly 4% from last year. 
So 2015 was an excellent year for our premium brands, our company and our shareholders.
Turning to 2016 and beyond, Altria is implementing a productivity initiative designed to maintain its operating company's leadership and cost competitiveness. This initiative is expected to deliver approximately $300 million in annual productivity savings by the end of 2017 and, as a result of reinvesting some of those savings, strength and our business capability. The savings will come from reduced spending on certain SG&A infrastructure and a leaner organization. Some of the productivity savings will be invested in important initiatives such as brand building, harm reduction and regulatory capabilities. Continually challenging our cost structure and investing in the future remain important for us as we focus on delivering strong results for the long term.
As to guidance. In 2016, Altria expects to deliver full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $3 to $3.05, representing growth of 7% to 9% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. This guidance does not include any impact from the proposed AB InBev and SABMiller business combination as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined.
And now I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance."

The smokable product segment increased adjusted OCI margins by 8 /10 of a percentage point in the fourth quarter to 44.7% due primarily to higher pricing. 
For the full year, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 2.3 points to 46.4% as higher pricing and the expiration of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments more than offset higher promotional spending and higher cost. 
PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume in the fourth quarter declined about 2.5% as elevated trade inventory levels at the end of the third quarter moderated in the fourth quarter. For the full year, PM U.S.A.'s reported cigarette shipment volume increased half of 1%. 
When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM U.S.A. estimates that shipment volume increased 0.5% in both the fourth quarter and for the full year.
PM U.S.A. estimates the total industry cigarette volume was essentially unchanged in the fourth quarter and decreased by 0.5% for the full year. 
In addition to retail share gains on Marlboro, L&M discount gain share allowing PM U.S.A.'s total retail share to reach 51.4% in the quarter and 51.3% for 2013. 
In the smokeless product segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI margins expanded 1.4 percentage points to 61.4%, driven by higher pricing, partially offset by higher promotional investments. For the year, adjusted OCI margins expanded 3/10 of a percentage point to 63.7% as higher pricing more than offset higher promotional investments and higher costs. 
The smokeless segment's reported shipments increased 4% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for 2015. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its volume grew 3% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year, while estimated smokeless industry volume grew 2.5% for the past 6 months. 
For both time periods, Copenhagen volume growth was partially offset by declines for Skoal and other brands. 
In wine, OCI margins narrowed by 8/10 of a percentage point to 24.8% in the fourth quarter but expanded by 1.2 percentage points to 22.8% for the year. Reported shipment volumes grew 5.% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the year.
Altria reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $211 million in the fourth quarter and $757 million for the year. Unfavorable foreign currency and special items were the primary drivers of the full year 2015 decline. 
In addition to the EPS guidance Marty provided for next year, we expect our full year 2016  effective tax rate on operations to be 35.3%. Additionally, we forecast capital expenditures to be in the range of $140 million to $180 million.

If you have opportunities to improve in your infrastructure or to improve your organization and to invest those savings in your brands or in your products for the future or in the way you can go to the market, you should do that. And I think it's one of the reasons, Matt, that Altria has been successful over decades. And while these programs are never easy to accomplish, that's how you grow over time. And when you see Altria's growth over time, it's because we do these programs often from strength, and that is the case today. Our business is strong, but we believe we should invest in several of these initiatives now and that's the reason."

Altria had yet another year of excellent business results and outstanding shareholder returns in 2015. We continue to deliver against our 2 long-term financial goals. First, Altria grew adjusted diluted earnings",1023,"Thanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Altria had yet another year of excellent business results and outstanding shareholder returns in 2015. We continue to deliver against our 2 long-term financial goals. First, Altria grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by nearly 9%, in line with our long-term growth objective. Second, Altria paid nearly $4.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders, consistent with our goal of paying out approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS. Also during the year, we raised our dividend per share by 8.7%, aligned with our goal to raise the dividend in line with adjusted diluted EPS growth. This was the 49th time we have raised the dividend in the last 46 years.
We also completed our $1 billion share repurchase program and announced a new $1 billion program that we expect to complete by the end of 2016. 
And Altria, SABMiller's largest shareholder, supported the approximately $107 billion business combination between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller, which will create the first truly global beer company. We strongly believe that the deal is in the best interest of our shareholders, offering a significant premium on our very large beer investment and continued participation in the global beer profit pool on attractive terms. The size of the premium we capture will ultimately depend on final closing prices, exchange rates and any proration that might occur. But as an example, as of the date of the agreement in November, the terms of the partial share alternative represented an approximate 43% premium to SABMiller's share price on September 14, 2015.
For 2015, Altria delivered a total shareholder return of more than 23%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Food, Beverage & Tobacco Index. And as a reminder, our total shareholder return was 29% in 2013 and 35% in 2014.
So let's turn to the businesses that supported those results. Our core tobacco companies delivered on their objectives by growing income and strengthening their market leadership positions. The smokeable products segment had a very strong 2015, with double-digit income growth in Marlboro's fourth consecutive year of modest retail share growth, in line with its strategy. Adjusted OCI grew nearly 11%, driven primarily by higher pricing, volume growth and the benefit of the federal tobacco quota buyout expiration. Fourth quarter adjusted OCI growth was more modest due primarily to trade inventory movements and lapping the end of the quota buyout payments. The segment also expanded adjusted OCI margins in both periods, with full year margins of more than 46%. Marlboro strengthened in 2015, gaining 2/10 of retail share in both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
In November, PM USA expanded distribution of Marlboro Midnight menthol nationally, offering adult menthol smokers a bold unique menthol flavor. While it's early, we expect Marlboro Midnight menthol to build on the very positive momentum we've seen from the Marlboro Black family, which now has grown for 20 consecutive quarters. 
Higher cigar shipment volume contributed to the smokeable segment's performance in both periods. Middleton grew Black & Mild's volume by over 5% in the quarter and nearly 4% for the year, continuing to build on the brand's strength in the more profitable tipped segment.
In our smokeless products segment, USSTC once again delivered on its strategy to increase income by growing volume and maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. Adjusted OCI grew more than 8% in the fourth quarter and nearly 5% for the full year. For the full year, higher pricing more than offset higher promotional spending and costs. Copenhagen and Skoal increased their combined retail share by 3/10 for the year. We're pleased with Copenhagen's continued strength, which grew nearly a full share point in 2015. Last year, Copenhagen was the fastest-growing smokeless brand in the category. And to build on this strength, USSTC is planning to expand Copenhagen Mint nationally later this quarter. Copenhagen Mint will be available at a popular price, and USSTC will support its expansion with a strong awareness and trial generating plan.
In innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continued building a portfolio of tobacco products using its strong internal capabilities and its partnership with Philip Morris International. In November, based on encouraging results from lead markets, Nu Mark continued its disciplined expansion of MarkTen XL e-vapor products to additional select retail chains. With respect to heat-not-burn products, we continue to support PMI as it prepares for a 2016 product application to the FDA for a Modified-Risk Tobacco Product designation. And we look forward to discussing more about our plans for U.S. commercialization at the appropriate time.
The wine business continued to perform well. Ste. Michelle grew OCI almost 4% in the fourth quarter and more than 13% for the year. Ste. Michelle's premium wines continued to be recognized as leaders in the industry, garnering more than 250 90-plus ratings in 2015, up nearly 40% from last year. 
So 2015 was an excellent year for our premium brands, our company and our shareholders.
Turning to 2016 and beyond, Altria is implementing a productivity initiative designed to maintain its operating company's leadership and cost competitiveness. This initiative is expected to deliver approximately $300 million in annual productivity savings by the end of 2017 and, as a result of reinvesting some of those savings, strength our business capability. The savings will come from reduced spending on certain SG&A infrastructure and a leaner organization. Some of the productivity savings will be invested in important initiatives, such as brand building, harm reduction and regulatory capabilities. Continually challenging our cost structure and investing in the future remain important for us as we focus on delivering strong results for the long term.
As to guidance. In 2016, Altria expects to deliver full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $3 to $3.05, representing growth of 7% to 9% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. This guidance does not include any impact from the proposed AB InBev and SABMiller business combination, as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined.
And now I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance."

The smokeable products segment increased adjusted OCI margins by 8/10 of a percentage point in the fourth quarter to 44.7% due primarily to higher pricing. 
For the full year, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 2.3 points to 46.4%, as higher pricing and the expiration of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments more than offset higher promotional spending and higher cost. 
PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume in the fourth quarter declined about 2.5%, as elevated trade inventory levels at the end of the third quarter moderated in the fourth quarter. For the full year, PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume increased 0.5%. 
When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its shipment volume increased 0.5% in both the fourth quarter and for the full year.
PM USA estimates that total industry cigarette volume was essentially unchanged in the fourth quarter and decreased by 0.5% for the full year. 
In addition to retail share gains on Marlboro, L&M in discount gained share, allowing PM USA's total retail share to reach 51.4% in the quarter and 51.3% for 2013. 
In the smokeless products segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI margins expanded 1.4 percentage points to 61.4%, driven by higher pricing, partially offset by higher promotional investments. For the year, adjusted OCI margins expanded 3/10 of a percentage point to 63.7% as higher pricing more than offset higher promotional investments and higher costs. 
The smokeless segment's reported shipments increased 4% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for 2015. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its volume grew 3% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year, while estimated smokeless industry volume grew 2.5% for the past 6 months. 
For both time periods, Copenhagen volume growth was partially offset by declines for Skoal and other brands. 
In wine, OCI margins narrowed by 8/10 of a percentage point to 24.8% in the fourth quarter but expanded by 1.2 percentage points to 22.8% for the year. Reported shipment volumes grew 5.9% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the year.
Altria recorded -- reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $211 million in the fourth quarter and $757 million for the year. Unfavorable foreign currency and special items were the primary drivers of the full year 2015 decline. 
In addition to the EPS guidance Marty provided for next year, we expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate on operations to be 35.3%. Additionally, we forecast capital expenditures to be in the range of $140 million to $180 million.

If you look at the net pricing for the year, Judy, it's almost 5%, which is at the higher end of the historical range. I had occasion to go back and look at the 4-year average, it's about 4.25%. And so that works. We're always mindful of the price gap, and there is competition in the industry. So with that kind of net pricing realization and attention to cost management, growing some share and the diverse business platform we have, we think that's kind of the Altria story. And we like the way that's been played out over the last several years, where you've seen really consistent EPS growth at about 8% through thick and thin. And we think that's the model that we should stick with."

Marlboro is doing exactly what we want it to do. And if you look at Marlboro Black, it has just added a whole new dimension, for example, to the brand. It's staying relevant to the current cohort of adult tobacco consumers. It commands nice price premiums. So Marlboro is great, but we're just not going to break it out at that level. I hope you'll indulge me on that."

Our position to begin with is, of course, there should be minimum age laws and we were the company that went around and led the effort on that, to make sure that there were minimum age laws in place everywhere and that they were vigorously enforced. And we spent an awful lot of time and energy and resources on that, which is completely appropriate and we support that. We support the minimum age of 18. And if you look at the reference points, the overwhelming majority of the states use 18. The Master Settlement Agreement from the 1990s used 18. And when we passed the FDA bill, it was 18. And further, the FDA bill contemplated a process to study whether the age should be raised, and they gave that task to FDA. FDA is now doing that. And our view on that is they should let FDA do that job and send a report over to Congress, and then we can have an intelligent debate about whether the age should be raised or not. But this sort of ad hoc approach of a locality here or a state there doesn't seem to make good public policy sense to us. We believe in 18 and we also support the process that was in place from the statute to study the issue."

First, Altria grew adjusted diluted earnings per",1021,"Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Altria had yet another year of excellent business results and outstanding shareholder returns in 2015. We continue to deliver against our 2 long-term financial goals. First, Altria grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by nearly 9%, in line with our long-term growth objective. Second, Altria paid nearly $4.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders, consistent with our goal of paying out approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS. Also during the year, we raised our dividend per share by 8.7%, aligned with our goal to raise the dividend in line with adjusted diluted EPS growth. This was the 49th time we have raised the dividend in the last 46 years.
We also completed our $1 billion share repurchase program and announced a new $1 billion program that we expect to complete by the end of 2016. 
And Altria, SABMiller's largest shareholder, supported the approximately $107 billion business combination between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller, which will create the first truly global beer company. We strongly believe that the deal is in the best interest of our shareholders, offering a significant premium on our very large beer investment and continued participation in the global beer profit pool on attractive terms. The size of the premium we capture will ultimately depend on final closing prices, exchange rates and any proration that might occur. But as an example, as of the date of the agreement in November, the terms of the partial share alternative represented an approximate 43% premium to SABMiller's share price on September 14, 2015.
For 2015, Altria delivered a total shareholder return of more than 23%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Food, Beverage & Tobacco Index. And as a reminder, our total shareholder return was 29% in 2013 and 35% in 2014.
So let's turn to the businesses that supported those results. Our core tobacco companies delivered on their objectives by growing income and strengthening their market leadership positions. The smokeable products segment had a very strong 2015, with double-digit income growth and Marlboro's fourth consecutive year of modest retail share growth, in line with its strategy. Adjusted OCI grew nearly 11%, driven primarily by higher pricing, volume growth and the benefit of the federal tobacco quota buyout expiration. Fourth quarter adjusted OCI growth was more modest due primarily to trade inventory movements and lapping the end of the quota buyout payments. The segment also expanded adjusted OCI margins in both periods, with full year margins of more than 46%. Marlboro strengthened in 2015, gaining 2/10 of retail share in both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
In November, PM USA expanded distribution of Marlboro Midnight menthol nationally, offering adult menthol smokers a bold unique menthol flavor. While it's early, we expect Marlboro Midnight menthol to build on the very positive momentum we've seen from the Marlboro Black family, which now has grown for 20 consecutive quarters. 
Higher cigar shipment volume contributed to the smokeable segment's performance in both periods. Middleton grew Black & Mild's volume by over 5% in the quarter and nearly 4% for the year, continuing to build on the brand's strength in the more profitable tipped segment.
In our smokeless products segment, USSTC once again delivered on its strategy to increase income by growing volume and maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. Adjusted OCI grew more than 8% in the fourth quarter and nearly 5% for the full year. For the full year, higher pricing more than offset higher promotional spending and costs. Copenhagen and Skoal increased their combined retail share by 3/10 for the year. We're pleased with Copenhagen's continued strength, which grew nearly a full share point in 2015. Last year, Copenhagen was the fastest-growing smokeless brand in the category. And to build on this strength, USSTC is planning to expand Copenhagen Mint nationally later this quarter. Copenhagen Mint will be available at a popular price, and USSTC will support its expansion with a strong awareness and trial-generating plan.
In innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continued building a portfolio of tobacco products using its strong internal capabilities and its partnership with Philip Morris International. In November, based on encouraging results from lead markets, Nu Mark continued its disciplined expansion of MarkTen XL e-vapor products to additional select retail chains. With respect to heat-not-burn products, we continue to support PMI as it prepares for a 2016 product application to the FDA for a Modified-Risk Tobacco Product designation. And we look forward to discussing more about our plans for U.S. commercialization at the appropriate time.
The wine business continued to perform well. Ste. Michelle grew OCI almost 4% in the fourth quarter and more than 13% for the year. Ste. Michelle's premium wines continued to be recognized as leaders in the industry, garnering more than 250 90-plus ratings in 2015, up nearly 40% from last year. 
So 2015 was an excellent year for our premium brands, our company and our shareholders.
Turning to 2016 and beyond, Altria is implementing a productivity initiative designed to maintain its operating company's leadership and cost competitiveness. This initiative is expected to deliver approximately $300 million in annual productivity savings by the end of 2017 and, as a result of reinvesting some of those savings, strength our business capability. The savings will come from reduced spending on certain SG&A infrastructure and a leaner organization. Some of the productivity savings will be invested in important initiatives, such as brand building, harm reduction and regulatory capabilities. Continually challenging our cost structure and investing in the future remain important for us as we focus on delivering strong results for the long term.
As to guidance. In 2016, Altria expects to deliver full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $3 to $3.05, representing growth of 7% to 9% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. This guidance does not include any impact from the proposed AB InBev and SABMiller business combination, as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined.
And now I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance."

And good morning, everyone. I'll start with the smokeable products segment. The smokeable products segment increased adjusted OCI margins by 8/10 of a percentage point in the fourth quarter to 44.7% due primarily to higher pricing. 
For the full year, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 2.3 points to 46.4%, as higher pricing and the expiration of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments more than offset higher promotional spending and higher cost. 
PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume in the fourth quarter declined about 2.5%, as elevated trade inventory levels at the end of the third quarter moderated in the fourth quarter. For the full year, PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume increased 0.5%. 
When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates its shipment volume increased 0.5% in both the fourth quarter and for the full year.
PM USA estimates the total industry cigarette volume was essentially unchanged in the fourth quarter and decreased by 0.5% for the full year. 
In addition to retail share gains on Marlboro, L&M in the Discount gained share, allowing PM USA's total retail share to reach 51.4% in the quarter and 51.3% for 2013. 
In the smokeless products segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI margins expanded 1.4 percentage points to 61.4%, driven by higher pricing, partially offset by higher promotional investments. For the year, adjusted OCI margins expanded 3/10 of a percentage point to 63.7% as higher pricing more than offset higher promotional investments and higher costs. 
The smokeless segment's reported shipments increased 4% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for 2015. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its volume grew 3% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year, while estimated smokeless industry volume grew 2.5% for the past 6 months. 
For both time periods, Copenhagen volume growth was partially offset by declines for Skoal and other brands. 
In wine, OCI margins narrowed by 8/10 of a percentage point to 24.8% in the fourth quarter but expanded by 1.2 percentage points to 22.8% for the year. Reported shipment volumes grew 5.9% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the year.
Altria recorded -- reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $211 million in the fourth quarter and $757 million for the year. Unfavorable foreign currency and special items were the primary drivers of the full year 2015 decline. 
In addition to the EPS guidance Marty provided for next year, we expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate on operations to be 35.3%. Additionally, we forecast capital expenditures to be in the range of $140 million to $180 million.

And we spend an awful lot of time and energy and resources on that, which is completely appropriate, and we support that. We support the minimum age of 18. And if you look at the reference points, the overwhelming majority of the states use 18. The Master Settlement Agreement from the 1990s used 18. And when we passed the FDA bill, it was 18. And further, the FDA bill contemplated a process to study whether the age should be raised, and they gave that task to FDA. FDA is now doing that. And our view on that is they should let FDA do that job and send a report over to Congress, and then we can have an intelligent debate about whether the age should be raised or not. But this sort of ad hoc approach of a locality here or a state there doesn't seem to make good public policy sense to us. We believe in 18, and we also support the process that was in place from the statute to study the issue."

Altria had yet another year of excellent business results and outstanding shareholder returns in 2015. We continue to deliver against our 2 long-term financial goals. First, Altria grew adjusted diluted earnings per",1021,"Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Altria had yet another year of excellent business results and outstanding shareholder returns in 2015. We continue to deliver against our 2 long-term financial goals. First, Altria grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by nearly 9%, in line with our long-term growth objective. Second, Altria paid nearly $4.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders, consistent with our goal of paying out approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS. Also during the year, we raised our dividend per share by 8.7%, aligned with our goal to raise the dividend in line with adjusted diluted EPS growth. This was the 49th time we have raised the dividend in the last 46 years.
We also completed our $1 billion share repurchase program and announced a new $1 billion program that we expect to complete by the end of 2016. 
And Altria, SABMiller's largest shareholder, supported the approximately $107 billion business combination between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller, which will create the first truly global beer company. We strongly believe that the deal is in the best interest of our shareholders, offering a significant premium on our very large beer investment and continued participation in the global beer profit pool on attractive terms. The size of the premium we capture will ultimately depend on final closing prices, exchange rates and any proration that might occur. But as an example, as of the date of the agreement in November, the terms of the partial share alternative represented an approximate 43% premium to SABMiller's share price on September 14, 2015.
For 2015, Altria delivered a total shareholder return of more than 23%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Food, Beverage & Tobacco Index. And as a reminder, our total shareholder return was 29% in 2013 and 35% in 2014.
So let's turn to the businesses that supported those results. Our core tobacco companies delivered on their objectives by growing income and strengthening their market leadership positions. The smokeable products segment had a very strong 2015, with double-digit income growth and Marlboro's fourth consecutive year of modest retail share growth, in line with its strategy. Adjusted OCI grew nearly 11%, driven primarily by higher pricing, volume growth and the benefit of the federal tobacco quota buyout expiration. Fourth quarter adjusted OCI growth was more modest due primarily to trade inventory movements and lapping the end of the quota buyout payments. The segment also expanded adjusted OCI margins in both periods, with full year margins of more than 46%. Marlboro strengthened in 2015, gaining 2/10 of retail share in both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
In November, PM USA expanded distribution of Marlboro Midnight menthol nationally, offering adult menthol smokers a bold unique menthol flavor. While it's early, we expect Marlboro Midnight menthol to build on the very positive momentum we've seen from the Marlboro Black family, which now has grown for 20 consecutive quarters. 
Higher cigar shipment volume contributed to the smokeable segment's performance in both periods. Middleton grew Black & Mild's volume by over 5% in the quarter and nearly 4% for the year, continuing to build on the brand's strength in the more profitable tipped segment.
In our smokeless products segment, USSTC once again delivered on its strategy to increase income by growing volume and maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. Adjusted OCI grew more than 8% in the fourth quarter and nearly 5% for the full year. For the full year, higher pricing more than offset higher promotional spending and costs. Copenhagen and Skoal increased their combined retail share by 3/10 for the year. We're pleased with Copenhagen's continued strength, which grew nearly a full share point in 2015. Last year, Copenhagen was the fastest-growing smokeless brand in the category. And to build on this strength, USSTC is planning to expand Copenhagen Mint nationally later this quarter. Copenhagen Mint will be available at a popular price, and USSTC will support its expansion with a strong awareness and trial-generating plan.
In innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continued building a portfolio of tobacco products using its strong internal capabilities and its partnership with Philip Morris International. In November, based on encouraging results from lead markets, Nu Mark continued its disciplined expansion of MarkTen XL e-vapor products to additional select retail chains. With respect to heat-not-burn products, we continue to support PMI as it prepares for a 2016 product application to the FDA for a Modified-Risk Tobacco Product designation. And we look forward to discussing more about our plans for U.S. commercialization at the appropriate time.
The wine business continued to perform well. Ste. Michelle grew OCI almost 4% in the fourth quarter and more than 13% for the year. Ste. Michelle's premium wines continued to be recognized as leaders in the industry, garnering more than 250 90-plus ratings in 2015, up nearly 40% from last year. 
So 2015 was an excellent year for our premium brands, our company and our shareholders.
Turning to 2016 and beyond, Altria is implementing a productivity initiative designed to maintain its operating company's leadership and cost competitiveness. This initiative is expected to deliver approximately $300 million in annual productivity savings by the end of 2017 and, as a result of reinvesting some of those savings, strength our business capability. The savings will come from reduced spending on certain SG&A infrastructure and a leaner organization. Some of the productivity savings will be invested in important initiatives, such as brand building, harm reduction and regulatory capabilities. Continually challenging our cost structure and investing in the future remain important for us as we focus on delivering strong results for the long term.
As to guidance. In 2016, Altria expects to deliver full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $3 to $3.05, representing growth of 7% to 9% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. This guidance does not include any impact from the proposed AB InBev and SABMiller business combination, as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined.
And now I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance."

And good morning, everyone. I'll start with the smokeable products segment. The smokeable products segment increased adjusted OCI margins by 8/10 of a percentage point in the fourth quarter to 44.7% due primarily to higher pricing. 
For the full year, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 2.3 points to 46.4%, as higher pricing and the expiration of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments more than offset higher promotional spending and higher cost. 
PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume in the fourth quarter declined about 2.5%, as elevated trade inventory levels at the end of the third quarter moderated in the fourth quarter. For the full year, PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume increased 0.5%. 
When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates its shipment volume increased 0.5% in both the fourth quarter and for the full year.
PM USA estimates the total industry cigarette volume was essentially unchanged in the fourth quarter and decreased by 0.5% for the full year. 
In addition to retail share gains on Marlboro, L&M in the Discount gained share, allowing PM USA's total retail share to reach 51.4% in the quarter and 51.3% for 2013. 
In the smokeless products segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI margins expanded 1.4 percentage points to 61.4%, driven by higher pricing, partially offset by higher promotional investments. For the year, adjusted OCI margins expanded 3/10 of a percentage point to 63.7% as higher pricing more than offset higher promotional investments and higher costs. 
The smokeless segment's reported shipments increased 4% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for 2015. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its volume grew 3% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year, while estimated smokeless industry volume grew 2.5% for the past 6 months. 
For both time periods, Copenhagen volume growth was partially offset by declines for Skoal and other brands. 
In wine, OCI margins narrowed by 8/10 of a percentage point to 24.8% in the fourth quarter but expanded by 1.2 percentage points to 22.8% for the year. Reported shipment volumes grew 5.9% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the year.
Altria recorded -- reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $211 million in the fourth quarter and $757 million for the year. Unfavorable foreign currency and special items were the primary drivers of the full year 2015 decline. 
In addition to the EPS guidance Marty provided for next year, we expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate on operations to be 35.3%. Additionally, we forecast capital expenditures to be in the range of $140 million to $180 million.

They had said that they expected it to be in 2015. But of course, we're now in '16 and that hasn't happened. So I'm afraid I can't give you much more color than that. The process is a little opaque. I want to make sure I understand the question you had about retail. If you're asking about our product, MarkTen XL, and our lead markets, our retailers are very excited about that product. It's been selling very well, and it's got a good response. I couldn't quite tell if that's what you're asking about or if you're asking something more general."

Marlboro is doing exactly what we want it to do. And if you look at Marlboro Black, it has just added a whole new dimension, for example, to the brand.

And we spend an awful lot of time and energy and resources on that, which is completely appropriate, and we support that. We support the minimum age of 18. And if you look at the reference points, the overwhelming majority of the states use 18. The Master Settlement Agreement from the 1990s used 18. And when we passed the FDA bill, it was 18. And further, the FDA bill contemplated a process to study whether the age should be raised, and they gave that task to FDA. FDA is now doing that. And our view on that is they should let FDA do that job and send a report over to Congress, and then we can have an intelligent debate about whether the age should be raised or not. But this sort of ad hoc approach of a locality here or a state there doesn't seem to make good public policy sense to us. We believe in 18, and we also support the process that was in place from the statute to study the issue."

Altria is off to an excellent start in 2016, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 14.3%, despite a tough 2015 comparison. Both the smokable and smokeless product segments are robust, adjusted operating company income growth and expanded margins. Altria paid over $1.1 billion in dividends. So once again, our first quarter results illustrate the strength of our core tobacco businesses and our focus on execution. Here are the highlights from the quarter. The smokeable products segment continued its outstanding performance with contributions across the brand portfolio. In the quarter, adjusted operating companies income grew 9.2%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, higher volume and lower SG&A and manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher resolution expense. Cigarette industry volume declines were moderate in the quarter, supported by lower gas prices and employment and wage growth, which continue to benefit adult tobacco consumers. PM USA's volume did better than the industry decline rate due to modest share gains, though the growth was flattered a bit by an additional shipping date and trade inventory movements. 
For the quarter, PM USA's total retail share was 51.4%, up 0.3 percentage point. Marlboro's retail share remained at 44% and L&M gained share in discount. In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the more profitable tipped cigar segment continue to produce strong results. Middleton's volumes were up 8.3%. So we're very pleased with the smokeable segment's performance. PM USA's investments to maintain a vibrant Marlboro franchise and our long-term approach to the business continue to pay off.
Turning to the smokeless products segment. USSTC continues to execute against its strategies and had produced a strong quarter. Adjusted operating companies income grew 16.7%, driven by higher net pricing and higher volume, which benefited from the national expansion of Copenhagen Mint and modest overall share gains. Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined retail share by 0.5 share points. Once again, Copenhagen was both the fastest-growing smokeless brand and the largest, growing its retail share by 1.1 percentage points to 32.4%. 
In mid-March, USSTC expanded Copenhagen Mint nationally with a strong awareness and trial generating plan. Copenhagen Mint is rooted in Copenhagen's essence of authenticity, masculinity and craftsmanship and allows the brand to compete in all major smokeless flavor categories. Our sales force quickly than strong distribution and we're saving positive response from our trade partners.
In innovative tobacco products, Altria continues to invest in developing a leading portfolio of products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences. In eBay, Nu Mark continued to expand distribution of MarkTen XL as early marketplace results have been encouraging in lead markets. On the heated tobacco platform, our work with Philip Morris International on an FDA application for a Modified-Risk Tobacco Product claim remains on plan, and our teams are making excellent progress on branding and go-to-market strategies for the U.S.
Turning to beer. AB InBev and SABMiller report that they are targeting the second half of 2016 to obtain the necessary approvals needed to complete the transaction. We remain excited about the transaction and look forward to supporting the combination of these 2 great companies. Internally, our teams are preparing to transition our investment from SABMiller to the new combined entity. And we look forward to sharing more details about that at the appropriate time. 
In late January, Altria announced a $300 million productivity initiative designed to maintain its operating company's leadership and cost competitiveness. We've made significant progress on the program. In particular, we have completed the design and realignment of our organization. So in summary, we're off to a strong start. We're reaffirming our guidance for 2016 full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $3 to $3.05, representing growth of 7% to 9% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. 
As a reminder, this guidance does not include any impact from the proposed AB InBev and SABMiller business combination, as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined. Now I'll turn things over to Billy for more details on our performance."

As Marty mentioned, we saw great results across our tobacco businesses, led by our smokeable products segment. The smokeable products segment increase adjusted OCI margins by 1.7 percentage points in the first quarter to 48.1%, due primarily to higher net pricing, higher volume and lower SG&A and manufacturing cost, partially offset by higher resolution expense. For the quarter, PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume increased 1.2%. After adjusting for an extra shipping day, trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume decreased approximately 0.5%. PM USA estimates that total industry cigarette volumes decreased approximately 1% in the first quarter. In the smokeless products segment, adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.4 percentage points to 65.5%, driven principally by higher net pricing. 
For the quarter, USSTC reported shipments volume grew 7.8%. After adjusting for trade inventory changes, including Copenhagen Mint pipeline volume and other factors, USSTC estimates its smokeless volume increased approximately 3%. Both Copenhagen and Skoal grew volumes, which were partially offset by declines in other brands. USSTC estimates that smokeless industry volume grew at approximately 2.5% over the past 6 months. 
In wine, net revenues grew 8.2%, driven by solid volume growth of 8.1%. Volume growth was primarily driven by strong performance among its core premium brands and the timing of the early Easter holiday. Ste. Michelle's operating company income grew 3.7%, while segment margin contracted 0.9 percentage points to 20% due to increased costs. 
In beer, Altria reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $66 million, down from $134 million last year. This decrease is due to Altria's share of SABMiller pretax special items, primarily reflecting asset impairment charges. Finally, we continue to make returning cash to shareholders a priority, paying over $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing $168 million in shares. As of March 31, Altria had approximately $797 million remaining in the current $1 billion share repurchase program. We continue to expect to complete the program by the end of 2016. An important part of our strategies is to manage our strong balance sheet to deliver consistent financial performance. We're pleased to report that last month, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, both upgraded Altria's long-term corporate credit rating, 1 notch to A3 and A-, respectively, reflecting our solid balance sheet, strong business fundamentals and the leading market positions of our businesses.

That didn't make it through in New Jersey, and now there's another bill in Massachusetts this week. So I know it's difficult to predict how and whether these things actually go forward. But I'm just curious if you could give us a sense of what, if anything, you think the practical impact might be if 21-plus Law goes into effect in a state? Is there a tangible impact on volumes? And I guess, is there anything underlying, from a regulatory standpoint, that you think is contributing to this higher level of legislative momentum?"

What should be happening, I think, is that the FDA's stature should be observed. We're all in favor of minimum age where the company I pointed out that led efforts to get minimum age loss in place where they were. But the reference point has historically been 18. There are few differences in a few states. But if we look at the master settlement agreement of the FDA bill itself or other reference points, it's been 18. I think we can all remember that when the statute was passed by the FDA, what was supposed to happen with the question of been studied by FDA, a report filed with Congress and then you can have a debate about whether it should be raised or not. So that what should happen and we support the process as we supported the FDA bill. Unfortunately, what's happening is we have states and localities with all respect, that are not observing that approach. And so there are these efforts. And the efforts have taken a bit of an uptick to dimensionalize the volume and the population, I think the population of that cohort, say 18 to 20, is roughly, I don't know, call it, 3% of 4%, Matt. The volume estimate, I think, I've seen 1 published at about 2.5%. So that it seems that it all happens and it all comes in at once. So obviously the impacts would be more muted over time. I think the most important thing would be to encourage people to allow an informed debate based on science and evidence over at the Congress. And that's what our position is on."

The smokeless volumes and industry estimate is on a 6-month trailing basis. We estimate about 2.5%. That's actually relatively consistent with our estimate, I think, for the last 2 years if you look at it on an average basis.

It's modest share momentum overtime. And the quarter is not over time. I think when we were talking about several weeks ago, we'll look back and Marlboro's actually grown about 2 full share points if you look back in a period, call it, 2007, 2008 to date, which is terrific share performance for Brent as big as that. One way to look at a competitive environment is how PM USA did in the quarter. So just call out again a few of the highlights, it grew its income more than 9% over tough comp. It expanded its margins. It had net pricing realization in line with the long-term trends.

We want to have L&M participate in the declining discount segment that industry segment continues to decline as the premium effect in the category obtains. But L&M is doing a very good job there but we don't want to grow the discount category, and L&M is doing exactly that. I read with interest and listened to the reports about Director Zeller. I've seen his presentation. We continue to be encouraged and optimistic that the FDA will adopt the continuum of risk with respect to products. It's the right thing for consumers. I think it's the right public policy. And it should promote innovation. This is a category in which the FDA, in our opinion, should be promoting innovation to bring new products to smokers in particular. And I thought it was great the directors had went out and shared his views at the conference."

Altria is off to an excellent start in 2016, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 14.3% despite a tough 2015 comparison. Both the smokable and smokeless product segments are robust, adjusted operating companies income growth and expanded margins. Altria paid over $1.1 billion in dividends. So once again, our first quarter results illustrate the strength of our core tobacco businesses and our focus on execution. Here are the highlights from the quarter. 
The smokeable products segment continued its outstanding performance, with contributions across the brand portfolio. In the quarter, adjusted operating companies income grew 9.2%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, higher volume and lower SG&A and manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher resolution expense. 
Cigarette industry volume declines were moderate in the quarter, supported by lower gas prices and employment and wage growth, which continue to benefit adult tobacco consumers. PM USA's volume did even better than the industry decline rate due to modest share gains, though the growth was flattered a bit by an additional shipping day and trade inventory movements. 
For the quarter, PM USA's total retail share was 51.4%, up 0.3 percentage point. Marlboro's retail share remained at 44% and L&M gained share in discount. In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the more profitable tipped cigars segment continued to produce strong results. Middleton's volumes were up 8.3%. So we're very pleased with the smokeable segment's performance. PM USA's investments to maintain a vibrant Marlboro franchise and our long-term approach to the business continue to pay off.
Turning to the smokeless products segment. USSTC continues to execute against these strategies and that produced a strong quarter. Adjusted operating companies income grew 16.7%, driven by higher net pricing and higher volume, which benefited from the national expansion of Copenhagen Mint and modest overall share gains. Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined retail share by 0.5 share points. Once again, Copenhagen was both the fastest-growing smokeless brand and the largest, growing its retail share by 1.1 percentage points to 32.4%. 
In mid-March, USSTC expanded Copenhagen Mint nationally with a strong awareness and trial-generating plan. Copenhagen Mint is rooted in Copenhagen's essence of authenticity, masculinity and craftsmanship, and allows the brand to compete in all major smokeless flavor categories. Our sales force quickly gained strong distribution and we are receiving positive response from our trade partners.
In innovative tobacco products, Altria continues to invest in developing a leading portfolio of products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences. In e-vapor, Nu Mark continued to expand distribution of MarkTen XL as early marketplace results have been encouraging in lead markets. On the heated tobacco platform, our work with Philip Morris International on an FDA application for a Modified-Risk Tobacco Product claim remains on plan, and our teams are making excellent progress on branding and go-to-market strategies for the U.S.
Turning to beer. AB InBev and SABMiller report that they are targeting the second half of 2016 to obtain the necessary approvals needed to complete the transaction. We remain excited about the transaction and look forward to supporting the combination of these 2 great companies. Internally, our teams are preparing to transition our investment from SABMiller to the new combined entity, and we look forward to sharing more details about that at the appropriate time. 
In late January, Altria announced a $300 million productivity initiative designed to maintain its operating companies' leadership and cost competitiveness. We've made significant progress on the program. In particular, we have completed the design and realignment of our organization. So in summary, we're off to a strong start. We're reaffirming our guidance for 2016 full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $3 to $3.05, representing growth of 7% to 9% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. 
As a reminder, this guidance does not include any impact from the proposed AB InBev and SABMiller business combination, as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined. 
Now I'll turn things over to Billy for more details on our performance."

As Marty mentioned, we saw great results across our core tobacco businesses, led by our smokeable products segment. The smokeable products segment increased adjusted OCI margins by 1.7 percentage points in the first quarter to 48.1%, due primarily to higher net pricing, higher volume and lower SG&A and manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher resolution expense. For the quarter, PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume increased 1.2%. After adjusting for an extra shipping day, trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume decreased approximately 0.5%. PM USA estimates that total industry cigarette volumes decreased approximately 1% in the first quarter. In the smokeless products segment, adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.4 percentage points to 65.5%, driven principally by higher net pricing.
For the quarter, USSTC reported shipment volumes grew 7.8%. After adjusting for trade inventory changes, including Copenhagen Mint pipeline volume and other factors, USSTC estimates its smokeless volume increased approximately 3%. Both Copenhagen and Skoal grew volumes, which were partially offset by declines in other brands. USSTC estimates that smokeless industry volume grew at approximately 2.5% over the past 6 months. 
In wine, net revenues grew 8.2%, driven by solid volume growth of 8.1%. Volume growth was primarily driven by strong performance among its core premium brands and the timing of the early Easter holiday. Ste. Michelle's operating company income grew 3.7%, while segment margin contracted 0.9 percentage points to 20% due to increased costs. 
In beer, Altria reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $66 million, down from $134 million last year. This decrease is due to Altria's share of SABMiller pretax special items, primarily reflecting asset impairment charges. Finally, we continue to make returning cash to shareholders a priority, paying over $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing $168 million in shares. As of March 31, Altria had approximately $797 million remaining in the current $1 billion share repurchase program. We continue to expect to complete the program by the end of 2016. An important part of our strategy is to manage our strong balance sheet to deliver consistent financial performance. We are pleased to report that last month, Moody's and Standard & Poor's both upgraded Altria's long-term corporate credit rating, one notch to A3 and A-, respectively, reflecting our solid balance sheet, strong business fundamentals and the leading market positions of our businesses.

So I know it's difficult to predict how and whether these things actually go forward, but I'm just curious if you could give us a sense of what, if anything, you think the practical impact might be if a 21-plus law goes into effect in a state? Is there a tangible impact on volumes? And I guess, is there anything underlying, from a regulatory standpoint, that you think is contributing to this higher level of legislative momentum?"

What should be happening, I think, is that the FDA's statute should be observed. We're all in favor of minimum age. We're the company, I've pointed out, that led the efforts to get minimum ages -- age laws in place where they weren't. But the reference point has historically been 18. There are few differences in a few states, but if we look at the Master Settlement Agreement or the FDA bill itself or other reference points, it's been 18. I think we can all remember that when the statute was passed by FDA, what was supposed to happen was the question was supposed to have been studied by FDA, a report filed with Congress and then you could have a debate about whether it should be raised or not. And so that's what should happen, and we support that process as we supported the FDA bill. Unfortunately, what's happening is we have states and localities, with all respect, that are not observing that approach, and so there are these efforts. And the efforts have taken a bit of an uptick to dimensionalize the volume and the population. I think the population of that cohort, say 18 to 20, is roughly, I don't know, call it, 3% of 4%, Matt. The volume estimate, I think, that I've seen one published is about 2.5%. So that assumes that it all happens and it all comes in at once, so obviously the impacts would be more muted over time. But I think the most important thing would be to encourage people to allow an informed debate based on science and evidence over at the Congress, and that's what our position is on it."

And then in this quarter, Steve, what we've got is on an adjusted basis, down actually 0.5%. So it's obviously well below the historical trends of 3% to 4%. But actually, on a sequential basis in cigarettes, it's -- the decline has picked up a little bit, but just a little bit. I think that's the way we think about smokable. The smokeless volumes, our industry estimate is on a 6-month trailing basis. We estimate about 2.5%. That's actually relatively consistent with our estimate, I think, for the last 2 years if you look at it on an average basis. Our shipments were flattered a little bit, obviously, because we had the launch of Copenhagen Mint. So that's how we look at the volume. I guess what I would say is the volumes continue to be strong on both segments, and that's good for our business."

We're very proud of the teams that are doing the work on this. I think it's a terrific and a responsible way to connect with both our Marlboro smokers and competitive adult smokers. We're very pleased about how digital is going."

At a very high level, what I would say is, we have been the market leader for decades. There's a reason for that through thick and thin, which is we have very good people, we have the leading brands and the leading position. And so while we respect our competition, I assure you that our people are ready to compete in this new environment. We haven't seen anything that's markedly different there. With respect to Marlboro, I'm tempted, but I won't reprise the presentation the we've put out in CAGNY just a few months ago about all the many strengths of Marlboro. You're right, Judy. I mean, it's modest share momentum over time, and a quarter is not over time. I think when we were talking about this several weeks ago, we looked back, and Marlboro has actually grown about 2 full share points, if you look back in a period, call it, 2007, 2008 to date, which is terrific share performance for a brand that's as big as that. One way to look at the competitive environment is how PM USA did in the quarter. So just to call out again a few of the highlights, it grew its income more than 9% over a tough comp. It expanded its margins. It had net pricing realization in line with the long-term trends. So it's a terrific performance despite the fact that we have a transaction, and there are some new owner of new brands out there. I think that's how we'd look at it."

But we don't want to grow the discount category, and L&M is doing exactly that. I read with interest and listened to the reports about Director Zeller. I've seen his presentation. We continue to be encouraged and optimistic that the FDA will adopt the continuum of risk with respect to products. It's the right thing for consumers.

Altria is off to an excellent start in 2016, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 14.3% despite a tough 2015 comparison. Both the smokable and smokeless product segments are robust, adjusted operating companies income growth and expanded margins. Altria paid over $1.1 billion in dividends. So once again, our first quarter results illustrate the strength of our core tobacco businesses and our focus on execution. Here are the highlights from the quarter. 
The smokeable products segment continued its outstanding performance, with contributions across the brand portfolio. In the quarter, adjusted operating companies income grew 9.2%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, higher volume and lower SG&A and manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher resolution expense. 
Cigarette industry volume declines were moderate in the quarter, supported by lower gas prices and employment and wage growth, which continue to benefit adult tobacco consumers. PM USA's volume did even better than the industry decline rate due to modest share gains, though the growth was flattered a bit by an additional shipping day and trade inventory movements. 
For the quarter, PM USA's total retail share was 51.4%, up 0.3 percentage point. Marlboro's retail share remained at 44% and L&M gained share in discount. In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the more profitable tipped cigars segment continued to produce strong results. Middleton's volumes were up 8.3%. So we're very pleased with the smokeable segment's performance. PM USA's investments to maintain a vibrant Marlboro franchise and our long-term approach to the business continue to pay off.
Turning to the smokeless products segment. USSTC continues to execute against its strategies and that produced a strong quarter. Adjusted operating companies income grew 16.7%, driven by higher net pricing and higher volume, which benefited from the national expansion of Copenhagen Mint and modest overall share gains. Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined retail share by 0.5 share points. Once again, Copenhagen was both the fastest-growing smokeless brand and the largest, growing its retail share by 1.1 percentage points to 32.4%. 
In mid-March, USSTC expanded Copenhagen Mint nationally with a strong awareness and trial-generating plan. Copenhagen Mint is rooted in Copenhagen's essence of authenticity, masculinity and craftsmanship, and allows the brand to compete in all major smokeless flavor categories. Our sales force quickly gained strong distribution and we are receiving positive response from our trade partners.
In innovative tobacco products, Altria continues to invest in developing a leading portfolio of products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences. In e-vapor, Nu Mark continued to expand distribution of MarkTen XL as early marketplace results have been encouraging in lead markets. On the heated tobacco platform, our work with Philip Morris International on an FDA application for a Modified-Risk Tobacco Product claim remains on plan, and our teams are making excellent progress on branding and go-to-market strategies for the U.S.
Turning to beer. AB InBev and SABMiller report that they are targeting the second half of 2016 to obtain the necessary approvals needed to complete the transaction. We remain excited about the transaction and look forward to supporting the combination of these 2 great companies. Internally, our teams are preparing to transition our investment from SABMiller to the new combined entity, and we look forward to sharing more details about that at the appropriate time. 
In late January, Altria announced a $300 million productivity initiative designed to maintain its operating companies' leadership and cost competitiveness. We've made significant progress on the program. In particular, we have completed the design and realignment of our organization. So in summary, we're off to a strong start. We're reaffirming our guidance for 2016 full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $3 to $3.05, representing growth of 7% to 9% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80.

As Marty mentioned, we saw great results across our core tobacco businesses, led by our smokeable products segment. The smokeable products segment increased adjusted OCI margins by 1.7 percentage points in the first quarter to 48.1%, due primarily to higher net pricing, higher volume and lower SG&A and manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher resolution expense. For the quarter, PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume increased 1.2%. After adjusting for an extra shipping day, trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume decreased approximately 0.5%. PM USA estimates that total industry cigarette volumes decreased approximately 1% in the first quarter. In the smokeless products segment, adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.4 percentage points to 65.5%, driven principally by higher net pricing.
For the quarter, USSTC reported shipment volumes grew 7.8%. After adjusting for trade inventory changes, including Copenhagen Mint pipeline volume and other factors, USSTC estimates its smokeless volume increased approximately 3%. Both Copenhagen and Skoal grew volumes, which were partially offset by declines in other brands. USSTC estimates that smokeless industry volume grew at approximately 2.5% over the past 6 months. 
In wine, net revenues grew 8.2%, driven by solid volume growth of 8.1%. Volume growth was primarily driven by strong performance among its core premium brands and the timing of the early Easter holiday. Ste. Michelle's operating company income grew 3.7%, while segment margin contracted 0.9 percentage points to 20% due to increased costs. 
In beer, Altria reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $66 million, down from $134 million last year. This decrease is due to Altria's share of SABMiller pretax special items, primarily reflecting asset impairment charges. Finally, we continue to make returning cash to shareholders a priority, paying over $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing $168 million in shares. As of March 31, Altria had approximately $797 million remaining in the current $1 billion share repurchase program. We continue to expect to complete the program by the end of 2016. An important part of our strategy is to manage our strong balance sheet to deliver consistent financial performance. We are pleased to report that last month, Moody's and Standard & Poor's both upgraded Altria's long-term corporate credit rating, one notch to A3 and A-, respectively, reflecting our solid balance sheet, strong business fundamentals and the leading market positions of our businesses. 
That wraps up our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we posted a list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items. Operator, do we have any questions?"

What should be happening, I think, is that the FDA's statute should be observed. We're all in favor of minimum age. We're the company, I've pointed out, that led the efforts to get minimum ages -- age laws in place where they weren't. But the reference point has historically been 18. There are few differences in a few states, but if we look at the Master Settlement Agreement or the FDA bill itself or other reference points, it's been 18. I think we can all remember that when the statute was passed by FDA, what was supposed to happen was the question was supposed to have been studied by FDA, a report filed with Congress and then you could have a debate about whether it should be raised or not. And so that's what should happen, and we support that process as we supported the FDA bill. Unfortunately, what's happening is we have states and localities, with all respect, that are not observing that approach, and so there are these efforts. And the efforts have taken a bit of an uptick to dimensionalize the volume and the population. I think the population of that cohort, say 18 to 20, is roughly, I don't know, call it, 3% of 4%, Matt. The volume estimate, I think, that I've seen one published is about 2.5%. So that assumes that it all happens and it all comes in at once, so obviously the impacts would be more muted over time. But I think the most important thing would be to encourage people to allow an informed debate based on science and evidence over at the Congress, and that's what our position is on it."

And then in this quarter, Steve, what we've got is on an adjusted basis, down actually 0.5%. So it's obviously well below the historical trends of 3% to 4%. But actually, on a sequential basis in cigarettes, it's -- the decline has picked up a little bit, but just a little bit. I think that's the way we think about smokable. The smokeless volumes, our industry estimate is on a 6-month trailing basis. We estimate about 2.5%. That's actually relatively consistent with our estimate, I think, for the last 2 years if you look at it on an average basis. Our shipments were flattered a little bit, obviously, because we had the launch of Copenhagen Mint. So that's how we look at the volume. I guess what I would say is the volumes continue to be strong on both segments, and that's good for our business."

With respect to Marlboro, I'm tempted, but I won't reprise the presentation the we've put out in CAGNY just a few months ago about all the many strengths of Marlboro. You're right, Judy. I mean, it's modest share momentum over time, and a quarter is not over time. I think when we were talking about this several weeks ago, we looked back, and Marlboro has actually grown about 2 full share points, if you look back in a period, call it, 2007, 2008 to date, which is terrific share performance for a brand that's as big as that. One way to look at the competitive environment is how PM USA did in the quarter. So just to call out again a few of the highlights, it grew its income more than 9% over a tough comp. It expanded its margins. It had net pricing realization in line with the long-term trends. So it's a terrific performance despite the fact that we have a transaction, and there are some new owner of new brands out there. I think that's how we'd look at it."

But we don't want to grow the discount category, and L&M is doing exactly that. I read with interest and listened to the reports about Director Zeller. I've seen his presentation. We continue to be encouraged and optimistic that the FDA will adopt the continuum of risk with respect to products. It's the right thing for consumers. I think it's the right public policy, and it should promote innovation. This is a category in which the FDA, in our opinion, should be promoting innovation to bring new products to smokers in particular.

Thanks for joining us. jAltria group delivered strong 2016 second quarter and first half results growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.5% in the second quarter and by nearly 11% for the first half. Our c",1014,"Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. jAltria group delivered strong 2016 second quarter and first half results growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.5% in the second quarter and by nearly 11% for the first half. 
Our core tobacco businesses continued to produce very strong results, with yet another solid quarter of income and retail share performance. Marlboro match the record retail sale in the first half last year and Copenhagen and Skoal produced excellent share results on a combined basis. And we continued to reward our shareholders paying out more than $2.2 billion in dividends to shareholders thus far in 2016. 
So here are some of the operating highlights from the quarter and the first half. The Smokeable Product segment continued to produce excellent results. Despite difficult year-over-year comparisons, it grew adjusted operating company's income by 4.5% the second quarter and nearly 7% for the first half. You'll recall that last year the Smokable segment grew adjusted OCI by nearly 16% in the second quarter and over 14% for the first half. This growth in 2015 benefited from higher reported volumes at PM USA, driven by stable industrial volume and a trade inventory build influenced by upcoming cigarette exercise tax increases.  
In the second quarter of 2016, the trade depleted inventory levels. So when adjusted for these inventory movements, PM USA estimates it's second quarter cigarette volume declined 3%, in line with PM USA's estimate for the total industry declined rate. For the half, PM USA estimates that it's adjusted cigarette volume declined 1.5% in line with the industry. 
For the first half of 2016, Marlboro's retail share was unchanged at 44.1%, matching its record share levels at a year ago. Marlboro second quarter retail share also was 44.1%, down 1/10th of a point form the year ago period. We are extremely pleased with the smokable segments performance in both the second quarter and first half of 2016. 
Our smokeless products segment continued to deliver excellent income performance, robust volumes and strong share growth on Copenhagen and Skoal combine.  
USSTC grew adjusted OCI by nearly 14% in the second quarter and more than 15% for the first half. USSTC estimates that it's volume after adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors grew approximately 5% in the second quarter and 4% for the first half, while estimated smokeless industry volume grew approximately 3% for the past 6 months. 
Copenhagen and Skoal increase their combined retail share by 1.5 points in the second quarter and by 9/10th of a share point for the first half. Copenhagen's retail share gained nearly 3 points in the quarter, benefiting from the first full quarter of Copenhagen national expansion at retail.  Copenhagen has performed very well, bringing excitement to the brand for both adult dippers and for the trade. 
Skoal's retail share declined 1.3 points in the second quarter, reflecting in part USSTC's portfolio strategy to invest behind Copenhagen and expand Copenhagen Mint. And as you know, part of USSTC strategy is to grow the combined share of Copenhagen and Skoal. 
In innovative tobacco Nu Mark continuous to invest with discipline in developing a portfolio of products to meet the evolving preferences of adulst tobacco consumers. In e-vapor, market results for MarkTen Xl remain encouraging, as Nu Mark has now distributed the branded into stores, representing approximately 50% of e-vapor category volume in mainstream retail channels including c-stores. 
On the heated tobacco platform, our work with Philip Morris International on it's FDA applications, where premarket authorization and a modified risk tobacco product destination remains on plan, and we're making excellent progress on commercialization strategies for the U.S. market. 
As you know, in May, the FDA published its final deeming regulation, expanding it's regulatory authority to all tobacco products including cigars and e-vapor. We believe we're well-prepared for these regulations and Nu Mark and Middleton are working now to comply with them. Our company is also continued to engage with the FDA and other stakeholders to advocate for changes to the regulations, where we believe appropriate. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with our first half performance. Based on these results and our expectation that our businesses will deliver solid results over the balance of 2016, we now expect to deliver 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $3.01 to $3.07, representing a growth rate of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80.  As a reminder, this guidance does not include any impact from the proposed AB InBev, SABMiller business combination, as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined. 
Speaking of our beer investment, we're pleased with the significant progress AB InBev has made, securing regulatory clearances. AB InBev has announced that it has obtained approval in 22 jurisdictions, including approvals in the United States, North America, Asia Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America. And AB InBev continues to pursue the remaining regulatory clearances that are necessary to close the transaction. 
In addition, as you know, on July 26, AB InBev announced its revised and final offer to SABMiller. This offer among other things would increase the pretax cash that Altria expects to receive to $3 billion from the previously estimated $2.5 billion. The other material terms related to Altria remain the same. 
Internally, our teams are preparing to transition our investment from SABMiller to the new combined entity. One such area of preparation is coordinating how our accounting teams will share information. And through this preportion, we now expect a timing difference between how we currently reported results for our SABMiller investment and how we'll report for our investment in the new combined company. 
Once the proposed transaction closes, we expect to record our share of results from the new company on a 1 quarter lag. will provide you with more details on his remarks. We remain excited about the proposed transaction and look forward to supporting the combination of these 2 great companies. Now I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance."

I'll start with some more color on the smokable product segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.6 percentage points in the second quarter to over 50%, primarily driven by higher net pricing and lower SG&A cost, partially offset by higher resolution expenses.  For the first half, adjusted OCI margins in this segment expended 2.2 points to 49.2%, primarily driven by the same factors. 
PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by the industry rate of decline and trade inventory moments. In the second quarter of last year, the trade build inventory, ahead of excise tax increases in several states, that went into affect in the next quarter. For the first half PM USA's reported shipment volumes declined 2.1%. 
At retail, PM USA's overall share was unchanged in the second quarter and grew 1/10th of a point for the first half. 
In cigars, higher shipment volume contributed the smokeable products segments performance in both periods. Middleton grew Black & Mild's volumes by 7.5% in the quarter and nearly 8% for the first half  by focusing on the brand strength in the more profitable segment. 
In the smokeless product segment, adjusted OCI margins expanded in the second quarter by nearly 3 percentage points to 69.3% and by 2.6 percentage points to 67.5% for the first half, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix, due to higher popular pricing product volume. 
This smokeless segments reported shipment volumes increased 4.3% in the second quarter and 6% for the first half of 2016, primarily driven by the industry's rate of growth and retail share gains. 
In wine, Ste. Michelle continue to deliver strong results by growing volume of it's premier wines. During this second quarter and first half, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by nearly 6% and 5% respectively.  Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volumes grew more than 3% in the second quarter and 5.5% for the first half. 
Altria recorded reported equity earnings from it's SABMiller investment of $199 million in the second quarter and $265 million for the first half. 
with some more information on the accounting of our beer investment that Marty mentioned. For context, Altria currently records results for it's SABMiller investment concurrent with Altria's reporting calendar. Because new results will not be available to us in time to report them in the current period, we expect to report our share of results using a 1 quarter lag. This means that after the transaction closes, there will be a one-time 3-month transition, with no earnings from our equity earnings in Newco are recorded in our income income statement. For example, Altair share of Newco's results in the quarter in which the transaction closes will be recorded in the subsequent quarter.  The precise periods affected will depend on when the transaction closes. 
It's important to understand that this lag will not affect our cash flows or quarterly dividends per share, that we do expect to impact our year-over-year comparability of our reported and adjusted diluted EPS in the short term and could also affect 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance.  As noted in our earnings release, our guidance does not yet include the impact of the expected lag, because the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined. 
That wraps our results. Marty and I will take your question. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we posted usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items. Operator, do we have any questions?"

We do think that innovation in the category is important. We're working very hard on our innovation system and our on innovative products for the adult tobacco consumer, and we believe that it would be good public policy for the FDA to encourage. Our comments had pointed out to the FDA, that some of what's in the deeming regulations does not seem to be particularly friendly to that concept. And so we continue -- I think we mentioned in our remarks this morning, we're both complying with the regs and we're trying to influence and advocate where we think the regs could be improved.

There is a desire I know to get onto that. We just don't break them out. I mean, we've had tables in the earnings release, which shows, as much as I think, we're willing to disclose. Look, the way to think about this Bonnie, I think is that overall Marlboro continues to perform terrifically. Because most of our shipments in the cigarette segment are Marlboro, and actually you would expect the volume to track, but we don't report at that level, but Marlboro is doing great. It continues to have as we mentioned, record share if you measured against the half. It's equity is doing great. The Marlboro architecture continues to perform well. If you and I spoken previously about the exciting digital marketing for adult tobacco consumers and we've improved the app even further and we've got exciting promotions on there. So I think the way to think about Marlboro, it is doing exactly what we wanted to do and it is doing it well."

So I think a lot of people think that it would be wise to revisit that portion. We certainly do and you may heard about the conversation we had earlier about encouraging innovation it did for us not seeming to do that. So that is one area. 
With respect to I'm not familiar with the conversation someone else, but I can tell you that it would seem to make sense for premarket approvals, you certainly ought to be taking into account the degree of harm of the product. So cigarettes, as we all know, bear a degree of risk. And while the evidence is not come lately in and it appears that be because they don't burn e-vapor probably has a lower risk. That's of course not taken into account in approving whether they should come into markets. So that would seem a sensible approach.

Thanks for joining us. Altria group delivered strong 2016 second quarter and first half results, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.5% in the second quarter and by nearly 11% for the first half. Our c",1013,"Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Altria group delivered strong 2016 second quarter and first half results, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.5% in the second quarter and by nearly 11% for the first half. 
Our core tobacco businesses continued to produce very strong results, with yet another solid quarter of income and retail share performance. Marlboro matched the record retail share it set in the first half last year, and Copenhagen and Skoal produced excellent share results on a combined basis. And we continued to reward our shareholders, paying out more than $2.2 billion in dividends to shareholders thus far in 2016. 
So here are some of the operating highlights from the quarter and the first half. The smokeable products segment continued to produce excellent results. Despite difficult year-over-year comparisons, it grew adjusted operating company's income by 4.5% in the second quarter and nearly 7% for the first half. You'll recall that last year the smokable segment grew adjusted OCI by nearly 16% in the second quarter and over 14% for the first half. This growth in 2015 benefited from higher reported volumes at PM USA, driven by stable industry volume and a trade inventory build influenced by upcoming cigarette excise tax increases.  
In the second quarter of 2016, the trade depleted inventory levels. So when adjusted for these inventory movements, PM USA estimates its second quarter cigarette volume declined 3%, in line with PM USA's estimate for the total industry declined rate. For the half, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined 1.5%, in line with the industry. 
For the first half of 2016, Marlboro's retail share was unchanged at 44.1%, matching its record share levels at a year ago. Marlboro second quarter retail share also was 44.1%, down 0.1 point form the year-ago period. We are extremely pleased with the smokable segments performance in both the second quarter and first half of 2016. 
Our smokeless products segment continued to deliver excellent income performance, robust volumes and strong share growth on Copenhagen and Skoal combined.  
USSTC grew adjusted OCI by nearly 14% in the second quarter and more than 15% for the first half. USSTC estimates that its volume, after adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, grew approximately 5% in the second quarter and 4% for the first half, while estimated smokeless industry volume grew approximately 3% for the past 6 months. 
Copenhagen and Skoal increased their combined retail share by 1.5 points in the second quarter and by 0.9 share point for the first half. Copenhagen's retail share gained nearly 3 points in the quarter, benefiting from the first full quarter of Copenhagen Mint's national expansion at retail.  Copenhagen Mint has performed extremely well, bringing excitement to the brand for both adult dippers and for the trade. 
Skoal's retail share declined 1.3 points in the second quarter, reflecting in part USSTC's portfolio strategy to invest behind Copenhagen and expand Copenhagen Mint. And as you know, part of USSTC's strategy is to grow the combined share of Copenhagen and Skoal. 
In innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continues to invest with discipline in developing a portfolio of products to meet the evolving preferences of adult tobacco consumers. In e-vapor, market results for MarkTen XL remain encouraging as Nu Mark has now distributed the brand into stores, representing approximately 50% of e-vapor category volume in mainstream retail channels, including c-stores. 
On the heated tobacco platform, our work with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications, where premarket authorization and a modified risk tobacco product destination remains on plan, and we're making excellent progress on commercialization strategies for the U.S. market. 
As you know, in May, the FDA published its final deeming regulation, expanding it's regulatory authority to all tobacco products, including cigars and e-vapor. We believe we're well-prepared for these regulations and Nu Mark and Middleton are working now to comply with them. Our companies also continued to engage with FDA and other stakeholders to advocate for changes to the regulations where we believe appropriate. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with our first half performance. Based on these results and our expectation that our businesses will deliver solid results over the balance of 2016, we now expect to deliver 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $3.01 to $3.07, representing a growth rate of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. As a reminder, this guidance does not include any impact from the proposed AB InBev, SABMiller business combination, as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined. 
Speaking of our beer investment, we're pleased with the significant progress AB InBev has made, securing regulatory clearances. AB InBev has announced that it has obtained approval in 22 jurisdictions, including approvals in the United States, North America, Asia Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America. And AB InBev continues to pursue the remaining regulatory clearances that are necessary to close the transaction. 
In addition, as you know, on July 26, AB InBev announced its revised and final offer to SABMiller. This offer, among other things, would increase the pretax cash that Altria expects to receive to $3 billion from the previously estimated $2.5 billion. The other material terms related to Altria remain the same. 
Internally, our teams are preparing to transition our investment from SABMiller to the new combined entity. One such area of preparation is coordinating how our accounting teams will share information. And through this preportion, we now expect a timing difference between how we currently report results for our SABMiller investment and how we'll report for our investment in the new combined company. 
Once the proposed transaction closes, we expect to record our share of results from the new company on a 1-quarter lag. Billy will provide you with more detail in his remarks. We remain excited about the proposed transaction and look forward to supporting the combination of these 2 great companies. 
Now I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance."

I'll start with some more color on the smokable products segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.6 percentage points in the second quarter to over 50%, primarily driven by higher net pricing and lower SG&A costs, partially offset by higher resolution expenses. For the first half, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expended 2.2 points to 49.2%, primarily driven by the same factors. 
PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline and trade inventory moments. In the second quarter of last year, the trade built inventory, ahead of excise tax increases in several states that went into affect in the next quarter. For the first half PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.1%. 
At retail, PM USA's overall share was unchanged in the second quarter and grew 0.1point for the first half. 
In cigars, higher shipment volume contributed to the smokeable products segment's performance in both periods. Middleton grew Black & Mild's volume by 7.5% in the quarter and nearly 8% for the first half by focusing on the brand strength in the more profitable tip segment. 
In the smokeless products segment, adjusted OCI margins expanded in the second quarter by nearly 3 percentage points to 69.3% and by 2.6 percentage points to 67.5% for the first half, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix due to higher popular price product volume.  The smokeless segment's reported shipment volumes increased 4.3% in the second quarter and 6% for the first half of 2016, primarily driven by the industry's rate of growth and retail share gains. 
In wine, Ste. Michelle continued to deliver strong results by growing volume of its premium wines. During this second quarter and first half, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by nearly 6% and 5%, respectively.  Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volumes grew more than 3% in the second quarter and 5.5% for the first half. 
Altria recorded reported equity earnings from its SABMiller investment of $199 million in the second quarter and $265 million for the first half. 
So let me close with some more information on the accounting of our beer investment that Marty mentioned. For context, Altria currently records results for its SABMiller investment concurrent with Altria's reporting calendar. Because NewCo's results will not be available to us in time to report them in the concurrent period, we expect to report our share of NewCo's results using a 1-quarter lag. This means that after the transaction closes, there will be a one-time 3-month transition where no earnings from our equity investment in NewCo are recorded in our income statement. For example, Altair's share of NewCo's results in the quarter in which the transaction closes will be recorded in the subsequent quarter. The precise periods affected will depend on when the transaction closes. 
It's important to understand that this lag will not affect our cash flows or quarterly dividends per share, but we do expect it to impact our year-over-year comparability of our reported and adjusted diluted EPS in the short term and could also affect 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance. As noted in our earnings release, our guidance does not yet include the impact of the expected lag because the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined. 
That wraps our results. Marty and I will now take your question. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we've posted our usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

But we did talk about the process, and the process is there is typically a high degree of engagement between the manufacturer that's trying to bring that product to market and the FDA staff. I think we talked previously about, for example, you don't want to design and execute clinical trials, which are lengthy and expensive, without knowing that the FDA, I think, is thinking that you're asking the right questions. So I would also point to comments that Director Zeller has made publicly about understanding that there is a continuum of harm among tobacco products and that the agency has to be thoughtful about how they encourage manufacturers and consumers to migrate to these kinds of products. So these things aren't done until they're done, but I continue to be optimistic that this is the way forward by bringing innovations to consumers, which may reduce harm. It's a good idea for everyone."

I'll give you an example on your first question which is predicate date. We had argued to the FDA and advocated to the FDA, as did many others, that it made little sense to go back and use a cigarette predicate date of 2007 for products that basically came into the marketplace after 2007. So there continues to be a lot of dialogue about that. That is not limited to the FDA, you know that there are legislated proposals pending. And so I think a lot of people think that it would be wise to revisit that question. We certainly do. And you may have heard the conversation we had earlier about encouraging innovation. Using that predicate date, to us, does not seem to do that. So that's one area. With respect to PMTAs, I'm not familiar with the conversation you've referenced with someone else, but I can tell you that it would seem to make sense that, for premarket approvals, you certainly, if you were the regulator, ought to be taking into account the degree of harm of the product. And so cigarettes, as we all know, bear a high degree of risk, and while the evidence is not completely in, it appears to be that because they don't burn, e-vapor probably has a lower risk. That of course ought to be taken into account in approving whether they should come to market. So that would seem to be a sensible approach. I think that's a development that would be good for consumers and for manufactures and for public health."

Thanks for joining us. Altria group delivered strong 2016 second quarter and first half results, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.5% in the second quarter and by nearly 11% for the first half. Our c",1014,"Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Altria group delivered strong 2016 second quarter and first half results, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.5% in the second quarter and by nearly 11% for the first half. 
Our core tobacco businesses continued to produce very strong results, with yet another solid quarter of income and retail share performance. Marlboro matched the record retail share it set in the first half last year, and Copenhagen and Skoal produced excellent share results on a combined basis. And we continued to reward our shareholders, paying out more than $2.2 billion in dividends to shareholders thus far in 2016. 
So here are some of the operating highlights from the quarter and the first half. The smokeable products segment continued to produce excellent results. Despite difficult year-over-year comparisons, it grew adjusted operating company's income by 4.5% in the second quarter and nearly 7% for the first half. You'll recall that last year, the smokable segment grew adjusted OCI by nearly 16% in the second quarter and over 14% for the first half. This growth in 2015 benefited from higher reported volumes at PM USA, driven by stable industry volume and a trade inventory build influenced by upcoming cigarette excise tax increases.  
In the second quarter of 2016, the trade depleted inventory levels. So when adjusted for these inventory movements, PM USA estimates its second quarter cigarette volume declined 3%, in line with PM USA's estimate for the total industry declined rate. For the half, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined 1.5%, in line with the industry. 
For the first half of 2016, Marlboro's retail share was unchanged at 44.1%, matching its record share levels at a year ago. Marlboro's second quarter retail share also was 44.1%, down 0.1 point form the year-ago period. We are extremely pleased with the smokable segments performance in both the second quarter and first half of 2016. 
Our smokeless products segment continued to deliver excellent income performance, robust volumes and strong share growth on Copenhagen and Skoal combined.  
USSTC grew adjusted OCI by nearly 14% in the second quarter and more than 15% for the first half. USSTC estimates that its volume, after adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, grew approximately 5% in the second quarter and 4% for the first half, while estimated smokeless industry volume grew approximately 3% for the past 6 months. 
Copenhagen and Skoal increased their combined retail share by 1.5 points in the second quarter and by 0.9 of 1 share point for the first half. Copenhagen's retail share gained nearly 3 points in the quarter, benefiting from the first full quarter of Copenhagen Mint's national expansion at retail.  Copenhagen Mint has performed extremely well, bringing excitement to the brand for both adult dippers and for the trade. 
Skoal's retail share declined 1.3 points in the second quarter, reflecting in part USSTC's portfolio strategy to invest behind Copenhagen and expand Copenhagen Mint. And as you know, part of USSTC's strategy is to grow the combined share of Copenhagen and Skoal. 
In innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continues to invest with discipline in developing a portfolio of products to meet the evolving preferences of adult tobacco consumers. In e-vapor, market results for MarkTen XL remain encouraging as Nu Mark has now distributed the brand into stores, representing approximately 50% of e-vapor category volume in mainstream retail channels, including c-stores. 
On the heated tobacco platform, our work with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications, where premarket authorization and a modified risk tobacco product destination remains on plan, and we're making excellent progress on commercialization strategies for the U.S. market. 
As you know, in May, the FDA published its final deeming regulation, expanding it's regulatory authority to all tobacco products, including cigars and e-vapor. We believe we're well-prepared for these regulations and Nu Mark and Middleton are working now to comply with them. Our companies also continued to engage with FDA and other stakeholders to advocate for changes to the regulations where we believe appropriate. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with our first half performance. Based on these results and our expectation that our businesses will deliver solid results over the balance of 2016, we now expect to deliver 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $3.01 to $3.07, representing a growth rate of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. As a reminder, this guidance does not include any impact from the proposed AB InBev/SABMiller business combination, as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined. 
Speaking of our beer investment, we're pleased with the significant progress AB InBev has made, securing regulatory clearances. AB InBev has announced that it has obtained approval in 22 jurisdictions, including approvals in the United States, North America, Asia Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America. And AB InBev continues to pursue the remaining regulatory clearances that are necessary to close the transaction. 
In addition, as you know, on July 26, AB InBev announced its revised and final offer to SABMiller. This offer, among other things, would increase the pretax cash that Altria expects to receive to $3 billion from the previously estimated $2.5 billion. The other material terms related to Altria remain the same. 
Internally, our teams are preparing to transition our investment from SABMiller to the new combined entity. One such area of preparation is coordinating how our accounting teams will share information. And through this preparation, we now expect a timing difference between how we currently report results for our SABMiller investment and how we'll report for our investment in the new combined company. 
Once the proposed transaction closes, we expect to record our share of results from the new company on a 1-quarter lag. Billy will provide you with more detail in his remarks. We remain excited about the proposed transaction and look forward to supporting the combination of these 2 great companies. 
Now I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance."

I'll start with some more color on the smokable products segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.6 percentage points in the second quarter to over 50%, primarily driven by higher net pricing and lower SG&A costs, partially offset by higher resolution expenses. For the first half, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expended 2.2 points to 49.2%, primarily driven by the same factors. 
PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline and trade inventory moments. In the second quarter of last year, the trade built inventory, ahead of excise tax increases in several states that went into effect in the next quarter. For the first half PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.1%. 
At retail, PM USA's overall share was unchanged in the second quarter and grew 0.1 of 1 point for the first half. 
In cigars, higher shipment volume contributed to the smokeable products segment's performance in both periods. Middleton grew Black & Mild's volume by 7.5% in the quarter and nearly 8% for the first half by focusing on the brand strength in the more profitable tip segment. 
In the smokeless products segment, adjusted OCI margins expanded in the second quarter by nearly 3 percentage points to 69.3% and by 2.6 percentage points to 67.5% for the first half, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix due to higher popular price product volume.  The smokeless segment's reported shipment volumes increased 4.3% in the second quarter and 6% for the first half of 2016, primarily driven by the industry's rate of growth and retail share gains. 
In wine, Ste. Michelle continued to deliver strong results by growing volume of its premium wines. During this second quarter and first half, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by nearly 6% and 5%, respectively.  Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volumes grew more than 3% in the second quarter and 5.5% for the first half. 
Altria recorded reported equity earnings from its SABMiller investment of $199 million in the second quarter and $265 million for the first half. 
So let me close with some more information on the accounting of our beer investment that Marty mentioned. For context, Altria currently records results for its SABMiller investment concurrent with Altria's reporting calendar. Because NewCo's results will not be available to us in time to record them in the concurrent period, we expect to report our share of NewCo's results using a 1-quarter lag. This means that after the transaction closes, there will be a one-time, 3-month transition where no earnings from our equity investment in NewCo are recorded in our income statement. For example, Altair's share of NewCo's results in the quarter in which the transaction closes will be recorded in the subsequent quarter. The precise periods affected will depend on when the transaction closes. 
It's important to understand that this lag will not affect our cash flows or quarterly dividends per share, but we do expect it to impact our year-over-year comparability of our reported and adjusted diluted EPS in the short term and could also affect 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance. As noted in our earnings release, our guidance does not yet include the impact of the expected lag because the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined. 
That wraps our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we have posted our usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

I'll give you an example on your first question which is predicate date. We had argued to the FDA and advocated to the FDA, as did many others, that it made little sense to go back and use a cigarette predicate date of 2007 for products that basically came into the marketplace after 2007. So there continues to be a lot of dialogue about that, that is not limited to the FDA, you know, that there are legislated proposals pending. And so I think a lot of people think that it would be wise to revisit that question. We certainly do. And you may have heard the conversation we had earlier about encouraging innovation. Using that predicate date, to us, does not seem to do that. So that's one area. With respect to PMTAs, I'm not familiar with the conversation you've referenced with someone else, but I can tell you that it would seem to make sense that, for premarket approvals, you certainly, if you were the regulator, ought to be taking into account the degree of harm of the product. And so cigarettes, as we all know, bear a high degree of risk, and while the evidence is not completely in, it appears to be that because they don't burn, e-vapor probably has a lower risk. That of course ought to be taken into account in approving whether they should come to market. So that would seem to be a sensible approach. I think that's a development that would be good for consumers, and for manufactures and for public health."

Thanks for joining us. Altria group delivered strong 2016 second quarter and first half results, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.5% in the second quarter and by nearly 11% for the first half. Our c",1013,"Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Altria group delivered strong 2016 second quarter and first half results, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.5% in the second quarter and by nearly 11% for the first half. 
Our core tobacco businesses continued to produce very strong results, with yet another solid quarter of income and retail share performance. Marlboro matched the record retail share it set in the first half last year, and Copenhagen and Skoal produced excellent share results on a combined basis. And we continued to reward our shareholders, paying out more than $2.2 billion in dividends to shareholders thus far in 2016. 
So here are some of the operating highlights from the quarter and the first half. The smokeable products segment continued to produce excellent results. Despite difficult year-over-year comparisons, it grew adjusted operating company's income by 4.5% in the second quarter and nearly 7% for the first half. You'll recall that last year, the smokeable segment grew adjusted OCI by nearly 16% in the second quarter and over 14% for the first half. This growth in 2015 benefited from higher reported volumes at PM USA, driven by stable industry volume and a trade inventory build influenced by upcoming cigarette excise tax increases. 
In the second quarter of 2016, the trade depleted inventory levels. So when adjusted for these inventory movements, PM USA estimates its second quarter cigarette volume declined 3%, in line with PM USA's estimate for the total industry declined rate. For the half, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined 1.5%, in line with the industry. 
For the first half of 2016, Marlboro's retail share was unchanged at 44.1%, matching its record share levels at a year ago. Marlboro's second quarter retail share also was 44.1%, down 0.1 point from the year-ago period. We are extremely pleased with the smokeable segments performance in both the second quarter and first half of 2016. 
Our smokeless products segment continued to deliver excellent income performance, robust volumes and strong share growth on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. 
USSTC grew adjusted OCI by nearly 14% in the second quarter and more than 15% for the first half. USSTC estimates that its volume, after adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, grew approximately 5% in the second quarter and 4% for the first half, while estimated smokeless industry volume grew approximately 3% for the past 6 months. 
Copenhagen and Skoal increased their combined retail share by 1.5 points in the second quarter and by 0.9 share point for the first half. Copenhagen's retail share gained nearly 3 points in the quarter, benefiting from the first full quarter of Copenhagen Mint's national expansion at retail. Copenhagen Mint has performed extremely well, bringing excitement to the brand for both adult dippers and for the trade. 
Skoal's retail share declined 1.3 points in the second quarter, reflecting in part USSTC's portfolio strategy to invest behind Copenhagen and expand Copenhagen Mint. And as you know, part of USSTC's strategy is to grow the combined share of Copenhagen and Skoal. 
In innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continues to invest with discipline in developing a portfolio of products to meet the evolving preferences of adult tobacco consumers. In e-vapor, market results for MarkTen XL remain encouraging as Nu Mark has now distributed the brand into stores, representing approximately 50% of e-vapor category volume in mainstream retail channels, including c-stores. 
On the heated tobacco platform, our work with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications, where premarket authorization and a modified risk tobacco product destination remains on plan, and we're making excellent progress on commercialization strategies for the U.S. market. 
As you know, in May, the FDA published its final deeming regulation, expanding its regulatory authority to all tobacco products, including cigars and e-vapor. We believe we're well prepared for these regulations and Nu Mark and Middleton are working now to comply with them. Our companies also continued to engage with FDA and other stakeholders to advocate for changes to the regulations where we believe appropriate. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with our first half performance. Based on these results and our expectation that our businesses will deliver solid results over the balance of 2016, we now expect to deliver 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $3.01 to $3.07, representing a growth rate of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. As a reminder, this guidance does not include any impact from the proposed AB InBev-SABMiller business combination, as the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined. 
Speaking of our beer investment, we're pleased with the significant progress AB InBev has made, securing regulatory clearances. AB InBev has announced that it has obtained approval in 22 jurisdictions, including approvals in the United States, North America, Asia Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America. And AB InBev continues to pursue the remaining regulatory clearances that are necessary to close the transaction. 
In addition, as you know, on July 26, AB InBev announced its revised and final offer to SABMiller. This offer, among other things, would increase the pretax cash that Altria expects to receive to $3 billion from the previously estimated $2.5 billion. The other material terms related to Altria remain the same. 
Internally, our teams are preparing to transition our investment from SABMiller to the new combined entity. One such area of preparation is coordinating how our accounting teams will share information. And through this preparation, we now expect a timing difference between how we currently report results for our SABMiller investment and how we'll report for our investment in the new combined company. 
Once the proposed transaction closes, we expect to record our share of results from the new company on a 1-quarter lag. Billy will provide you with more detail in his remarks. We remain excited about the proposed transaction and look forward to supporting the combination of these 2 great companies. 
Now I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance."

I'll start with some more color on the smokeable products segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.6 percentage points in the second quarter to over 50%, primarily driven by higher net pricing and lower SG&A costs, partially offset by higher resolution expenses. For the first half, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expended 2.2 points to 49.2%, primarily driven by the same factors. 
PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline and trade inventory moments. In the second quarter of last year, the trade built inventory, ahead of excise tax increases in several states that went into effect in the next quarter. For the first half PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.1%. 
At retail, PM USA's overall share was unchanged in the second quarter and grew 0.1 point for the first half. 
In cigars, higher shipment volume contributed to the smokeable products segment's performance in both periods. Middleton grew Black & Mild's volume by 7.5% in the quarter and nearly 8% for the first half by focusing on the brand strength in the more profitable tip segment. 
In the smokeless products segment, adjusted OCI margins expanded in the second quarter by nearly 3 percentage points to 69.3% and by 2.6 percentage points to 67.5% for the first half, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix due to higher popular price product volume. The smokeless segment's reported shipment volumes increased 4.3% in the second quarter and 6% for the first half of 2016, primarily driven by the industry's rate of growth and retail share gains. 
In wine, Ste. Michelle continued to deliver strong results by growing volume of its premium wines. During this second quarter and first half, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by nearly 6% and 5%, respectively. Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volumes grew more than 3% in the second quarter and 5.5% for the first half. 
Altria recorded reported equity earnings from its SABMiller investment of $199 million in the second quarter and $265 million for the first half. 
So let me close with some more information on the accounting of our beer investment that Marty mentioned. For context, Altria currently records results for its SABMiller investment concurrent with Altria's reporting calendar. Because NewCo's results will not be available to us in time to record them in the concurrent period, we expect to report our share of NewCo's results using a 1-quarter lag. This means that after the transaction closes, there will be a one-time, 3-month transition where no earnings from our equity investment in NewCo are recorded in our income statement. For example, Altair's share of NewCo's results in the quarter in which the transaction closes will be recorded in the subsequent quarter. The precise periods affected will depend on when the transaction closes. 
It's important to understand that this lag will not affect our cash flows or quarterly dividends per share, but we do expect it to impact our year-over-year comparability of our reported and adjusted diluted EPS in the short term and could also affect 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance. As noted in our earnings release, our guidance does not yet include the impact of the expected lag because the transaction remains subject to certain approvals and the closing date has not yet been determined. 
That wraps our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we have posted our usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

You know the science on that, and we you put it in our papers on that. So I'm not sure it has a big effect on menthol. I do think that there had been instances in which some in tobacco control have argued to take flavors away from adult tobacco consumers in the name of trying to prevent youth consumption. Our view on that is that there is so much that can be done to prevent youth consumption, most of which we have worked on, and the numbers are trending in the right direction that we wanted to defend the flavors for our adult tobacco consumers who have enjoyed -- the cigar category is a perfect example where flavors have been in that category for decades and decades. So we'll have to see how the FDA approaches that, but we think that they are actually very separate issues about youth consumption and flavors."

I'll give you an example on your first question which is predicate date. We had argued to the FDA and advocated to the FDA, as did many others, that it made little sense to go back and use a cigarette predicate date of 2007 for products that basically came into the marketplace after 2007. So there continues to be a lot of dialogue about that, that is not limited to the FDA, you know that there are legislated proposals pending. And so I think a lot of people think that it would be wise to revisit that question. We certainly do. And you may have heard the conversation we had earlier about encouraging innovation. Using that predicate date, to us, does not seem to do that. So that's one area. With respect to PMTAs, I'm not familiar with the conversation you've referenced with someone else, but I can tell you that it would seem to make sense that, for premarket approvals, you certainly, if you were the regulator, ought to be taking into account the degree of harm of the product. And so cigarettes, as we all know, bear a high degree of risk, and while the evidence is not completely in, it appears to be that because they don't burn, e-vapor probably has a lower risk. That of course ought to be taken into account in approving whether they should come to market. So that would seem to be a sensible approach. I think that's a development that would be good for consumers and for manufactures and for public health."

We're pleased to report that Altria delivered excellent performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2016. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.3% in the third quarter and 10.3% for the first 9 months. Our core tobacco businesses delivered another quarter of strong income growth on the strength of their leading premium brands.
Marlboro maintained retail share near record levels, and Copenhagen and Skoal combined delivered yet another quarter of good volume growth and strong retail share growth. We also continued to simplify business processes, streamline infrastructure and invest in important growth initiatives.
In August, our board raised our dividend per share by 8%, marking the 50th increase in the past 47 years. And in September, we further strengthened our balance sheet by tendering for high coupon debt and refinancing it with lower coupon, longer maturity debt. Most recently, with Altria's support of Anheuser-Busch InBev's landmark business combination with SABMiller, we've maximized the value of our SABMiller investment, rewarded our shareholders with an expanded and extended share repurchase program and enhanced our position in the global brewing profit pool.
So with that backdrop, let's look at some of the operating highlights from the quarter and first 9 months.
The smokeable products segment produced solid third quarter results despite difficult year-over-year comparisons. The segment grew adjusted operating company's income 4.2% in the third quarter and 5.8% for the first 9 months of 2016. For comparison, you will remember that in 2015, adjusted OCI grew 11% in the third quarter and over 13% for the first 9 months. The strong year-ago results were driven by several factors, including the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments.
In the third quarter and for the first 9 months of this year, PM USA's total retail share was 51.4%. This represents a 0.1 share point increase for both periods. Marlboro maintained its industry-leading retail share of 44%, up 0.1 share point in the quarter and stable on a year-to-date basis, in line with PM USA's long-term strategy to maximize income, while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro.
The smokeless products segment is executing very well against its long-term strategy to grow volume at or ahead of the category growth rate, while maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. The smokeless products segment grew adjusted OCI by 9.4% in the third quarter and 13.2% for the first 9 months. Further, USSTC grew Copenhagen and Skoal combined retail share by 1.2 share points in the third quarter to 52.6%. It's the highest level since we acquired USSTC. Copenhagen fueled this growth with a retail share increase of 2.7 points in the quarter, due in large part to strong consumer response to Copenhagen Mint.
For the first 9 months, Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share grew 1 share point to 52.2%. In e-vapor, Nu Mark continued its disciplined rollout of MarkTen XL, optimizing its distribution while maximizing marketplace learning. As you know, FDA's final deeming regulations became effective on August 8, about which we'll say more in a moment. Nu Mark has been focused on preparing for deeming and positioning itself to succeed in the new regulatory environment. It has a pipeline of promising e-vapor products, and it continues to enhance its infrastructure and systems to move those products through the required regulatory approval process.
In the heated tobacco space, we continue to partner with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications for ICOS. PMI recently announced that it remains on track to submit a modified risk tobacco product application to the FDA by the end of this year with a premarket tobacco product application following early next year. At Altria, we continue to make progress on our commercialization strategies for the U.S. market. We're excited about this opportunity and are working closely with PMI to incorporate insights from other iQOS markets.
Speaking of the FDA, a word of color might be useful now that the August effective date of the deeming regulations has passed. First, we're pleased to report that John Middleton and Nu Mark have taken the necessary steps to comply with the regulations, and we believe they are well positioned to move forward with their strategies in the new environment. More generally, all tobacco products are now FDA regulated for us and others in the industry. This means greater regulatory complexity and more resource commitment. 
For the agency, this also means more work and the need to make progress on the existing backlog of substantial equivalence in new product applications, particularly as it prepares for a large volume of applications for newly deemed products. To that end, the agency now appears to be resourced and staffed, which we're seeing reflected in the increased pace of its work across all regulated segments. Our strategy continues to be to focus on complying with the requirements of the act, while engaging constructively with FDA to urge sensible interpretations consistent with the act. We also are encouraging FDA to promote good public policy like harm reduction and to create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation. Through this approach, we aim to maintain a constructive relationship with FDA while protecting the rights of adult tobacco consumers and other important stakeholders.
In other areas, we remain focused on simplification and cost management to improve our core businesses and invest in future growth initiatives. Today, we announced plans to consolidate certain of our operating companies' manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. John Middleton will transfer its Limerick, Pennsylvania operations to the manufacturing center site in Richmond, Virginia. USSTC will transfer its Franklin Park, Illinois operations to its existing factory in Nashville, Tennessee and to the manufacturing center site in Richmond.
Employees affected by the consolidation will be offered the opportunity to transfer into available positions and our hope is that many of them will want to do so. For employees who do not transfer, they will be eligible for enhanced severance and benefits. We expect to complete the consolidation by the first quarter of 2018 and to deliver approximately $50 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2018, over and above the previously announced productivity initiative.
Finally, let's touch briefly on our beer investment. We are very excited that on October 10, Anheuser-Busch InBev completed its business combination with SABMiller. Following the transaction, the new combined group retained the name AB InBev.
In connection with the closing, Altria received roughly 185 million restricted shares of AB InBev, representing a 9.6% ownership of first truly global beer company and one of the world's largest consumer packaged goods companies. We also received approximately $5.3 billion in pretax cash, resulting from the terms of the partial share alternative, including proration and proceeds from the currency derivatives we entered into to hedge our British pound exposure.
As you saw, we also announced our board's decision to expand and extend our previous $1 billion share repurchase program to $3 billion, which we expect to complete by the end of the second quarter of 2018, and Billy will say more about our investment in the combined AB InBev in a moment. 
As to guidance, we reaffirmed this morning our 2016 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $2.98 to $3.04, representing a growth rate of 6.5% to 8.5% from a 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. Long term, our financial goals remain unchanged.
So in summary, we had an excellent third quarter and first 9 months and firmly believe that we are on track to achieve our full year financial goals. 
So with that, I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance."

PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 1% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, partially offset by trade",803,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the smokeable products segment. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 1% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, partially offset by trade inventory movements. After adjusting for trade inventory movements, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined 3% in the third quarter, in line with PM USA's estimate for total industry decline rate.
For the first 9 months, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined 2%, in line with the industry. As you know, we have seen a moderation in cigarette industry volumes declines over the past -- over the last 18 months-or-so as positive macroeconomic factors have benefited the adult tobacco consumer. While some of these factors are still present, the decline rate appears to be gradually reverting back to long-term historical norms as we expected.
Smokeable segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 7/10 in the third quarter to 47.7%. The margin expansion was driven by higher net pricing and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher resolution expenses and higher SG&A cost as a result of valid initiative spending.
For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expended 1.6 percentage points to 48.6%, driven by the same factors.
Marlboro continues to innovate to maintain the brand's vibrancy and relevance. Adult smokers and retailers have responded enthusiastically to Marlboro's digital engagement efforts. As Marlboro mobile coupon redemptions continue to increase in line with expectations. And recently, PM USA announced the national expansion of Marlboro Slay, a bold menthol product in the Marlboro Black family with innovative packaging featuring soft touch ink.
In cigars, Black & Mild remain the overwhelming leader in the profitable tip segment, though it lost some share overall. Middleton grew Black & Mild's reported volume by 5% in the quarter and 6.7% for the first 9 months, contributing to the smokeable segment's income growth.
In the smokeless product segment, reported shipment volume increased 5.6% in the third quarter and 5.9% for the first 9 months of the year. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that the shipment volume grew by approximately 6% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first 9 months. This growth outpaced the estimated industry volume growth of approximately 3% over the last past 6 months.
Smokeless segment adjusted OCI margins declined slightly in the quarter, down 3/10 to 63.5% due primarily to higher manufacturing costs and valid initiative spending.
For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins expanded 1.6 percentage points to 66.1%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix and higher marketing investments.
In line, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by 8.6% in the quarter and 6.2% for the first 9 months. Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volume grew 6.3% in the third quarter and 5.8% for the first 9 months.
Now for a bit more detail about our beer investment. Altria's investment in SABMiller contributed $299 million in equity earnings in the third quarter and $564 million for the first 9 months.
After the closing of the transaction and through October 24, we used a portion of the cash proceeds to purchase approximately 12 million ordinary shares of AB InBev for a total cost of approximately $1.6 million. Including these shares, Altria has now approximately 10.2% ownership of AB InBev.
For ownership levels at or above 10%, Altria is entitled to foreign tax credits available in connection with the dividends we received from AB InBev as we were with SABMiller previously.
As a reminder, we will use the equity method of accounting for our investment in AB InBev, and we'll report Altria's share of AB InBev's results using a 1 quarter lag because AB InBev's results will not be available in time to record them in the concurrent period. Previously, Altria recorded results for its SABMiller investment concurrently with Altria's reporting calendar. As we wrap up our results, let me provide a few additional thoughts as we move forward.
In the fourth quarter, PM USA will have a 1 fewer shipping day and Altria will, of course, have the impact of the AB InBev accounting lag. Beyond the fourth quarter, state excise tax increases remain an ongoing challenge. We're closely watching for valid initiatives that will go to vote in November, including a proposed $2 per pack tax increase in California. We're actively engaged on this issue and are prepared for outcomes.
That wraps up our results. Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com, along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we posted for your reference a usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

And in the tipped segment, which is where the bulk of the profitability is, we are the overwhelming leader there both in terms of share and in terms of the profit pool. The untipped has been, for several years now, following a federal excise tax increase subject to very, very heavily promotions and the profit pool has been diminishing there. So our strategy is to be the leader where the profit pool is and that's in the tipped segment. So you consider the overall share goes down a little bit but actually in terms of our share, the profit pool is in the tipped segment where we're doing great."

We're pleased to report that Altria delivered excellent performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2016. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.3% in the third quarter and 10.3% for the first 9 months. Our core tobacco businesses delivered another quarter of strong income growth on the strength of their leading premium brands.
Marlboro maintained retail share near record levels, and Copenhagen and Skoal combined delivered yet another quarter of good volume growth and strong retail share growth. We also continued to simplify business processes, streamline infrastructure and invest in important growth initiatives.
In August, our board raised our dividend per share by 8%, marking the 50th increase in the past 47 years. And in September, we further strengthened our balance sheet by tendering for high coupon debt and refinancing it with lower coupon, longer maturity debt. Most recently, with Altria's support of Anheuser-Busch InBev's landmark business combination with SABMiller, we've maximized the value of our SABMiller investment, rewarded our shareholders with an expanded and extended share repurchase program and enhanced our position in the global brewing profit pool.
So with that backdrop, let's look at some of the operating highlights from the quarter and first 9 months.
The smokeable products segment produced solid third quarter results despite difficult year-over-year comparisons. The segment grew adjusted operating company's income 4.2% in the third quarter and 5.8% for the first 9 months of 2016. For comparison, you will remember that in 2015, adjusted OCI grew 11% in the third quarter and over 13% for the first 9 months. The strong year-ago results were driven by several factors, including the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments.
In the third quarter and for the first 9 months of this year, PM USA's total retail share was 51.4%. This represents a 0.1 share point increase for both periods. Marlboro maintained its industry-leading retail share of 44%, up 0.1 share point in the quarter and stable on a year-to-date basis, in line with PM USA's long-term strategy to maximize income, while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro.
The smokeless products segment is executing very well against its long-term strategy to grow volume at or ahead of the category growth rate, while maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. The smokeless products segment grew adjusted OCI by 9.4% in the third quarter and 13.2% for the first 9 months. Further, USSTC grew Copenhagen and Skoal combined retail share by 1.2 share points in the third quarter to 52.6%. It's the highest level since we acquired USSTC. Copenhagen fueled this growth with a retail share increase of 2.7 points in the quarter, due in large part to strong consumer response to Copenhagen Mint.
For the first 9 months, Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share grew 1 share point to 52.2%. In e-vapor, Nu Mark continued its disciplined rollout of MarkTen XL, optimizing its distribution while maximizing marketplace learning. As you know, FDA's final deeming regulations became effective on August 8, about which we'll say more in a moment. Nu Mark has been focused on preparing for deeming and positioning itself to succeed in the new regulatory environment. It has a pipeline of promising e-vapor products, and it continues to enhance its infrastructure and systems to move those products through the required regulatory approval process.
In the heated tobacco space, we continue to partner with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications for iQOS. PMI recently announced that it remains on track to submit a modified risk tobacco product application to the FDA by the end of this year with a premarket tobacco product application following early next year. At Altria, we continue to make progress on our commercialization strategies for the U.S. market. We're excited about this opportunity and are working closely with PMI to incorporate insights from other iQOS markets.
Speaking of the FDA, a word of color might be useful now that the August effective date of the deeming regulations has passed. First, we're pleased to report that John Middleton and Nu Mark have taken the necessary steps to comply with the regulations, and we believe they are well positioned to move forward with their strategies in the new environment. More generally, all tobacco products are now FDA regulated for us and others in the industry. This means greater regulatory complexity and more resource commitment. 
For the agency, this also means more work and the need to make progress on the existing backlog of substantial equivalence in new product applications, particularly as it prepares for a large volume of applications for newly deemed products. To that end, the agency now appears to be resourced and staffed, which we're seeing reflected in the increased pace of its work across all regulated segments. Our strategy continues to be to focus on complying with the requirements of the act, while engaging constructively with FDA to urge sensible interpretations consistent with the act. We also are encouraging FDA to promote good public policy like harm reduction and to create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation. Through this approach, we aim to maintain a constructive relationship with FDA while protecting the rights of adult tobacco consumers and other important stakeholders.
In other areas, we remain focused on simplification and cost management to improve our core businesses and invest in future growth initiatives. Today, we announced plans to consolidate certain of our operating companies' manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. John Middleton will transfer its Limerick, Pennsylvania operations to the manufacturing center site in Richmond, Virginia. USSTC will transfer its Franklin Park, Illinois operations to its existing factory in Nashville, Tennessee and to the manufacturing center site in Richmond.
Employees affected by the consolidation will be offered the opportunity to transfer into available positions and our hope is that many of them will want to do so. For employees who do not transfer, they will be eligible for enhanced severance and benefits. We expect to complete the consolidation by the first quarter of 2018 and to deliver approximately $50 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2018, over and above the previously announced productivity initiative.
Finally, let's touch briefly on our beer investment. We are very excited that on October 10, Anheuser-Busch InBev completed its business combination with SABMiller. Following the transaction, the new combined group retained the name AB InBev.
In connection with the closing, Altria received roughly 185 million restricted shares of AB InBev, representing a 9.6% ownership of first truly global beer company and one of the world's largest consumer packaged goods companies. We also received approximately $5.3 billion in pretax cash, resulting from the terms of the partial share alternative, including proration and proceeds from the currency derivatives we entered into to hedge our British pound exposure.
As you saw, we also announced our board's decision to expand and extend our previous $1 billion share repurchase program to $3 billion, which we expect to complete by the end of the second quarter of 2018, and Billy will say more about our investment in the combined AB InBev in a moment. 
As to guidance, we reaffirmed this morning our 2016 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $2.98 to $3.04, representing a growth rate of 6.5% to 8.5% from a 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. Long term, our financial goals remain unchanged.
So in summary, we had an excellent third quarter and first 9 months and firmly believe that we are on track to achieve our full year financial goals. 
So with that, I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance."

I'll start with the smokeable products segment. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 1% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, partially offset by trade",808,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the smokeable products segment. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 1% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, partially offset by trade inventory movements. After adjusting for trade inventory movements, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined 3% in the third quarter, in line with PM USA's estimate for total industry decline rate.
For the first 9 months, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined 2%, in line with the industry. As you know, we have seen a moderation in cigarette industry volume declines over the past -- over the last 18 months or so as positive macroeconomic factors have benefited the adult tobacco consumer. While some of these factors are still present, the decline rate appears to be gradually reverting back to long-term historical norms as we expected.
Smokeable segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 0.7 in the third quarter to 47.7%. The margin expansion was driven by higher net pricing and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher resolution expenses and higher SG&A cost as a result of valid initiative spending.
For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 1.6 percentage points to 48.6%, driven by the same factors.
Marlboro continues to innovate to maintain the brand's vibrancy and relevance. Adult smokers and retailers are responding enthusiastically to Marlboro's digital engagement efforts as Marlboro mobile coupon redemptions continue to increase in line with expectations. And recently, PM USA announced the national expansion of Marlboro Slate [ph], a bold menthol product in the Marlboro Black family with innovative packaging featuring soft touch ink.
In cigars, Black & Mild remained the overwhelming leader in the profitable tip segment, though it lost some share overall. Middleton grew Black & Mild's reported volume by 5% in the quarter and 6.7% for the first 9 months, contributing to the smokeable segment's income growth.
In the smokeless products segment, reported shipment volume increased 5.6% in the third quarter and 5.9% for the first 9 months of the year. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that the shipment volume grew by approximately 6% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first 9 months. This growth outpaced the estimated industry volume growth of approximately 3% over the last -- past 6 months.
Smokeless segment adjusted OCI margins declined slightly in the quarter, down 0.3 to 63.5% due primarily to higher manufacturing costs and valid initiative spending.
For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins expanded 1.6 percentage points to 66.1%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix and higher marketing investments.
In wine, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by 8.6% in the quarter and 6.2% for the first 9 months. Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volume grew 6.3% in the third quarter and 5.8% for the first 9 months.
Now for a bit more detail about our beer investment. Altria's investment in SABMiller contributed $299 million in equity earnings in the third quarter and $564 million for the first 9 months.
After the closing of the transaction and through October 24, we used a portion of the cash proceeds to purchase approximately 12 million ordinary shares of AB InBev for a total cost of approximately $1.6 billion. Including these shares, Altria now has approximately 10.2% ownership of AB InBev.
For ownership levels at or above 10%, Altria is entitled to foreign tax credits available in connection with the dividends we received from AB InBev as we were with SABMiller previously.
As a reminder, we will use the equity method of accounting for our investment in AB InBev and will report Altria's share of AB InBev's results using a 1 quarter lag because AB InBev's results will not be available in time to record them in the concurrent period. Previously, Altria recorded results for its SABMiller investment concurrently with Altria's reporting calendar. As we wrap up our results, let me provide a few additional thoughts as we move forward.
In the fourth quarter, PM USA will have one fewer shipping day and Altria will, of course, have the impact of the AB InBev accounting lag. Beyond the fourth quarter, state excise tax increases remain an ongoing challenge. We're closely watching for valid initiatives that will go to vote in November, including a proposed $2 per pack tax increase in California. We're actively engaged on this issue and are prepared for all potential outcomes.
That wraps up our results. Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com, along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations. We posted for your reference a usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items. 
Operator, do we have any questions?"

But as we look forward, I guess, the question that I'm getting a lot of, is the goal to make up for that lag as we think about fiscal '17 and over-deliver on the long-term algorithm next year? Or do you want investors to think more about just continuing 7% to 9% off the reported fiscal '16 base? Because I think acknowledging some of the excise tax uncertainty, et cetera, smokeable trends seem very solid, both price and volume. Smokeless and wine appear strong. And you seem to have a little bit more flexibility than might be usual when we think about your productivity programs and the excess cash that you have to deploy post-ABI. So can you just help us weigh those puts and takes as we think about the next 12 to 15 months?"

And you see we've been able to do that pretty consistently, about 8%, over the last several years. That's basically what the model has been producing but -- and then as we get into each year, we look at all of the factors that we put into our guidance for a given year. And you pointed out some factors that we're going to have to put into the guidance for 2017 given the transaction. What I would like to communicate to investors as opposed to getting ahead of guidance before it's due is how well the businesses are performing. You're right to point out that the businesses are strong and we're doing well but there are some puts and takes every year when you do your guidance and we'll do that when we release our guidance in January. So that's how I would encourage investors to think about it. We'll have more to say about that in a little while."

We pointed out, I think, in the remarks we just made that it's up 0.1 through the third quarter and it's hovering at near record share for the year. Our strategy in this category is to increase our income while maintaining modest share momentum. And actually, if you look at Marlboro from a share perspective, and I'll pick 1 period to say from 2011 forward, we've grown 2 share points. We look at it over time. It's doing its job, and I would say it's doing its job especially well in light of the fact that we had a transaction last year and some owners got new brands and they've obviously been working hard in the marketplace to try to advance them.

Marty mentioned small tuck-in acquisitions from time to time such as Green Smoke or small ones in wine. So we try to put that money to using the best -- to the best use for our shareholders. In the most current period, you saw us put some of that to use, managing the diverse income streams and buying additional shares in ABI.

We're pleased to report that Altria delivered excellent performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2016.

We're pleased to report that Altria delivered excellent performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2016. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.3% in the third quarter and 10.3% for the first 9 months. Our core tobacco businesses delivered another quarter of strong income growth on the strength of their leading premium brands.
Marlboro maintained retail share near record levels, and Copenhagen and Skoal combined delivered yet another quarter of good volume growth and strong retail share growth. We also continued to simplify business processes, streamline infrastructure and invest in important growth initiatives.
In August, our board raised our dividend per share by 8%, marking the 50th increase in the past 47 years. And in September, we further strengthened our balance sheet by tendering for high coupon debt and refinancing it with lower coupon, longer maturity debt. Most recently, with Altria's support of Anheuser-Busch InBev's landmark business combination with SABMiller, we've maximized the value of our SABMiller investment, rewarded our shareholders with an expanded and extended share repurchase program and enhanced our position in the global brewing profit pool.
So with that backdrop, let's look at some of the operating highlights from the quarter and first 9 months.
The smokeable products segment produced solid third quarter results despite difficult year-over-year comparisons. The segment grew adjusted operating company's income 4.2% in the third quarter and 5.8% for the first 9 months of 2016. For comparison, you will remember that in 2015, adjusted OCI grew 11% in the third quarter and over 13% for the first 9 months. The strong year-ago results were driven by several factors, including the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments.
In the third quarter and for the first 9 months of this year, PM USA's total retail share was 51.4%. This represents a 0.1 share point increase for both periods. Marlboro maintained its industry-leading retail share of 44%, up 0.1 share point in the quarter and stable on a year-to-date basis, in line with PM USA's long-term strategy to maximize income, while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro.
The smokeless products segment is executing very well against its long-term strategy to grow volume at or ahead of the category growth rate, while maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. The smokeless products segment grew adjusted OCI by 9.4% in the third quarter and 13.2% for the first 9 months. Further, USSTC grew Copenhagen and Skoal combined retail share by 1.2 share points in the third quarter to 52.6%. It's the highest level since we acquired USSTC. Copenhagen fueled this growth with a retail share increase of 2.7 points in the quarter, due in large part to strong consumer response to Copenhagen Mint.
For the first 9 months, Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share grew 1 share point to 52.2%. In e-vapor, Nu Mark continued its disciplined rollout of MarkTen XL, optimizing its distribution while maximizing marketplace learning. As you know, FDA's final deeming regulations became effective on August 8, about which we'll say more in a moment. Nu Mark has been focused on preparing for deeming and positioning itself to succeed in the new regulatory environment. It has a pipeline of promising e-vapor products, and it continues to enhance its infrastructure and systems to move those products through the required regulatory approval processes.
In the heated tobacco space, we continue to partner with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications for iQOS. PMI recently announced that it remains on track to submit a modified risk tobacco product application to the FDA by the end of this year with a premarket tobacco product application following early next year. At Altria, we continue to make progress on our commercialization strategies for the U.S. market. We're excited about this opportunity and are working closely with PMI to incorporate insights from other iQOS markets.
Speaking of the FDA, a word of color might be useful now that the August effective date of the deeming regulations has passed. First, we're pleased to report that John Middleton and Nu Mark have taken the necessary steps to comply with the regulations, and we believe they are well positioned to move forward with their strategies in the new environment. More generally, all tobacco products are now FDA regulated for us and others in the industry. This means greater regulatory complexity and more resource commitment. 
For the agency, this also means more work and the need to make progress on the existing backlog of substantial equivalence in new product applications, particularly as it prepares for a large volume of applications for newly deemed products. To that end, the agency now appears to be resourced and staffed, which we're seeing reflected in the increased pace of its work across all regulated segments. Our strategy continues to be to focus on complying with the requirements of the act, while engaging constructively with FDA to urge sensible interpretations consistent with the act. We also are encouraging FDA to promote good public policy like harm reduction and to create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation. Through this approach, we aim to maintain a constructive relationship with FDA while protecting the rights of adult tobacco consumers and other important stakeholders.
In other areas, we remain focused on simplification and cost management to improve our core businesses and invest in future growth initiatives. Today, we announced plans to consolidate certain of our operating companies' manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. John Middleton will transfer its Limerick, Pennsylvania operations to the manufacturing center site in Richmond, Virginia. USSTC will transfer its Franklin Park, Illinois operations to its existing factory in Nashville, Tennessee and to the manufacturing center site in Richmond.
Employees affected by the consolidation will be offered the opportunity to transfer into available positions and our hope is that many of them will want to do so. For employees who do not transfer, they will be eligible for enhanced severance and benefits. We expect to complete the consolidation by the first quarter of 2018 and to deliver approximately $50 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2018, over and above the previously announced productivity initiative.
Finally, let's touch briefly on our beer investment. We are very excited that on October 10, Anheuser-Busch InBev completed its business combination with SABMiller. Following the transaction, the new combined group retained the name AB InBev.
In connection with the closing, Altria received roughly 185 million restricted shares of AB InBev, representing a 9.6% ownership of first truly global beer company and one of the world's largest consumer packaged goods companies. We also received approximately $5.3 billion in pretax cash, resulting from the terms of the partial share alternative, including proration and proceeds from the currency derivatives we entered into to hedge our British pound exposure.
As you saw, we also announced our board's decision to expand and extend our previous $1 billion share repurchase program to $3 billion, which we expect to complete by the end of the second quarter of 2018, and Billy will say more about our investment in the combined AB InBev in a moment. 
As to guidance, we reaffirmed this morning our 2016 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $2.98 to $3.04, representing a growth rate of 6.5% to 8.5% from a 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. Long term, our financial goals remain unchanged.
So in summary, we had an excellent third quarter and first 9 months and firmly believe that we are on track to achieve our full year financial goals. 
So with that, I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance."

I'll start with the smokeable products segment. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 1% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, partially offset by trade",807,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the smokeable products segment. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 1% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, partially offset by trade inventory movements. After adjusting for trade inventory movements, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined 3% in the third quarter, in line with PM USA's estimate for total industry decline rate.
For the first 9 months, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined 2%, in line with the industry. As you know, we have seen a moderation in cigarette industry volume declines over the past -- over the last 18 months or so as positive macroeconomic factors have benefited the adult tobacco consumer. While some of these factors are still present, the decline rate appears to be gradually reverting back to long-term historical norms as we expected.
Smokeable segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 0.7 in the third quarter to 47.7%. The margin expansion was driven by higher net pricing and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher resolution expenses and higher SG&A cost as a result of valid initiative spending.
For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 1.6 percentage points to 48.6%, driven by the same factors.
Marlboro continues to innovate to maintain the brand's vibrancy and relevance. Adult smokers and retailers are responding enthusiastically to Marlboro's digital engagement efforts as Marlboro mobile coupon redemptions continue to increase in line with expectations. And recently, PM USA announced the national expansion of Marlboro Slate, a bold menthol product in the Marlboro Black family with innovative packaging featuring soft touch ink.
In cigars, Black & Mild remained the overwhelming leader in the profitable tip segment, though it lost some share overall. Middleton grew Black & Mild's reported volume by 5% in the quarter and 6.7% for the first 9 months, contributing to the smokeable segment's income growth.
In the smokeless products segment, reported shipment volume increased 5.6% in the third quarter and 5.9% for the first 9 months of the year. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that the shipment volume grew by approximately 6% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first 9 months. This growth outpaced the estimated industry volume growth of approximately 3% over the last -- past 6 months.
Smokeless segment adjusted OCI margins declined slightly in the quarter, down 0.3 to 63.5% due primarily to higher manufacturing costs and valid initiative spending.
For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins expanded 1.6 percentage points to 66.1%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix and higher marketing investments.
In wine, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by 8.6% in the quarter and 6.2% for the first 9 months. Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volume grew 6.3% in the third quarter and 5.8% for the first 9 months.
Now for a bit more detail about our beer investment. Altria's investment in SABMiller contributed $299 million in equity earnings in the third quarter and $564 million for the first 9 months.
After the closing of the transaction and through October 24, we used a portion of the cash proceeds to purchase approximately 12 million ordinary shares of AB InBev for a total cost of approximately $1.6 billion. Including these shares, Altria now has approximately 10.2% ownership of AB InBev.
For ownership levels at or above 10%, Altria is entitled to foreign tax credits available in connection with the dividends we received from AB InBev as we were with SABMiller previously.
As a reminder, we will use the equity method of accounting for our investment in AB InBev and will report Altria's share of AB InBev's results using a 1 quarter lag because AB InBev's results will not be available in time to record them in the concurrent period. Previously, Altria recorded results for its SABMiller investment concurrently with Altria's reporting calendar. As we wrap up our results, let me provide a few additional thoughts as we move forward.
In the fourth quarter, PM USA will have one fewer shipping day and Altria will, of course, have the impact of the AB InBev accounting lag. Beyond the fourth quarter, state excise tax increases remain an ongoing challenge. We're closely watching for valid initiatives that will go to vote in November, including a proposed $2 per pack tax increase in California. We're actively engaged on this issue and are preparing for all potential outcomes.
That wraps up our results. Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com, along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations. We posted for your reference a usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items. 
Operator, do we have any questions?"

But as we look forward, I guess, the question that I'm getting a lot of, is the goal to make up for that lag as we think about fiscal '17 and over-deliver on the long-term algorithm next year? Or do you want investors to think more about just continuing 7% to 9% off the reported fiscal '16 base? Because I think acknowledging some of the excise tax uncertainty, et cetera, smokeable trends seem very solid, both price and volume. Smokeless and wine appear strong. And you seem to have a little bit more flexibility than might be usual when we think about your productivity programs and the excess cash that you have to deploy post-ABI. So can you just help us weigh those puts and takes as we think about the next 12 to 15 months?"

That's basically what the model has been producing but -- and then as we get into each year, we look at all of the factors that we put into our guidance for a given year. And you pointed out some factors that we're going to have to put into the guidance for 2017 given the transaction. What I would like to communicate to investors as opposed to getting ahead of guidance before it's due is how well the businesses are performing. You're right to point out that the businesses are strong and we're doing well but there are some puts and takes every year when you do your guidance and we'll do that when we release our guidance in January. So that's how I would encourage investors to think about it. We'll have more to say about that in a little while."

Our strategy in this category is to increase our income while maintaining modest share momentum. And actually, if you look at Marlboro from a share perspective, and I'll pick 1 period to say from 2011 forward, we've grown 2 share points. We look at it over time. It's doing its job, and I would say it's doing its job especially well in light of the fact that we had a transaction last year and some owners got new brands and they've obviously been working hard in the marketplace to try to advance them.

But what we do is we provide sufficient capital to the wine company from time to time so that if they want to make a small acquisition in order to improve their business or to invest in their sales force or to help their distribution capability and the like, we do that and they're a very nice, if small, contributor to Altria. So I want to commend the work they do. They do a terrific job, but I wouldn't want to leave anyone with the idea that we're trying to be a big consolidator in wine because we are not."

We're pleased to report that Altria delivered excellent performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2016.

We're pleased to report that Altria delivered excellent performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2016. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 9.3% in the third quarter and 10.3% for the first 9 months. Our core tobacco businesses delivered another quarter of strong income growth on the strength of their leading premium brands.
Marlboro maintained retail share near record levels, and Copenhagen and Skoal combined delivered yet another quarter of good volume growth and strong retail share growth. We also continued to simplify business processes, streamline infrastructure and invest in important growth initiatives.
In August, our board raised our dividend per share by 8%, marking the 50th increase in the past 47 years. And in September, we further strengthened our balance sheet by tendering for high coupon debt and refinancing it with lower coupon, longer maturity debt. Most recently, with Altria's support of Anheuser-Busch InBev's landmark business combination with SABMiller, we've maximized the value of our SABMiller investment, rewarded our shareholders with an expanded and extended share repurchase program and enhanced our position in the global brewing profit pool.
So with that backdrop, let's look at some of the operating highlights from the quarter and first 9 months.
The smokeable products segment produced solid third quarter results despite difficult year-over-year comparisons. The segment grew adjusted operating company's income 4.2% in the third quarter and 5.8% for the first 9 months of 2016. For comparison, you will remember that in 2015, adjusted OCI grew 11% in the third quarter and over 13% for the first 9 months. The strong year-ago results were driven by several factors, including the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments.
In the third quarter and for the first 9 months of this year, PM USA's total retail share was 51.4%. This represents a 0.1 share point increase for both periods. Marlboro maintained its industry-leading retail share of 44%, up 0.1 share point in the quarter and stable on a year-to-date basis, in line with PM USA's long-term strategy to maximize income, while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro.
The smokeless products segment is executing very well against its long-term strategy to grow volume at or ahead of the category growth rate, while maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. The smokeless products segment grew adjusted OCI by 9.4% in the third quarter and 13.2% for the first 9 months. Further, USSTC grew Copenhagen and Skoal combined retail share by 1.2 share points in the third quarter to 52.6%. It's the highest level since we acquired USSTC. Copenhagen fueled this growth with a retail share increase of 2.7 points in the quarter, due in large part to strong consumer response to Copenhagen Mint.
For the first 9 months, Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share grew 1 share point to 52.2%. In e-vapor, Nu Mark continued its disciplined rollout of MarkTen XL, optimizing its distribution while maximizing marketplace learning. As you know, FDA's final deeming regulations became effective on August 8, about which we'll say more in a moment. Nu Mark has been focused on preparing for deeming and positioning itself to succeed in the new regulatory environment. It has a pipeline of promising e-vapor products, and it continues to enhance its infrastructure and systems to move those products through the required regulatory approval processes.
In the heated tobacco space, we continue to partner with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications for iQOS. PMI recently announced that it remains on track to submit a modified risk tobacco product application to the FDA by the end of this year with a premarket tobacco product application following early next year. At Altria, we continue to make progress on our commercialization strategies for the U.S. market. We're excited about this opportunity and are working closely with PMI to incorporate insights from other iQOS markets.
Speaking of the FDA, a word of color might be useful now that the August effective date of the deeming regulations has passed. First, we're pleased to report that John Middleton and Nu Mark have taken the necessary steps to comply with the regulations, and we believe they are well positioned to move forward with their strategies in the new environment. More generally, all tobacco products are now FDA regulated for us and others in the industry. This means greater regulatory complexity and more resource commitment. 
For the agency, this also means more work and the need to make progress on the existing backlog of substantial equivalence in new product applications, particularly as it prepares for a large volume of applications for newly deemed products. To that end, the agency now appears to be resourced and staffed, which we're seeing reflected in the increased pace of its work across all regulated segments. Our strategy continues to be to focus on complying with the requirements of the act, while engaging constructively with FDA to urge sensible interpretations consistent with the act. We also are encouraging FDA to promote good public policy like harm reduction and to create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation. Through this approach, we aim to maintain a constructive relationship with FDA while protecting the rights of adult tobacco consumers and other important stakeholders.
In other areas, we remain focused on simplification and cost management to improve our core businesses and invest in future growth initiatives. Today, we announced plans to consolidate certain of our operating companies' manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. John Middleton will transfer its Limerick, Pennsylvania operations to the manufacturing center site in Richmond, Virginia. USSTC will transfer its Franklin Park, Illinois operations to its existing factory in Nashville, Tennessee and to the manufacturing center site in Richmond.
Employees affected by the consolidation will be offered the opportunity to transfer into available positions and our hope is that many of them will want to do so. For employees who do not transfer, they will be eligible for enhanced severance and benefits. We expect to complete the consolidation by the first quarter of 2018 and to deliver approximately $50 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2018, over and above the previously announced productivity initiative.
Finally, let's touch briefly on our beer investment. We are very excited that on October 10, Anheuser-Busch InBev completed its business combination with SABMiller. Following the transaction, the new combined group retained the name AB InBev.
In connection with the closing, Altria received roughly 185 million restricted shares of AB InBev, representing a 9.6% ownership of first truly global beer company and one of the world's largest consumer packaged goods companies. We also received approximately $5.3 billion in pretax cash, resulting from the terms of the partial share alternative, including proration and proceeds from the currency derivatives we entered into to hedge our British pound exposure.
As you saw, we also announced our board's decision to expand and extend our previous $1 billion share repurchase program to $3 billion, which we expect to complete by the end of the second quarter of 2018, and Billy will say more about our investment in the combined AB InBev in a moment. 
As to guidance, we reaffirmed this morning our 2016 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $2.98 to $3.04, representing a growth rate of 6.5% to 8.5% from a 2015 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.80. Long term, our financial goals remain unchanged.
So in summary, we had an excellent third quarter and first 9 months and firmly believe that we are on track to achieve our full year financial goals. 
So with that, I'll turn things over to Billy for more detail on our performance."

I'll start with the smokeable products segment. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 1% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, partially offset by trade",807,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the smokeable products segment. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 1% in the third quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, partially offset by trade inventory movements. After adjusting for trade inventory movements, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined 3% in the third quarter, in line with PM USA's estimate for total industry decline rate.
For the first 9 months, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined 2%, in line with the industry. As you know, we have seen a moderation in cigarette industry volume declines over the past -- over the last 18 months or so as positive macroeconomic factors have benefited the adult tobacco consumer. While some of these factors are still present, the decline rate appears to be gradually reverting back to long-term historical norms as we expected.
Smokeable segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 0.7 in the third quarter to 47.7%. The margin expansion was driven by higher net pricing and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher resolution expenses and higher SG&A cost as a result of valid initiative spending.
For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 1.6 percentage points to 48.6%, driven by the same factors.
Marlboro continues to innovate to maintain the brand's vibrancy and relevance. Adult smokers and retailers are responding enthusiastically to Marlboro's digital engagement efforts as Marlboro mobile coupon redemptions continue to increase in line with expectations. And recently, PM USA announced the national expansion of Marlboro Slate, a bold menthol product in the Marlboro Black family with innovative packaging featuring soft touch ink.
In cigars, Black & Mild remained the overwhelming leader in the profitable tip segment, though it lost some share overall. Middleton grew Black & Mild's reported volume by 5% in the quarter and 6.7% for the first 9 months, contributing to the smokeable segment's income growth.
In the smokeless products segment, reported shipment volume increased 5.6% in the third quarter and 5.9% for the first 9 months of the year. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that the shipment volume grew by approximately 6% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first 9 months. This growth outpaced the estimated industry volume growth of approximately 3% over the last -- past 6 months.
Smokeless segment adjusted OCI margins declined slightly in the quarter, down 0.3 to 63.5% due primarily to higher manufacturing costs and valid initiative spending.
For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins expanded 1.6 percentage points to 66.1%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix and higher marketing investments.
In wine, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by 8.6% in the quarter and 6.2% for the first 9 months. Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volume grew 6.3% in the third quarter and 5.8% for the first 9 months.
Now for a bit more detail about our beer investment. Altria's investment in SABMiller contributed $299 million in equity earnings in the third quarter and $564 million for the first 9 months.
After the closing of the transaction and through October 24, we used a portion of the cash proceeds to purchase approximately 12 million ordinary shares of AB InBev for a total cost of approximately $1.6 billion. Including these shares, Altria now has approximately 10.2% ownership of AB InBev.
For ownership levels at or above 10%, Altria is entitled to foreign tax credits available in connection with the dividends we received from AB InBev as we were with SABMiller previously.
As a reminder, we will use the equity method of accounting for our investment in AB InBev and will report Altria's share of AB InBev's results using a 1 quarter lag because AB InBev's results will not be available in time to record them in the concurrent period. Previously, Altria recorded results for its SABMiller investment concurrently with Altria's reporting calendar. As we wrap up our results, let me provide a few additional thoughts as we move forward.
In the fourth quarter, PM USA will have one fewer shipping day and Altria will, of course, have the impact of the AB InBev accounting lag. Beyond the fourth quarter, state excise tax increases remain an ongoing challenge. We're closely watching for valid initiatives that will go to vote in November, including a proposed $2 per pack tax increase in California. We're actively engaged on this issue and are preparing for all potential outcomes.
That wraps up our results. Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com, along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations. We posted for your reference a usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

But as we look forward, I guess, the question that I'm getting a lot of, is the goal to make up for that lag as we think about fiscal '17 and over-deliver on the long-term algorithm next year? Or do you want investors to think more about just continuing 7% to 9% off the reported fiscal '16 base? Because I think acknowledging some of the excise tax uncertainty, et cetera, smokeable trends seem very solid, both price and volume. Smokeless and wine appear strong. And you seem to have a little bit more flexibility than might be usual when we think about your productivity programs and the excess cash that you have to deploy post-ABI.

That's basically what the model has been producing but -- and then as we get into each year, we look at all of the factors that we put into our guidance for a given year. And you pointed out some factors that we're going to have to put into the guidance for 2017 given the transaction. What I would like to communicate to investors as opposed to getting ahead of guidance before its due is how well the businesses are performing. You're right to point out that the businesses are strong and we're doing well but there are some puts and takes every year when you do your guidance and we'll do that when we release our guidance in January. So that's how I would encourage investors to think about it. We'll have more to say about that in a little while."

We pointed out, I think, in the remarks we just made that it's up 0.1 through the third quarter and it's hovering at near record share for the year. Our strategy in this category is to increase our income while maintaining modest share momentum. And actually, if you look at Marlboro from a share perspective, and I'll pick 1 period to say from 2011 forward, we've grown 2 share points. We look at it over time. It's doing its job, and I would say it's doing its job especially well in light of the fact that we had a transaction last year and some owners got new brands and they've obviously been working hard in the marketplace to try to advance them.

And then the final question, I never thought I'd ask this question but just given what's going on globally and things that almost like we're going back in history with globalization of the tobacco industry, but philosophically, like how do you guys think about getting into nontobacco businesses? Like I'm not talking about wine because you made that very clear, but I'm just thinking about some of the core capabilities and competencies you have, your expansive distribution footprint in C stores. I'm just trying to get a sense, have you ever considered or do you consider ever kind of drifting out of the tobacco into other fast-moving goods?"

Our history is that this is a company that owned a lot of different businesses over time, food businesses and other businesses. And I think what we learned over time was that while we have terrific people and lots of resources, we're very, very good at the tobacco business and we know how to run it. That doesn't mean that it's the only business we could run, but you have to be disciplined about what you have to bring to the party so that you can run a business better than somebody else can run the business. So that's the model we use. We're also mindful, of course, of the margins we have and how you're going to deploy capital if you get into other businesses. So we have a highly developed model. Our business development team is consistently running scans to look for what might work but we have to be pretty disciplined about it."
