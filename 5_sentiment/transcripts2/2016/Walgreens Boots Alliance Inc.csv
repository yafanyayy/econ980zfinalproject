I'm pleased to report that the day have started with a comparatively strong first quarter as we expected. Our ongoing goal to control costs across the company and improve adjusted operating income margin is going earnings overall, with adjusted diluted net earnings per share accretively towards, which lines up 32.1% compared with the year-ago period up to $1.03. Although it is early in the year, we are on track to deliver against our expectations.

93624,318730690,916187,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 07, 2016",2016-01-07,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefano. Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Starting with the first quarter highlights.

Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Starting with the first quarter highlights. Net sales were $29 billion, up 48.5% on the same quarter a year ago, largely due to the inclusion of Alliance Boots. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.5 billion. Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion; and diluted EPS was $1.01. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $1.7 billion, up 53.8%. Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion, up 51.1%. And adjusted diluted EPS was $1.03, up 32.1%.
These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the first quarter of fiscal 2015 due to the Alliance Boots transaction in December 2014 and the resulting changes in segmental reporting. Key factors driving our performance versus the same quarter last year were the Alliance Boots transaction and growth in the Retail Pharmacy USA division. 
Total Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $20.4 billion, an increase of 4.2% over the same quarter a year ago. Sales on a comparable store basis increased by 5.8% , driven by strong pharmacy volume and mix. Total sales growth was lower than comparable store sales primarily due to the sale of our infusion business and store closures during the past year.
Adjusted gross margin of 27% was 30 basis points lower, primarily due to  ongoing pharmacy margin pressure. This resulted in $5.5 billion of adjusted gross profit, up 2.7%.
Adjusted SG&A was $4.2 billion, a decrease of 2.1%. This reflects the meaningful progress made on our cost-savings program while maintaining our customer experience.
The divisions adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, up 11.2%, giving an adjusted operating margin of 6.1%, up 40 basis points. Excluding Walgreens' share of equity earnings and Alliance Boots in the year-ago quarter, adjusted operating income per division grew by 22.9%. 
So turning now to look at more detail in pharmacy. Pharmacy sales were up 6.7% for the quarter. 231 million prescriptions were filled on a 30-day basis, including immunizations, an increase of 4.1%. On a comparable store basis, pharmacy sales increased 9.3%, with comparable scripts filled up 4.7%. Overall, we are pleased with our top line growth, especially given the weak spot to the cough cold flu season this year. According to IMS Health, the reported incidence of flu across the U.S.A. declined by 10.7% compared with the year-ago quarter. Our increase in comparable store scripts was driven by Medicare Part D growth strategy where we grew market share and a greater focus of customer care.
This resulted in our refill prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increasing by approximately 20 basis points over the year-ago quarter to 19.2% as reported by IMS Health. 
Consistent with our expectations, we experienced pressure on pharmacy gross margins. These were negatively impacted by lower third party reimbursements, an increase in Medicare Part D mix, our continuing strategy of driving 90-day prescriptions at retail and the mix of specialty drug which carry a lower margin percentage.  This was partially offset by additional branded-to-generic drug conversions. 
Although we continue to anticipate gross margin pressure, we remain confident in our ability to grow pharmacy part of our business over time.
Our strategy to deliver this is to drive access to critical programs such as Medicare Part D through building deeper relationships into developing innovative partnerships such as our recently announced agreement with Valeant. 
Since the quarter end in December, our pharmacy sales were impacted by the continuing weakness in the cough cold flu season. Retail sales decreased by 90 basis points over the first quarter of fiscal 2015, with sales in comparable stores down 60 basis points. This was primarily due to the reduction in unprofitable promotions as we increasingly focused on our key health and beauty categories. Additionally, as part of our strategy, we took seasonal items away from holiday declarations, which were historically sold on Black Friday and in November run-up to Christmas, with higher quality gift of the items that sell throughout the holiday season. This slight anticipated on sales fall in the quarter. 
While gross margin was essentially flat, overall retail profitability increased due to the lower costs. Since the quarter end, December comparable retail sales were relatively flat with positive results from our strategy shift to health and beauty, wellness and seasonal categories, offset by the weak cough, cold, flu season. 
We believe that our fundamental shift towards health and beauty is resonating with our customers and is an important point of differentiation. Having conducted pilots in over 400 stores, we're excited on the positive results we have seen, particularly for No7 and soft and beauty. As previously stated, we are expanding our differentiated beauty offering to approximately 2,000 stores with the rollout plan to begin in summer 2016. 
So turning now to our Retail Pharmacy International division, which was pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in 8 countries, the biggest business being Boots in the U.K. 
Total Retail Pharmacy International sales for the quarter were $3.5 billion. Pro forma constant currency comparable store sales being up by 2.2%. Adjusted gross profit was $1.5 billion with an adjusted gross profit margin of 42.6%. Adjusted SG&A was $1.2 billion. The divisions depreciation charge marginally benefiting from purchase price refinements in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $350 million. The adjusted operating margin of 8.9% being higher than in the seasonally weaker fourth quarter as we expected. 
On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable pharmacy sales for the division were up 3.8%. Comparable retail sales, up 1.3%. U.K. pharmacy comparable sales increased by 3.5%, mainly as a result of additional high-value drugs dispensed in hospital pharmacies, higher average value, higher average pricing value and growth in pharmacy services, such as flu vaccinations. Comparable retail sales growth at Boots UK was 80 basis points. Growth coming mainly from boots.com albeit at a lower rate than in previous quarters. As in August, we've anniversary it's improved order online collective store offer. Cosmetics were the best performing retail category in the U.K, led by strong performance in premium, No7 and Liz Earle, which we acquired in July. In November, we added another exciting brand to our portfolio, Sleep Makeup, which has a young and ethnically diverse customer base. Sleep is sold in over 100 Boots stores [indiscernible] doing with Liz Earle. Outside the U.K., we delivered particularly good comparable sales growth in Mexico and in the Republic of Ireland. That is in Mexico while currently lower operating business in Boots is a key priority for expansion, and we are working hard to find innovative ways to accelerate our store opening program. Since the quarter end, December performance has been encouraging. Boots UK retail sales growth was higher than in the first quarter due to a strong online performance. Sales of our exclusive range of seasonal gifts were particularly good. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Overall, the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division performed in line with our expectations during the quarter. Total sales were $5.8 billion. On a pro forma constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and disposals, comparable sales increased by 3.1% over the same quarter in 2015. This was slightly ahead of our estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales. As in the prior quarter, sales growth was particularly strong in Norway, and we continue to see good growth in Germany and Turkey, 2 of our largest markets. Adjusted operating income was $166 million in the quarter. And the adjusted operating income margin was 2.9%.
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the Alliance Boots program were $288 million. So we are very much on track to deliver our goal of reaching at least $1 billion in fiscal 2016.
As I said on the year-end call, we continue to intensify in action many other synergies, which is simply not practical to quantify as they blend into our core operations. At the same time, we're continuing to make good progress to deliver our $1.5 billion cost-savings program and remain on track to achieve this target by the end of fiscal 2017. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $732 million, reflecting our typical seasonal building inventories. As I said on the last call, we continue to seek ways to deliver further working capital efficiencies, particularly in the U.S.
Capital expenditure in the quarter totaled $340 million, which was just below the amount spent in the fourth quarter of last year. This reflects our drive, which I again talked about on our last call to invest in key areas to develop our customer proposition, including information technology.
Free cash flow for the quarter therefore netted to $392 million. 
Since our Rite Aid announcement, we've made good progress with the funding. In December, we completed the placement of $5 billion term loan facilities and the syndication of a new $7.8 billion bridge facility. These new facilities replaced our previously reported $12.8 billion bridge facility commitment.  Entering, of course, subject to the closing of the acquisition.
So let me now conclude with some comments on guidance for fiscal 2016. As you will have seen in this morning's press release, we've raised the lower end of our fiscal '16 guidance by $0.05 per share to a range of $4.30 to $4.55. This continues to assume no material accretion from the agreement to acquire Rite Aid, the previously announced suspension of the balance of the $3 billion share buyback program, continuation of our normal antidilution buyback program relating to stock incentives, but no significant changes in currency exchange rates. Please remember that we have currency transitional exposure based primarily on the movement in the pound sterling versus the dollar. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating income and EPS but it can also cause quarterly volatility in the sales gross margin and SG&A item lines.
The guidance I have just provided reflects current currency rates and some factors in headwind of around $0.03 since we've provided our initial fiscal year '16 guidance back in October.
So I'll now have you back to Stefano."

In the first quarter, and I want to come back on [indiscernible]. I would like first to provide you on a few other things we have been working on in the quarter and since [indiscernible] has that had any impact on the quarterly performance under review. As you have heard, we are not assuming that our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid will provide any material accretion in fiscal 2015 [ph]. But I will reiterate that this transaction is progressing as we have expected and implied. We continue to anticipate completing the acquisition in the second half of calendar year 2016. The transaction remains subject to our core values of Rite Aid shareholders, regulatory clearances and other customary conditions. Rite Aid have issued their prophecy and their accordance of meeting to approve the transaction and scheduled for the 4th [ph] of February. We are until we can to work with the [indiscernible]. 
You will have seen, as we expected, that we have received the second request from the FTC for additional information. This is the standard part of the regulatory process in connection with the FTC's review. Shortly after the announcement of the proposed acquisition, we have appointed highly resilient experienced team, which has been up and running since the end of November. They are now well underway on preliminary planning work. In December, we also announced our agreement with Valeant Pharmaceuticals. These agreements today U.S. market as some similarities that will work with the from pharmaceutical company in Europe. It is a very good example of how we can are consequently exiting express an understanding from one market to another. The 2 main parts of the agreement combines to provide Valeant with the opportunity to serve a far wider patient base at a significantly lower cost and the potential to both grow their business and improve convenience and service level at an overall savings to their [indiscernible] system. From our point of view, we have the potential to offer patients the medications they want and that they are being prescribed with the high standard of counseling and service that makes good use of our infrastructure and professional capabilities. 
So as we look at our business today and what we have seen in our dynamics in a changing market, it's a resurgence in number of global teams that to be [indiscernible]. In Eckerd, we are continuing to see increasing demand on the existing system for both preventive and therapeutic treatments. This is only compounded by the inflationary pressure on new, innovative and high costs equity. It is to mitigate pressure and provide more and better care at lower cost, our pharma systems are being one of the most convenient, flexible and lowest cost means of meeting the challenges that which the system faces. Our agreement with Valeant demonstrates how we can use our pharmacy network to improve access and service level while reducing cost in the health care system. 
And we have seen in Europe and elsewhere, we believe that we are working in close alignment into partnership with [indiscernible] sector, we can achieve everything, both in service level, care, cost savings and of course, in financial reward for both our partner and ourself. This is why I want the partnership to become a characteristic for which our company will be known as good partnerships delivery value. As you know, our pharmacy services operate in close alignment with our regional activities. The retail, we have the beginning of a journey to focus on our customers to meet and to differentiate our retail offers. We have seen real changes taking effect and supported by good operational disciplines, this will deliver growth on the future. Like all other retailers, we have also seen an acceleration in the U.S. in customers moving towards omnichannel retail, with online shopping working in parallel in the integrated physical stores. This is a trend that we have seen in many of our markets, most particularly in the U.K., where we have adopted our model to embrace these trends. We will now decide how to [indiscernible] services and experience to maximize the opportunities to which this presents worldwide. Today, we have delivered what I believe to be a strong performance of a business in a positive transformation. Looking forward, there is no doubt that we still have a lot of work to do with within our core business to optimize their existing market, we introduce new products, services and ways to further enhance our spending with our customers. These are fundamental drivers that I believe will help us to deliver the long-term earnings growth that we are confident in achieving. As a company, we continue to look at new areas of business to add to our portfolio and continue to fight opportunities complementary to our core operations professionally, commercially and geographically that will help us grow the business and enhance its financial performance. Ultimately, our success relies on the quality and commitment of our people globally, their experience, expertise and drive will improve our business everyday. The commitment I see from our team give me great confidence that we will deliver what we have signaled for fiscal 2016 and beyond.

As I've said we had -- looking at the sales with omnichannel is a good boots.com in particular a very important order for our strategy. We did in the summer anniversary, just the beginning of August, our much faster online collection in-store offers. So we have seen the impact of the growth of that come with food and the anniversary then we brought in some new developments, so we sort this improvement coming back up again and into this the December numbers, which together with the strongest in that we had a good Christmas and what's been a particularly competitive environment. So in that of those businesses, it's really about having a differentiated from some store offer and then increasingly supported omnichannel. Of course, in transferring the U.K., we're able to piggyback on the Alliance Healthcare distribution system to do that is so if you look at Boots performance and it's still early, early days. We are just starting to see some of the features from the competitors on the high street but I think what's coming through pretty clear is Boots is continuing to be a real winner there. In terms of the margin, really, 2 points: One is there's of seasonal impact given the importance of the retail part of our offerings in Retail Pharmacy International. And of course, we started to see the buildup in November because it tends to be that people start their Christmas shopping a little bit earlier in Europe than would be the case here in the United States. So the seasonal element. And then as I said also in the presentation, we have got a little bit of benefit in this quarter from the finalizing of the world working towards finalizing our purchase price adjustments, the fair values that you have to do on the acquisition of Alliance Boots. And with got a little bit of and if it is there, which helped the margin in this quarter that we won't see when you come and look at the quarter, the same first quarter in 12 months' time. But the key factor is that there is seasonality. And of course, as we look towards the second quarter, we're we have a very important holiday trading for December results and early January you will also see the benefit of that come in through on the next call."

I am pleased to report that the day started with a comparatively strong first quarter as we expected. Our ongoing goal to control costs across the company and improve adjusted operating income margin is growing earnings overall with adjusted diluted net earnings per share appreciatively to Walgreens Boots Alliance, up 32.1% compared with the year ago period  to $1.03. Although it is early in the year, we are on track to deliver against our expectations. In addition to the encouraging organic results from all 3 of our divisions, we continue to work hard to develop the company. We have taken a significant step forward with our proposed agreement to acquire Rite Aid and we remain focused on building a new partnership.

On an adjusted basis, operating income was $1.7 billion, up 53.8%. Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion, up 51.1%. And adjusted diluted EPS was $1.03, up 32.1%.
These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the first quarter of fiscal 2015 due to the Alliance Boots transaction in December 2014 and the resulting changes in segmental reporting. 
Key factors driving our performance versus the same quarter last year were the Alliance Boots transaction and growth in the Retail Pharmacy USA division. 
Total Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $20.4 billion, an increase of 4.2% over the same quarter a year ago. Sales on a comparable store basis increased by 5.8% , driven by strong pharmacy volume and mix. Total sales growth was lower than comparable store sales primarily due to the sale of our infusion business and store closures during the past year. Adjusted gross margin of 27% was 30 basis points lower, primarily due to ongoing pharmacy margin pressure. This resulted in $5.5 billion of adjusted gross profit, up 2.7%.
Adjusted SG&A was $4.2 billion, a decrease of 2.1%. This reflects the meaningful progress made on our cost-savings program while maintaining our customer experience.
The division's adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, up 11.2%, giving an adjusted operating margin of 6.1%, up 40 basis points. Excluding Walgreens' share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the year ago quarter, adjusted operating income for the division grew by 22.9%. 
So turning now to look in more detail at pharmacy. Pharmacy sales were up 6.7% for the quarter. 231 million prescriptions were filled on a 30-day basis including immunizations, an increase of 4.1%. On a comparable store basis, pharmacy sales increased 9.3% with comparable scripts filled up 4.7%. Overall, we are pleased with our top line growth especially given the weak spot through the cough, cold, flu season this year. According to IMS Health, the reported incidence of flu across the U.S.A. declined by 10.7% compared with the year ago quarter. Our increase in comparable store scripts was driven by our Medicare Part D growth strategy where we grew market share and a greater focus on customer care. This resulted in our refill prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increasing by approximately 20 basis points over the year ago quarter to 19.2% as reported by IMS Health. 
Consistent with our expectations, we experienced pressure on pharmacy gross margins. These were negatively impacted by lower third-party reimbursements, an increase in Medicare Part D mix, our continuing strategy of driving 90-day prescriptions at retail and the mix of specialty drugs, which carry a lower margin percentage.  This was partially offset by additional branded-to-generic drug conversions. 
Although we continue to anticipate gross margin pressure, we remain confident in our ability to grow pharmacy part of our business over time. Our strategy to deliver this is to drive access through critical programs such as Med Part D through building deeper payer relationships and through developing innovative partnerships such as our recently announced agreement with Valeant. 
Since the quarter end in December, our pharmacy sales were impacted by the continuing weakness in the cough, cold, flu season. Retail sales decreased by 90 basis points over the first quarter of fiscal 2015 with sales in comparable stores down 60 basis points. This was primarily due to a reduction in unprofitable promotions as we increasingly focused on our key health and beauty categories. Additionally, as part of our strategy, we transitioned seasonal items away from holiday decorations, which were historically sold on Black Friday and in the November run-up to Christmas with higher quality giftable items that sell throughout the holiday season. This led to an anticipated fall in sales in the quarter. 
While gross margin was essentially flat, overall retail profitability increased due to the lower costs. Since the quarter end, December comparable retail sales were relatively flat with positive results from our strategic shift to health and beauty, wellness and seasonal categories offset by the weak cough, cold, flu season. 
We believe that our fundamental shift towards health and beauty is resonating with our customers and is an important point of differentiation. Having conducted pilots in over 400 stores, we're excited on the positive results we have seen, particularly for No7 and Soap & Glory. As previously indicated, we are expanding our differentiated beauty offering to approximately 2,000 stores with the rollout plan to begin in summer 2016. 
So turning now to our Retail Pharmacy International division, which is pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in 8 countries, the biggest business being Boots in the U.K. Total Retail Pharmacy International sales for the quarter were $3.5 billion, pro forma constant currency comparable store sales being up by 2.2%. Adjusted gross profit was $1.5 billion with an adjusted gross profit margin of 42.6%. 
Adjusted SG&A was $1.2 billion, the division's depreciation charge marginally benefiting from purchase price accounting refinements in the quarter. 
Adjusted operating income was $315 million, the adjusted operating margin of 8.9% being higher than in the seasonally weaker fourth quarter as we expected. 
On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable pharmacy sales for the division were up 3.8%. Comparable retail sales, up 1.3%. Boots UK's comparable pharmacy sales increased by 3.5%, mainly as a result of additional high-value drugs dispensed in its hospital pharmacies, higher average value -- higher average price and value and growth in pharmacy services such as flu vaccinations. Comparable retail sales growth at Boots UK was 80 basis points, growth coming mainly from boots.com albeit at a lower rate than in previous quarters, and in August, Boots anniversaried its improved order online collect in-store offer. Cosmetics were the best performing retail category in the U.K, led by a strong performance in Premium, No7 and Liz Earle, which we acquired in July. In November, we added another exciting brand to our portfolio, Sleek MakeUP, which has a young and ethnically diverse customer base. Sleek is currently sold in over 100 Boots stores.  
[Audio Gap] 
in doing with Liz Earle. 
Outside the U.K., we delivered particularly good comparable sales growth in Mexico and in the Republic of Ireland. Benavides in Mexico, while currently a lower operating margin business in Boots, is a key priority for expansion and we are working hard to find innovative ways to accelerate our store opening program. 
Since the quarter end, December performance has been encouraging. Boots UK's retail sales growth was higher than in the first quarter due to a strong online performance. Sales of our exclusive range of seasonal gifts were particularly good. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Overall, the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division performed in line with our expectations during the quarter. Total sales were $5.8 billion. On a pro forma constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and disposals, comparable sales increased by 3.1% over the same quarter in 2015. This was slightly ahead of our estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales. As in the prior quarter, sales growth was particularly strong in Norway and we continue to see good growth in Germany and Turkey, 2 of our largest markets. Adjusted operating income was $166 million in the quarter and the adjusted operating income margin was 2.9%.
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the Alliance Boots program were $288 million. So we are very much on track to deliver our goal of reaching at least $1 billion in fiscal 2016.
As I said on the year-end call, we continue to identify and action many other synergies, which is simply not practical to quantify as they blend into our core operations. At the same time, we're continuing to make good progress to deliver our $1.5 billion cost-savings program and remain on track to achieve this target by the end of fiscal 2017. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $732 million, reflecting our typical seasonal build in inventories. As I said on the last call, we continue to seek ways to deliver further working capital efficiencies, particularly in the U.S.
Capital expenditure in the quarter totaled $340 million, which was just below the amount spent in the fourth quarter of last year. This reflects our drive, which I again talked about on our last call, to invest in key areas that develop our customer proposition including information technology.
Free cash flow for the quarter therefore netted to $392 million. 
Since our Rite Aid announcement, we've made good progress with the funding. In December, we completed the placement of $5 billion term loan facilities and the syndication of a new $7.8 billion bridge facility. These new facilities replaced our previously reported $12.8 billion bridge facility commitment. Drawings are, of course, subject to the closing of the acquisition.
So let me now conclude with some comments on guidance for fiscal 2016. As you will have seen in this morning's press release, we've raised the lower end of our fiscal '16 guidance by $0.05 per share to a range of $4.30 to $4.55. This continues to assume no material accretion from the agreement to acquire Rite Aid, the previously announced suspension of the balance of the $3 billion share buyback program, continuation of our normal antidilutive buyback program relating to stock incentives and no significant changes in currency exchange rates. Please remember that we have currency translational exposure based primarily on the movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating income and EPS, but it can also cause quarterly volatility in the sales gross margin and SG&A item lines.
The guidance I have just provided reflects current currency rates and so factors in a headwind of around $0.03 since we've provided our initial fiscal year '16 guidance back in October.
So I'll now hand you back to Stefano."

So the company has performed well overall in the first quarter and I want to come back to that in a moment. But I would like first to update you on a few other things that we have been working on in the quarter and since its progress that has not had a very big impact on the quarterly performance under review. As you have heard, we are not assuming that our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid will provide any material accretion in fiscal 2016, but I would reiterate that this transaction is progressing as we expected and planned. We continue to anticipate completing the acquisition in the second half of calendar year 2016. The transaction remains subject to approval by the Rite Aid shareholders, regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. Rite Aid had issued their proxy and they have called a meeting to approve the transaction scheduled for the 4th of February. We are continuing to work closely with the regulators. 
You will have seen, as we expected, that we have received a second request from the FTC for additional information. This is the standard part of the regulatory process in connection with the FTC's review. Shortly after the announcement of the proposed acquisition, we appointed highly experienced integration team, which has been up and running since the end of November. They are now well underway on preliminary planning work. 
In December, we also announced our agreement with Valeant Pharmaceuticals. This agreement, though new to the U.S. market, has some similarities to the way it will work with a number of pharmaceutical companies in Europe. It is a very good example of how we can transfer existing experience and understanding from one market and adapting to another. The 2 main parts of the agreement combine to provide Valeant with the opportunity to serve a far wider patient base at a significantly lower cost and the potential to both grow their business and improve convenience and service level at an overall savings to their entire system. 
From our point of view, we have the potential to offer patients the medications they want and they are being prescribed with a high standard of counseling and service in a manner that makes good use of our infrastructure and professional capabilities. 
So as we look at our business today and what we are seeing in our dynamics in a changing market, it refers to a number of global teams that I believe to be inevitable for some time. In health care, we are continuing to see increasing demand on the existing system for both preventive and therapeutic treatments. This is only compounded by inflationary pressure of new, innovative and correspondingly high cost [indiscernible]. In order to mitigate this pressure and provide more and better care at lower costs, our pharma systems are being one of the most convenient, flexible and lowest cost means of meeting the challenges which the system faces. Our agreement with Valeant demonstrates how we can use our pharmacy network to improve access and service level while reducing costs in the health care system. 
As we have seen in Europe and elsewhere, we believe that the way we work in close alignment and through partnership with Valeant in the sector, we can achieve immense benefits both in service level, therapeutic care, cost savings, and of course, in financial reward for both our partner and ourselves. This is why I want the partnership to become a characteristic for which our company will be known as good partnerships deliver real value. As you know, our pharmacy services operate in close alignment with our retail activities. In retail, we have a beginning of a journey to focus on our customers' true need and to differentiate our retail offers. We have seen real changes taking effect, and supported by good operational discipline, this will deliver growth for the future. 
Like all other retailers, we are also seeing an acceleration in the U.S. in customers moving towards omnichannel retail with online shopping working in parallel and integrated with physical stores. This is a trend that we have seen in many of our markets, most particularly in the U.K. where we have adopted our model to embrace this trend. We will now decide how to deploy our services and experience to maximize the opportunities, which this trend presents worldwide. Today, we have delivered what I believe to be a strong performance of a business in a process of transformation. 
Looking forward, there is no doubt that we still have a lot of work to do within our core businesses. To optimize them for their existing markets, we introduce new products, services and ways of working and to further enhance our spending with our customers. These are fundamental drivers that I believe will help us to deliver the long-term earnings growth that we are confident in achieving. As a company, we continue to look at new areas of business to add to our portfolio and continue to find opportunities complementary to our core operations professionally, commercially and geographically that will help us grow the business and enhance its financial performance. Ultimately, our success relies on the quality and commitment of our people globally. Their experience, expertise and drive will improve our business every day. The commitment I see from our team give me great confidence that we will deliver what we have signaled for fiscal 2016 and beyond.

We've swapped our photo labs for dry photo labs using digital technology and obviously it's been a great success on the cost side, but also important in the growth side as well. So these are some of the structural changes that we have been doing so far.

We have a very strong operational and IT team here and we're working on all the things we can do to reduce workload throughout the company, but particularly for the stores so we can take better care of the customers and we've got a lot more to go at both in the plan and other ideas that we will develop over the next period. So we believe these are sustainable changes. We believe, importantly, the customer care numbers that we measure in time we -- are going up as well. So we're moving work, taking better care of customers, taking bad costs out and starting now to reinvest back in the costs that are most important to the customers, more people in our shops as appropriate and obviously gaining the value proposition right as well for customers both in pharmacy and also in the front end. So essentially we're on our cost program bang on track and more to come on developing more opportunities in the future."

I think, Stefano, you'd said merger is always preferred and that makes sense because then you have control. On the other side, going on Lisa's question with maybe agreement or partnership of something of this sort, what do you need to have accomplished in something like that? And what are the challenges in making sure the sort of economic benefit to the 2 sides are equivalent and that both parties are sort of working for the good of each other and the customer. I mean, what are maybe conceptually the things that you think you need to get out of it and then I stated some of the obvious challenges. But what are some of the others in terms of not having necessarily control over the whole relationship and only hoping that your partner, whomever that may be, sort of participates in the same way? Obviously, you've got there on Valeant and you've done it before, so I just love sort of some broad context."

What we want is to do something, which creates value, long-term, sustainable value. We have never spoken about control. We have done many, many deal where at the end we have a lot of control and it's by chance that many of our managers have come back and this was not in fact. It was just the force of things. When you merge a company, when you merge 2 companies, you have 1 company and of course all the people of the previous 2 companies are members of the new company and you have just to try to select the best people for the best hope.  And the people can come from everywhere. So we have never ever, I can tell you, I can assure you, have never ever done a deal with the idea of controlling the resulting company, first of all. Secondly, so we are open at a merger, we are open at a merger where we could have the control, a merger where we could see that the control a merger of equals. We will be open to everything which would create, I repeat, substantial and sustainable value immediately and in the future for the company. This is for the merger. For the commercial partnership, of course you can imagine many, many different kinds of commercial partnerships. Valeant is a really good example, but there are other kinds of partnership that you can do. On the cost side, on the margin side, creating synergies that you can share and there is not a market where every time you have to discuss and you have to see what is the best way to create value and how to share the value. But if you approach these discussions with an open mind, I mean, sometimes it's possible to find a solution. Alex, you have seen many of these joint ventures, commercial joint ventures in the past, so you can say something maybe?"

Yes, I think the thing that's important here is to create a win-win. And for example, in Valeant, what we see is the opportunity to really take friction out for customers and patients and doctors and pharmacists so they can spend more time with patients and therefore patients win. So the whole idea behind Valeant as, I think, Stefano said in the introduction, really is about taking friction and cost out of the interactions between health care professionals and giving more time to customers. We're becoming more of a services company. We'll be faced with things which have to do with the job of a pharmacist, which is about providing -- actually dispensing and making sure you understand the drugs properly and that is great for a pharmacist and great for profession. And we're committed, as Valeant have committed as to, over time, ensuring that we independently monitor what we deliver at all costs in this system as a result of working definitely together. Last example we're developing in the U.S. and we will take the time to get this right and make sure that we implement in a way that is appropriate for the system that will work in America. There's lots of examples in Europe, which are -- we could go into as well in terms of not just retail locally in a way that creates win-wins and ensures that we deliver better care at lower costs and that's really what the partnership strategy is all about."

They're becoming more sophisticated, as we also know, being paid for some services within these contracts. And again, we're determined to get better value and better care within these contracts.

I mean, there's always an element of mix, but I think that one of the factors that I've tried to draw in is obviously we're continuing in -- the biggest business is Boots in the UK is the biggest business and the division continue to perform well. As I've said we had -- and looking at the sales with omnichannel is -- at boots.com in particular, is a very important part of our growth strategy. We did in the summer anniversary, just the beginning of August, our much faster online collect in-store offers. So we've seen the impact of the growth of that coming through, then the anniversary, then we brought in some new developments. So we saw this improvement coming then back up again into the December numbers, which, together with the strong gifting meant that we've had a good Christmas in what's been a particularly competitive environment. So in those businesses, it's really about having a differentiated front of store offer and then increasingly supported by omnichannel. Of course, in Boots in the U.K., we're able to piggyback on the Alliance Healthcare distribution system to do that. So if you look at Boots' performance and certainly it's still early, early days, we're just starting to see some of the features from the -- from our competitors on the high street, but I think what's coming through pretty clear is that Boots is continuing to be a real winner there. In terms of the margin, really 2 points. One is there's always a seasonal impact given the importance of the retail part of our offerings in Retail Pharmacy International. And of course, we started to see the buildup in November because it tends to be that people start their Christmas shopping a little bit earlier in Europe than would be the case here in the United States. So there's a seasonal element. And then as I said also in the presentation, we've got a little bit of a benefit in this quarter from the finalizing of the -- we're working towards finalizing our purchase price adjustments, the fair values that you have to do on the acquisition of Alliance Boots and we've got a little bit of benefit there, which helped the margin in this quarter that we won't see when you come and look at the quarter, the same first quarter in 12 months' time. But the key factor is the seasonality. And of course, as we look towards the second quarter where we've got a very important holiday trading, the December results and into early January, you'll also see the benefit of that coming through on the next call."

Generic inflation, going to the last part of the question first, is not material. So therefore we are feeling pretty good about this and is factored into our guidance going forward. The trends beyond that really are the same trends: we have ongoing reimbursement pressure as we work with the market to lower costs. They are more or less as we expected and the trend will continue in the same fashion. It's something we're used to in Europe, as we said before. I've worked in Europe for many, many years and it's a trend that we expect to see because as health care expands and government pays more and patients pay more then you've got to become more efficient in the market as we commit to doing. And on the front-end margin, we are pleased with the profitability as we continue to swap out old products. I mean, as George said in his introduction, we took out all of the older sort of home decoration products, which primarily sell in November and we are replacing these with more giftables. But this was really the first year of that transition. We had great support from some of our partners, so we have more plans to shift that mix next Christmas. And also importantly, we have a viewed 2,00 where again we're shifting the mix towards more beauty products, owned brand beauty products, from Ken's organization with the launch of these products in over 1/2 of those extra stores to get to 2,000 stores by somewhere around Christmas next year. So the trends are very similar, to be honest. We are pretty predictable. Maybe the one that was a bit less flexible was promotional markets where again we give great promotions throughout the autumn so we have to adjust that a little bit to our period. And of course, that's important to see in the markets they compare to, which we are doing. So really, trends are the same. We adjust as we go, though the fundamentals are the same."

I think related to that, secondly to your point, they've been investing wisely in their best stores and they're getting from the numbers that the team speak about and they will confirm they're getting nice lifts in their [indiscernible] stores. To be honest, as we reviewed some of the stuff we did in the Well Experience, we hadn't been successful in the past, maybe 2 or 3 years ago, with some of the lifts.

In terms of why Valeant, well, because of the fact that they came to us and they've asked us would we be able to keep their end of the business, in particular, with the situation that we're in. We did appropriate due diligence and we decided it's a good opportunity to take some of the lessons that the team, particularly Alex's team in Europe, had learned about attractive pharmacy model in wholesale. So we saw the opportunity to lift and shift the best practice in Europe into Valeant and they liked the idea, I mean, walked through it pretty quickly and got to a good place in a pretty short of period of time. They're a great team to work with and we wish Mike a very speedy recovery.

In reality, you don't have to measure us for the quarter, taking all the different elements of our company quarter-by-quarter. We have a long-term project. We are following this project independently on the quarter and so you will see sometimes better rewards or KPIs and these would not be always the same. You have to judge on the whole overall and you'll see that overall we will continue to progress. As we have clearly demonstrated in the last 4 quarters, every quarter we progress and it's a mix of everything we do. The gross margin is important, but at the end of the day, what is really important is the operating margin. It's the earnings that we are talking, that we can attract from an operation. And sometimes you have to sacrifice the gross profit because the lower increase in the gross profit or in the gross margin can be very expensive to achieve a level cost or in other costs. So we have always a holistic view and this, our holistic view, is extended over a longer period of time and not over a quarter. Maybe you can answer in detail, but this is the logic obviously."

So in photographic, we were just substantially are operating costs by removing more expensive to maintain, more difficult to use and requiring more people to use them wet labs, the old labs. We removed all of them very quickly in a period of 18 months across all the states and replaced them with a new digital technology, which, in essence, reduces the gross margin. Actually, because of the operating cost, the advantage of that system drives 2 things. It drives volume, we had a very strong volume average for the period. And as part of the flat sales George mentioned in holding the number of periods, that was a driver up the way of sales. And also we have been able to offer better value to customers and we're very pleased with the performance in that country. We have really been driven a big differential and that's been also transported to Boots as well. Boots is using the same platform with the same effect over in the U.K. It's another great example of what we mean by operating margin. In terms of costs going forward, we remain confident in our cost plan. We're on track. People's attitude toward this has been fantastic. The teams have done a great job and customer care scores are up because we're taking more costs out. So going forward, you should expect to seeing the same activities. Now how they fall quarter-over-quarter, as Stefano said, some things vary depending on a number of factors, but the strategy we're implementing is a very clear strategy and we're very pleased with the progress."

Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Starting with the first quarter highlights. Net sales were $29 billion, up 48.5% on the same quarter a year ago, largely due to the inclusion of Alliance Boots.",1699,"Thank you, Stefano. Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. 
Starting with the first quarter highlights. Net sales were $29 billion, up 48.5% on the same quarter a year ago, largely due to the inclusion of Alliance Boots. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.5 billion. Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion. And diluted EPS was $1.01. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $1.7 billion, up 53.8%. Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion, up 51.1%. And adjusted diluted EPS was $1.03, up 32.1%.
These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the first quarter of fiscal 2015 due to the Alliance Boots transaction in December 2014 and the resulting changes in segmental reporting. 
Key factors driving our performance versus the same quarter last year were the Alliance Boots transaction and growth in the Retail Pharmacy USA division. 
Total Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $20.4 billion, an increase of 4.2% over the same quarter a year ago. Sales on a comparable store basis increased by 5.8% , driven by strong pharmacy volume and mix. Total sales growth was lower than comparable store sales primarily due to the sale of our infusion business and store closures during the past year. Adjusted gross margin of 27% was 30 basis points lower, primarily due to ongoing pharmacy margin pressure. This resulted in $5.5 billion of adjusted gross profit, up 2.7%.
Adjusted SG&A was $4.2 billion, a decrease of 2.1%. This reflects the meaningful progress made on our cost-savings program while maintaining our customer experience.
The division's adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, up 11.2%, giving an adjusted operating margin of 6.1%, up 40 basis points. Excluding Walgreens' share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the year ago quarter, adjusted operating income for the division grew by 22.9%. 
So turning now to look in more detail at pharmacy. Pharmacy sales were up 6.7% for the quarter. 231 million prescriptions were filled on a 30-day basis including immunizations, an increase of 4.1%. On a comparable store basis, pharmacy sales increased 9.3% with comparable scripts filled up 4.7%. Overall, we are pleased with our top line growth especially given the weak spot through the cough, cold, flu season this year. According to IMS Health, the reported incidence of flu across the U.S.A. declined by 10.7% compared with the year ago quarter. Our increase in comparable store scripts was driven by our Medicare Part D growth strategy where we grew market share and a greater focus on customer care. This resulted in our refill prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increasing by approximately 20 basis points over the year ago quarter to 19.2% as reported by IMS Health. 
Consistent with our expectations, we experienced pressure on pharmacy gross margins. These were negatively impacted by lower third-party reimbursements, an increase in Medicare Part D mix, our continuing strategy of driving 90-day prescriptions at retail and the mix of specialty drugs, which carry a lower margin percentage.  This was partially offset by additional branded-to-generic drug conversions. 
Although we continue to anticipate gross margin pressure, we remain confident in our ability to grow pharmacy part of our business over time. Our strategy to deliver this is to drive access through critical programs such as Med Part D through building deeper payer relationships and through developing innovative partnerships such as our recently announced agreement with Valeant. 
Since the quarter end in December, our pharmacy sales were impacted by the continuing weakness in the cough, cold, flu season. Retail sales decreased by 90 basis points over the first quarter of fiscal 2015 with sales in comparable stores down 60 basis points. This was primarily due to a reduction in unprofitable promotions as we increasingly focused on our key health and beauty categories. Additionally, as part of our strategy, we transitioned seasonal items away from holiday decorations, which were historically sold on Black Friday and in the November run-up to Christmas, with higher quality giftable items that sell throughout the holiday season. This led to an anticipated fall in sales in the quarter. 
While gross margin was essentially flat, overall retail profitability increased due to the lower costs. Since the quarter end, December comparable retail sales were relatively flat with positive results from our strategic shift to health and beauty, wellness and seasonal categories offset by the weak cough, cold, flu season. 
We believe that our fundamental shift towards health and beauty is resonating with our customers and is an important point of differentiation. Having conducted pilots in over 400 stores, we're excited by the positive results we have seen, particularly for No7 and Soap & Glory. As previously indicated, we are expanding our differentiated beauty offering to approximately 2,000 stores with the rollout plan to begin in summer 2016. 
So turning now to our Retail Pharmacy International division, which is pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in 8 countries, the biggest business being Boots in the U.K. Total Retail Pharmacy International sales for the quarter were $3.5 billion, pro forma constant currency comparable store sales being up by 2.2%. Adjusted gross profit was $1.5 billion with an adjusted gross profit margin of 42.6%. 
Adjusted SG&A was $1.2 billion, the division's depreciation charge marginally benefiting from purchase price accounting refinements in the quarter. 
Adjusted operating income was $350 million, the adjusted operating margin of 8.9% being higher than in the seasonally weaker fourth quarter as we expected. 
On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable pharmacy sales for the division were up 3.8% with comparable retail sales up 1.3%. Boots UK's comparable pharmacy sales increased by 3.5%, mainly as a result of additional high-value drugs dispensed in its hospital pharmacies, higher average value -- higher average price and value and growth in pharmacy services such as flu vaccinations. Comparable retail sales growth at Boots UK was 80 basis points, growth coming mainly from boots.com albeit at a lower rate than in previous quarters, as in August, Boots anniversaried its improved order online collect in-store offer. Cosmetics were the best performing retail category in the U.K, led by a strong performance in Premium, No7 and Liz Earle, which we acquired in July. In November, we added another exciting brand to our portfolio, Sleek MakeUP, which has a young and ethnically diverse customer base. Sleek is currently sold in over 100 Boots stores.  
[Audio Gap] 
in doing with Liz Earle. 
Outside the U.K., we delivered particularly good comparable sales growth in Mexico and in the Republic of Ireland. Benavides in Mexico, while currently a lower operating margin business than Boots, is a key priority for expansion and we are working hard to find innovative ways to accelerate our store opening program. 
Since the quarter end, December performance has been encouraging. Boots UK's retail sales growth was higher than in the first quarter due to a strong online performance. Sales of our exclusive range of seasonal gifts were particularly good. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Overall, the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division performed in line with our expectations during the quarter. Total sales were $5.8 billion. On a pro forma constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and disposals, comparable sales increased by 3.1% over the same quarter in 2015. This was slightly ahead of our estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales. As in the prior quarter, sales growth was particularly strong in Norway and we continue to see good growth in Germany and Turkey, 2 of our largest markets. Adjusted operating income was $166 million in the quarter and the adjusted operating income margin was 2.9%.
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the Alliance Boots program were $288 million. So we are very much on track to deliver our goal of reaching at least $1 billion in fiscal 2016.
As I said on the year-end call, we continue to identify and action many other synergies, which is simply not practical to quantify as they blend into our core operations. At the same time, we're continuing to make good progress to deliver our $1.5 billion cost-savings program and remain on track to achieve this target by the end of fiscal 2017. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $732 million, reflecting our typical seasonal build in inventories. As I said on the last call, we continue to seek ways to deliver further working capital efficiencies, particularly in the U.S.
Capital expenditure in the quarter totaled $340 million, which was just below the amount spent in the fourth quarter of last year. This reflects our drive, which I again talked about on our last call, to invest in key areas that develop our customer proposition including information technology.
Free cash flow for the quarter therefore netted to $392 million. 
Since our Rite Aid announcement, we've made good progress with the funding. In December, we completed the placement of $5 billion term loan facilities and the syndication of a new $7.8 billion bridge facility. These new facilities replaced our previously reported $12.8 billion bridge facility commitment. Drawings are, of course, subject to the closing of the acquisition.
So let me now conclude with some comments on guidance for fiscal 2016. As you will have seen in this morning's press release, we've raised the lower end of our fiscal '16 guidance by $0.05 per share to a range of $4.30 to $4.55. This continues to assume no material accretion from the agreement to acquire Rite Aid, the previously announced suspension of the balance of the $3 billion share buyback program, continuation of our normal antidilutive buyback program relating to stock incentives and no significant changes in currency exchange rates. Please remember that we have currency translational exposure based primarily on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating income and EPS, but it can also cause quarterly volatility in the sales gross margin and SG&A item lines.
The guidance I have just provided reflects current currency rates and so factors in a headwind of around $0.03 since we've provided our initial fiscal year '16 guidance back in October.
So I'll now hand you back to Stefano."

But I would like first to update you on a few other things that we have been working on in the quarter and since its [indiscerni",912,"Thank you, George. So the company has performed well overall in the first quarter and I want to come back to that in a moment. But I would like first to update you on a few other things that we have been working on in the quarter and since its [indiscernible] that has not had a very big impact on the quarterly performance under review. As you have heard, we are not assuming that our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid will provide any material accretion in fiscal 2016, but I would reiterate that this transaction is progressing as we expected and planned. We continue to anticipate completing the acquisition in the second half of calendar year 2016. The transaction remains subject to approval by Rite Aid shareholders, regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. Rite Aid had issued their proxy and they called us a meeting to approve the transaction. It's scheduled for the 4th of February. We are continuing to work closely with the regulators. 
You will have seen, as we expected, that we have received a second request from the FTC for additional information. This is the standard part of the regulatory process in connection with the FTC's review. Shortly after the announcement of the proposed acquisition, we appointed highly experienced integration team, which has been up and running since the end of November. They are now well underway on preliminary planning work. 
In December, we also announced our agreement with Valeant Pharmaceuticals. This agreement, though new to the U.S. market, has some similarities to the way we work with a number of pharmaceutical companies in Europe. It is a very good example of how we can transfer existing experience and understanding from one market and adapting to another. The 2 main parts of the agreements combine to provide Valeant with the opportunity to serve a far wider patient base at a significantly lower cost and the potential to both grow their business and improve convenience and service level at an overall savings to their entire system. 
From our point of view, we have the potential to offer patients the medications they want and they have been prescribed with a high standard of counseling and service in a manner that makes good use of our infrastructure and professional capabilities. 
So as we look at our business today and what we are seeing in our dynamics in a changing market, it refers to a number of global teams that I believe to be inevitable for some time. In health care, we are continuing to see increasing demand on the existing system for both preventive and therapeutic treatments. This is only compounded by inflationary pressure of new, innovative and correspondingly high cost [indiscernible]. In order to mitigate this pressure and provide more and better care at lower cost, our pharmacy stands out as being one of the most convenient, flexible and lowest cost means of meeting the challenges which the system faces. Our agreement with Valeant demonstrates how we can use our pharmacy network to improve access and service level while reducing costs in the health care system. 
As we have seen in Europe and elsewhere, we believe that the way we work in close alignment and through partnership with Valeant in the sector, we can achieve immense benefits both in service level, therapeutic care, cost savings, and of course, in financial reward for both our partner and ourselves. This is why I want the partnership to become a characteristic for which our company will be known as good partnerships deliver real value. As you know, our pharmacy services operate in close alignment with our retail activities. In retail, we have the beginning of a journey to focus on our customers' true need and to differentiate our retail offers. We have seen real changes taking effect, and supported by good operational disciplines, this will deliver growth for the future. 
Like all other retailers, we are also seeing an acceleration in the U.S. in customers moving towards omnichannel retail with online shopping working in parallel and integrated with physical stores. This is a trend that we have seen in many of our markets, most particularly in the U.K. where we have adopted our model to embrace this trend. We will now decide how to deploy our services and experience to maximize the opportunities which this trend presents worldwide. Today, we have delivered what I believe to be a strong performance of a business in a process of transformation. 
Looking forward, there is no doubt that we still have a lot of work to do within our core businesses. To optimize them for their existing markets, we introduce new products, services and ways of working and to further enhance our spending with our customers. These are fundamental drivers that I believe will help us to deliver the long-term earning growth that we are confident in achieving. As a company, we continue to look at new areas of business to add to our portfolio and continue to find opportunities complementary to our core operations professionally, commercially and geographically that will help us grow the business and enhance its financial performance. Ultimately, our success relies on the quality and commitment of our people globally. Their experience, expertise and drive will improve our business every day. The commitment I see from our team give me great confidence that we will deliver what we have signaled for fiscal 2016 and beyond.

We've swapped our photo labs for dry photo labs using digital technology and obviously that's been a great success on the cost side, but also important in the growth side as well. So these are some of the structural changes that we have been doing so far. We've done some nice work, I think, in centralizing a lot of pharmacy operations, which allows our pharmacists to give more attention and care to customers at the counter while reducing costs substantially in the cost to bill. And all of these are programs that we continue to run into the future. We're not short of ideas. We have a very strong operational and IT team here and we're working on all the things we can do to reduce workload throughout the company, but particularly for stores so we can take better care of the customers and we've got a lot more to go at both in the plan and other ideas that we will develop over the next period. So we believe these are sustainable changes. We believe, importantly, the customer care numbers that we measure in time will be -- are going up as well. So we're moving work, taking better care of customers, taking bad costs out and starting now to reinvest back in the costs that are most important to the customers, more people in our shops as appropriate and obviously getting the value proposition right as well for customers both in pharmacy and also in the front end.

We have done many, many deal where at the end we have a lot of control and it's by chance that many of our managers have come back and this was not the fact. It was just the force of things. When you merge a company, when you merge 2 companies, you have 1 company and of course all the people of the previous 2 companies are members of the new company and you have just to try to select the best people for the best hope. And the people can come from everywhere. So we have never ever, I can tell you, I can assure you, have never ever done a deal with the idea of controlling the resulting company, first of all. Secondly, so we are open at the merger, we are open at the merger where we could have the control, a merger where we could see the control a merger of equals. So we will be open to everything which would create, I repeat, substantial and sustainable value immediately and in the future for the company. This is for the merger. For the commercial partnership, of course you can imagine many, many different kinds of commercial partnerships. Valeant is a really good example, but there are other kinds of partnership that you can do. On the cost side, on the margin side, creating synergies that you can share and there is not a market where every time you have to discuss and you have to see what is the best way to create value and how to share the value. But if you approach these discussions with an open mind, I mean, sometimes it's possible to find a solution. Alex, you have seen many of these joint ventures, commercial joint ventures in the past, so you can say something maybe?"

Yes, I think the thing that's important here is to create the win-win. And for example, in Valeant, what we see is the opportunity to really take friction out for customers and patients and doctors and pharmacists so they can spend more time with patients and therefore patients win. So the whole idea behind Valeant as, I think, Stefano said in the introduction, really is about taking friction and cost out of the interactions between health care professionals and giving more time to customers. We're becoming more of a services company. We'll be faced with things which have to do with the job of a pharmacist, which is about providing -- actually dispensing and making sure you understand the drugs properly and that is great for a pharmacist and great for profession. And we're committed, as Valeant is committed as to, over time, ensuring that we independently monitor, that we deliver lower costs in this system as a result of working differently together. Last example we'll develop in the U.S. and we will take our time to get this right and make sure that we implement in a way that is appropriate for the system that will work in America. There's lots of examples in Europe, which are -- we could go into as well in terms of not just retail locally in a way that creates win-wins and ensures that we deliver better care at lower costs and that's really what the partnership strategy is all about."

If you look at the performance of Part Med D you can see again it's been a successful strategy. We're well set up again for this season. These are annual contracts in the main. They're becoming more sophisticated, as we also know, being paid for some services within these contracts. And again, we're determined to get better value and better care within these contracts. And we're starting to gently, but progressively improve relationships and grow our share, as George has said. We grew share again in the quarter, which we're pleased with, but we know we have a lot more to do. So that's where we are. So we are feeling more confident in relationships with the PBMs. We're feeling more confident as we give better value to the market in terms of both price and quality of care.

I mean, there's always an element of mix, but I think that one of the factors that I've tried to draw in is obviously we're continuing in -- the biggest business is Boots in the UK is the biggest business and the division continue to perform well. As I've said we had -- and looking at the sales with omnichannel is -- and boots.com in particular, is a very important part of our growth strategy. We did in the summer anniversary, just the beginning of August, our much faster online collect in-store offers. So we've seen the impact of the growth of that coming through, then the anniversary, then we brought in some new developments. So we saw this improvement coming then back up again into the December numbers, which, together with the strong gifting meant that we've had a good Christmas in what's been a particularly competitive environment. So in those businesses, it's really about having a differentiated front of store offer and then increasingly supported by omnichannel. And of course, in Boots in the U.K., we're able to piggyback on the Alliance Healthcare distribution system to do that. So if you look at Boots' performance and certainly it's still early, early days, we're just starting to see some of the features from the -- from our competitors on the high street, but I think what's coming through pretty clear is that Boots is continuing to be a real winner there. In terms of the margin, really 2 points. One is there's always a seasonal impact given the importance of the retail part of our offerings in Retail Pharmacy International. And of course, we started to see the buildup in November because it tends to be that people start their Christmas shopping a little bit earlier in Europe than would be the case here in the United States. So there's a seasonal element. And then as I said also in the presentation, we've got a little bit of a benefit in this quarter from the finalizing of the -- we're working towards finalizing our purchase price adjustments, the fair values that you have to do on the acquisition of Alliance Boots and we've got a little bit of benefit there, which helped the margin in this quarter that we won't see when you come and look at the quarter, the same first quarter in 12 months' time. But the key factor is the seasonality. And of course, as we look towards the second quarter where we've got a very important holiday trading, the December results and into early January, you'll also see the benefit of that coming through on the next call."

Generic inflation, going to the last part of the question first, is not material. So therefore we are feeling pretty good about this and it's factored into our guidance going forward. The trends beyond that really are the same trends: we have ongoing reimbursement pressure as we work with the market to lower costs. They are more or less as we expected and the trend will continue in the same fashion. It's something we're used to in Europe, as we said before. I've worked in Europe for many, many years and it's a trend that we expect to see because as health care expands and government pays more and patients pay more then you've got to become more efficient within the market as we commit to doing. And on the front-end margin, we are pleased with the profitability as we continue to swap out old products. I mean, as George said in his introduction, we took out all of the older sort of home decoration products, which primarily sell in November and we are replacing these with more giftables. But this was really the first year of that transition. We had great support from some of our partners, so we have more plans to shift that mix next Christmas. And also importantly, we have viewed [ph]2,000 where again we're shifting the mix towards more beauty products, owned brand beauty products, from Ken's organization with the launch of these products in over 1/2 -- 1,000 extra stores to get to 2,000 stores by somewhere around Christmas next year. So the trends are very similar, to be honest. We are pretty predictable. Maybe the one that was a bit less predictable was promotional markets where again we give great promotions throughout the autumn so we have to adjust that a little bit to that period. And of course, that's important to see in the markets they compare to, which we are doing. So really, trends are the same. We adjust as we go, though the fundamentals are the same."

I think related to that, secondly to your point, they've been investing wisely in their best stores and they're getting from the numbers that the teams speak about and they will confirm they're getting nice lifts in their refitted stores. To be honest, as we reviewed some of the stuff we did in the Well Experience, we hadn't been successful in the past, maybe 2 or 3 years ago, with some of these lifts. We're now getting better lifts and I guess I think if we can put these lessons together we can make better use of our capital and get better lifts on end. And of course, we believe some really great products coming out of the global sourcing organization from Alliance Boots that [indiscernible] mentioned, starting with beauty developing into health care, into seasonal gifts. We put these few things. So we are very open. Partnership is about openness, curiosity to learn and that team has done a good job in these 2 dimensions in particular, I think."

In terms of why Valeant, well, because of the fact that they came to us and they've asked us would we be able to keep their end of the business, in particular, with the situation that we're in. We did appropriate due diligence and we decided that it's a good opportunity to take some of the lessons that the team, particularly Alex's team in Europe, had learned about attractive pharmacy model in wholesale. So we saw the opportunity to lift and shift the best practice in Europe into Valeant and they liked the idea, I mean, walked through it pretty quickly and got to a good place in a pretty short of period of time. They're a great team to work with and we wish Mike a very speedy recovery.

We are following this project independently on the quarter and so you will see sometimes better rewards or KPIs and these would not be always the same. You have to judge on the whole and you'll see that overall we will continue to progress. As we have clearly demonstrated in the last 4 quarters, every quarter we progress and it's a mix of everything we do. The gross margin is important, but at the end of the day, what is really important is the operating margin. It's the earnings that we are talking, that we can attract from an operation. And sometimes you have to sacrifice the gross profit because the lower increase in the gross profit or in the gross margin can be very expensive to achieve a level cost or in other costs. So we have always an holistic view and this, our holistic view, is extended over a longer period of time and not over a quarter. Maybe you can answer in detail, but this is the logic obviously."

So in photographic, we were just substantially are operating costs by removing more expensive to maintain, more difficult to use and requiring more people to use them wet labs, the old labs. We removed all of them very quickly in a period of about 18 months across all the states and replaced them with a new digital technology, which, in essence, reduces the gross margin. Actually, because of the operating cost, the advantage of that system drives 2 things. It drives volume, we had a very strong volume average for the period. And as part of the flat sales George mentioned in holding the number of periods, that was a driver up the way of sales. And also we have been able to offer better value to customers and we're very pleased with the performance in that country. We have really been driven a big differential and that's been also transported to Boots as well. Boots are using the same platform with the same effect now in the U.K. It's another great example of what we mean by operating margin. In terms of costs going forward, we remain confident in our cost plan. We're on track. People's attitude toward this has been fantastic. The teams have done a great job and customer care scores are up because we're taking more costs out. So going forward, you should expect to seeing the same activities. Now how they fall quarter-over-quarter, as Stefano said, some things vary depending on a number of factors, but the strategy we're implementing is a very clear strategy and we're very pleased with the progress."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings call. 
It is a pleasure to be talking to you all today or shall I say that this quarterly earnings call always presented me with challenge. The work that we are doing within our business is -- around the company is a far-reaching and all the time will leave a transformative impact but quarter-to-quarter it is not always easy to find new things to say or to demonstrate the changes in our company.

We can see the impact of this in the company's results announced today with adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance per diluted share up 11% compared to the same quarter last year to $1.31. All initials have, we believe, delivered a very credible financial performance but there's plenty more to do and we are still at relatively early stage in this process. 
This last quarter results, we have made good progress in developing the company. With more focused mind set and strategic direction. And I will talk about this later in our presentation, but for now, I will hand over to George to take us through the financial performance."

Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. 
Overall, we view our second quarter performance as quite good, particularly given the number of headwinds including the weak cough, cold, flu season and currency translation. 
So beginning as usual with the key financial highlights for the quarter. Net sales were $30.2 billion, up 13.6% versus the same quarter a year ago. This increase was largely due to the consolidation of Alliance Boots for the entire second quarter this year and to sales growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. 
Foreign currency translation adversely affected sales by approximately $750 million or 2.4%. This was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $2.1 billion, up 15.2%. Our net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.4 billion, up 14.4% and diluted earnings per share were $1.31, up 11.0%. 
These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the second quarter fiscal 2015 due to Alliance Boots transaction in December 2014 and the resulting changes in our consolidated group and segments are reporting. 
We now lap the closing of that transaction and will hopefully comparable quarterly results beginning in the third quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.9 billion, up 35.1%. Of the GAAP net earnings level, our performance versus last year was impacted by a number of accounting factors. The most significant being last year 's noncash gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held equity investments in Alliance Boots and the change in fair value adjustments on our Mercersburg and warrants. As a results, GAAP earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $930 million and diluted EPS were $0.85. 
This is a leap year, our second quarter results have benefited from 1 extra date versus last year. We therefore, prepared all comparable sales in prescription figures to include only the first 28 days of February. 
For completeness, here are the numbers for the first half of fiscal 2016. I will not go through those in great detail, but you will note that adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.34 is up 18.2% versus the same period a year ago. 
So turning now to our segmented performance. Total Retail Pharmacy USA sales for the quarter were $21.5 billion, an increase of 2.1% over the same quarter a year ago. 
Sales on the comparable store basis increased by 2.2%. The sales growth was driven by increased market share, partially offset by the sale of a controlling interest in our infusion business last April and the weak cough, cold, flu season, which was particularly strong in the comparable period last year. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points to 27.7%, primarily due to procurement efficiencies. This resulted in $6.0 billion of adjusted gross profit, up 2.8%. 
Adjusted SG&A was $4.3 billion, an increase of 30 basis points as we continued to focus on store efficiencies and controlled corporate costs. 
Adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 2.1% given an adjusted operating margin of 7.6%. 
Excluding Walgreens share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the year ago quarter, adjusted operating income for the division grew by 10% and adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points. 
So turning now to look in more detail on pharmacy. Pharmacy sales were up 3.2% for the quarter, 233 million prescriptions were filled on a 30-day basis including immunizations. That was an increase of 3.9%. On a comparable store basis, pharmacy sales increased by 3.7% with comparable scripts filled up 2.8%. 
We view this as a good performance, particularly given the weak cough, cold, flu season this year, which we estimate for the 30 basis points negative impact on comparable scripts. 
The reported incidence of flu across the U.S.A. declined by 16% compared to-year ago quarter according to IMS health. 
Overall, our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increased by 19.5%, up approximately 20 basis points over the year ago quarter, again, as reported by IMS Health. 
Our increase in comparable store scripts was driven by our Medicare Part D growth strategy, where we grew market share. 
Consistent with our expectations, we experienced a decline in pharmacy gross margins, which were impacted by ongoing reimbursement pressure and changes in mix, including an increase contribution from Medicare Part D. 
As you know, the new Medicare Part D rates came into effect on the 1st of January this year. Our second quarter results therefore, included 2 months of the new rates, but looking ahead, our third and fourth quarters will reflect their full impact. 
As we've said before, we continue to anticipate gross margin pressure in pharmacy but remain confident in our ability to grow the business over time. 
Retail product sales were up 30 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2015 with sales on a comparable basis, down 30 basis points. Gross margin increase compared with the year ago quarter. Again, we are pleased with these results given the weak cough, cold, flu season. We estimate this headwind had an impact of approximately 100 basis points on comparable sales this quarter. 
We saw good performances over Christmas and New Year with strong sales in giftables and candy, wellness and other area of focus also performed well, driven by sales of vitamins and first aid products. 
We also made good progress in driving sales of No7 during the quarter. 
As I've mentioned before, we're on track to roll out our differentiated beauty offering through an additional 1,600 stores beginning this summer. This will increase the total number of stores with this beauty offerings to approximately 2,000 by the end of calendar 2016. 
So let me now provide more detail on our Retail Pharmacy International division. Total Retail Pharmacy International sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion with pro forma constant currency comparable store sales up 2.3%. 
Adjusted gross profit was $1.5 billion with an adjusted gross profit margin of 41.1%. 
As you're aware, this quarter is not directly comparable with the same quarter last year, which did not include December 2014. December is a very significant sales month, but typically has a slightly lower gross margin reflecting a higher proportion of gifting items. 
Adjusted SG&A was $1.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $335 million. The adjusted operating margin of 9.1% was higher than the year ago period due to the seasonally strongest month of December being part of our second quarter this year. 
So looking more closely at the segment. Comparable pharmacy sales on a pro forma constant currency basis were up 2.6%. The comparable retail sales were up 2.1%. 
Comparable pharmacy sales in Boots U.K. increased by 3.0% as a result of an increase in average item value and additional high-value drugs dispensed in hospital pharmacies. 
Comparable retail sales at Boots U.K. were up 1.8% driven by good performance over the holiday period. 
Growth in our Boots.com Order & Collect service was strong with seasonal categories and our beauty product brands such as No7 and Soap & Glory being key drivers. 
Liz Earle also performed very well in the quarter both in-store and online. We're continuing the U.K. rollout of Liz Earle  and Sleek, which we acquired in November. 
Outside the U.K., sales growth continued to be particularly strong in the Republic of Ireland. 
Turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales of Pharmaceutical Wholesale was $5.6 billion. On a pro forma constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and disposals, comparable sales increased by 1.6% over the same quarter in 2015. This was in line with our estimated market growth waited on the basis of our country wholesale sales. Turkey, the U.K. and Norway performed well while the French and Russian markets remained challenging. 
Adjusted operating income for the division was $155 million in the quarter and adjusted operating income margin was 2.8%. 
Going forward, the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division will include our share of net earnings attributable to our equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. 
I'll now just take a few moments to explain how we will account for this. As you know following the exercise of our first tranche warrants on the 18th of March, we owned 34.2 million shares or approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of AmerisourceBergen. Will account for this investment using equity method accounting subject to 2 1 reporting lag. The lag synchronizes our reporting with the end of the our quarterly fiscal periods. 
Due to the lag, in our third quarter, we will only recognize our share of equity income for a couple of weeks. But of course, we will recognize full quarter of equity income in our fourth fiscal quarter based on AmerisourceBergen 's quarter ending the 30th of June. 
From a funding perspective, we used approximately $1.2 billion from existing cash on hand to exercise the warrants. 
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the Alliance Boots program were $329 million, taking the cumulative total for this fiscal year to $617 million. We're well on track to deliver our goal of reaching at least $1 billion of combined net synergies in fiscal 2016. 
We're also continuing to make good progress in delivering our $1.5 billion cost-saving program by the end of fiscal 2017 and are well on track to achieve this. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.4 billion, driven by a combination of operational performance and cash conversion from the sale of seasonal inventory. Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $317 million. 
As I have said on previous calls, we continue to invest in key areas that develop our customer proposition including IT. This resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.0 billion. 
As we have stated previously, we're very focused on cash flow and are very disciplined in making capital allocation decisions and we remain committed to a solid investment grade rating. 
As you have seen from our press release, we have narrowed our fiscal '16 guidance range to between $4.35 and $4.55 by raising the bottom end of the range by a further $0.05. This assumes AmerisourceBergen equity income on a two-month lag, no material accretion from the agreement to acquire Rite Aid, the previously announced suspension of the balance of our $3 billion share buyback program, the continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback program relating to equity incentives and no significant changes in current currency exchange rates. 
Please remember that we have currency translational exposure. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating income and EPS but it can also cost quarterly volatility in the sales, gross margin and SG&A line items. 
We estimate that a 1% move in pounds sterling in the euro versus the dollar impacts full year sales by approximately $150 million and $125 million, respectively. 
On an adjusted earnings level, a 1% move in pounds sterling impacts full year adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share. Of the impact of the euro is somewhat less significant. 
Note that other currencies can also impact the quarter results particularly on the sales line as they did this quarter. Our guidance reflects current currency rates and so factors in a headwind of $0.06 since we provided our initial fiscal year 2016 guidance back in October 2015. 
Since Walgreens provided its fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per share goal way back in August 2014, that was $4.25 to $4.60, we've encountered a currency headwind of around $0.19 per share. 
And lastly, when considering the outlook for the balance of this fiscal year, please keep in mind that during the third quarter of our last fiscal year that we had a temporary pause in certain investments within our U.S. business as a we evaluated the returns being generated on certain projects. 
By the time we entered the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, we've finished this exercise and resumed our more normalized SG&A spend. This led to SG&A last year being a little lower in Q3 and a little higher in Q4 than you would expect on a more normalized basis. 
So with that, I will hand you back to Stefano."

So if you have heard, overall our company is performing pretty much in line with our expectation. I mean in respect we are now past that leading of the exceptional items that have impacted us during the last few quarters. 
As we begin to work of bringing our management information system together and also this work as with most of our projects is now complete after such a short time as a unified company we are making good progress. 
As our business begins to normalize and embrace a new approach to the reporting and control, both at the physical and operational level, we are beginning to see far more clearly the impacts and implications of the levers we have to influence our operations and the areas where we have the greatest opportunities in areas where we have the most work to do. 
I have to say that this is very much work that we expected. It is important and necessary exercise to help ensure our priorities are correct and our assumptions are not broad. 
I believe that one of our greatest strengths as a management team is that where we can, we base our decision on probable facts and where we can't, we always and I mean always, question our own assumptions. Then we go back and check whether we are right or not so that we can learn and do better next time. 
In our U.S. division, you can see some examples of how we're likely focus on the way we work is impacting the company already in a very real way. Beyond the impacted our cost saving synergy programs are bringing. 
In our [indiscernible] approach, we have taken in terms of partnership and strategic relationship such as that we have entered into Valeant Pharmaceuticals. By Valeant as a company is still working in the way some challenges. The collaboration we have with them, those dealings, it's early stages is showing some very promising results in terms of improved access and affordability of their product. 
Since the close of the quarter, we have announced the partnership with Optima Rx to create a new 90-day Retail Pharmacy collaboration giving eligible optimize member choice of how to receive their medication and providing them with 24/7 pharmacy serviceability. 
Although I cannot disclose the term of this contract it is fair to say that it has been structured so that there is a shared and neutral benefit to us working together to increase the utilization and volume in a more collaborative manner that I understand to have been the case in the past. 
Of course, our agreement to acquire Rite Aid is continuing as we aspect with the regulatory approval process are progressing in line with the timetable we had expected. 
All these actions not only contribute to the development of the company but also provide us with opportunities and the flexibility to continue the process of reviewing and reviewing our existing operations, both in retail and pharmacy further differentiating us in the marketplace. These are trends also validate that in seeking to lead improved efficiency in the health care value chain we not only target highly selective M&A activities but also new partnership and relationship driven on equity alignment like AmerisourceBergen, innovative commercial relationship such as the Valeant supply contracts as well as improvement in long-standing arrangements with our critical business partners. 
As we have always said, this is much longer term but it's still essential to the sustainable future of our company. We have to find new innovative and value offering to continue to bring people to our stores. In pharmacy, the contracts can help us to do this to an extent but we need to announce our patient offering and ensure we maximize the value of that interaction, both to the patients and to our services company to announce services and reach relationship between the patient, the pharmacy team and our company overall. 
In front of our stores, we need to focus our offering, be clear, what we stand for and define our 2 areas of expertise in differentiation and we need to offer these to whatever medium or interface the customer wants. 
We have done well in controlling costs and improving efficiency, but we understand that has a limited lifespan. If the growing of sales growth cannot be altered or reversed. Alex and his team know this and are very focused on their strategies to address the recent trend. 
If these all sound very U.S. focused, it is perhaps not surprising as today the U.S. is the market where we have the most immediate opportunities. 
This does not mean we are neglecting our other markets, far from it. The U.K., the team is working hard on strategies to keep Boots stores in our portfolio, not just ahead of the market but most relevant with these customers.  While working on plan to manage and mitigate the next round of work is ever present government pressure on pharmacy pricing. 
And across our businesses, owned and in partnership with our equity investment, the work continues constantly, daily, to any one of the structure, to be the best they can be and do always and to [indiscernible] be ready to address the challenges, but more importantly, to face the opportunities where we see them. And there, we must do this with extreme vigilance and vigor so that we achieve without disrupting the extraordinary level of service customers has come to and they have the right to expect from us and without failing to deliver for you as the owners of our company. 
Now, let's open up for questions."

So we're really focused on removing unprofitable opportunity, unprofitable items and try to simplify the offer and focusing on the key destination countries for us, which is primarily health beauty and convenience and we feel good about where we are, but there is a long opportunity ahead of us and that opportunities to get customers to reevaluate the offer inside of Walgreens and to see it's more unique and more differentiates it's not just journey really with the beauty differentiation projects we spoke about earlier on the call, summer and autumn. So I think the opportunity is still a lot to come, particularly on the expansion of differentiation and higher-margin products. It will just take us longer to get that done as customers one by one reevaluate what they're seeing inside Walgreens. I think finally I would say we had a one size fits all approach to the Walgreens front end for quite some time and as we've all thinking on omni-channel and formats, again, we believe that there will be more opportunity there in the later years. But the first thing, I think people reevaluate the current Walgreens, which is almost right now and then we'll  figure out how use the space definitely over the medium to long term."

We saw the people who are at the end of the day, they have the food for the scripts and clever way of collaborating with them can help because it can increase the number of and of course the volume is a very, very important because if you can compensate at least partially, the volume, buy the volume the actual margin of course, this can help substantially. So there are many, many different action that you can take and we are taking and these actions we can stabilize the results. The final results as Alex was saying for years and years to come and in 10 years time or whatever, we will have probably another organization of the business and we would what will happen at that time.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings call. 
It is a pleasure to be talking to you all today, although I must say that these quarterly earnings calls always presented me with a mild challenge. The work that we are doing within our business is -- around the company is far-reaching and, all the time, will have a transformative impact. But quarter-to-quarter, it is not always easy to find new things to say or to demonstrate the changes in our company, other than by the meticulous taking of the daily numbers, and that is naturally we'll show this year, too. My role on this call is to put the results in the context of a bigger picture. But that bigger picture, though it will look very different over the years to come, does not show great shift and low shift over time. And frankly, we should all be glad about that as stability is generally a good thing. 
The changes we are making might be managed carefully and progressively if they are to have a long-term and sustainable impact on the company. 
This quarter, we have continued to make good progress in driving cost out, establishing even more efficient working practice and impacting the company appropriately for the future. 
We can see the impact of this in the company's results announced today, with adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance per diluted share up 11% compared to the same quarter last year to $1.31. All 3 divisions have, we believe, delivered a very creditable financial performance. But there is plenty more to do, and we are still at a relatively early stage in this process. 
Since last quarter results, we have made good progress in developing the company with a more focused mindset and strategic direction. And I will talk about this later in our presentation, but for now, I will hand over to George to talk us through the financial performance."

Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. 
Overall, we view our second-quarter performance as quite good, particularly given the number of headwinds, including the weak cough, cold, flu season and currency translation. 
So beginning as usual with the key financial highlights for the quarter. Net sales were $30.2 billion, up 13.6% versus the same quarter a year ago. This increase was largely due to the consolidation of Alliance Boots for the entire second quarter this year and to sales growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. 
Foreign currency translation adversely affected sales by approximately $750 million or 2.4%. This was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $2.1 billion, up 15.2%. Our net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.4 billion, up 14.4%. And diluted earnings per share were $1.31, up 11.0%. 
These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the second quarter of fiscal 2015 due to the Alliance Boots transaction in December 2014 and the resulting changes in our consolidated group and segmental reporting. 
We've now lapped the closing of that transaction and will have fully comparable quarterly results beginning in the third quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.9 billion, up 35.1%. At the GAAP net earnings level, our performance versus last year was impacted by a number of accounting factors, the most significant being last year's noncash gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held equity investment in Alliance Boots and the change in fair value adjustments on our AmerisourceBergen warrants. As a results, GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $930 million and diluted EPS were $0.85. 
As this is a leap year, our second-quarter results have benefited from one extra date versus last year. We therefore prepared all comparable sales in prescription figures to include only the first 28 days of February. 
For completeness, here are the numbers for the first half of fiscal 2016. I will not go through those in great detail, but you will note that adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.34 is up 18.2% versus the same period a year ago. 
So turning now to our segmental performance. Total Retail Pharmacy USA sales for the quarter were $21.5 billion, an increase of 2.1% over the same quarter a year ago. 
Sales on a comparable store basis increased by 2.2%. The sales growth was driven by increased market share, partially offset by the sale of a controlling interest in our infusion business last April and the weak cough, cold, flu season, which was particularly strong in the comparable period last year. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points to 27.7%, primarily due to procurement efficiencies. This resulted in $6.0 billion of adjusted gross profit, up 2.8%. 
Adjusted SG&A was $4.3 billion, an increase of 30 basis points, as we continued to focus on store efficiencies and controlled corporate costs. 
Adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 2.1% given an adjusted operating margin of 7.6%. 
Excluding Walgreens' share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the year-ago quarter, adjusted operating income for the division grew by 10% and adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points. 
So turning now to look in more detail at pharmacy. Pharmacy sales were up 3.2% for the quarter. 233 million prescriptions were filled on a 30-day basis including immunizations. That was an increase of 3.9%. On a comparable store basis, pharmacy sales increased by 3.7%, with comparable scripts filled up 2.8%. 
We view this as a good performance, particularly given the weak cough, cold, flu season this year, which we estimate are the 30 basis points negative impact on comparable scripts. 
The reported incidence of flu across the U.S.A. declined by 16% compared with the year-ago quarter according to IMS Health. 
Overall, our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increased by 19.5%, up approximately 20 basis points over the year-ago quarter, again, as reported by IMS Health. 
Our increase in comparable store scripts was driven by our Medicare Part D growth strategy, where we grew market share. 
Consistent with our expectations, we experienced a decline in pharmacy gross margins, which were impacted by ongoing reimbursement pressure and changes in mix, including an increased contribution from Medicare Part D. 
As you know, the new Medicare Part D rates came into effect on the 1st of January this year. Our second-quarter results therefore included 2 months of the new rates. But looking ahead, our third and fourth quarters will reflect their full impact. 
As we've said before, we continue to anticipate gross margin pressure in pharmacy, but remain confident in our ability to grow the business over time. 
Retail product sales were up 30 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2015. With sales on a comparable basis down 30 basis points, gross margin increased compared with the year-ago quarter. Again, we are pleased with these results given the weak cough, cold, flu season. We estimate this headwind had an impact of approximately 100 basis points on comparable sales this quarter. 
We saw good performances over Christmas and New Year with strong sales in giftables and candy. Wellness, another area of focus, also performed well, driven by sales of vitamins and first aid products. 
We also made good progress in driving sales of No7 during the quarter. 
As I've mentioned before, we're on track to roll out our differentiated beauty offering to an additional 1,600 stores beginning this summer. This will increase the total number of stores with this beauty offering to approximately 2,000 by the end of calendar 2016. 
So let me now provide more detail on our Retail Pharmacy International division. Total Retail Pharmacy International sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion with pro forma constant currency comparable store sales up 2.3%. 
Adjusted gross profit was $1.5 billion with an adjusted gross profit margin of 41.1%. 
As you're aware, this quarter is not directly comparable with the same quarter last year, which did not include December 2014. December is a very significant sales month, but typically has a slightly lower gross margin, reflecting a higher proportion of gifting items. 
Adjusted SG&A was $1.2 billion, and adjusted operating income was $335 million. The adjusted operating margin of 9.1% was higher than the year-ago period due to the seasonally strongest month of December being part of our second quarter this year. 
So looking more closely at this segment. Comparable pharmacy sales on a pro forma constant currency basis were up 2.6%. The comparable retail sales were up 2.1%. 
Comparable pharmacy sales in Boots UK increased by 3.0% as a result of an increase in average item value and additional high-value drugs dispensed in hospital pharmacies. Comparable retail sales at Boots UK were up 1.8%, driven by good performance over the holiday period. 
Growth in our boots.com ""Order & Collect service"" was strong with seasonal categories and our beauty product brands such as No7 and Soap & Glory being key drivers. 
Liz Earle also performed very well in the quarter, both in-store and online. We're continuing the U.K. rollout of Liz Earle and Sleek, which we acquired in November. 
Outside the U.K., sales growth continue to be particularly strong in the Republic of Ireland. 
Turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales of Pharmaceutical Wholesale were $5.6 billion. On a pro forma constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and disposals, comparable sales increased by 1.6% over the same quarter in 2015. This was in line with our estimated market growth waited on the basis of our country wholesale sales. Turkey, the U.K. and Norway performed well, while the French and Russian markets remained challenging. 
Adjusted operating income for the division was $155 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating income margin was 2.8%. 
Going forward, the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division will include our share of net earnings attributable to our equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. 
I'll now just take a few moments to explain how we will account for this. As you know, following the exercise of our first tranche warrants on the 18th of March, we owned 34.2 million shares or approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of AmerisourceBergen. We will account for this investment using equity method accounting subject to a 2-month reporting lag. The lag synchronizes our reporting with the end of their quarterly fiscal periods. 
Due to the lag, in our third quarter, we will only recognize our share of equity income for a couple of weeks. But of course, we will recognize a full quarter of equity income in our fourth fiscal quarter based on AmerisourceBergen's quarter ending the 30th of June. 
From a funding perspective, we used approximately $1.2 billion from existing cash on hand to exercise the warrants. 
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the Alliance Boots program were $329 million, taking the cumulative total for this fiscal year to $617 million. We're well on track to deliver our goal of reaching at least $1 billion of combined net synergies in fiscal 2016. 
We're also continuing to make good progress in delivering our $1.5 billion cost-saving program by the end of fiscal 2017 and are well on track to achieve this. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.4 billion, driven by a combination of operational performance and cash conversion from the sale of seasonal inventory. Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $317 million. 
As I have said on previous calls, we continue to invest in key areas that develop our customer proposition, including IT. This resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.0 billion. 
As we have stated previously, we're very focused on cash flow and are very disciplined in making capital allocation decisions, and we remain committed to a solid investment grade rating. 
As you have seen from our press release, we have narrowed our fiscal '16 guidance range to between $4.35 and $4.55 by raising the bottom end of the range by a further $0.05. This assumes AmerisourceBergen equity income on a 2-month lag, no material accretion from the agreement to acquire Rite Aid, the previously announced suspension of the balance of our $3 billion share buyback program, the continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback program relating to equity incentives and no significant changes in current currency exchange rates. 
Please remember that we have currency translational exposure. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating income and EPS, but it can also cause quarterly volatility in the sales, gross margin and SG&A line items. 
We estimate that a 1% move in pound sterling in the euro versus the dollar impacts full-year sales by approximately $150 million and $125 million, respectively. 
On an adjusted earnings level, a 1% move in pound sterling impacts full year adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share of the impact of the euro is somewhat less significant. 
Note that other currencies can also impact reported results, particularly on the sales line, as they did this quarter. Our guidance reflects current currency rates, and so factors in a headwind of $0.06 since we provided our initial fiscal year 2016 guidance back in October 2015. 
Since Walgreens provided its fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per share goal way back in August 2014, that was $4.25 to $4.60, we've encountered a currency headwind of around $0.19 per share. 
And lastly, when considering the outlook for the balance of this fiscal year, please keep in mind that during the third quarter of our last fiscal year that we had a temporary pause in certain investments within our U.S. business as we evaluated the returns being generated on certain projects. 
By the time we entered the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, we've finished this exercise and resumed our more normalized SG&A spend. This led to SG&A last year being a little lower in Q3 and a little higher in Q4 than you would expect on a more normalized basis. 
So with that, I will hand you back to Stefano."

As our business begins to normalize and embrace a new approach to reporting and control, both at the fiscal and operational level, we are beginning to see far more clearly the impacts and implications of the levers we have to influence our operations and the areas where we have the greatest opportunities and the areas where we have the most work to do. 
I have to say that this is very much work that we expected. It is an important and necessary exercise to help ensure our priorities are correct and our assumptions are not broad. 
I believe that one of our greatest strengths as a management team is that where we can, we base our decision on probable facts. And where we can't, we always, and I mean always, question our own assumptions. Then we go back and check whether we were right or not so that we can learn and do better next time. 
In our U.S. division, you can see some examples of how we're slightly focused on the way we work is impacting the company already in a very real way, beyond the impacted, our cost saving and synergy programs are bringing. 
In the more innovative approaches we are taking in terms of partnership and strategic relationship such as that we have entered into Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Why Valeant as a company is clearly still working its way to some challenges, the collaboration we have with them, those dealings, it's early stages, is showing some very promising results in terms of improved access and affordability of their product. 
Since the close of the quarter, we have announced a partnership with OptumRx to create a new 90-day Retail Pharmacy collaboration, giving eligible OptumRx member a choice of how to receive their medication and providing them with 24/7 pharmacy serviceability. 
Although I cannot disclose the terms of this contract, it is fair to say that it has been structured so that there is a shared and neutral benefit to us working together to increase the utilization and volume in a more collaborative manner that I understand to have been the case in the past. 
Of course, our agreement to acquire Rite Aid is continuing, as we expect, with the regulatory approval process progressing in line with the timetable we had expected. 
All these actions not only contribute to the development of the company, but also provide us with opportunities and the flexibility to continue the process of reviewing and rejuvenating our existing operations, both in retail and pharmacy, further differentiating us in the marketplace. These trends also validate that in seeking to lead improved efficiency in the healthcare value chain, we not only target highly selective M&A activities, but also new partnership and relationship driven on equity alignment like AmerisourceBergen, innovative commercial relationship such as the Valeant supply contract as well as improvement in long-standing arrangements with our critical business partners. 
As we have always said, this is much longer term, but it's essential to the sustainable future of our company. We have to find new, innovative and value offering to continue to bring people to our stores. In pharmacy, the contracts can help us to do this to an extent, but we need to announce our patient offering and ensure we maximize the value of that interaction, both to the patients and to our service as a company to announce services and reach relationship between the patient, the pharmacy team and our company overall. 
In front of our stores, we need to focus our offering, be clear what we stand for and define our 2 areas of expertise in differentiation, and we need to offer these to whatever medium or interface the customer wants. 
We have done well in controlling costs and improving efficiency, but we understand that this has a limited lifespan if the growing of the sales growth cannot be altered and reversed. Alex and his team know this and are very focused on their strategies to address the recent trend. 
If these all sound very U.S.-focused, it is perhaps not surprising as today the U.S. is the market where we have the most immediate opportunities. 
This does not mean we are neglecting our other markets, far from it. The U.K., the team is working hard on strategies to keep Boots stores in our rent portfolio, not just ahead of the market, but the most relevant with customers. While working on plan to manage and mitigate the next round of work is ever present government pressure on pharmacy pricing. 
And across our businesses, owned and in partnership with our equity investment, the work continues constantly, daily, to renew and restructure them, to be the best they can be and to always be ready to address the challenges, but more importantly, to face the opportunities where we see them. And there, we must do this with extreme vigilance and vigor, so that we achieve it without disrupting the extraordinary level of service our customers has come to. And they have the right to expect from us and without failing to deliver for you as the owners of our company. 
Now let's open up for questions."

On the other side, which is still the bigger impact on the operating margin in the U.S. as pharmacy reimbursement, we continue to see the pressures we've spoken about in the past, today and also going forward. As George mentioned, who's on the call, the mayor of D.C. has been good from a volume point of view on plan, and we've had the expected impact on margin and reimbursement pressure as a result. So I will say that there is really no change overall in the margin. We continue to work hard to improve the front of the store margin with some successes. We continue to see constant reimbursement pressure, which we're dealing with, as we are planning to do going forward."

And therefore, we are working hard to try to deliver more synergies. The cost base also that we're working would balance that out. But all of that is balanced out by all ongoing reimbursement pressure beyond simply the Med D contracts. There are commensurate reimbursement pressures and whether it impact us, we'll let you know, but they are definitely there. And also, we are working hard as well.

But for the next year, we see enough ways to compensate the margin reduction. We accepted that the margin reduction will be there, and we are trying to find and we are finding different ways to compensate for it."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 earning call. 
It is a pleasure to be talking to you all today, although I must say that these quarterly earning calls always present me with a mild challenge. The work that we are doing within our business is -- around the company is far-reaching and, all the time, will have a transformative impact. But quarter-to-quarter, it is not always easy to find new things to say or to demonstrate the changes in our company other than by the meticulous taking of the daily numbers, and that is -- naturally, we'll show this here, too. My role on this call is to put the results in the context of a bigger picture. But that bigger picture, though it will look very different over the years to come, does not show great shift in [indiscernible] over time. And frankly, we should all be glad about that as stability is generally a good thing. 
The changes we are making might be managed carefully and progressively if they are to have a long-term and sustainable impact on the company. 
This quarter, we have continued to make good progress in driving cost out, establishing even more efficient working practice and impacting the company appropriately for the future. 
We can see the impact of this in the company's results announced today with adjusted net earning attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance per diluted share up 11% compared to the same quarter last year to $1.31. All 3 divisions have, we believe, delivered a very creditable financial performance. But there is plenty more to do, and we are still at a relatively early stage in this process. 
Since last quarter results, we have made good progress in developing the company with a more focused mindset and strategic direction. And I will talk about this later in our presentation, but for now, I will hand over to George to talk us through the financial performance."

Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Overall, we view our second-quarter performance as quite good, particularly given the number of headwinds, including the weak cough, cold, flu season and curren",1999,"Thank you, Stefano. Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. 
Overall, we view our second-quarter performance as quite good, particularly given the number of headwinds, including the weak cough, cold, flu season and currency translation. 
So beginning as usual with the key financial highlights for the quarter. Net sales were $30.2 billion, up 13.6% versus the same quarter a year ago. This increase was largely due to the consolidation of Alliance Boots for the entire second quarter this year and to sales growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. 
Foreign currency translation adversely affected sales by approximately $750 million or 2.4%. This was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $2.1 billion, up 15.2%. Our net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.4 billion, up 14.4%. And diluted earnings per share were $1.31, up 11.0%. 
These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the second quarter of fiscal 2015 due to the Alliance Boots transaction in December 2014 and the resulting changes in our consolidated group and segmental reporting. 
We've now lapped the closing of that transaction and will have fully comparable quarterly results beginning in the third quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.9 billion, up 35.1%. At the GAAP net earnings level, our performance versus last year was impacted by a number of accounting factors, the most significant being last year's noncash gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held equity investment in Alliance Boots and the change in fair value adjustments on our AmerisourceBergen warrants. As a results, GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $930 million, and diluted EPS were $0.85. 
As this is a leap year, our second-quarter results have benefited from one extra day versus last year. We've, therefore, prepared all comparable sales in prescription figures to include only the first 28 days of February. 
For completeness, here are the numbers for the first half of fiscal 2016. I will not go through those in great detail, but you will note that adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.34 is up 18.2% versus the same period a year ago. 
So turning now to our segmental performance. Total Retail Pharmacy USA sales for the quarter were $21.5 billion, an increase of 2.1% over the same quarter a year ago. Sales on a comparable store basis increased by 2.2%. The sales growth was driven by increased market share, partially offset by the sale of a controlling interest in our infusion business last April and the weak cough, cold, flu season, which was particularly strong in the comparable period last year. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points to 27.7%, primarily due to procurement efficiencies. This resulted in $6.0 billion of adjusted gross profit, up 2.8%. 
Adjusted SG&A was $4.3 billion, an increase of 30 basis points, as we continued to focus on store efficiencies and controlled corporate costs. 
Adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 2.1% given an adjusted operating margin of 7.6%. 
Excluding Walgreens' share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the year-ago quarter, adjusted operating income for the division grew by 10% and adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points. 
So turning now to look in more detail at pharmacy. Pharmacy sales were up 3.2% for the quarter. 233 million prescriptions were filled on a 30-day basis, including immunizations. That was an increase of 3.9%. On a comparable store basis, pharmacy sales increased by 3.7% with comparable scripts filled up 2.8%. 
We view this as a good performance, particularly given the weak cough, cold, flu season this year, which we estimate had a 30 basis point negative impact on comparable scripts. 
The reported incidence of flu across the U.S.A. declined by 16% compared with the year-ago quarter according to IMS Health. 
Overall, our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increased by 19.5%, up approximately 20 basis points over the year-ago quarter, again, as reported by IMS Health. Our increase in comparable store scripts was driven by our Medicare Part D growth strategy, where we grew market share. 
Consistent with our expectations, we experienced a decline in pharmacy gross margins, which were impacted by ongoing reimbursement pressure and changes in mix, including an increased contribution from Medicare Part D. 
As you know, the new Medicare Part D rates came into effect on the 1st of January this year. Our second quarter results, therefore, included 2 months of the new rates. But looking ahead, our third and fourth quarters will reflect their full impact. As we've said before, we continue to anticipate gross margin pressure in pharmacy but remain confident in our ability to grow the business over time. 
Retail product sales were up 30 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2015 with sales on a comparable basis down 30 basis points. Gross margin increased compared with the year-ago quarter. Again, we are pleased with these results given the weak cough, cold, flu season. We estimate this headwind had an impact of approximately 100 basis points on comparable sales this quarter. 
We saw good performances over Christmas and New Year with strong sales in giftables and candy. Wellness, another area of focus, also performed well, driven by sales of vitamins and first aid products. We also made good progress in driving sales of No7 during the quarter. 
As I've mentioned before, we're on track to roll out our differentiated beauty offering to an additional 1,600 stores beginning this summer. This will increase the total number of stores with this beauty offering to approximately 2,000 by the end of calendar 2016. 
So let me now provide more detail on our Retail Pharmacy International division. Total Retail Pharmacy International sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion with pro forma constant-currency comparable store sales up 2.3%. 
Adjusted gross profit was $1.5 billion with an adjusted gross profit margin of 41.1%. 
As you're aware, this quarter is not directly comparable with the same quarter last year, which did not include December 2014. December is a very significant sales month but typically has a slightly lower gross margin, reflecting a higher proportion of gifting items. 
Adjusted SG&A was $1.2 billion, and adjusted operating income was $335 million. The adjusted operating margin of 9.1% was higher than the year-ago period due to the seasonally strongest month of December being part of our second quarter this year. So looking more closely at this segment. Comparable pharmacy sales on a pro forma constant currency basis were up 2.6%, and comparable retail sales were up 2.1%. 
Comparable pharmacy sales in Boots UK increased by 3.0% as a result of an increase in average item value and additional high-value drugs dispensed in hospital pharmacies. Comparable retail sales at Boots UK were up 1.8% driven by a good performance over the holiday period. 
Growth in our boots.com ""Order & Collect service"" was strong with seasonal categories and our beauty product brands, such as No7 and Soap & Glory, being key drivers. 
Liz Earle also performed very well in the quarter, both in-store and online. We're continuing the U.K. rollout of Liz Earle and Sleek, which we acquired in November. 
Outside the U.K., sales growth continue to be particularly strong in the Republic of Ireland. 
Turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales for Pharmaceutical Wholesale were $5.6 billion. On a pro forma constant-currency basis, excluding acquisitions and disposals, comparable sales increased by 1.6% over the same quarter in 2015. This was inline with our estimated market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales. Turkey, the U.K. and Norway performed well, while the French and Russian markets remained challenging. 
Adjusted operating income for the division was $155 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating income margin was 2.8%. Going forward, the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division will include our share of net earnings attributable to our equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. 
I'll now just take a few moments to explain how we will account for this. As you know, following the exercise of our first tranche warrants on the 18th of March, we owned 34.2 million shares or approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of AmerisourceBergen. We'll account for this investment using equity method accounting subject to a 2-month reporting lag. The lag synchronizes our reporting with the end of their quarterly fiscal periods. 
Due to the lag, in our third quarter, we will only recognize our share of equity income for a couple of weeks. But of course, we will recognize a full quarter of equity income in our fourth fiscal quarter based on AmerisourceBergen's quarter ending the 30th of June. 
From a funding perspective, we used approximately $1.2 billion from existing cash on hand to exercise the warrants. 
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the Alliance Boots program were $329 million, taking the cumulative total for this fiscal year to $617 million. We're well on track to deliver our goal of reaching at least $1 billion of combined net synergies in fiscal 2016. 
We're also continuing to make good progress in delivering our $1.5 billion cost-saving program by the end of fiscal 2017 and are well on track to achieve this. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.4 billion, driven by a combination of operational performance and cash conversion from the sale of seasonal inventory. Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $317 million. 
As I have said on previous calls, we continue to invest in key areas that develop our customer proposition, including IT. This resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.0 billion. 
As we have stated previously, we're very focused on cash flow and are very disciplined in making capital allocation decisions, and we remain committed to a solid investment grade rating. 
As you have seen from our press release, we have narrowed our fiscal '16 guidance range to between $4.35 and $4.55 by raising the bottom end of the range by a further $0.05. This assumes AmerisourceBergen equity income on a 2-month lag, no material accretion from the agreement to acquire Rite Aid, the previously announced suspension of the balance of our $3 billion share buyback program, the continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback program relating to equity incentives and no significant changes in current currency exchange rates. 
Please remember that we have currency translational exposure. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating income and EPS, but it can also cause quarterly volatility in the sales, gross margin and SG&A line items. 
We estimate that a 1% move in pound sterling in the euro versus the dollar impacts full-year sales by approximately $150 million and $125 million, respectively. 
On an adjusted earnings level, a 1% move in pound sterling impacts full year adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share; of [ph] the impact of the euro is somewhat less significant. 
Note that other currencies can also impact reported results, particularly on the sales line, as they did this quarter. Our guidance reflects current currency rates and so factors in a headwind of $0.06 since we provided our initial fiscal year 2016 guidance back in October 2015. 
Since Walgreens provided its fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per share goal way back in August 2014, that was $4.25 to $4.60, we've encountered a currency headwind of around $0.19 per share. 
And lastly, when considering the outlook for the balance of this fiscal year, please keep in mind that during the third quarter of our last fiscal year that we had a temporary pause in certain investments within our U.S. business as we evaluated the returns being generated on certain projects. 
By the time we entered the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, we'd finished this exercise and resumed our more normalized SG&A spend. This led to SG&A last year being a little lower in Q3 and a little higher in Q4 than you would expect on a more normalized basis. 
So with that, I will hand you back to Stefano."

So as you have heard, overall, our company is performing pretty much in line with our expectation. In many respects, we are now past the meaning of the exceptional items that have impacted us during the last few quarters as we begin to work of bringing our management information system together. And also, this work, as with most of our projects, is now complete after such a short time as a unified company. We are making good progress. 
As our business begins to normalize and embrace a new approach to reporting and control, both at the fiscal and operational level, we are beginning to see far more clearly the impacts and implications of the levers we have to influence our operations in the areas where we have the greatest opportunities and the areas where we have the most work to do. 
I have to say that this is very much work that we expected. It is an important and necessary exercise to help ensure our priorities are correct and our assumptions are not flawed. 
I believe that the one of our greatest strengths as a management team is that, where we can, we base our decision on provable facts. And where we can't, we always, and I mean always, question our own assumptions. Then we go back and check whether we were right or not so that we can learn and do better next time. 
In our U.S. division, you can see some examples of how we're [indiscernible] new focus on the way we work is impacting the company already in a very real way, beyond the impact of our cost saving and synergy programs are bringing. 
In the more innovative approaches we are taking in terms of partnership and strategic relationship, such as that we have entered into Valeant Pharmaceuticals. While Valeant is -- as a company, is clearly still working its way through some challenges, the collaboration we have with them, those dealings, it's early stages, is showing some very promising results in terms of improved access and affordability of their products. 
Since the close of the quarter, we have announced a partnership with OptumRx to create a new 90-day at retail pharmacy collaboration, giving eligible OptumRx member choice of how to receive their medication and providing them with 24/7 pharmacy availability. 
Although I cannot disclose the terms of this contract, it is fair to say that it has been structured so that there is a shared and mutual benefit to us working together to increase the utilization and volumes in a more collaborative manner that I understand to have been the case in the past. 
Of course, our agreement to acquire Rite Aid is continuing as we expect with the regulatory approval process progressing in line with the timetable we had expected. 
All these actions not only contribute to the development of the company, but also provide us with opportunities and the flexibility to continue the process of reviewing and rejuvenating our existing operation, both in retail and pharmacy, further differentiating us in the marketplace. These trends also validate that in seeking to lead improved efficiency in the health care value chain, we not only target highly selective M&A activities but also new partnership and relationship driven on equity alignment like AmerisourceBergen, innovative commercial relationship, such as the Valeant supply contract, as well as improvement in longstanding arrangements with our critical business partners. 
As we have always said, this is much longer term, but it's essential to the sustainable future of our company. We have to find new, innovative and valuable offering to continue to bring people to our store. In pharmacy, the contracts can help us to do this to an extent, but we need to announce our patient offering and ensure we maximize the value of that interaction, both to the patients and to our service as a company to announce services and reach a relationship between the patient, the pharmacy team and our company overall. 
In the front of our stores, we need to focus our offering, be clear what we stand for and define our 2 areas of expertise in differentiation, and we need to offer these to whatever medium or interface the customer wants. 
We have done well in controlling cost and improving efficiency, but we understand that this has a limited lifespan if the slowing of the sales growth cannot be altered and reversed. Alex and his team know this and are very focused on their strategies to address the recent trend. 
If this all sound very U.S.-focused, it is perhaps not surprising as, today, the U.S. is the market where we have the most immediate opportunities. 
This does not mean we are neglecting our other markets. Far from it. In the U.K., the team is working hard on strategies to keep Boots stores in our rent portfolio, not just ahead of the market, but the most relevant to its customers while working on plan to manage and mitigate the next round of what is ever-present government pressure on pharmacy pricing. 
And across our businesses, owned and in partnership through our equity investment, the work continues constantly, daily, to renew and restructure them, to be the best they can be and to always be ready to address the challenges but, more importantly, to face the opportunities where we see them. As ever, we must do this with extreme vigilance and vigor, so that we achieve it without disrupting the extraordinary level of service our customers have come to and they have the right to expect from us and without failing to deliver for you as the owners of our company.

On the other side, which is still the bigger impact on the operating margin in the U.S. as pharmacy reimbursement, we continue to see the pressures we've spoken about in the past on today and also going forward. As George mentioned on the call, the [indiscernible] of DCs has been good [ph] from a volume point of view on plan, and we've had the expected impact on margin and reimbursement pressure as a result. So I will say that there is really no change overall in the margin. We continue to work hard to improve the front of the store margin with some successes. We continue to see constant reimbursement pressure, which we're dealing with as we are planning to do going forward."

For sure, there's more interest from manufacturers in a mixed model of central specialty on distribution through Retail Pharmacy. And that's because the patients and customers do like having care closer to where they live, when they're on set medications or the carers do as well. We've seen that trend, obviously, going for a while. There has been more interest and more contracts with us, particularly since we started to speak about new model and relationship with Valeant. But at this stage, we are really working that through in terms of what does that mean for what we do today. So you know we got some great assets in communities beyond the almost 1,000 centers of excellence that we have within our normal drugstores. We have community pharmacies well over 100 now, close to where some of these specialist doctors that look after patients. And we have, again, plans for well over a couple hundred in hospital pharmacies as well, again, doing with outpatient specialty. So we think we got a fantastic network, to be honest, to deal with this trend as it comes through. But we're still working it out. So the interest is high. We're building our assets. And we're working out what other partnerships we need with both manufacturers and others to try and take advantage of this trend."

As George, I think, has said, we've only had 2 of the 3 months this quarter actually had the Med D impact. So I think it's still good to look at 1 quarter in isolation. What I would also say is that we are constantly working hard at procurement, not just because of deflation, but as Stefano said, because of the good capability we have in Europe. And therefore, we are working hard to try to deliver more synergies. The cost base also that was working on has balanced that out. But all of that is balanced out by the ongoing reimbursement pressure beyond simply the Med D contracts. There are commensurate reimbursement pressures, and when they impact us, we'll let you know, but they are definitely there. And also, we are working them hard as well. So, obviously, on balance, the operating margin in this quarter was slightly more positive because of the impacts of when certain things hit. The overall trend is really the same trend that we've seen and we've been seeing for some time, and we've managed that trend."

That's the real aim of this program. We're comfortable with the deal that we have struck. It's a fair deal both ways, and we had a great conversation on the way through with the team from Optum, and we're in good shape.

So I think the opportunity is still a lot to come, particularly on the expansion of differentiation and higher-margin products.

Other -- and increase -- better relationship with, say, your suppliers, can help, of course, because it contributes to the margin, better relationship with the clients, with the PBM. We saw the people who are, at the end of the day, they have the tools for the scripts. And a clever way of collaborating with them can help because it can increase the number of fleet [ph]. And of course, the volume is very, very important because if you can compensate, at least partially, the volume -- by the volume the reduction in margin, of course, this can help substantially.

As you can see from our results, I'm pleased to announce that we have delivered another solid performance, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 better than original expectations. We have also made further progress in positioning our company for the future. We are continuing to build strong business partnerships in [indiscernible] markets. In the U.S., we have made particularly good progress in developing closer relationships with payers and PBM. In March, we exercised our first tranche of warrants in AmerisourceBergen purchasing common stock. We subsequently extended our pharmaceutical distribution and [indiscernible] arrangements by 3 years. ABC is a great working [indiscernible] certain capital investments in their relationship and we proceed with additional capital investments in its distribution network. 
Our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid is progressing as planned. As you know, we are in the process of seeking regulatory approval. In parallel, our integration team is continuing its work on preliminary planning. In June, we completed a $6 billion public bond offering to support the funding of the acquisition. Also in June, I am pleased to report that we achieved our $1 billion synergy goal for fiscal 2016 from the Walgreens and Alliance Boots merger. 
June was quite a busy month for us. We have also changed our senior management responsibility to structure the company in a way that is more efficient following the successful integration of Walgreens Boots Alliance as we move to operating a unified company. To support me in my role, we have created Co-Chief Operating Officer, Alex Gourlay, and Ornella Barra. We'll oversee the day-to-day activities of the company with the support of George Fairweather as Global Chief Financial Officer; and Marco Pagni as global Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel, and of course, with the continued support of our other senior leaders. 
Over the past 10 [ph] years, Alex and Ornella [ph] have established an extremely effective working partnership and have created significant value for our company today. They will be instrumental in driving the operations of our company in the next phase of its evolution. This will allow me to focus even more on driving the growth strategy and developing our company. You can be assured, however, that this change will not in any way reduce my scrutiny and expectation of our businesses and the [indiscernible]. 
Since the quarter-end, as you have seen, the U.K. referendum in Europe has created some uncertainties and volatility in our market. Our businesses and management teams have operated the too many business cycles in many markets. Perhaps change is [indiscernible] and a sign of [indiscernible] we work with and manage it every day. Yes and volatility and uncertainty create issues that are to be overcome, but they also provide opportunities for our company. It is our job to ensure we meet these opportunities positively and position and structure our company to its best advantage. As events unfold and the uncertainty in the wider market are resolved, I am confident that we will emerge well positioned as we enter more optimistic times. The progress that we have made to date gives us stronger platform from which to drive further efficiencies, meet the challenges of current volatility in many of our markets and the potential wider economic impact this may have in many of the regions we work in and puts us in an even better position for the company to deliver long-term success. 
Now let me hand over to George."
93624,345162950,1004584,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 06, 2016",2016-07-06,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefano. I'd like to start by pointing out that for the first time since the acquisition of Alliance Boots, we have fully comparable quarterly results. Net sales for the quarter totaled $29.5 billion, up 2.4% versus the same quarter last year.",1274,"Thank you, Stefano. I'd like to start by pointing out that for the first time since the acquisition of Alliance Boots, we have fully comparable quarterly results. Net sales for the quarter totaled $29.5 billion, up 2.4% versus the same quarter last year. These were impacted by currency translation, net sales on a constant currency basis being up 3.3%. GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, up 9.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion and diluted EPS was $1.01. The decrease in both GAAP net earnings and net earnings per share was due to fluctuations in the fair value of our ABC warrants. 
Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, up 3.7%. On a constant currency basis, this represents an increase of 4.7%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.3 billion, up 14.7% and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.18, up 15.7%. The adjusted effective tax rate which we calculate excluding the equity income from ABC was 24.4%, the rate benefiting from revisions to the full year tax rate forecast including certain discrete items. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be broadly in line with the year-to-date rate of 27.2%. 
For completeness, here are the numbers for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the first 9 months of the previous year. I will not go through them in detail, but you will see that GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.88 was down 28.7%. This reflects a number of accounting factors including the fluctuations in the warrants and last year's noncash gain relating to Alliance Boots. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 17.3% to $3.52. 
So turning now to our segmental performance starting as usual with Retail Pharmacy USA. Total sales for the quarter in Retail Pharmacy USA were $21.2 billion, an increase of 3.7% over the same quarter last year. Sales growth was driven by an increase in pharmacy partially offset by the sale of a controlling interest in our infusion business back in April 2015. Comparable store sales increased by 3.9%. As we expected, adjusted gross margin declined by 0.5 percentage points to 26.9% while pharmacy margin was partially offset by retail products. Adjusted gross profit was up 1.8% to $5.7 billion and adjusted SG&A was $4.3 billion, an increase of 1.1%. Now as you may recall, in the same quarter last year, SG&A was lower than normal. This was because we had a temporary pause in certain investments while we evaluated the returns being generated. We are pleased with our performance and we are well on track towards achieving our overall target savings from our cost transformation program. This program, the vast majority of which is in the U.S., will deliver $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 6.5% resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion, up 4.1%. 
So turning now to look in more detail at pharmacy. Total U.S. pharmacy sales in the quarter were up 5.8%. We filled 235 million prescriptions on a 30-day basis including immunizations, an increase of 3.9%. This reflects our strategy of increasing script volume in our stores. On a comparable basis, pharmacy sales increased by 6%, scripts filled being up by 4.5%, primarily due to continued growth in Medicare Part D volume. Our reported market share retail prescriptions on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 19.6%. Over the year ago quarter, this was up approximately 30 basis points. As we expected, gross margins were lower mainly due to reimbursement rates and changes in mix partially offset by procurement efficiencies. 
Retail product sales on a comparable basis increased by 0.1%. [ph] This was primarily due to higher sales in the health and wellness and photo categories partially offset by declines in certain convenience categories. As we've said previously, we are focused on expanding front-of-store gross margins and are pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. To further drive performance, we're starting to expand our differentiated beauty offering across over 1,800 stores and expect to complete this phase by the end of calendar 2016. 
So turning next to our Retail Pharmacy International division. Total sales in the quarter for the Retail Pharmacy International division were $3.2 billion, an increase of 3.4% on a constant currency basis. Comparable store sales increased by 0.2% [ph], and clearly comparable figures are in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was 8.1%, up 0.4 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $258 million, an increase of 8% in constant currency. Comparable pharmacy sales decreased [ph] by 0.7% [ph] due to Boots in the U.K. and the loss of certain institutional contracts in Chile. In Boots U.K., comparable pharmacy sales were down 1% due to the negative impact of the reduction in government pharmacy funding that was expected. As you may know, the U.K. government has been consulting with the industry on pharmacy funding. The consultation period closed at the end of May and we are awaiting to hear their conclusions. Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.7% [ph] with strong performances in the Republic of Ireland and Thailand. Boots U.K.'s comparable retail sales increased by 0.6%. [ph] We were particularly pleased with the performance of our sleek [ph] cosmetics brands acquired in November last year and #7 where in April, we successfully launched our new lift and illuminate triple action serum. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division were $5.7 billion [ph]. In April, we sold Alliance Healthcare Russia to 36.6 and returned for a 15% stake in the combined group. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis excluding acquisitions and dispositions increased by 6.3%. This was ahead of our estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales. In a number of our emerging markets, sales growth was particularly strong. Adjusted operating margin was 3% leveled with the same quarter last year. Within the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, we report our 16% share of ABC's net earnings. This is reported and a 2-month lag in the quarter including only 2 weeks of equity method income. Overall, the division's adjusted operating income increased 4.7% to $179 million. On a constant currency basis, the increase was 7.6%, of which 4.7% was for ABC. Next quarter, we will recognize a full 3-month share of ABC's net earnings based on their quarter to the end of June. 
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the strategic combination with Alliance Boots were $330 million. This takes a cumulative total up to the quarter end to $947 million. As Stefano said, since the quarter-end, we have achieved our goal of reaching at least $1 billion of combined net synergies. Going forward, we will, therefore, not be breaking them out separately as we have said before. 
In the quarter, operating cash flow was $2.1 billion. This was due to our solid profit performance and favorable working capital cash flows. Cash capital expenditure was $247 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $1.9 billion. 
Looking to the full fiscal year results. We have raised the lower end of our guidance by $0.10. Guidance is, therefore, $4.45 to $4.55. This assumes no impact from the proposed acquisition of Rite Aid and related financing and already assumes current exchange rates for the rest of the fiscal year. Looking forward to fiscal 2017, our current plan is to issue guidance in October when we announce our full year results. 
I will now hand back to Gerald. Thank you."

We've been quite conservative in the first sort of part of the year on this while we're we doing this work. And really, the numbers that you've seen in the quarter, if you look at year-to-date as I said in my presentation, that really gives us a true reflection of what the rate would be with this mix of profits at the currency rates that we've seen in this year-to-date. So I think you should really look at it as a clear rate. Clearly, if we then -- going forward, the mix changes, and clearly, it will change with Rite Aid coming being U.S.-based and U.S. being obviously one of the highest tax countries in the mix of where we trade and you will see the tax rate going up and reflecting mix but only mix."

As you can see from our results, I am pleased to announce that we have delivered another solid performance, with adjusted earning per share of $1.18, better than original expectations. We have also made further progress in positioning our company for the future. 
We are continuing to build strong business partnerships across our markets. In the U.S., we have made particularly good progress in developing closer relationships with payers and PBM. In March, we exercised our first tranche of warrants in AmerisourceBergen purchasing common stock. We subsequently extended our pharmaceutical distribution and sourcing arrangements by 3 years. ABC has agreed to make certain working capital investments in the relationship, and we proceed with additional capital investments in its distribution network. 
Our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid is progressing as planned. As you know, we are in the process of seeking regulatory approval. In parallel, our integration team is continuing its work on preliminary planning. In June, we completed a $6 billion public bond offering to support the funding of the acquisition. Also in June, I am pleased to report that we achieved our $1 billion synergy goal for fiscal 2016 from the Walgreens and Alliance Boots merger. 
June was quite a busy month for us. We have also changed our senior management responsibility to structure the company in a way that is more efficient following the successful integration of Walgreens Boots Alliance as we move to operating a unified company. To support me in my role, we have created Co-Chief Operating Officers, Alex Gourlay, and Ornella Barra, who will oversee the day-to-day activities of the company with the support of George Fairweather as Global Chief Financial Officer; and Marco Pagni as Global Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel; and of course, with the continued support of our other senior leaders. 
Over the past 10 years, Alex and Ornella have established an extremely effective working partnership and have created significant value for our company today. They will be instrumental in driving the operations of our company in the next phase of its evolution. This will allow me to focus even more on driving the growth strategy and developing our company. You can be assured, however, that this change will not in any way reduce my scrutiny and expectations of our businesses and the team.
Since the quarter end, as you have seen, the U.K. referendum on Europe has created some uncertainties and volatility in our market. Our businesses and management teams have operated through many business cycles in many markets. Perhaps change is normal and a sign of life. We work with and manage it every day. Yes, volatility and uncertainty create issues to be overcome, but they also provide opportunities for our company. It is our job to ensure we meet these opportunities positively and position and structure our company to its best advantage. As events unfold and the uncertainty in the wider markets resolved, I am confident that we will emerge well positioned as we enter more optimistic times. The progress that we have made to date gives us a stronger platform from which to drive further efficiencies, meet the challenges of current volatility in many of our market and the potential wider economic impact this may have in many of the region we work in, and puts us in an even better position for the company to deliver long-term success. 
Now let me hand over to George."
93624,345162950,1004687,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 06, 2016",2016-07-06,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefano. I'd like to start by pointing out that for the first time since the acquisition of Alliance Boots, we have fully comparable quarterly results. Net sales for the quarter totaled $29.5 billion, up 2.4% versus the same quarter last year.",1267,"Thank you, Stefano. I'd like to start by pointing out that for the first time since the acquisition of Alliance Boots, we have fully comparable quarterly results. Net sales for the quarter totaled $29.5 billion, up 2.4% versus the same quarter last year. These were impacted by currency translation, net sales on a constant currency basis being up 3.3%. GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, up 9.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion, and diluted EPS was $1.01. The decrease in both GAAP net earnings and net earnings per share was due to fluctuations in the fair value of our ABC warrants. 
Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, up 3.7%. On a constant currency basis, this represents an increase of 4.7%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.3 billion, up 14.7%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.18, up 15.7%. 
The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from ABC, was 24.4%, the rate benefiting from revisions to the full year tax rate forecast, including certain discrete items. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be broadly in line with the year-to-date rate of 27.2%. 
For completeness, here are the numbers for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the first 9 months of the previous year. I will not go through them in detail, but you will see that GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.88 was down 28.7%. This reflects a number of accounting factors, including the fluctuations in the warrants and last year's noncash gain relating to Alliance Boots. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 17.3% to $3.52. 
So turning now to our segmental performance, starting as usual with Retail Pharmacy USA. Total sales for the quarter in Retail Pharmacy USA were $21.2 billion, an increase of 3.7% over the same quarter last year. Sales growth was driven by an increase in pharmacy partially offset by the sale of a controlling interest in our infusion business back in April 2015. Comparable store sales increased by 3.9%. As we expected, adjusted gross margin declined by 0.5 percentage points to 26.9%, lower pharmacy margin being partially offset by retail products. Adjusted gross profit was up 1.8% to $5.7 billion and adjusted SG&A was $4.3 billion, an increase of 1.1%. Now as you may recall, in the same quarter last year, SG&A was lower than normal. This was because we had a temporary pause in certain investments while we evaluated the returns being generated. 
We are pleased with our performance and we are well on track towards achieving our overall target savings from our cost transformation program. This program, the vast majority of which is in the U.S., will deliver $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 6.5% resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion, up 4.1%. 
So turning now to look in more detail at pharmacy. Total U.S. pharmacy sales in the quarter were up 5.8%. We filled 235 million prescriptions on a 30-day basis including immunizations, an increase of 3.9%. This reflects our strategy of increasing script volume in our stores. On a comparable basis, pharmacy sales increased by 6%, scripts filled being up by 4.5%, primarily due to continued growth in Medicare Part D volume. Our reported market share retail prescriptions on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 19.6%. Over the year-ago quarter, this was up approximately 30 basis points. As we expected, gross margins were lower mainly due to reimbursement rates and changes in mix partially offset by procurement efficiencies. 
Retail product sales on a comparable basis increased by 0.1%. This was primarily due to higher sales in the health and wellness and photo categories, partially offset by declines in certain convenience categories. As we've said previously, we are focused on expanding front-of-store gross margins and are pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. To further drive performance, we're starting to expand our differentiated beauty offering across over 1,800 stores and expect to complete this phase by the end of calendar 2016. 
So turning next to our Retail Pharmacy International division. Total sales in the quarter for the Retail Pharmacy International division were $3.2 billion, an increase of 3.4% on a constant currency basis. Comparable store sales increased by 0.2%, and clearly, comparable figures are in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was 8.1%, up 0.4 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $258 million, an increase of 8% in constant currency. Comparable pharmacy sales decreased by 0.7% due to Boots in the U.K. and the loss of certain institutional sales contracts in Chile. In Boots UK, comparable pharmacy sales were down 1% due to the negative impact of a reduction in government pharmacy funding that was expected. As you may know, the U.K. government has been consulting with the industry on pharmacy funding. The consultation period closed at the end of May, and we are awaiting to hear their conclusions. 
Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.7% with strong performances in the Republic of Ireland and Thailand. Boots UK's comparable retail sales increased by 0.6%. We were particularly pleased with the performance of our Sleek cosmetics brand, acquired in November last year, and No7, where in April, we successfully launched our new Lift and Luminate Triple Action Serum. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division were $5.7 billion. In April, we sold Alliance Healthcare Russia to 36.6 in return for a 15% stake in the combined group. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and dispositions, increased by 6.3%. This was ahead of our estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales. In a number of our emerging markets, sales growth was particularly strong. Adjusted operating margin was 3%, level with the same quarter last year. 
Within the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, we report our 16% share of ABC's net earnings. As this is reported on a 2-month lag, the quarter including only 2 weeks of equity method income. Overall, the division's adjusted operating income increased 4.7% to $179 million. On a constant currency basis, the increase was 7.6%, of which 4.7% was for ABC. Next quarter, we will recognize a full 3-month share of ABC's net earnings based on their quarter to the end of June. 
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the strategic combination with Alliance Boots were $330 million. This takes the cumulative total up to the quarter end to $947 million. As Stefano said, since the quarter end, we have achieved our goal of reaching at least $1 billion of combined net synergies. Going forward, we will, therefore, not be breaking them out separately as we have said before. 
In the quarter, operating cash flow was $2.1 billion. This was due to our solid profit performance and favorable working capital cash flows. Cash capital expenditure was $247 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $1.9 billion. 
Looking to the full fiscal year results. We have raised the lower end of our guidance by $0.10. Guidance is, therefore, $4.45 to $4.55. This assumes no impact from the proposed acquisition of Rite Aid and related financing and already assumes current exchange rates for the rest of the fiscal year. Looking forward to fiscal 2017, our current plan is to issue guidance in October when we announce our full year results. 
I will now hand back to Gerald. Thank you."

So this is a deeper conversation about the -- what we call a global sum in the U.K., which is the amount of money they pay all pharmacy, a combination of drug costs and services. And the government are keen to get more value from pharmacy, and that's the negotiation that's currently being carried out. And it's not just for Boots, but it's for the whole market. Boots has a roundabout 1/5 of the market in the U.K. in pharmacy. It is not untypical. We've lived with this sort of pressure and these requests for very many, many years, both in the U.K. and Europe, and we're used to dealing with it. But there's a particular phase we're going through where that request is slightly deeper with the norm, and obviously, the industry is working together to try and give the government the best answer we can."

It was consolidated and now this is not consolidated anymore because we have 15% of the new company. To be honest, Russia was a quite volatile account, where the results were depending very much on the weather. And also over time, the wholesaling business, which was really the best part of the supply chain over the chain in Russia earning-wise, has deteriorated because the pharmacies have become more important. In the past, the pharmacies were not particularly profitable because the cost of the rents was really very, very high. Now the situation is normalized. You can have long-term or medium-term rents with a way of extending the rents. And so the pharmacies are becoming the most important and the most profitable part of the chain. And so we had the opportunity to contribute our wholesale to the largest pharmacy chain because we have 1,000 pharmacies in 36.6, but 1,000 pharmacies also in another chain, A5, and the 2 chains have merged. And so we have 15% in a company where we had in reality 2,000 pharmacies, and the opportunity to buy out the company is ideal. So we will see what happens in 5 years, and we will take the decision. It's a big opportunity for us because this is the best segment of the distribution in Russia today."

And if you remember, we're investing quite a lot in our core IT systems right now, both in retail in a SAP program, that is about 6 months in; and also in pharmacy, where we're redoing our pharmacy system over the next 5 years. These 2 alone, apart from working capital benefits, will clearly make the whole supply chain more efficient and allow us to remove a lot of noncustomer-facing activity out of the drugstores and save money and also put more hours into customer care, which is part of our strategy to become more differentiated in health, wellness and beauty care and pharmacy. So I think there is a significant investment going in. The board signed us off only a couple of months ago fully, and we're very confident the programs are well set up. And we've got the global expertise, both here in America and Europe, applied to these 2 very important programs here in the U.S. And we'll update you on what that means in the future as it becomes clear about the benefits that we see coming through. We've already gone back to the first question, starting with minimum wage. We've already -- in the background, we've already -- for most lower-paid people in the stores, improved the base salary. We've done that already. That's already in the cost you see, and we'll continue to improve our minimum wage against the market, paying very close attention to the market. Second to that, we're also upscaling our people, for example, with the rollout of beauty differentiation. We're putting in place a number of beauty consultants in our top 2,000 stores, who have got deeper expertise and more knowledge and more ability to take care and drive up sales appropriately with customers. That's another investment we are making in labor cost in stores, but with a very clear return on our investment. So we're feeling good about where we are on these 2 investments. With the overtime, we explore this very carefully. We have a solution very clearly mapped out, and we'll announce that solution at an appropriate time. And it's one that will both be fair to people and cost effective to our shareholders."

Typically, obviously, one is prudent in doing provisioning and then, when one is able to agree numbers with the various tax authorities, then one has to the discrete items. But fundamentally, we've been doing a lot of work looking at our underlying tax rates and exactly with the quite complex structure that we got in place, what is the real underlying rate. We've been quite conservative in the first sort of part of the year on this while we're we doing this work. And really, the numbers that we've seen in the quarter, if you look at the year-to-date, as we said in my presentation, that really gives us a true reflection of what the rate would be with this mix of profits at the currency rates that we've seen in this year-to-date. So I think it's -- I think you should really look at it as a clear rate. Clearly, if we then -- going forward, the mix changes. And clearly, it will change with Rite Aid coming in, being U.S.-based and the U.S. being, obviously, one of the highest tax countries in the mix of where we trade. Then you will see the tax rate going up, reflecting mix, but only mix."

And these numbers, we extrapolate it with costs. We also looked at different models of investment from a people point of view and investment in fixturing. We created what we thought was the most customer effective, and importantly, the best model for a return to our shareholders. And that's what we're implementing right now this summer at roundabout 1,600 more stores. And we're very confident because we've seen these customer behaviors of more in their basket and coming back more often, specifically for No7 skin care consistently for the 18 months.

Of course, they do, but we have so much opportunity with Walgreens. With 6 million customers, about 20% of them are what we call [indiscernible] customers, who are prepared to buy more beauty products from Walgreens, and that's what we've focused in to the Walgreens channel. The rest of the team, led by Ken, who heads up our brands division for WBA, are focused on building the brands in across America and building good relationships with the partners outside of Walgreens. It's a very clear strategy and one where we want to be successful in both, and that's what we intend to do."

As you can see from our results, I am pleased to announce that we have delivered another solid performance, with adjusted earning per share of $1.18, better than original expectations. We have also made further progress in positioning our company for the future. 
We are continuing to build strong business partnerships across our markets. In the U.S., we have made particularly good progress in developing closer relationships with payers and PBM. In March, we exercised our first tranche of warrants in AmerisourceBergen purchasing common stock. We subsequently extended our pharmaceutical distribution and sourcing arrangements by 3 years. ABC has agreed to make certain working capital investments in the relationship, and will proceed with additional capital investments in its distribution network. 
Our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid is progressing as planned. As you know, we are in the process of seeking regulatory approval. In parallel, our integration team is continuing its work on preliminary planning. In June, we completed a $6 billion public bond offering to support the funding of the acquisition. Also in June, I am pleased to report that we achieved our $1 billion synergy goal for fiscal 2016 from the Walgreens and Alliance Boots merger. 
June was quite a busy month for us. We have also changed our senior management responsibility to structure the company in a way that is more efficient, following the successful integration of Walgreens Boots Alliance as we move to operating a unified company. To support me in my role, we have created Co-Chief Operating Officers, Alex Gourlay, and Ornella Barra, who will oversee the day-to-day activities of the company with the support of George Fairweather as Global Chief Financial Officer; and Marco Pagni as Global Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel; and of course, with the continued support of our other senior leaders. 
Over the past 10 years, Alex and Ornella have established an extremely effective working partnership and have created significant value for our company today. They will be instrumental in driving the operations of our company in the next phase of its evolution. This will allow me to focus even more on driving the growth strategy and developing our company. You can be assured, however, that this change will not in any way reduce my scrutiny and expectations of our businesses and the team.
Since the quarter end, as you have seen, the U.K. referendum on Europe has created some uncertainty and volatility in our market. Our businesses and management teams have operated through many business cycles in many markets. For us, change is normal and a sign of life. We work with and manage it every day. Yes, volatility and uncertainty create issues to be overcome, but they also provide opportunities for our company. It is our job to ensure that we meet these opportunities positively and position and structure our company to its best advantage. As events unfold and the uncertainty in the wider market is resolved, I am confident that we will emerge well positioned as we enter more optimistic times. The progress that we have made to date gives us a stronger platform from which to drive further efficiencies, meet the challenges of current volatility in many of our market and the potential wider economic impact this may have in many of the region we work in, and puts us in an even better position for the company to deliver long-term success. 
Now let me hand over to George."
93624,345162950,1004781,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 06, 2016",2016-07-06,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefano. I'd like to start by pointing out that for the first time since the acquisition of Alliance Boots, we have fully comparable quarterly results. Net sales for the quarter totaled $29.5 billion, up 2.4% versus the same quarter last year.",1268,"Thank you, Stefano. I'd like to start by pointing out that for the first time since the acquisition of Alliance Boots, we have fully comparable quarterly results. Net sales for the quarter totaled $29.5 billion, up 2.4% versus the same quarter last year. These were impacted by currency translation, net sales on a constant currency basis being up 3.3%. GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, up 9.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion, and diluted EPS was $1.01. The decrease in both GAAP net earnings and net earnings per share was due to fluctuations in the fair value of our ABC warrants. 
Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, up 3.7%. On a constant currency basis, this represents an increase of 4.7%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.3 billion, up 14.7%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.18, up 15.7%. 
The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from ABC, was 24.4%, the rate benefiting from revisions to the full year tax rate forecast, including certain discrete items. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be broadly in line with the year-to-date rate of 27.2%. 
For completeness, here are the numbers for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the first 9 months of the previous year. I will not go through them in detail, but you will see that GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.88 was down 28.7%. This reflects a number of accounting factors, including the fluctuations in the warrants and last year's noncash gain relating to Alliance Boots. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 17.3% to $3.52. 
So turning now to our segmental performance, starting as usual with Retail Pharmacy USA. Total sales for the quarter in Retail Pharmacy USA were $21.2 billion, an increase of 3.7% over the same quarter last year. Sales growth was driven by an increase in pharmacy, partially offset by the sale of a controlling interest in our infusion business back in April 2015. Comparable store sales increased by 3.9%. As we expected, adjusted gross margin declined by 0.5 percentage points to 26.9%, lower pharmacy margin being partially offset by retail products. Adjusted gross profit was up 1.8% to $5.7 billion and adjusted SG&A was $4.3 billion, an increase of 1.1%. Now as you may recall, in the same quarter last year, SG&A was lower than normal. This was because we had a temporary pause in certain investments while we evaluated the returns being generated. 
We are pleased with our performance and we are well on track towards achieving our overall target savings from our cost transformation program. This program, the vast majority of which is in the U.S., will deliver $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 6.5% resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion, up 4.1%. 
So turning now to look in more detail at pharmacy. Total U.S. pharmacy sales in the quarter were up 5.8%. We filled 235 million prescriptions on a 30-day basis including immunizations, an increase of 3.9%. This reflects our strategy of increasing script volume in our stores. On a comparable basis, pharmacy sales increased by 6%, scripts filled being up by 4.5%, primarily due to continued growth in Medicare Part D volume. Our reported market share of retail prescriptions on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 19.6%. Over the year-ago quarter, this was up approximately 30 basis points. As we expected, gross margins were lower mainly due to reimbursement rates and changes in mix, partially offset by procurement efficiencies. 
Retail product sales on a comparable basis increased by 0.1%. This was primarily due to higher sales in the health and wellness and photo categories, partially offset by declines in certain convenience categories. As we've said previously, we are focused on expanding front-of-store gross margins and are pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. To further drive performance, we're starting to expand our differentiated beauty offering across over 1,800 stores and expect to complete this phase by the end of calendar 2016. 
So turning next to our Retail Pharmacy International division. Total sales in the quarter for the Retail Pharmacy International division were $3.2 billion, an increase of 3.4% on a constant currency basis. Comparable store sales increased by 0.2%, and clearly, comparable figures are in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was 8.1%, up 0.4 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $258 million, an increase of 8% in constant currency. Comparable pharmacy sales decreased by 0.7% due to Boots in the U.K. and the loss of certain institutional sales contracts in Chile. In Boots UK, comparable pharmacy sales were down 1% due to the negative impact of a reduction in government pharmacy funding that was expected. As you may know, the U.K. government has been consulting with the industry on pharmacy funding. The consultation period closed at the end of May, and we are waiting to hear their conclusions. 
Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.7% with strong performances in the Republic of Ireland and Thailand. Boots UK's comparable retail sales increased by 0.6%. We were particularly pleased with the performance of our Sleek cosmetics brand, acquired in November last year, and No7, where in April, we successfully launched our new Lift and Luminate Triple Action Serum. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division were $5.7 billion. In April, we sold Alliance Healthcare Russia to 36.6 in return for a 15% stake in the combined group. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and dispositions, increased by 6.3%. This was ahead of our estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales. In a number of our emerging markets sales growth was particularly strong. Adjusted operating margin was 3%, level with the same quarter last year. 
Within the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division we report our 16% share of ABC's net earnings. As this is reported on a 2-month lag, the quarter included only 2 weeks of equity method income. Overall, the division's adjusted operating income increased 4.7% to $179 million. On a constant currency basis, the increase was 7.6%, of which 4.7% was for ABC. Next quarter, we will recognize a full 3-month share of ABC's net earnings based on their quarter to the end of June. 
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the strategic combination with Alliance Boots were $330 million. This takes the cumulative total up to the quarter end to $947 million. As Stefano said, since the quarter end, we have achieved our goal of reaching at least $1 billion of combined net synergies. Going forward, we will, therefore, not be breaking them out separately as we have said before. 
In the quarter, operating cash flow was $2.1 billion. This was due to our solid profit performance and favorable working capital cash flows. Cash capital expenditure was $247 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $1.9 billion. 
Looking to the full fiscal year results. We have raised the lower end of our guidance by $0.10. Guidance is, therefore, $4.45 to $4.55. This assumes no impact from the proposed acquisition of Rite Aid and related financing and already assumes current exchange rates for the rest of the fiscal year. Looking forward to fiscal 2017, our current plan is to issue guidance in October when we announce our full year results. 
I will now hand back to Gerald. Thank you."

To be honest, Russia was a quite volatile account, where the results were depending very much on the weather. And also over time, the wholesaling business, which was really the best part of the supply chain of the chain in Russia earning-wise, has deteriorated because the pharmacies have become more important. In the past, the pharmacies were not particularly profitable because the cost of the rents was really very, very high. Now the situation is normalized. You can have long-term or medium-term rents with a way of extending the rents. And so the pharmacies are becoming the most important and the most profitable part of the chain. And so we had the opportunity to contribute our wholesale to the largest pharmacy chain because we have 1,000 pharmacies in 36.6, but 1,000 pharmacies also in another chain, A5, and the 2 chains have merged. And so we have 15% in a company where we have in reality 2,000 pharmacies, and the opportunity to buy out the company in 5 years. So we will see what happens in 5 years, and we will take the decision. It's a big opportunity for us because this is the best segment of the distribution in Russia today."

So I think there is a significant investment going in. The board signed this off only a couple of months ago fully, and we're very confident the programs are well set up. And we've got the global expertise, both here in America and Europe, applied to these 2 very important programs here in the U.S. And we'll update you on what that means in the future as it becomes clear about the benefits that we see coming through. We've already -- going back to the first question, starting with minimum wage. We've already, in the background, we've already, for most lower-paid people in stores, improved the base salary. We've done that already. That's already in the cost you see, and we'll continue to improve our minimum wage against the market, paying very close attention to the market. Second to that, we're also upscaling our people, for example, with the rollout of beauty differentiation. We're putting in place a number of beauty consultants in our top 2,000 stores, who have got deeper expertise and more knowledge and more ability to take care and drive up sales appropriately with customers. That's another investment we are making in labor costs in our stores, but with a very clear return on our investment. So we're feeling good about where we are on these 2 investments.

So let me talk a little bit how you're rethinking that whole part of the business. And when you broadening out to consumables, can that business effectively drive traffic?

And we believe that Walgreens in particular can play a much broader role in that work. We've only really had the data with the card, our Balance Reward card for just about 3 years. And we're now seeing very clearly the opportunities for the fill-in mission. And we're now constructing our offer across convenience categories, including toiletries, that we believe will offer the right brands at the right price, not the lowest price but the right price, and we're on with that work. It will be different by types of stores for sure and, therefore, it's quite a complicated piece to get done. But we are well on the journey and you'll see that coming through in the months and years ahead. It's very important to our plan. Obviously, we're trying to create destination -- more destination beauty. That plan has already been executed in 1,800 stores as we speak, and there'll be more to come once we get these stores complete. And health care has always been a very important category to us, and we continue to drive that category pretty well, and so that's how we see driving footfall back into our drug stores. The final thing to say about footfall is omnichannel. It's really important to see that in the U.K. The U.K. team have done a really nice job in the U.K. market here to join or repair [ph] the supply chain and to make that effective for customers. Clearly, we can share and borrow some of that best practice from Europe, and we intend to do that."

The next phase is to really start to drive sales, particularly in beauty. That will be progressive over a period of time and it's actually this summer into the autumn. So you should start to see the comps gradually improve quarter by quarter. But the key thing, really, that we keep on repeating is that the comps are important but are always going to be relatively low in reality in a mature market where we were really shifting the mix. The important thing is the operating margin, and that's the thing that we've been constantly focused on now for the past couple of years.

We've been quite conservative in the first sort of part of the year on this while we're we doing this work. And really, the numbers that we've seen in the quarter, if you look at the year-to-date, as we said in my presentation, that really gives us a true reflection of what the rate would be with this mix of profits at the currency rates that we've seen in this year-to-date. So I think it's -- I think you should really look at it as a clear rate. Clearly, if we then -- going forward, the mix changes.

As you can see from our results, I am pleased to announce that we have delivered another solid performance, with adjusted earning per share of $1.18, better than original expectations. We have also made further progress in positioning our company for the future. 
We are continuing to build strong business partnerships across our markets. In the U.S., we have made particularly good progress in developing closer relationships with payers and PBM. In March, we exercised our first tranche of warrants in AmerisourceBergen purchasing common stock. We subsequently extended our pharmaceutical distribution and sourcing arrangements by 3 years. ABC has agreed to make certain working capital investments in the relationship, and will proceed with additional capital investments in its distribution network. 
Our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid is progressing as planned. As you know, we are in the process of seeking regulatory approval. In parallel, our integration team is continuing its work on preliminary planning. In June, we completed a $6 billion public bond offering to support the funding of the acquisition. Also in June, I am pleased to report that we achieved our $1 billion synergy goal for fiscal 2016 from the Walgreens and Alliance Boots merger. 
June was quite a busy month for us. We have also changed our senior management responsibility to structure the company in a way that is more efficient, following the successful integration of Walgreens Boots Alliance as we move to operating a unified company. To support me in my role, we have created Co-Chief Operating Officers, Alex Gourlay, and Ornella Barra, who will oversee the day-to-day activities of the company with the support of George Fairweather as Global Chief Financial Officer; and Marco Pagni as Global Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel; and of course, with the continued support of our other senior leaders. 
Over the past 10 years, Alex and Ornella have established an extremely effective working partnership and have created significant value for our company today. They will be instrumental in driving the operations of our company in the next phase of its evolution. This will allow me to focus even more on driving the growth strategy and developing our company. You can be assured, however, that this change will not in any way reduce my scrutiny and expectations of our businesses and the team.
Since the quarter end, as you have seen, the U.K. referendum on Europe has created some uncertainty and volatility in our market. Our businesses and management teams have operated through many business cycles in many markets. For us, change is normal and a sign of life. We work with and manage it every day. Yes, volatility and uncertainty create issues to be overcome, but they also provide opportunities for our company. It is our job to ensure that we meet these opportunities positively and position and structure our company to its best advantage. As events unfold and the uncertainty in the wider market is resolved, I am confident that we will emerge well positioned as we enter more optimistic times. The progress that we have made to date gives us a stronger platform from which to drive further efficiencies, meet the challenges of current volatility in many of our market and the potential wider economic impact this may have in many of the region we work in, and puts us in an even better position for the company to deliver long-term success. 
Now let me hand over to George."

I'd like to start by pointing out that for the first time since the acquisition of Alliance Boots, we have fully comparable quarterly results. Net sales for the quarter totaled $29.5 billion, up 2.4% versus the same quarter last year.",1268,"Thank you, Stefano. I'd like to start by pointing out that for the first time since the acquisition of Alliance Boots, we have fully comparable quarterly results. Net sales for the quarter totaled $29.5 billion, up 2.4% versus the same quarter last year. These were impacted by currency translation, net sales on a constant currency basis being up 3.3%. GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, up 9.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion, and diluted EPS was $1.01. The decrease in both GAAP net earnings and net earnings per share was due to fluctuations in the fair value of our ABC warrants. 
Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, up 3.7%. On a constant currency basis, this represents an increase of 4.7%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.3 billion, up 14.7%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.18, up 15.7%. 
The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from ABC, was 24.4%, the rate benefiting from revisions to the full year tax rate forecast, including certain discrete items. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be broadly in line with the year-to-date rate of 27.2%. 
For completeness, here are the numbers for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the first 9 months of the previous year. I will not go through them in detail, but you will see that GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.88 was down 28.7%. This reflects a number of accounting factors, including the fluctuations in the warrants and last year's noncash gain relating to Alliance Boots. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 17.3% to $3.52. 
So turning now to our segmental performance, starting as usual with Retail Pharmacy USA. Total sales for the quarter in Retail Pharmacy USA were $21.2 billion, an increase of 3.7% over the same quarter last year. Sales growth was driven by an increase in pharmacy, partially offset by the sale of a controlling interest in our infusion business back in April 2015. Comparable store sales increased by 3.9%. As we expected, adjusted gross margin declined by 0.5 percentage points to 26.9%, lower pharmacy margin being partially offset by retail products. Adjusted gross profit was up 1.8% to $5.7 billion and adjusted SG&A was $4.3 billion, an increase of 1.1%. Now as you may recall, in the same quarter last year, SG&A was lower than normal. This was because we had a temporary pause in certain investments while we evaluated the returns being generated. 
We are pleased with our performance and we are well on track towards achieving our overall target savings from our cost transformation program. This program, the vast majority of which is in the U.S., will deliver $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 6.5% resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion, up 4.1%. 
So turning now to look in more detail at pharmacy. Total U.S. pharmacy sales in the quarter were up 5.8%. We filled 235 million prescriptions on a 30-day basis including immunizations, an increase of 3.9%. This reflects our strategy of increasing script volume in our stores. On a comparable basis, pharmacy sales increased by 6%, scripts filled being up by 4.5%, primarily due to continued growth in Medicare Part D volume. Our reported market share of retail prescriptions on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 19.6%. Over the year-ago quarter, this was up approximately 30 basis points. As we expected, gross margins were lower mainly due to reimbursement rates and changes in mix, partially offset by procurement efficiencies. 
Retail product sales on a comparable basis increased by 0.1%. This was primarily due to higher sales in the health and wellness and photo categories, partially offset by declines in certain convenience categories. As we've said previously, we are focused on expanding front-of-store gross margins and are pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. To further drive performance, we're starting to expand our differentiated beauty offering across over 1,800 stores and expect to complete this phase by the end of calendar 2016. 
So turning next to our Retail Pharmacy International division. Total sales in the quarter for the Retail Pharmacy International division were $3.2 billion, an increase of 3.4% on a constant currency basis. Comparable store sales increased by 0.2%, and clearly, comparable figures are in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was 8.1%, up 0.4 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $258 million, an increase of 8% in constant currency. Comparable pharmacy sales decreased by 0.7% due to Boots in the U.K. and the loss of certain institutional sales contracts in Chile. In Boots UK, comparable pharmacy sales were down 1% due to the negative impact of a reduction in government pharmacy funding that was expected. As you may know, the U.K. government has been consulting with the industry on pharmacy funding. The consultation period closed at the end of May, and we are waiting to hear their conclusions. 
Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.7% with strong performances in the Republic of Ireland and Thailand. Boots UK's comparable retail sales increased by 0.6%. We were particularly pleased with the performance of our Sleek cosmetics brand, acquired in November last year, and No7, where in April, we successfully launched our new Lift and Luminate Triple Action Serum. 
So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division were $5.7 billion. In April, we sold Alliance Healthcare Russia to 36.6 in return for a 15% stake in the combined group. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and dispositions, increased by 6.3%. This was ahead of our estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales. In a number of our emerging markets sales growth was particularly strong. Adjusted operating margin was 3%, level with the same quarter last year. 
Within the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division we report our 16% share of ABC's net earnings. As this is reported on a 2-month lag, the quarter included only 2 weeks of equity method income. Overall, the division's adjusted operating income increased 4.7% to $179 million. On a constant currency basis, the increase was 7.6%, of which 4.7% was for ABC. Next quarter, we will recognize a full 3-month share of ABC's net earnings based on their quarter to the end of June. 
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the strategic combination with Alliance Boots were $330 million. This takes the cumulative total up to the quarter end to $947 million. As Stefano said, since the quarter end, we have achieved our goal of reaching at least $1 billion of combined net synergies. Going forward, we will, therefore, not be breaking them out separately as we have said before. 
In the quarter, operating cash flow was $2.1 billion. This was due to our solid profit performance and favorable working capital cash flows. Cash capital expenditure was $247 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $1.9 billion. 
Looking to the full fiscal year results. We have raised the lower end of our guidance by $0.10. Guidance is, therefore, $4.45 to $4.55. This assumes no impact from the proposed acquisition of Rite Aid and related financing and already assumes current exchange rates for the rest of the fiscal year. Looking forward to fiscal 2017, our current plan is to issue guidance in October when we announce our full year results. 
I will now hand back to Gerald. Thank you."

So using our very large fixed assets, going to more 90 day, where we're dispensing once -- around 3 times is a very important part of that. And also the growth of specialty, which is lower margin in terms of percent but higher dollars is another feature of the marketplace. So overall, we are comfortable with where we are, and we're comfortable with the strategy we're driving to focus on operating profit rather than just gross margin."

Boots has around about 1/5 of the market in the U.K. in pharmacy. It is not untypical. We've lived with this sort of pressure and these requests for very many, many years, both in the U.K. and Europe, and we're used to dealing with it.

To be honest, Russia was a quite volatile account, where the results were depending very much on the weather. And also over time, the wholesaling business, which was really the best part of the supply chain of the chain in Russia earning-wise, has deteriorated because the pharmacies have become more important. In the past, the pharmacies were not particularly profitable because the cost of the rents was really very, very high. Now the situation is normalized. You can have long-term or medium-term rents with a way of extending the rents. And so the pharmacies are becoming the most important and the most profitable part of the chain. And so we had the opportunity to contribute our wholesale to the largest pharmacy chain because we have 1,000 pharmacies in 36.6, but 1,000 pharmacies also in another chain, A5, and the 2 chains have merged. And so we have 15% in a company where we have in reality 2,000 pharmacies, and the opportunity to buy out the company in 5 years. So we will see what happens in 5 years, and we will take the decision. It's a big opportunity for us because this is the best segment of the distribution in Russia today."

So I think there is a significant investment going in. The board signed this off only a couple of months ago fully, and we're very confident the programs are well set up. And we've got the global expertise, both here in America and Europe, applied to these 2 very important programs here in the U.S. And we'll update you on what that means in the future as it becomes clear about the benefits that we see coming through. We've already -- going back to the first question, starting with minimum wage. We've already, in the background, we've already, for most lower-paid people in stores, improved the base salary. We've done that already. That's already in the cost you see, and we'll continue to improve our minimum wage against the market, paying very close attention to the market. Second to that, we're also upscaling our people, for example, with the rollout of beauty differentiation. We're putting in place a number of beauty consultants in our top 2,000 stores, who have got deeper expertise and more knowledge and more ability to take care and drive up sales appropriately with customers. That's another investment we are making in labor costs in our stores, but with a very clear return on our investment. So we're feeling good about where we are on these 2 investments. With the overtime, we study this very carefully. We have a solution very clearly mapped out, and we'll announce that solution at the appropriate time. And it's one that will be both fair to people and cost effective to our shareholders."

I think that historically, Boots has been very solid through difficult times. It tends to overperform the market during recessions or slowdowns because it's got a very strong beauty business and people still buy into beauty even in tough times. And that's been historically the case. So we feel that that's important. And Boots is still broadly positioned, both in beauty and in health care in the U.K. The team have done a nice job there to keep it strong, and the model is still very strong. So I think if any retail business is positioned to do okay during these uncertain times that Stefano's talked about, I think it is the Boots brand in the U.K."

Typically, obviously, one is prudent in doing provisioning and then, when one is able to agree numbers with the various tax authorities, then one has the discrete items. But fundamentally, we've been doing a lot of work looking at our underlying tax rate and exactly, with the quite complex structure that we got in place, what is the real underlying rate. We've been quite conservative in the first sort of part of the year on this while we're we doing this work. And really, the numbers that we've seen in the quarter, if you look at the year-to-date, as we said in my presentation, that really gives us a true reflection of what the rate would be with this mix of profits at the currency rates that we've seen in this year-to-date. So I think it's -- I think you should really look at it as a clear rate. Clearly, if we then -- going forward, the mix changes. And clearly, it will change with Rite Aid coming in, being U.S.-based and the U.S. being, obviously, one of the highest tax countries in the mix of where we trade. Then you will see the tax rate going up, reflecting mix, but only mix."

And these numbers, we extrapolated with costs. We also looked at different models of investment from a people point of view and investment in fixturing. We created what we thought was the most customer effective, importantly, the best model for a return to our shareholders. And that's what we're implementing right now this summer in around about 1,600 more stores. And we're very confident because we've seen these customer behaviors of more in the basket and coming back more often, specifically for No7 skin care, consistently for the 18 months.

I'm pleased that we've delivered good results, which is a fitting close to what's been an outstanding financial year for the company, exceeding the upper end of our guidance when we have again experienced stronger currency headwinds and some challenging market conditions. As usual, this performance has been achieved through a combination of operational progress and corporate efficiencies. In particular, we've managed our costs well and generated a healthy cash flow. At the same time, we've announced a number of significant strategic partnerships in the U.S., which Stefano will talk about later. But first, I'll take you through our fourth quarter results. 
Let me start with the financial highlights. Sales totaled $28.6 billion, up 0.4% versus the comparable quarter last year. Our results were impacted by currency translation. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 2.5%. GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, an increase of 36.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.0 billion, and diluted EPS was $0.95. Adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 7.2% and in constant currency, was up 10.3%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.2 billion, up 20.3%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.07. That was up 21.6%. And the adverse currency translation impact was around $0.03. 
So now let me turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter, beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $20.7 billion, up 4.0% over the year-ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 3.2%. Adjusted gross profit was up 0.5% to $5.4 billion, adjusted gross margin being lower for both pharmacy and retail. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales improved by 0.9 percentage points to 20.7%. Adjusted operating margin was stable at 5.3%, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion, up 4.4%. This increase was primarily driven by increased pharmacy volume, procurement efficiencies and cost control, partially offset by lower reimbursement rates. 
We continue to make strong progress on our previously announced cost savings program, the majority of which is in the U.S. Overall, we are well on track to deliver our $1.5 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2017. We now expect total pretax charges associated with the program to be between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, which is $300 million lower than we previously estimated. 
So next, let's look in more detail at pharmacy. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 6.2%, driven by increased script volume and improved specialty sales. We filled 229.95 -- sorry, 229.5 million prescriptions, and that's on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, an increase of 3.7%. On a comparable basis for stores, which excludes central specialty, pharmacy sales increased by 5.0%, with scripts filled up 3.9%, mainly due to continued growth in Medicare Part D volume. Our reported market share of retail prescriptions on a usual 30-day adjusted basis was 19.3%, up approximately 40 basis points over the year-ago quarter. 
As you may know, IMS restated its market share numbers for the comparable period due to an enhancement to the IMS panel. In the appendix, we set out fully comparable historic market share statistics for the division. 
As in the last quarter and as we expected, gross margins were lower, mainly due to reimbursement rates and changes in mix, which were partially offset by procurement efficiencies. Retail sales on a comparable basis were down 0.3% on the same quarter last year. Sales were impacted most significantly by declines in certain consumable categories and seasonal items such as back-to-school and commodity electronics, where we took action to proactively clear out old and legacy stock as we move to the next phase of our retail transformation program. We're also seeing the impact of direct management action in tobacco, where we've continued to reduce space [ph] and visibility as we focus on helping customers who want to stop smoking. 
Importantly, the health and wellness and beauty categories performed well. While gross margins in the quarter were slightly down, we don't see this as a permanent weakness as the recent declines have been mainly due to actions we have taken to put in place foundations for long-term growth. 
I'm delighted to report that the first phase of our new beauty offering reached more than 1,600 stores across the U.S. by the end of the fiscal year. This has 3 core elements: products, store environment and customer experience. First, the product. In this phase, we're highlighting 2 of our best-known brands, No7 and Soap & Glory, alongside existing national brands already well known to Walgreens customers. 
The second element is the store environment. Our stores' beauty areas are being transformed to provide a welcoming and colorful environment with improved signage and lighting and a product range chosen to suit all types of customers regardless of age or background. 
The third element of the new Walgreens beauty offer is the customer experience. This involved training and deploying specialist beauty consultants to offer high-quality advice to our customers. The program has drawn on our experience internationally, most directly from Boots in the U.K., but has been tailored specifically for the U.S. market based on customer engagement and research. This is the first phase of a multiphase, multiyear strategy to differentiate Walgreens' beauty offering. 
So now let's look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division. Sales for the division were $3.0 billion, up 1.4% in constant currency. On a same basis, comparable store sales declined by 0.6%, mainly due to Chile and the U.K., which I'll cover in a moment. Adjusted operating margin for the division was 8.1%, up 1.0 percentage points. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $247 million, an increase of 15.7% in constant currency. To improve comparability, you will see that we've made certain classification changes to prior period sales, cost of sales and SG&A. These changes have had no impact on operating income. To help with modeling, in the appendix, we've provided revised numbers by quarter for fiscal 2015 and '16. 
Comparable pharmacy sales were flat on a constant currency basis as the loss of institutional contracts in Chile offset growth in other markets. In Boots U.K., comparable pharmacy sales were up 0.6%. And while we continue to experience reimbursement pressure, pharmacy services continued to perform well. Comparable retail sales for the division decreased 1.0% due to a weaker Boots performance in the U.K., where comparable retail sales were down 0.8%, impacted by a particularly volatile and poor June. 
So now let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5.4 billion, down 1.5% on a constant currency basis due to the disposal of Alliance Healthcare Russia in April. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes acquisitions and dispositions, increased by 2.9%. This was marginally behind our estimated market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales due to competitive market conditions in Continental Europe. Adjusted operating margin for the division, which we define to exclude AmerisourceBergen income, was 2.9%. This was up 0.3 percentage points on a constant currency basis versus the comparable quarter last year. Adjusted operating income for the division was $208 million, up 39.2% in constant currency.
[Audio Gap] [ph] 
We report our share of ABC's net earnings on a 2-month lag. As a result, this was our first full quarter of recognizing approximately 16% of ABC's net earnings. In modeling ABC, remember that equity income related to our increased ownership from the August warrant exercise will be reflected in only 5 weeks of the first quarter due to the 2-month reporting lag. 
So now let me turn to the full year numbers for fiscal 2016. As I said at the beginning, this has been an outstanding financial year, exceeding the upper end of our guidance. These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the previous year due to the Alliance Boots transaction. 
In summary, GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.82 was down 4.5%. This reflects a number of factors, including the fluctuations in the ABC warrants and last year's noncash gain relating to Alliance Boots. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 18.3% to $4.59. Adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from ABC, this was 25.4%. This was lower than we had anticipated when we spoke to you last quarter. 
Ignoring discrete tax items, our underlying adjusted effective tax rate would have been 26.3%. Discrete items of approximately 0.9 percentage points primarily included completion of certain U.S. tax audits and true ups of prior year accruals. The tax rate also reflects changes in the geographical mix of our pretax earnings and the U.S. taxation of our non-U.S. entities. 
Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter and $7.8 billion in the full fiscal year. Over the course of the year, working capital reduced by $1.4 billion due to improved payables. Cash capital expenditure was $421 million in the quarter and $1.3 billion in the full fiscal year. During the year, we invested in key areas to develop our customer proposition, including investment in stores and the U.S. beauty program as well as upgrades to our IT systems, which we began earlier in the year. Store investment included over 100 new openings in Mexico, which continues to be a focus area for expansion. Overall, this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.2 billion and $6.5 billion in the full fiscal year, a year-on-year increase of $2.1 billion. 
So turning now to our pending acquisition of Rite Aid. As announced on September 8, we remain actively engaged with the FTC on its review. And today, we still expect that the most likely outcome will be that the parties will be required to divest between 500 and 1,000 stores. We believe that we will be able to execute agreements to divest these stores to potential buyers pending FTC approval by the end of calendar year 2016. I now expect to close the acquisition in early calendar 2017. 
Taking into account our current expectations of store divestitures, we continue to expect that the acquisition will be accretive to adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the first full year after closing. We also continue to expect that we will realize synergies from the acquisition in excess of $1 billion to be fully realized within 3 to 4 years of closing. These synergies have been updated where practicable and as previously disclosed, are expected to come primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters. 
So turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017. We're expecting adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.20. This assumes Rite Aid accretion of $0.05 to $0.12 based on the assumptions that I just mentioned and on the continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback program relating to equity incentives. And in addition, this guidance is based on currency exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year. Please remember, sterling today is around 15% lower versus the dollar than our weighted average operating income translation rate for fiscal '16. This had an adverse impact on our guidance of around $0.13. 
In terms of phasing, the timing and development of our recently announced new strategic pharmacy partnerships in the U.S. means that we expect Retail Pharmacy USA script draw to be stronger than usual in the second half of the fiscal year. The new rates come into effect on day 1 of the contracts mainly around the end of the calendar year, while we believe that the enhanced volumes will take some time to build. Overall, we therefore expect Retail Pharmacy USA gross margins to continue to decline in the coming quarters but expect to see sales and profits for the year as a whole to continue to grow as the expected volumes come through from our pharmacy contracts in the second half of the fiscal year. 
So I'll now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments."

As you have heard, this was a good quarter despite both currency and operational challenges. It is our fourth quarter in what I believe has been an extremely good year as a whole for the company. That said, the work that we have been do",816,"Thank you, George. As you have heard, this was a good quarter despite both currency and operational challenges. It is our fourth quarter in what I believe has been an extremely good year as a whole for the company. That said, the work that we have been doing to control cost, reduce waste and return our business to a partial growth has been showing marked effects for some time. For the past 8 quarters in a row, we have grown our adjusted net earnings over the comparable prior periods. 
In fiscal 2014, if you make adjusted basic adjustment trailing [ph] the 55% of Alliance Boots not reflected in the historical published results, we would have generated an estimated $3.9 billion of adjusted net earnings. As we reported $5 billion of adjusted net earnings in fiscal 2016, this could represent an increase of approximately 28% over the last 2 fiscal years on a reported currency basis. This is a compound annual growth rate of around 13%. It is -- it also presents an annual increase of over 15% on a constant currency basis. In addition, we have delivered $10.9 billion of free cash flow over the same period. While I believe that this is impressive by any measure, it is not solely due to the merger that created Walgreens Boots Alliance. We have continued to see progressive operations growth across the company, which has been a significant driver of our strong financial performance. This success has been achieved despite it having been a very busy time. 
Let's take a moment to remind ourselves of everything we have achieved in the past year. In the U.S., we launched significant initiatives to advance our retail and pharmacy offering. These included investing in the customer experience, especially in beauty, to differentiate Walgreens as a retailer. We also reset our relationship with health care payers and PBM and worked to develop close partnership as a platform for our future. Examples of this strategic partnership include our new 90-day prescription agreement with OptumRx and Envision, our announced agreement with Express Scripts and our innovative partnership with Prime Therapeutics. These close partnerships are central to our strategy of increasing volumes to our pharmacies and driving footfall to our store. We strengthened our relationship with AmerisourceBergen, exercising both franchise warrants, understanding our pharmacy sales distribution and [indiscernible] agreements. This move further cements the strong and collaborative working relationship our [ph] companies have been together over the past 3 years. Our pending acquisition of Rite Aid continues to progress, as George has said. 
Globally, we continue to expand our reach [ph] and presence. In Russia, we divested our sales business and as part of the deal, retained the strategic stake in the country's leading health and beauty retailer. And in South Korea, we signed an agreement to form a franchise relationship with one of the country's leading retailers. 
At the company level, we reached and surpassed our $1 billion synergies goal for -- from the WBA merger and further progressed the cost saving goal of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2017. At the same time, we changed the roles and responsibilities of our senior management team to structure our leadership more efficiently and move to operating a truly unified company. 
Looking forward to 2017, we expect to face the same headwinds we encountered in this year but with some additional factors that are going to slightly change the profile for the year.  We are entering a period where we need to consolidate much of the recent activities in the company. We must ensure we are properly positioned to get the full benefit of our work to date. As expected, the volume increases from our new commercial agreement begin to flow to our U.S. pharmacies and global procurement network. Additional benefits will come as our retail transformation work accelerate and compound the [ph] expected increase in traffic that flows through our stores with this agreement. We therefore expect a different phasing for the year-end. We anticipate growth skewed significantly towards the second half of the year. But as you have heard from George, we are expecting the year as a whole to continue our record of healthy growth. We believe this phasing is a temporary phenomenon, and we see our work to transform the company have an increased impact. Operation [ph] and integration, if done properly, is never instant or easy, but we are progressing well. While we are delivering on the promises of the merger, we are also building strong foundation based on establishing an outstanding team and structuring our company for growth in the core business, especially Walgreens. We are doing this without losing sight of the global opportunity and are preparing the company to play an even greater goal as health care evolves in the U.S. and around the world.

And remember, many of these new contracts are maybe narrow, but some are actually pretty broad.

So that will start to build up. And then we built solid plans on what we know about the market and what our great partners, who helped us to build this business, have told us about their networks. And some of the selling season is happening right now. You'll see some more of this be announced, particularly through Prime in the days and the weeks ahead. On the front-end strategy, this is a multiyear, multiphase approach. We have [ph] 1,600 new beauty departments in the ground. Not complete, but new in terms of the brands that George mentioned, particularly No7 and Soap & Glory, in this phase with [indiscernible] and importantly, upgraded our training and development of our consultants to give the customers information they need. And this is in the ground based on the challenges there before. The majority of this work will phase in over a 2- or 3-year period in reality, but you should expect the ongoing improvement to the margin -- gross margin throughout '17 and the years ahead. Remember that we focus our business on the whole box. We focus our business on operating margin, including costs and of course, in adjusted net earnings. All of this work is designed to drive all elements of profitability within the box of Walgreens. And we are very confident with what we're doing, and the pace is accelerating."

But for sure, if we could talk, and of course you know that we cannot, our news would be different. For what we see today, we see just a long administrative process, but we don't see substantial differences from the work that we were expecting. Yes, probably more stores, a little more stores here and there. But at the end of the day, as far as I can see today, as far as we can see today, we are absolutely confident that we can create, that we can do the deal and we can create the value. Just this value will be a little postponed on time because if and when we will do the deal, of course, for the first months, we will not be able to start immediately the synergies. It will take some time, and we were hoping to do the deal at the beginning of this fiscal year. For us, in this case, we would have had time to develop some of the synergies. Of course, if we close the deal relatively late in our fiscal year, the synergies will be small, but we will find all of them next year."

In terms of thinking, as we've tried to sort of shape, you should think, as we develop the new partnerships, that we are able to build our pharmacy. Our pharmacy volume, and as we said, we expect that -- the growth to be faster in the second half of the year, and you can think then [indiscernible] taking that beyond and the new -- as we said, a lot of the new partnerships coming around the end of the calendar beginning of the next calendar. There's obviously then the function of your views on inflation and then on mix and, of course, with very different profile in somewhere like central specialty versus our core pharmacy, there's an element of mix comes through there, and that will, obviously, change over time and then -- but we will continue to see the reimbursement pressures just very much aware of life. In terms of retail, a lot of our focus has been on developing the offer. As Alex has said, both in terms of the actual offer in-store our own brands, the leading U.S. brands, the work we're doing on omnichannel. And so a lot of our focus has been on working our way through getting ready for that. You should start to see the benefits of that coming through. Over time, [indiscernible] has been on the offer over time, then we believe we will be able to grow but we're looking to grow in the right categories which is very important. So mix is very important and we know mix is an important way of managing the margin some, the gross margin and the retail product as part of the U.S. business, and so we'd expect to see the benefits of that coming through over time. And then on cost, as we drive efficiency, then we're certainly very focused on continuing to improve our cost ratios, our SG&A as a percentage of sales is a key area of focus. And again, we would be seeking to see that progressing. So these really are the core drivers of what should drive the profit. I'm particularly talking obviously Retail Pharmacy USA here."

But fundamentally, that's what we're focused on, is driving profit and then from core activities and then, obviously, doing shareholder-enhancing transactions periodically like the Rite Aid deal. And also at the same time, we're very focused, and I know it's a little old-fashioned, but we're really focus on cash flow because cash flow is an engine for growth. In the long term, you see we've made good progress on working capital this year, and this really lets us invest overtime in M&A and it enables us to continue to drive shareholder value."

In terms of tax, we've obviously not given specific guidance for fiscal '17 on tax. But in terms of thinking about it, if you strip out the discrete items, as I talked about last year, then our real underlying tax prerated last year was -- our underlying tax rate last year was 26.3% on an adjusted basis. That's up obviously excluding the ABC income because, of course, that gets reported on a post-tax basis. So it's quite -- in terms of modeling, we always model and think about it, the way I've just described excluding ABC. If you think of that 26.3%, then excluding Rite Aid, that's a fairly good proxy for what it should be going forward because prerated, the mix will be broadly the same. In terms of Rite Aid, you're absolutely right. With Rite Aid, as the proportion of profit increases from the Rite Aid deal, once we're able to complete it, then you will see a higher proportion of profit here in the USA. And of course here, the tax rates are higher than in most parts of Europe where the rest of the business operates. But of course, this year, given the accretion that we've indicated, that will be a relatively modest impact."

I'm pleased that we've delivered good results, which is a fitting close to what's been an outstanding financial year for the company, exceeding the upper end of our guidance when we have again experienced stronger currency headwinds and some challenging market conditions. As usual, this performance has been achieved through a combination of operational progress and corporate efficiencies. In particular, we've managed our costs well and generated a healthy cash flow. At the same time, we've announced a number of significant strategic partnerships in the U.S., which Stefano will talk about later. But first, I'll take you through our fourth quarter results. 
Let me start with the financial highlights. Sales totaled $28.6 billion, up 0.4% versus the comparable quarter last year. Our results were impacted by currency translation. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 2.5%. GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, an increase of 36.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.0 billion, and diluted EPS was $0.95. Adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 7.2% and in constant currency, was up 10.3%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.2 billion, up 20.3%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.07. That was up 21.6%. And the adverse currency translation impact was around $0.03. 
So now let me turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter, beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $20.7 billion, up 4.0% over the year-ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 3.2%. Adjusted gross profit was up 0.5% to $5.4 billion, adjusted gross margin being lower for both pharmacy and retail. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales improved by 0.9 percentage points to 20.7%. Adjusted operating margin was stable at 5.3%, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion, up 4.4%. This increase was primarily driven by increased pharmacy volume, procurement efficiencies and cost control, partially offset by lower reimbursement rates. 
We continue to make strong progress on our previously announced cost savings program, the majority of which is in the U.S. Overall, we are well on track to deliver our $1.5 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2017. We now expect total pretax charges associated with the program to be between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, which is $300 million lower than we previously estimated. 
So next, let's look in more detail at pharmacy. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 6.2%, driven by increased script volume and improved specialty sales. We filled 229.95 -- sorry, 229.5 million prescriptions, and that's on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, an increase of 3.7%. On a comparable basis for stores, which excludes central specialty, pharmacy sales increased by 5.0%, with scripts filled up 3.9%, mainly due to continued growth in Medicare Part D volume. Our reported market share of retail prescriptions on a usual 30-day adjusted basis was 19.3%, up approximately 40 basis points over the year-ago quarter. 
As you may know, IMS restated its market share numbers for the comparable period due to an enhancement to the IMS panel. In the appendix, we set out fully comparable historic market share statistics for the division. 
As in the last quarter and as we expected, gross margins were lower, mainly due to reimbursement rates and changes in mix, which were partially offset by procurement efficiencies. Retail sales on a comparable basis were down 0.3% on the same quarter last year. Sales were impacted most significantly by declines in certain consumable categories and seasonal items such as back-to-school and commodity electronics, where we took action to proactively clear out old and legacy stock as we move to the next phase of our retail transformation program. We're also seeing the impact of direct management action in tobacco, where we've continued to reduce space and visibility as we focus on helping customers who want to stop smoking. 
Importantly, the health and wellness and beauty categories performed well. While gross margins in the quarter were slightly down, we don't see this as a permanent weakness as the recent declines have been mainly due to actions we have taken to put in place foundations for long-term growth. 
I'm delighted to report that the first phase of our new beauty offering reached more than 1,600 stores across the U.S. by the end of the fiscal year. This has 3 core elements: products, store environment and customer experience. First, the product. In this phase, we're highlighting 2 of our best-known brands, No7 and Soap & Glory, alongside existing national brands already well known to Walgreens customers. 
The second element is the store environment. Our stores' beauty areas are being transformed to provide a welcoming and colorful environment with improved signage and lighting and a product range chosen to suit all types of customers regardless of age or background. 
The third element of the new Walgreens beauty offer is the customer experience. This involved training and deploying specialist beauty consultants to offer high-quality advice to our customers. The program has drawn on our experience internationally, most directly from Boots in the U.K., but has been tailored specifically for the U.S. market based on customer engagement and research. This is the first phase of a multiphase, multiyear strategy to differentiate Walgreens' beauty offering. 
So now let's look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division. Sales for the division were $3.0 billion, up 1.4% in constant currency. On a same basis, comparable store sales declined by 0.6%, mainly due to Chile and the U.K., which I'll cover in a moment. Adjusted operating margin for the division was 8.1%, up 1.0 percentage points. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $247 million, an increase of 15.7% in constant currency. To improve comparability, you will see that we've made certain classification changes to prior period sales, cost of sales and SG&A. These changes have had no impact on operating income. To help with modeling, in the appendix, we've provided revised numbers by quarter for fiscal 2015 and '16. 
Comparable pharmacy sales were flat on a constant currency basis as the loss of institutional contracts in Chile offset growth in other markets. In Boots U.K., comparable pharmacy sales were up 0.6%. And while we continue to experience reimbursement pressure, pharmacy services continued to perform well. Comparable retail sales for the division decreased 1.0% due to a weaker Boots performance in the U.K., where comparable retail sales were down 0.8%, impacted by a particularly volatile and poor June. 
So now let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5.4 billion, down 1.5% on a constant currency basis due to the disposal of Alliance Healthcare Russia in April. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes acquisitions and dispositions, increased by 2.9%. This was marginally behind our estimated market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales due to competitive market conditions in Continental Europe. Adjusted operating margin for the division, which we define to exclude AmerisourceBergen income, was 2.9%. This was up 0.3 percentage points on a constant currency basis versus the comparable quarter last year. Adjusted operating income for the division was $208 million, up 39.2% in constant currency.
We report our share of ABC's net earnings on a 2-month lag. As a result, this was our first full quarter of recognizing approximately 16% of ABC's net earnings. In modeling ABC, remember that equity income related to our increased ownership from the August warrant exercise will be reflected in only 5 weeks of the first quarter due to the 2-month reporting lag. 
So now let me turn to the full year numbers for fiscal 2016. As I said at the beginning, this has been an outstanding financial year, exceeding the upper end of our guidance. These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the previous year due to the Alliance Boots transaction. 
In summary, GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.82 was down 4.5%. This reflects a number of factors, including the fluctuations in the ABC warrants and last year's noncash gain relating to Alliance Boots. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 18.3% to $4.59. Adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from ABC, this was 25.4%. This was lower than we had anticipated when we spoke to you last quarter. 
Ignoring discrete tax items, our underlying adjusted effective tax rate would have been 26.3%. Discrete items of approximately 0.9 percentage points primarily included completion of certain U.S. tax audits and true ups of prior year accruals. The tax rate also reflects changes in the geographical mix of our pretax earnings and the U.S. taxation of our non-U.S. entities. 
Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter and $7.8 billion in the full fiscal year. Over the course of the year, working capital reduced by $1.4 billion due to improved payables. Cash capital expenditure was $421 million in the quarter and $1.3 billion in the full fiscal year. During the year, we invested in key areas to develop our customer proposition, including investment in stores and the U.S. beauty program as well as upgrades to our IT systems, which we began earlier in the year. Store investment included over 100 new openings in Mexico, which continues to be a focus area for expansion. Overall, this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.2 billion and $6.5 billion in the full fiscal year, a year-on-year increase of $2.1 billion. 
So turning now to our pending acquisition of Rite Aid. As announced on September 8, we remain actively engaged with the FTC on its review. And today, we still expect that the most likely outcome will be that the parties will be required to divest between 500 and 1,000 stores. We believe that we will be able to execute agreements to divest these stores to potential buyers pending FTC approval by the end of calendar year 2016. I now expect to close the acquisition in early calendar 2017. 
Taking into account our current expectations of store divestitures, we continue to expect that the acquisition will be accretive to adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the first full year after closing. We also continue to expect that we will realize synergies from the acquisition in excess of $1 billion to be fully realized within 3 to 4 years of closing. These synergies have been updated where practicable and as previously disclosed, are expected to come primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters. 
So turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017. We're expecting adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.20. This assumes Rite Aid accretion of $0.05 to $0.12 based on the assumptions that I just mentioned and on the continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback program relating to equity incentives. And in addition, this guidance is based on currency exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year. Please remember, sterling today is around 15% lower versus the dollar than our weighted average operating income translation rate for fiscal '16. This had an adverse impact on our guidance of around $0.13. 
In terms of phasing, the timing and development of our recently announced new strategic pharmacy partnerships in the U.S. means that we expect Retail Pharmacy USA script draw to be stronger than usual in the second half of the fiscal year. The new rates come into effect on day 1 of the contracts mainly around the end of the calendar year, while we believe that the enhanced volumes will take some time to build. Overall, we therefore expect Retail Pharmacy USA gross margins to continue to decline in the coming quarters but expect to see sales and profits for the year as a whole to continue to grow as the expected volumes come through from our pharmacy contracts in the second half of the fiscal year. 
So I'll now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments."

It is our fourth quarter in what I believe has been an extremely good year as a whole for the company. That said, the work that we have been doing to control cost, reduce waste and return our business to a partial growth has been showing marked effects for some time. For the past 8 quarters in a row, we have grown our adjusted net earnings over the comparable prior periods. 
In fiscal 2014, if you make adjusted basic adjustment trailing the 55% of Alliance Boots not reflected in the historical published results, we would have generated an estimated $3.9 billion of adjusted net earnings. As we reported $5 billion of adjusted net earnings in fiscal 2016, this could represent an increase of approximately 28% over the last 2 fiscal years on a reported currency basis. This is a compound annual growth rate of around 13%. It is -- it also presents an annual increase of over 15% on a constant currency basis. In addition, we have delivered $10.9 billion of free cash flow over the same period. While I believe that this is impressive by any measure, it is not solely due to the merger that created Walgreens Boots Alliance. We have continued to see progressive operations growth across the company, which has been a significant driver of our strong financial performance. This success has been achieved despite it having been a very busy time. 
Let's take a moment to remind ourselves of everything we have achieved in the past year. In the U.S., we launched significant initiatives to advance our retail and pharmacy offering. These included investing in the customer experience, especially in beauty, to differentiate Walgreens as a retailer. We also reset our relationship with health care payers and PBM and worked to develop close partnership as a platform for our future. Examples of this strategic partnership include our new 90-day prescription agreement with OptumRx and Envision, our announced agreement with Express Scripts and our innovative partnership with Prime Therapeutics. These close partnerships are central to our strategy of increasing volumes to our pharmacies and driving footfall to our store. We strengthened our relationship with AmerisourceBergen, exercising both franchise warrants, understanding our pharmacy sales distribution and sourcing agreements. This move further cements the strong and collaborative working relationship our companies have been together over the past 3 years. Our pending acquisition of Rite Aid continues to progress, as George has said. 
Globally, we continue to expand our region presence. In Russia, we divested our sales business and as part of the deal, retained the strategic stake in the country's leading health and beauty retailer. And in South Korea, we signed an agreement to form a franchise relationship with one of the country's leading retailers. 
At the company level, we reached and surpassed our $1 billion synergies goal for -- from the WBA merger and further progressed the cost saving goal of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2017. At the same time, we changed the roles and responsibilities of our senior management team to structure our leadership more efficiently and move to operating a truly unified company. 
Looking forward to 2017, we expect to face the same headwinds we encountered in this year but with some additional factors that are going to slightly change the profile for the year. We are entering a period where we need to consolidate much of the recent activities in the company. We must ensure we are properly positioned to get the full benefit of our work to date. As expected, the volume increases from our new commercial agreement begin to flow to our U.S. pharmacies and global procurement network. Additional benefits will come as our retail transformation work accelerate and compounds the expected increase in traffic that flows through our stores with this agreement. We therefore expect a different phasing for the year-end. We anticipate growth skewed significantly towards the second half of the year. But as you have heard from George, we are expecting the year as a whole to continue our record of healthy growth. We believe this phasing is a temporary phenomenon, and we see our work to transform the company have an increased impact. Confirmation and integration, if done properly, is never instant or easy, but we are progressing well. While we are delivering on the promises of the merger, we are also building strong foundation based on establishing an outstanding team and structuring our company for growth in the core business, especially Walgreens. We are doing this without losing sight of the global opportunity and are preparing the company to play an even greater goal as health care evolves in the U.S. and around the world. 
Thank you. Now I will hand you back to Gerald"

And obviously, as the year progresses, we'll be able to get a better feel on our ability to both get customers back into Walgreens and hold onto them. And remember, many of these new contracts are maybe narrow, but some are actually pretty broad. The TRICARE contract, for example, still has the vast majority of pharmacies in the U.S. in that contract. So we've been what we think is a good estimate from what we know into the forecast.

And again, as I said, I think the previous question to Bob, most of these contracts starts in January 1, but we'll see the majority of the volume, as George has said, in the second half of our fiscal year, which I think starts in March of next year. So that will start to build up. And then we built solid plans on what we know about the market and what our great partners, who helped us to build this business, have told us about their networks. And some of the selling season is happening right now. You'll see some more of this be announced, particularly through Prime in the days and the weeks ahead. On the front-end strategy, this is a multiyear, multiphase approach. We have plus 1,600 new beauty departments in the ground. Not complete, but new in terms of the brands that George mentioned, particularly No7 and Soap & Glory, this phase with [indiscernible] and importantly, upgraded our training and development of our consultants to give the customers information they need. And this is in the ground based on the challenges there before. The majority of this work will phase in over a 2- or 3-year period in reality, but you should expect the ongoing improvement to the margin -- gross margin throughout '17 and the years ahead. Remember that we focus our business on the whole box. We focus our business on operating margin, including costs and of course, in adjusted net earnings. All of this work is designed to drive all elements of profitability within the box of Walgreens. And we are very confident with what we're doing, and the pace is accelerating."

This is a strategy, a strategy which has always worked for us in the past, in other countries and I believe will work also in the U.S. Of course, as George said, every time that we do something new, every time that we propose, let's say, an agreement or taking into consideration an agreement which is proposed by one of our customers, we are running the numbers in a very disciplined way considering, of course, everything, considering the volume, considering the discounts, considering the -- what we can extract more from our suppliers, if anything, considering the increased efficiencies of the pharmacies. And then at the end, we decide whether we can do this particular kind of deal or not. And of course, we are very conscious that when we come with an innovative deal or with a partnership on the market, we have to be prepared to offer similar things to other people.

One, we've just seen in the last period, which is a combination of access through Med D as our channel grows, a growing channel, but really through delivering for customers. Customer experience scores in our pharmacies have moved, and a big credit to Richard Ashworth and all of the teams involved and Brad because that really has been a big shift in how we've been able to take care of customers in our pharmacy. That really has been a driver of the recent share you've seen in the past, and we'll be completely focused on continuing to do that. And secondly, as Stefano saw and what I'll put, we want to make sure that the people who are paying for these prescriptions, both customers and peers, we need to just make sure we are getting the right understanding of what they want from the networks that we're in. And that's what we're trying to do in different ways. And we have all sorts of different ways, as we demonstrated, of getting that done. So we do it really customer by customer and payer by payer and also network by network to make sure that we can grow our business. We're early in this strategy, Ricky, to be honest. We're early in this strategy, and we're still learning how to really drive this, make it work. And we remain confident that we'll lean a lot this year with the ambitions we have and the lives that have access back into Walgreens that didn't have access before. And again, we'll continue to reevaluate internally our goals going forward."

There's an element of mix comes through there, and that will obviously change over time. And then on the -- but we will continue to see the reimbursement pressures but are just very much aware of life.

And so we'd expect to see the benefits of that coming through over time. And then on cost, as we say, as we drive efficiency, then we're certainly very focused on continuing to improve our cost ratios. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales is a key area of focus. And again, we would be seeking to see that progressing. So these really are the core drivers of what should drive the profit. I'm particularly talking, obviously, Retail Pharmacy USA here."

But fundamentally, that's what we're focused on, is driving profit and then -- from core activities and then, obviously, doing shareholder-enhancing transactions periodically like the Rite Aid deal. And also at the same time, we're very focused, and I know it's a little old-fashioned, but we're very focused on cash flow because cash flow is an engine for growth. In the long term, you see we've made good progress on working capital this year, and this really lets us invest over time in M&A, and it enables us to continue to drive shareholder value."

In terms of tax, we've obviously not given specific guidance for fiscal '17 on tax. But in terms of thinking about it, if you strip out the discrete items, as I talked about last year, then our real underlying tax pre-Rite Aid last year was -- our underlying tax last year was 26.3% on an adjusted basis. That's up obviously excluding the ABC income because, of course, that gets reported on a post-tax basis. So it's quite -- in terms of modeling, we always model and think about it the way I've just described, excluding ABC. If you think of that 26.3% then, excluding Rite Aid, that's a fairly good proxy for what it should be going forward. Because pre-Rite Aid, the mix will be broadly the same. In terms of Rite Aid, you're absolutely right. With Rite Aid, as the proportion of profit increases from the Rite Aid deal, once we're able to complete it, then we will see a higher proportion of profit here in the U.S.A. And of course here, the tax rates are higher than in most parts of Europe, where the rest of the business operates. But of course, this year, given the accretion that we've indicated, that will be a relatively modest impact."

I'm pleased that we've delivered good results, which is a fitting close to what's been an outstanding financial year for the company, exceeding the upper end of our guidance when we have again experienced strong currency headwinds and some challenging market conditions. As usual, this performance has been achieved through a combination of operational progress and corporate efficiencies. In particular, we've managed our costs well and generated a healthy cash flow. At the same time, we've announced a number of significant strategic partnerships in the U.S., which Stefano will talk about later. But first, I'll take you through our fourth quarter results. 
Let me start with the financial highlights. Sales totaled $28.6 billion, up 0.4% versus the comparable quarter last year. Our results were impacted by currency translation. And on a constant currency basis, sales were up 2.5%. GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, an increase of 36.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.0 billion, and diluted EPS was $0.95. Adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 7.2% and in constant currency, was up 10.3%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.2 billion, up 20.3%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.07. That was up 21.6%. And the adverse currency translation impact was around $0.03. 
So now let me turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter, beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $20.7 billion, up 4.0% over the year-ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 3.2%. Adjusted gross profit was up 0.5% to $5.4 billion, adjusted gross margins being lower for both pharmacy and retail. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales improved by 0.9 percentage points to 20.7%. Adjusted operating margin was stable at 5.3%, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion, up 4.4%. This increase was primarily driven by increased pharmacy volume, procurement efficiencies and cost control, partially offset by lower reimbursement rates. 
We continue to make strong progress on our previously announced cost savings program, the majority of which is in the U.S. Overall, we are well on track to deliver our $1.5 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2017. We now expect total pretax charges associated with the program to be between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, which is $300 million lower than we previously estimated. 
So next, let's look in more detail at pharmacy. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 6.2%, driven by increased script volume and improved specialty sales. We filled 229.95 -- sorry, 229.5 million prescriptions, and that's on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, an increase of 3.7%. On a comparable basis for stores, which excludes central specialty, pharmacy sales increased by 5.0%, with scripts filled up 3.9%, mainly due to continued growth in Medicare Part D volume. Our reported market share of retail prescriptions on a usual 30-day adjusted basis was 19.3%, up approximately 40 basis points over the year-ago quarter. 
As you may know, IMS restated its market share numbers for the comparable period due to an enhancement to the IMS panel. In the appendix, we set out fully comparable historic market share statistics for the division. 
As in the last quarter, and as we expected, gross margins were lower, mainly due to reimbursement rates and changes in mix, which were partially offset by procurement efficiencies. Retail sales on a comparable basis were down 0.3% on the same quarter last year. Sales were impacted most significantly by declines in certain consumable categories and seasonal items such as back-to-school and commodity electronics, where we took action to proactively clear out old and legacy stock as we move to the next phase of our retail transformation program. We're also seeing the impact of direct management action in tobacco, where we've continued to reduce space and visibility as we focus on helping customers who want to stop smoking. 
Importantly, the health and wellness and beauty categories performed well. While gross margins in the quarter were slightly down, we don't see this as a permanent weakness as the recent declines have been mainly due to actions we have taken to put in place foundations for long-term growth. 
I'm delighted to report that the first phase of our new beauty offering reached more than 1,600 stores across the U.S. by the end of the fiscal year. This has 3 core elements: products, store environment and customer experience. First, the products. In this phase, we are highlighting 2 of our best-known brands, No7 and Soap & Glory, alongside existing national brands already well known to Walgreens customers. 
The second element is the store environment. Our stores' beauty areas are being transformed to provide a welcoming and colorful environment, with improved signage and lighting and a product range chosen to suit all types of customers regardless of age or background. 
The third element of the new Walgreens beauty offer is the customer experience. This involved training and deploying specialist beauty consultants to offer high-quality advice to our customers. The program has drawn on our experience internationally, most directly from Boots in the U.K., but has been tailored specifically for the U.S. market based on customer engagement and research. This is the first phase of a multiphase, multiyear strategy to differentiate Walgreens' beauty offering. 
So now let's look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division. Sales for the division were $3.0 billion, up 1.4% in constant currency. On a same basis, comparable store sales declined by 0.6%, mainly due to Chile and the U.K., which I'll cover in a moment. Adjusted operating margin for the division was 8.1%, up 1.0 percentage points. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $247 million, an increase of 15.7% in constant currency. To improve comparability, you will see that we've made certain classification changes to prior period sales, cost of sales and SG&A. These changes have had no impact on operating income. To help with modeling, in the appendix, we've provided revised numbers by quarter for fiscal 2015 and '16. 
Comparable pharmacy sales were flat on a constant currency basis as the loss of institutional contracts in Chile offset growth in other markets. In Boots U.K., comparable pharmacy sales were up 0.6%. And while we continue to experience reimbursement pressure, pharmacy services continued to perform well. Comparable retail sales for the division decreased 1.0% due to a weaker Boots performance in the U.K., where comparable retail sales were down 0.8%, impacted by a particularly volatile and poor June. 
So now let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5.4 billion, down 1.5% on a constant currency basis due to the disposal of Alliance Healthcare Russia in April. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes acquisitions and dispositions, increased by 2.9%. This was marginally behind our estimated market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales due to competitive market conditions in Continental Europe. Adjusted operating margin for the division, which we define to exclude AmerisourceBergen income, was 2.9%. This was up 0.3 percentage points on a constant currency basis versus the comparable quarter last year. Adjusted operating income for the division was $208 million, up 39.2% in constant currency.
We report our share of ABC's net earnings on a 2-month lag. As a result, this was our first full quarter of recognizing approximately 16% of ABC's net earnings. For modeling ABC, remember that equity income related to our increased ownership from the August warrant exercise will be reflected in only 5 weeks of the first quarter due to the 2-month reporting lag. 
So now let me turn to the full year numbers for fiscal 2016. As I said at the beginning, this has been an outstanding financial year, exceeding the upper end of our guidance. These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the previous year due to the Alliance Boots transaction. 
In summary, GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.82 was down 4.5%. This reflects a number of factors, including the fluctuations in the ABC warrants and last year's noncash gain relating to Alliance Boots. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 18.3% to $4.59. Adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from ABC, this was 25.4%. This was lower than we had anticipated when we spoke to you last quarter. 
Ignoring discrete tax items, our underlying adjusted effective tax rate would have been 26.3%. Discrete items of approximately 0.9 percentage points primarily included completion of certain U.S. tax audits and true ups of prior year accruals. The tax rate also reflects changes in the geographical mix of our pretax earnings and the U.S. taxation of our non-U.S. entities. 
Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter and $7.8 billion in the full fiscal year. Over the course of the year, working capital reduced by $1.4 billion due to improved payables. Cash capital expenditure was $421 million in the quarter and $1.3 billion in the full fiscal year. During the year, we invested in key areas to develop our customer proposition, including investment in stores and the U.S. beauty program as well as upgrades to our IT systems, which we began earlier in the year. Store investment included over 100 new openings in Mexico, which continues to be a focus area for expansion. Overall, this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.2 billion and $6.5 billion in the full fiscal year, a year-on-year increase of $2.1 billion. 
So turning now to our pending acquisition of Rite Aid. As announced on September 8, we remain actively engaged with the FTC on its review. And today, we still expect that the most likely outcome will be that the parties will be required to divest between 500 and 1,000 stores. We believe that we will be able to execute agreements to divest these stores to potential buyers, pending FTC approval, by the end of calendar year 2016, and now expect to close the acquisition in early calendar 2017. 
Taking into account our current expectations of store divestitures, we continue to expect that the acquisition will be accretive to adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the first full year after closing. We also continue to expect that we will realize synergies from the acquisition in excess of $1 billion to be fully realized within 3 to 4 years of closing. These synergies have been updated where practicable, and as previously disclosed, are expected to come primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters. 
So turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017. We're expecting adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.20. This assumes Rite Aid accretion of $0.05 to $0.12 based on the assumptions that I just mentioned and on the continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback program relating to equity incentives. And in addition, this guidance is based on currency exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year. Please remember, the sterling today is around 15% lower versus the dollar than our weighted average operating income translation rate for fiscal '16. This had an adverse impact on our guidance of around $0.13. 
In terms of phasing, the timing and development of our recently announced new strategic pharmacy partnerships in the U.S. means that we expect Retail Pharmacy USA script draw to be stronger than usual in the second half of the fiscal year. The new rates come into effect on day one of the contract, mainly around the end of the calendar year, while we believe that the enhanced volumes will take some time to build. Overall, we therefore expect Retail Pharmacy USA gross margins to continue to decline in the coming quarters but expect to see sales and profits for the year as a whole to continue to grow as the expected volumes come through from our pharmacy contracts in the second half of the fiscal year. 
So I'll now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments."

It is our fourth quarter in what I believe has been an extremely good year as a whole for the company. That said, the work that we have been doing to control cost, reduce waste and return our business to a partial growth has been showing marked effects for some time. For the past 8 quarters in a row, we have grown our adjusted net earnings over the comparable prior periods. 
In fiscal 2014, if you make adjusted basic adjustment trailing the 55% of Alliance Boots not reflected in the historical published results, we would have generated an estimated $3.9 billion of adjusted net earnings. As we reported $5 billion of adjusted net earnings in fiscal 2016, this could represent an increase of approximately 28% over the last 2 fiscal years on a reported currency basis. This is a compound annual growth rate of around 13%. It is -- it also presents an annual increase of over 15% on a constant currency basis. In addition, we have delivered $10.9 billion of free cash flow over the same period. While I believe that this is impressive by any measure, it is not solely due to the merger that created the Walgreens Boots Alliance. We have continued to see progressive operations growth across the company, which has been a significant driver of our strong financial performance. This success has been achieved despite it having been a very busy time. 
Let's take a moment to remind ourselves of everything we have achieved in the past year. In the U.S., we launched significant initiatives to advance our retail and pharmacy offering. These included investing in the customer experience, especially in beauty, to differentiate Walgreens as a retailer. We also reset our relationship with health care payers and PBMs and worked to develop closer partnerships as a platform for our future. Examples of these strategic partnerships include our new 90-day prescription agreement with OptumRx and Envision, our announced agreement with Express Scripts and our innovative partnership with Prime Therapeutics. These close partnerships are central to our strategy of increasing volumes to our pharmacies and driving footfall to our stores. We strengthened our relationship with AmerisourceBergen, exercising both franchise warrants and extending our pharmacy sales distribution and sourcing agreements. This move further cements the strong and collaborative working relationship our companies have been together over the past 3 years. Our pending acquisition of Rite Aid continues to progress, as George has said. 
Globally, we continue to expand our region presence. In Russia, we divested our sales business and as part of the deal, retained a strategic stake in the country's leading health and beauty retailer. And in South Korea, we signed an agreement to form a franchise relationship with one of the country's leading retailers. 
At the company level, we reached and surpassed our $1 billion synergies goal for -- from the WBA merger and further progressed our cost saving goal of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2017. At the same time, we changed the roles and responsibilities of our senior management team to structure our leadership more efficiently and move to operating a truly unified company. 
Looking forward to 2017, we expect to face the same headwinds we encountered in this year but with some additional factors that are going to slightly change the profile for the year. We are entering a period where we need to consolidate much of the recent activities in the company. We must ensure we are properly positioned to get the full benefit of our work to date. As expected, the volume increases from our new commercial agreements begin to flow to our U.S. pharmacies and global procurement network. Additional benefits will come as our retail transformation work accelerates and compounds the expected increase in traffic that flows through our stores with this agreement. We therefore expect a different phasing for the year-end, with anticipated growth skewed significantly towards the second half of the year. But as you have heard from George, we are expecting the year as a whole to continue our record of healthy growth. We believe this phasing is a temporary phenomenon as we see our work to transform the company have an increased impact. Confirmation and integration, if done properly, is never instant or easy, but we are progressing well. While we are delivering on the promises of the merger, we are also building strong foundations based on establishing an outstanding team and structuring our company for growth in the core business, especially Walgreens. We are doing this without losing sight of the global opportunity and are preparing the company to play an even greater role as health care evolves in the U.S. and around the world. 
Thank you. Now I will hand you back to Gerald."

And obviously, as the year progresses, we'll be able to get a better feel on our ability to both get customers back into Walgreens and hold onto them. And remember, many of these new contracts are maybe narrow, but some are actually pretty broad. The Tricare contract, for example, still has the vast majority of pharmacies in the U.S. in that contract. So we've put in what we think is a good estimate from what we know into the forecast.

And again, as I said I think the previous question to Bob, most of these contracts starts in January 1, but we'll see the majority of the volume, as George just said, in the second half of our fiscal year, which I think starts in March of next year. So that will start to build up. And then we built solid plans on what we know about the market and what our great partners, who are helping us to build this business, have told us about their networks. And some of the selling season is happening right now. You'll see some more of this be announced, particularly through Prime in the days and the weeks ahead. On the front-end strategy, this is a multiyear, multiphase approach. We've put 1,600 new beauty departments on the ground. Not complete, but new in terms of the brands that George mentioned, particularly No7 and Soap & Glory, in this phase, with newer lighting [ph], and importantly, upgraded our training and development of our consultants to give the customers the information they need. And this is in the ground based on the trials we did before. The majority of this work will phase in over a 2- or 3-year period in reality, but you should expect the ongoing improvement to the margin -- gross margin throughout '17 and the years ahead. Remember that we focus our business on the whole box. We focus our business on operating margin, including costs and, of course, on adjusted net earnings. All of this work is designed to drive all elements of profitability within the box of Walgreens. And we are very confident with what we're doing, and the pace is accelerating."

If you don't really accept -- you as an operator of the market, if you don't accept this concept of collaboration, sooner or later, you are isolated, and you cannot really exploit your potential best. So when we have announced some of these deals, of course, we have spoken to the other customers that we have, the other PBMs, and we have explained, which is our logic, and we have explained that we are willing to help or to collaborate with everybody, and you have seen that in a few months, we have been able to announce an agreement, a special collaboration practically with most of the operators in the sector. This is a strategy, a strategy which has always worked for us in the past, in other countries and I believe will work also in the U.S. Of course, as George said, every time that we do something new, every time that we propose a, let's say, an agreement or taking into consideration an agreement which is proposed by one of our customers, we are running the numbers in a very disciplined way, considering, of course, everything, considering the volume, considering the discounts, considering the -- what we can extract more from our suppliers, if anything, considering the increased efficiencies of the pharmacies. And then at the end, we decide whether we can do this particular kind of deal or not. And of course, we are very conscious that when we come with an innovative deal or with a partnership on the market, we have to be prepared to offer similar things to other people. I believe that this is the beauty of being independent. We can work with everybody and we can offer our services to everybody, and we are not seen as particularly skewed toward this or that player in the market."

We obviously transformed the photographic business here in the U.S. through that approach a couple of years ago, and we've tried to spread that knowledge to Europe as well. So where to next, which I think is your question, well, we've closed down operations for beauty and drugstore.com. That's been done successfully. And then we'll start to focus really on the retail part of our business. We announced last Monday order online, collect at the store, or ship to store in 7,600 drugstores, including Duane Reades, a model we successfully built.

But at the end of the day, I -- as far as I can see today, as far as we can see today, we are absolutely confident that we can create -- that we can do the deal and we can create the value. Just this value will be a little postponed on time because if and when we will do the deal, of course, for the first months, we will not be able to start immediately the synergies. It will take some time. And we were hoping to do the deal at the beginning of this fiscal year. For us, in this case, we would have had time to develop some of the synergies.

So I mean, currency would be a good example of an extraneous factor where there's not a lot we can do. In currency translation, it can go one way one year, another way the other year. But fundamentally, that's what we're focused on, is driving profit and then -- from core activities and then, obviously, doing shareholder-enhancing transactions periodically like the Rite Aid deal. And also at the same time, we're very focused, and I know it's a little old-fashioned, but we're very focused on cash flow because cash flow is an engine for growth in the long term. You see we've made good progress on working capital this year, and this really lets us invest over time in M&A, and it enables us to continue to drive shareholder value."

In terms of tax, we've obviously not given specific guidance for fiscal '17 on tax. But in terms of thinking about it, if you strip out the discrete items, as I talked about last year, then our real underlying tax pre-Rite Aid last year was -- so our underlying tax last year was 26.3% on an adjusted basis. That's up obviously excluding the ABC income because, of course, that gets reported on a post-tax basis. So it's quite -- in terms of modeling, we always model it and think about it the way I've just described, excluding ABC. If you think of that 26.3% then, excluding Rite Aid, that's a fairly good proxy for what it should be going forward. Because pre-Rite Aid, the mix will be broadly the same. In terms of Rite Aid, you're absolutely right. With Rite Aid, as the proportion of profit increases from the Rite Aid deal, once we're able to complete it, then we will see a higher proportion of profit here in the U.S.A. And of course here, the tax rates are higher than in most parts of Europe, where the rest of the business operates. But of course, this year, given the accretion that we've indicated, that will be a relatively modest impact."

I'm pleased that we've delivered good results, which is a fitting close to what's been an outstanding financial year for the company, exceeding the upper end of our guidance when we have again experienced strong currency headwinds and some challenging market conditions. As usual, this performance has been achieved through a combination of operational progress and corporate efficiencies. In particular, we've managed our costs well and generated a healthy cash flow. At the same time, we've announced a number of significant strategic partnerships in the U.S., which Stefano will talk about later. But first, I'll take you through our fourth quarter results. 
Let me start with the financial highlights. Sales totaled $28.6 billion, up 0.4% versus the comparable quarter last year. Our results were impacted by currency translation. And on a constant currency basis, sales were up 2.5%. GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, an increase of 36.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.0 billion, and diluted EPS was $0.95. Adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 7.2% and in constant currency, was up 10.3%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.2 billion, up 20.3%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.07. That was up 21.6%. And the adverse currency translation impact was around $0.03. 
So now let me turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter, beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $20.7 billion, up 4.0% over the year-ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 3.2%. Adjusted gross profit was up 0.5% to $5.4 billion, adjusted gross margins being lower for both pharmacy and retail. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales improved by 0.9 percentage points to 20.7%. Adjusted operating margin was stable at 5.3%, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion, up 4.4%. This increase was primarily driven by increased pharmacy volume, procurement efficiencies and cost control, partially offset by lower reimbursement rates. 
We continue to make strong progress on our previously announced cost savings program, the majority of which is in the U.S. Overall, we are well on track to deliver our $1.5 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2017. We now expect total pretax charges associated with the program to be between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, which is $300 million lower than we previously estimated. 
So next, let's look in more detail at pharmacy. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 6.2%, driven by increased script volume and improved specialty sales. We filled 229.95 -- sorry, 229.5 million prescriptions, and that's on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, an increase of 3.7%. On a comparable basis for stores, which excludes central specialty, pharmacy sales increased by 5.0%, with scripts filled up 3.9%, mainly due to continued growth in Medicare Part D volume. Our reported market share of retail prescriptions on a usual 30-day adjusted basis was 19.3%, up approximately 40 basis points over the year-ago quarter. 
As you may know, IMS restated its market share numbers for the comparable period due to an enhancement to the IMS panel. In the appendix, we set out fully comparable historic market share statistics for the division. 
As in the last quarter, and as we expected, gross margins were lower, mainly due to reimbursement rates and changes in mix, which were partially offset by procurement efficiencies. Retail sales on a comparable basis were down 0.3% on the same quarter last year. Sales were impacted most significantly by declines in certain consumable categories and seasonal items such as back-to-school and commodity electronics, where we took action to proactively clear out old and legacy stock as we move to the next phase of our retail transformation program. We're also seeing the impact of direct management action in tobacco, where we've continued to reduce space and visibility as we focus on helping customers who want to stop smoking. 
Importantly, the health and wellness and beauty categories performed well. While gross margins in the quarter were slightly down, we don't see this as a permanent weakness as the recent declines have been mainly due to actions we have taken to put in place foundations for long-term growth. 
I'm delighted to report that the first phase of our new beauty offering reached more than 1,600 stores across the U.S. by the end of the fiscal year. This has 3 core elements: products, store environment and customer experience. First, the products. In this phase, we are highlighting 2 of our best-known brands, No7 and Soap & Glory, alongside existing national brands already well known to Walgreens customers. 
The second element is the store environment. Our stores' beauty areas are being transformed to provide a welcoming and colorful environment, with improved signage and lighting and a product range chosen to suit all types of customers regardless of age or background. 
The third element of the new Walgreens beauty offer is the customer experience. This involved training and deploying specialist beauty consultants to offer high-quality advice to our customers. The program has drawn on our experience internationally, most directly from Boots in the U.K., but has been tailored specifically for the U.S. market based on customer engagement and research. This is the first phase of a multiphase, multiyear strategy to differentiate Walgreens' beauty offering. 
So now let's look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division. Sales for the division were $3.0 billion, up 1.4% in constant currency. On a same basis, comparable store sales declined by 0.6%, mainly due to Chile and the U.K., which I'll cover in a moment. Adjusted operating margin for the division was 8.1%, up 1.0 percentage points. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $247 million, an increase of 15.7% in constant currency. To improve comparability, you will see that we've made certain classification changes to prior period sales, cost of sales and SG&A. These changes have had no impact on operating income. To help with modeling, in the appendix, we've provided revised numbers by quarter for fiscal 2015 and '16. 
Comparable pharmacy sales were flat on a constant currency basis as the loss of institutional contracts in Chile offset growth in other markets. In Boots U.K., comparable pharmacy sales were up 0.6%. And while we continue to experience reimbursement pressure, pharmacy services continued to perform well. Comparable retail sales for the division decreased 1.0% due to a weaker Boots performance in the U.K., where comparable retail sales were down 0.8%, impacted by a particularly volatile and poor June. 
So now let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5.4 billion, down 1.5% on a constant currency basis due to the disposal of Alliance Healthcare Russia in April. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes acquisitions and dispositions, increased by 2.9%. This was marginally behind our estimated market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales due to competitive market conditions in Continental Europe. Adjusted operating margin for the division, which we define to exclude AmerisourceBergen income, was 2.9%. This was up 0.3 percentage points on a constant currency basis versus the comparable quarter last year. Adjusted operating income for the division was $208 million, up 39.2% in constant currency.
We report our share of ABC's net earnings on a 2-month lag. As a result, this was our first full quarter of recognizing approximately 16% of ABC's net earnings. For modeling ABC, remember that equity income related to our increased ownership from the August warrant exercise will be reflected in only 5 weeks of the first quarter due to the 2-month reporting lag. 
So now let me turn to the full year numbers for fiscal 2016. As I said at the beginning, this has been an outstanding financial year, exceeding the upper end of our guidance. These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the previous year due to the Alliance Boots transaction. 
In summary, GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.82 was down 4.5%. This reflects a number of factors, including the fluctuations in the ABC warrants and last year's noncash gain relating to Alliance Boots. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 18.3% to $4.59. Adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from ABC, this was 25.4%. This was lower than we had anticipated when we spoke to you last quarter. 
Ignoring discrete tax items, our underlying adjusted effective tax rate would have been 26.3%. Discrete items of approximately 0.9 percentage points primarily included completion of certain U.S. tax audits and true ups of prior year accruals. The tax rate also reflects changes in the geographical mix of our pretax earnings and the U.S. taxation of our non-U.S. entities. 
Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter and $7.8 billion in the full fiscal year. Over the course of the year, working capital reduced by $1.4 billion due to improved payables. Cash capital expenditure was $421 million in the quarter and $1.3 billion in the full fiscal year. During the year, we invested in key areas to develop our customer proposition, including investment in stores and the U.S. beauty program as well as upgrades to our IT systems, which we began earlier in the year. Store investment included over 100 new openings in Mexico, which continues to be a focus area for expansion. Overall, this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.2 billion and $6.5 billion in the full fiscal year, a year-on-year increase of $2.1 billion. 
So turning now to our pending acquisition of Rite Aid. As announced on September 8, we remain actively engaged with the FTC on its review. And today, we still expect that the most likely outcome will be that the parties will be required to divest between 500 and 1,000 stores. We believe that we will be able to execute agreements to divest these stores to potential buyers, pending FTC approval, by the end of calendar year 2016, and now expect to close the acquisition in early calendar 2017. 
Taking into account our current expectations of store divestitures, we continue to expect that the acquisition will be accretive to adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the first full year after closing. We also continue to expect that we will realize synergies from the acquisition in excess of $1 billion to be fully realized within 3 to 4 years of closing. These synergies have been updated where practicable, and as previously disclosed, are expected to come primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters. 
So turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017. We're expecting adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.20. This assumes Rite Aid accretion of $0.05 to $0.12 based on the assumptions that I just mentioned and on the continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback program relating to equity incentives. And in addition, this guidance is based on currency exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year. Please remember, the sterling today is around 15% lower versus the dollar than our weighted average operating income translation rate for fiscal '16. This had an adverse impact on our guidance of around $0.13. 
In terms of phasing, the timing and development of our recently announced new strategic pharmacy partnerships in the U.S. means that we expect Retail Pharmacy USA script draw to be stronger than usual in the second half of the fiscal year. The new rates come into effect on day one of the contract, mainly around the end of the calendar year, while we believe that the enhanced volumes will take some time to build. Overall, we therefore expect Retail Pharmacy USA gross margins to continue to decline in the coming quarters but expect to see sales and profits for the year as a whole to continue to grow as the expected volumes come through from our pharmacy contracts in the second half of the fiscal year. 
So I'll now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments."

As you have heard, this was a good quarter despite both currency and operational challenges. It is our fourth quarter in what I believe has been an extremely good year as a whole for the company.

It is our fourth quarter in what I believe has been an extremely good year as a whole for the company. That said, the work that we have been doing to control cost, reduce waste and return our business to a partial growth has been showing marked effects for some time. For the past 8 quarters in a row, we have grown our adjusted net earnings over the comparable prior periods. 
In fiscal 2014, if you make adjusted basic adjustment trailing the 55% of Alliance Boots not reflected in the historical published results, we would have generated an estimated $3.9 billion of adjusted net earnings. As we reported $5 billion of adjusted net earnings in fiscal 2016, this could represent an increase of approximately 28% over the last 2 fiscal years on a reported currency basis. This is a compound annual growth rate of around 13%. It is -- it also presents an annual increase of over 15% on a constant currency basis. In addition, we have delivered $10.9 billion of free cash flow over the same period. While I believe that this is impressive by any measure, it is not solely due to the merger that created the Walgreens Boots Alliance. We have continued to see progressive operations growth across the company, which has been a significant driver of our strong financial performance. This success has been achieved despite it having been a very busy time. 
Let's take a moment to remind ourselves of everything we have achieved in the past year. In the U.S., we launched significant initiatives to advance our retail and pharmacy offering. These included investing in the customer experience, especially in beauty, to differentiate Walgreens as a retailer. We also reset our relationship with health care payers and PBMs and worked to develop closer partnerships as a platform for our future. Examples of these strategic partnerships include our new 90-day prescription agreement with OptumRx and Envision, our announced agreement with Express Scripts and our innovative partnership with Prime Therapeutics. These close partnerships are central to our strategy of increasing volumes to our pharmacies and driving footfall to our stores. We strengthened our relationship with AmerisourceBergen, exercising both franchise warrants and extending our pharmacy sales distribution and sourcing agreements. This move further cements the strong and collaborative working relationship our companies have been together over the past 3 years. Our pending acquisition of Rite Aid continues to progress, as George has said. 
Globally, we continue to expand our region presence. In Russia, we divested our sales business and as part of the deal, retained a strategic stake in the country's leading health and beauty retailer. And in South Korea, we signed an agreement to form a franchise relationship with one of the country's leading retailers. 
At the company level, we reached and surpassed our $1 billion synergies goal for -- from the WBA merger and further progressed our cost saving goal of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2017. At the same time, we changed the roles and responsibilities of our senior management team to structure our leadership more efficiently and move to operating a truly unified company. 
Looking forward to 2017, we expect to face the same headwinds we encountered in this year but with some additional factors that are going to slightly change the profile for the year. We are entering a period where we need to consolidate much of the recent activities in the company. We must ensure we are properly positioned to get the full benefit of our work to date. As expected, the volume increases from our new commercial agreements begin to flow to our U.S. pharmacies and global procurement network. Additional benefits will come as our retail transformation work accelerates and compounds the expected increase in traffic that flows through our stores with this agreement. We therefore expect a different phasing for the year-end, with anticipated growth skewed significantly towards the second half of the year. But as you have heard from George, we are expecting the year as a whole to continue our record of healthy growth. We believe this phasing is a temporary phenomenon as we see our work to transform the company have an increased impact. Confirmation and integration, if done properly, is never instant or easy, but we are progressing well. While we are delivering on the promises of the merger, we are also building strong foundations based on establishing an outstanding team and structuring our company for growth in the core business, especially Walgreens. We are doing this without losing sight of the global opportunity and are preparing the company to play an even greater role as health care evolves in the U.S. and around the world. 
Thank you. Now I will hand you back to Gerald."

The team has done a lot of planning here to make sure we take care of customers when they appear back in Walgreens and sometimes, new to Walgreens. And obviously, as the year progresses, we'll be able to get a better feel on our ability to both get customers back into Walgreens and hold onto them. And remember, many of these new contracts are maybe narrow, but some are actually pretty broad. The Tricare contract, for example, still has the vast majority of pharmacies in the U.S. in that contract. So we've put in what we think is a good estimate from what we know into the forecast.

And again, as I said I think the previous question to Bob, most of these contracts starts in January 1, but we'll see the majority of the volume, as George just said, in the second half of our fiscal year, which I think starts in March of next year. So that will start to build up. And then we built solid plans on what we know about the market and what our great partners, who are helping us to build this business, have told us about their networks. And some of the selling season is happening right now. You'll see some more of this be announced, particularly through Prime in the days and the weeks ahead. On the front-end strategy, this is a multiyear, multiphase approach. We've put 1,600 new beauty departments on the ground. Not complete, but new in terms of the brands that George mentioned, particularly No7 and Soap & Glory, in this phase, with newer lighting [ph], and importantly, upgraded our training and development of our consultants to give the customers the information they need. And this is in the ground based on the trials we did before. The majority of this work will phase in over a 2- or 3-year period in reality, but you should expect the ongoing improvement to the margin -- gross margin throughout '17 and the years ahead. Remember that we focus our business on the whole box. We focus our business on operating margin, including costs and, of course, on adjusted net earnings. All of this work is designed to drive all elements of profitability within the box of Walgreens. And we are very confident with what we're doing, and the pace is accelerating."

If you don't really accept -- you as an operator of the market, if you don't accept this concept of collaboration, sooner or later, you are isolated, and you cannot really exploit your potential best. So when we have announced some of these deals, of course, we have spoken to the other customers that we have, the other PBMs, and we have explained, which is our logic, and we have explained that we are willing to help or to collaborate with everybody, and you have seen that in a few months, we have been able to announce an agreement, a special collaboration practically with most of the operators in the sector. This is a strategy, a strategy which has always worked for us in the past, in other countries and I believe will work also in the U.S. Of course, as George said, every time that we do something new, every time that we propose a, let's say, an agreement or taking into consideration an agreement which is proposed by one of our customers, we are running the numbers in a very disciplined way, considering, of course, everything, considering the volume, considering the discounts, considering the -- what we can extract more from our suppliers, if anything, considering the increased efficiencies of the pharmacies. And then at the end, we decide whether we can do this particular kind of deal or not. And of course, we are very conscious that when we come with an innovative deal or with a partnership on the market, we have to be prepared to offer similar things to other people. I believe that this is the beauty of being independent. We can work with everybody and we can offer our services to everybody, and we are not seen as particularly skewed toward this or that player in the market."

And we continue to get the CSAT score as a team, frankly, deserved, and it's a great platform for us. We obviously transformed the photographic business here in the U.S. through that approach a couple of years ago, and we've tried to spread that knowledge to Europe as well. So where to next, which I think is your question, well, we've closed down operations for beauty and drugstore.com. That's been done successfully. And then we'll start to focus really on the retail part of our business. We announced last Monday order online, collect at the store, or ship to store in 7,600 drugstores, including Duane Reades, a model we successfully built. And again, the Boots business, through the sharing of knowledge between the front end and the U.K. is a very important part of our journey here. So we continue to invest behind the digital team. They are a very strong team, in my view, a very impressive team, and we are very confident with the platforms we have, the know-how we have, and now we're focusing back on Walgreens' health and beauty strategy, particularly in the front end, to become an integrated omnichannel retailer.

So I mean, currency would be a good example of an extraneous factor where there's not a lot we can do. In currency translation, it can go one way one year, another way the other year. But fundamentally, that's what we're focused on, is driving profit and then -- from core activities and then, obviously, doing shareholder-enhancing transactions periodically like the Rite Aid deal. And also at the same time, we're very focused, and I know it's a little old-fashioned, but we're very focused on cash flow because cash flow is an engine for growth in the long term. You see we've made good progress on working capital this year, and this really lets us invest over time in M&A, and it enables us to continue to drive shareholder value."

Practically, we have not had any acquisition in the meantime, excluding AB -- acquisition which contributed much in the last 2 years. We also divested something. So the real growth, the underlying growth of our company in the last 2 years, has been 13% if we consider the effect of the devaluation of the pound sterling, more than 15% in constant currency. And we have always said that we can deliver underlying double-digit growth -- low double-digit growth. And this is what we are doing, and this is what we are focused on."

In the guidance for fiscal '17, can you give us a sense on where we should think about a tax rate for the year? Particularly as we think about the Rite Aid business coming on, should we expect that, as a U.S. business, to bring the tax rate up slightly? Also, Alex, you talked about minimizing -- or someone talked about minimizing the tobacco footprint in the stores. How much of a headwind did -- may that have caused in front-end sales? And should we think about that -- what type of headwind that could cause as you continue to minimize that going forward?"

In terms of tax, we've obviously not given specific guidance for fiscal '17 on tax. But in terms of thinking about it, if you strip out the discrete items, as I talked about last year, then our real underlying tax pre-Rite Aid last year was -- so our underlying tax last year was 26.3% on an adjusted basis. That's up obviously excluding the ABC income because, of course, that gets reported on a post-tax basis. So it's quite -- in terms of modeling, we always model it and think about it the way I've just described, excluding ABC. If you think of that 26.3% then, excluding Rite Aid, that's a fairly good proxy for what it should be going forward. Because pre-Rite Aid, the mix will be broadly the same. In terms of Rite Aid, you're absolutely right. With Rite Aid, as the proportion of profit increases from the Rite Aid deal, once we're able to complete it, then we will see a higher proportion of profit here in the U.S.A. And of course here, the tax rates are higher than in most parts of Europe, where the rest of the business operates. But of course, this year, given the accretion that we've indicated, that will be a relatively modest impact."
