Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings. As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered another positive quarter as results exceeded our expectations with comparable EPS of $0.68, up from $0.59 in the prior year.
Yesterday was my 1 year anniversary as Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods, and I can tell you, I am pleased with what we are accomplishing. Clearly, it's been an active year as we've methodically taken the necessary steps to help ConAgra start to unlock the value opportunity that I saw so clearly when I first started thinking about taking this job. Simply put, we are driving focus and discipline into the company, and the impact can be seen, not only in our P&L, but also in our culture where our team is energized, optimistic and determined about the path ahead. And while we're pleased with our progress over the past year, we're also clear eyed that there is much more to do. Accordingly, our team remains hard at work on executing our plans to build a stronger, more consistent and more valuable ConAgra Foods.
Before John and I get into the details of our Q3 results, I want to take a step back and provide you with my perspective on where we are relative to our strategic plans. In February, we completed the sale of our private label operations to TreeHouse foods, marking the conclusion of a robust sales process. The sale enables us to sharpen our focus on our Consumer and Commercial businesses, and it provides us with meaningful capital. We've already deployed $2.15 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt. And going forward, as part of a balanced capital allocation program, we plan to pursue further debt reductions.
As we've discussed previously, the sale also provided a sizable tax benefit, which can be used in the future. In addition to completing the sale of our private label operations, we've been hard at work at strengthening the foundation of our 2 businesses. We're executing our $300 million efficiency plan primarily within consumer to build ConAgra into a lean, more focused company. We are confident this effort will improve profitability, advance our growth agenda and unlock shareholder value.
As we've said previously, we expect to realize the majority of our efficiency improvements in fiscal 2017 and 2018. We also remain on track to bring our consumer and corporate leadership teams together under 1 roof at our new headquarters in Chicago this summer. I'm excited about our plans to develop a more open physical space that will facilitate collaboration and accelerate our shift to a leaner, more nimble, innovative and performance-oriented culture.
Finally, we remain on track to complete the separation of ConAgra into 2 public companies in the fall of calendar 2016. As we said when we announced the proposed spinoff, our goal is to enable both ConAgra brands and Lamb Weston to operate as vibrant pure-play companies with enhanced strategic focus and flexibility.
I'll talk more in a moment about the progress we're making in each of these businesses, but let me reiterate that when you take all factors into consideration, we believe the separation of ConAgra brands and Lamb Weston is the right path to maximize value, as we expect shareholders to benefit from better operating performance and more consistency from both businesses following the separation.
As you know, there's a lot of work to complete between the announcement of a proposed spend [ph] and the separation itself. We're hard at work on that front, and we will have a lot of more information to share via SEC filings and investor days over time. Ultimately, our ability to drive value across these businesses is a function of how well we execute. To that end, our solid Q3 results exceeded our expectations and give me confidence that we're identifying the right actions to drive improved profitability.
So onto Q3 in detail. Our Q3 results for the Consumer Foods segment reflect continued progress and momentum around establishing a higher quality, investment-grade volume base. Even though we experienced a volume decline, we had strong price mix during the quarter. We've been implementing initiatives to improve pricing discipline and create efficiency while driving renovation and targeted brand investment. Importantly, as we undertake these actions, we remain relentlessly focused on execution.
We're making good progress on all these fronts. From a topline perspective, we saw volume declines where we expected them. The vast majority of the Q3 consumer volume decline was on banquet, 90% to be exact. But more broadly, in the second half of last fiscal year, we funded several major deep discount promotions, particularly in our frozen business. These kinds of deals can drive big spikes in low-margin promoted volume. And given our deliberate plan to reduce our reliance on deep discount promotions and given the promoted volume spikes embedded in our year-ago comps, we expected lower promoted volume. What we were counting on though was solid performance on most base consumption trends and strong margin expansion broadly, and that is basically what we got. You see the entire segment's margin expansion in the release, but it's important to note that on Banquet, we saw over 200 basis points of gross margin expansion despite investments in higher quality. Further, we also made other below-the-line investments to build the brand the right way for the long haul, mainly A&P support. These collective investments do not have the same immediate impact of promoted price points below a dollar, but they represent the right way to manage a branded asset for long-term value creation.
This notion has been missing for too long at ConAgra. We will be relentless as we continue these efforts because at the end of the day, we want sustainably stronger margins, which requires strong brands, and strong brands don't compete on the back of giveaway deals.
As a result of our efforts, on a comparable basis, operating profit was $340 million, up about 17%. Operating margins were up more than 300 basis points from the year-ago period, driven by these 3 factors: Price mix, supply chain productivity and modest material depletion deflation.
Our focus in consumer foods will continue to be on expanding margins. The cornerstone of this effort is strengthening the brands that generate the best return. By focusing on our strongest brands, we are getting better price realization and trade efficiencies.
As you've heard us discuss before, our approach provides the fuel to reinvest in brands that have the right fundamentals, are consumer relevant and have accretive margins. And we're not just talking about investment, during the third quarter, we supported our brands in a highly disciplined way as evidenced by our 12% increase in A&P support. We've increased A&P spending 13% year-to-date.
We've been investing in brands with clear differentiators and relevant consumer benefits like Marie Callender's, Hunt’s, Ro*Tel, Reddi-wip, Slim Jim and PAM. I'll talk in a moment about our efforts in the frozen category, but in the center of the store, we continue to make good progress with a real food initiative around the Hunt’s brand, and we're very pleased with the progress we're making with Ro*Tel, which deliver very strong results during the Super Bowl. In addition, through focused execution, we increased sales, built share and won the holiday season across Marie Callender's pies, Reddi-wip and PAM.
Our investments are also coming in the form of innovation and renovation. As you've heard me discuss, we intend to continue enhancing our portfolio with the focus on further premiumization, wellness and authenticity. We expect to achieve this through a combination of organic innovation and smart acquisitions.
A great example of our investment in innovation comes from our healthy choice simply steamers line, which you've heard us discuss previously. This is a clean label, nothing-artificial version of our Café Steamers offering, and we're continuing to drive wellness-based innovation with this line. In the fourth quarter, we're adding 4 new premium varieties, including 3 cheese tortellini, a sweet and spicy Asian style noodle bowl, creamy spinach and tomato linguine and an unwrapped bowl. Consistent with the consumer focus on authenticity, these new recipes will spotlight organic non-GMO ingredients.
Renovation will also be a driver of margin expansion. Building on an example we've touched upon last quarter, our work to restage the Banquet franchise continues. As I noted earlier, Banquet represented the vast majority of our volume decline in the third quarter as we reduced our reliance on deep discount promotion and raised our everyday shelf price above a dollar. While we recognize it will take time to rebuild the buying rate among households that are long accustomed to $1 Banquet, we are confident that the higher price points enable us to invest in product enhancements and higher-quality A&P that reeducates consumers about the brand. Not all consumers will transition with the brand, and we're okay with that. But given the higher quality, we expect to attract new consumers to the franchise in time. We continue to believe our plan for Banquet is the right one for its long-term brand health and financial strength.
And this highly disciplined approach to margin expansion is when we plan to methodically apply to other brands with similar opportunities. Another prime restaging candidate is Bertolli, which we see as right for the same type of target investment. With Bertolli, we are stepping up our work to renovate our frozen skillet business and make the brand even more relevant to today's shoppers. We're expanding occasions through the addition of family-sized skillets within our lineup, and looking ahead, we're embarking on major renovation investments in the Bertolli brand to upgrade proteins such as all-natural chicken and dramatically simplified ingredient labels.
As we continue to renovate around the brand, we will support the product upgrades with increased marketing spend to drive profitable growth.
As I've said many times, unlocking the full value potential of our branded portfolio will be a process, not a flip of the switch. But it is a battle-tested process, and it will succeed. It all starts with the unwavering belief that strong margins are the key to maximizing value, and that strong melt [ph] margins are the byproduct of execution all excellence across disciplines, spanning everything from supply chain productivity to pricing and trade analytics, to mix management and targeted high ROI marketing to exciting innovation.
Make no mistake about it, ConAgra is becoming much stronger in each of these disciplines, and you are seeing the impact in our margin expansion. Over time, as we lean ourselves off of our historical overreliance on deep discount trade deals and rebuild our innovation pipeline, supported by more effective marketing, you will see sales grow, but in a much higher quality fashion.
We are confident that there is a lot of room for progress, and we are relentlessly focused on continuing to execute against our goals. It is about the delta, meaning the change we can drive as opposed to a snapshot assessment.
Overall, I'm very encouraged by the work going on in Consumer Foods. Investment creates a virtuous cycle. Over time, stronger brands will lead to better pricing power and higher margins, and we are clearly on the right path to maximizing value.
Now turning to Commercial Foods. Net sales were approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 6% compared to the prior year. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit was $175 million, up 21% on a comparable basis. While the Commercial Foods segment posted strong results across the board, Lamb Weston was particularly strong. Sales for Lamb Weston's potato operations grew across North America during the quarter as well as in international markets. International sales performance for Lamb Weston was noticeably strong, reflecting the lapping of the impact of the West Coast port labor dispute in the year-ago period as well as improving demand in key Asian markets.
As we've indicated before, Lamb Weston remains well positioned to capitalize on significant international growth opportunities created by the aggressive, emerging market expansion of major quick service restaurant chains.
In our Lamb Weston North America business, we continue to see positive growth momentum across many of our key customers in the quick-serve restaurant and operator-distributor channels. We have industry-leading innovation and customer service, and our breadth of diversified products continues to position this business as a clear market leader in North America.
Now before I turn it over to John, I want to take a moment to acknowledge our talented team as we work to transform ConAgra into a stronger, more consistent company with a more valuable future. While there has been significant change during the past year, our people are energized and focused on serving our customers, and I am excited about the path forward.
Over to you, John."

In my comment this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our fiscal third quarter performance, including discontinued operations, comparability matters, cash flow capital and balance sheet items and our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year.
I'll start with some comments on our performance for our fiscal third quarter. Overall, diluted EPS from continuing operations, as reported, was $0.41. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, diluted EPS for the fiscal third quarter, including discontinued operations, was $0.68, which is ahead of our expectations and compares favorably to our prior year quarter's comparable earnings per share of $0.59. Both our Consumer Foods and our Commercial Foods segments performed very well.
In our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.9 billion for the quarter, down about 2% from the year-ago period. This reflects a 4% decline in volume and a negative 1% impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by a 3% improvement in price/mix.
Segment operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $339 million or up about 17% from the year-ago period. Operating margin on a comparable basis expanded about 300 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. Margin expansion reflects pricing discipline, mix management, supply chain efficiencies and favorable input costs, offset by higher marketing and incentive costs.
Foreign exchange for this quarter had negative impacts of $28 million on net sales and about $12 million on operating profit.
On marketing, Consumer Foods' advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $91 million, up about 12% from the prior year quarter, reflecting our efforts to continue to strengthen and support our brands.
In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion, up about 6% from the prior year quarter. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit was $175 million or 21% above last year's third quarter operating profit. The operating results largely reflect a strong profit increase in our Lamb Weston business, driven by strong volume performance, both domestically and internationally; margin expansion; and the benefit of lapping the West Coast port labor dispute in the year-ago quarter.
Equity method investment earnings, excluding the impact -- excluding items impacting comparability, were $27 million for the quarter and $33 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture, principally driven by unfavorable wheat market conditions, which from time to time, can impact margins.
Moving on to corporate expenses. For the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $155 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $73 million versus $52 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase principally relates to higher incentives, reflecting the significant improvement in operating performance this year and the timing of the related incentive accruals year-over-year.
On our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making good progress and expect to see significant benefits over the next couple of years. I would note that our fiscal third quarter results from continuing operations reflect some initial benefits from our cost savings programs, partially offset by modest stranded costs from our private label divestiture.
Further, I would highlight 2 other points related to our cost savings initiatives. First, the benefits of our previously announced cost savings programs are concentrated in the Consumer business; and second, we have developed aggressive targets and plans so that we can offset modest stranded costs as they arrive -- as they arise as well as selectively invest back into the business to build capabilities that will expand operating margins over time.
Discontinued operations posted EPS of $0.05 per diluted share this quarter. It reflects operations of the private label business through February 1, 2016, or about 9 weeks of the fiscal quarter.
After adjusting for items impacting comparability, the private label discontinued operations earned $0.11 per share this quarter, including about $0.05 per share of benefit related to the elimination of depreciation and amortization expense.
Expected comparable earnings from the private label operations were included in our earlier guidance for the quarter.
Also at this time, we estimate that the divestiture of the private label operations gave rise to a capital loss of approximately $4.2 billion pretax or $1.6 billion after tax, which can be utilized over the next 5 years. We remain confident that the company will be able to realize significant tax benefits in the future as we work to reshape our portfolio in a disciplined manner.
On comparability items, this quarter included 4 items. First, approximately $0.16 per share of net expense related to restructuring charges; second, approximately $0.04 per share of net expense related to transaction costs incurred in connection with debt reduction this quarter; third, approximately $0.03 per share of income related to a pension settlement gain at a joint venture; and finally, we included in comparable earnings approximately $0.11 per share of income related to items in discontinued operations for which we have provided additional details in our Regulation G disclosures in the release.
On cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, we ended the quarter with $503 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total operating cash flows through the fiscal third quarter were approximately $695 million versus $740 million from the year-ago quarter. The decrease is principally driven by higher tax payments in the current fiscal year. As a reminder, due to the seasonality in our business and our normal inventory cycle, we typically generate a significant portion of our annual operating cash flows in the latter part of the fiscal year. We remain confident in our ability to generate attractive operating cash flows over the balance of this fiscal year and expect total operating cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations to be in the range of $1.2 billion for the year.
On capital expenditures. For the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $100 million versus $83 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $77 million in the fiscal third quarter versus $80 million in the year-ago quarter, and dividends for this fiscal quarter were $109 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter.
On capital allocation, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments. As we've previously noted, we completed the divestiture of our private label operation this quarter. We received proceeds in excess of $2.6 billion and deployed about $2.15 billion to repay long-term debt. We expect to deploy the majority of the remaining proceeds for debt repayment over the next several months.
During the fiscal third quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, and we have approximately $132 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.
Now I'd like to provide a few comments on the balance of fiscal 2016. Given that we have sold the private label operations, we are now citing guidance in terms of earnings per share from continuing operations. We have given you the quarterly and annual details of EPS from continuing operations for this fiscal year and last fiscal year and our Regulation G tables and in our written Q&A documents. 
For the full fiscal year 2016, we expect EPS from continuing operations, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.07. This compares with $1.93 for fiscal year 2015 on that same basis. So far, in fiscal 2016, we have earned 1 point -- I'm sorry, $1.56 from continuing operations after adjusting for items affecting our comparability items.
To reach our full year guidance, we are expecting fiscal fourth quarter comparable EPS to be in the range of $0.50. This guidance reflects continued strong fundamentals in our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments. This guidance is lower than the prior year comparable amount of $0.55, and the decrease is due mainly to the extra week in the prior year, the impact of FX, higher marketing investments and higher incentives this year.
I'll offer that the guidance for fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations should not be taken as a beginning point on which to make fiscal 2017 estimate for either Conagra Brands or Lamb Weston, as there are several details that we need to finalize, including capital allocation and financial policies, the phasing of our SG&A savings and trade efficiency benefits, brand investment targets as well as the short-term impacts of any stranded costs associated with the Lamb Weston spinoff. We will offer details on those items in due course at the Investor Day events we plan to hold ahead of spin.
In closing, while we are working through a great deal of change, we are pleased with our performance for this fiscal year in strengthening margins across our businesses and in managing the significant changes in cost structure and portfolio that will we believe will drive value creation over time.
That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I, along with Tom McGough and Tom Warner, will be happy to take your questions.

We do expect the centerline of our profitability to go north over time. We also expect that the standard deviation around that centerline will decrease over time. And you're absolutely right, in any given quarter, margins could be impacted by short-term inflation or deflation. And what I would say is you won't see us get overly exercised by that because we'll stay focused on what's right for the long haul.

We also are going through our typical annual operating plan process, so we're evaluating where we want to invest, the magnitude of those investments.

And we don't have a targeted spending level for the entire portfolio, we look at each individual brand based on the segmentation and digest for investment. I think you see that in our results today where our EP is concentrated on the focused group of brands like Marie Callender's, Hunt’s, Slim Jim and our materially. You see that we're growing sales and share, and they're contributing to overall improvement of our portfolio margin.

So one thing I would remind folks is that, especially in our Consumer Foods business last year in fourth quarter, we've put through a pretty strong quarter. So we're lapping a stronger quarter relatively speaking. The other thing is we do have some seasonality in to our business in terms of the mix of products we sell in our consumer business, which impacts the margin. So when you look at sequential margins from third quarter to fourth quarter, you should expect to see the seasonality mix impact come down some. And I think we're still looking at some margin expansion year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So I don't think the trends are reversing or significantly flattening out. I really view it as again a number of these mechanical issues, in particular the 53rd week, some FX, some higher incentives and then we're going to continue to have some higher marketing investments. So that's kind of how we see it right now. And again, I don't think we see any significant break in the trend on the Lamb Weston business either."

Now keep in mind, average pricing is a fiction of shelf price or a list price, but it's also a version of our promoted volume price, and we've actually been active on both fronts. I think with respect to merchandising and $100 million efficiency that we've talked about within trade, sometimes what I read it sounds as if that's coming across as if it's just a cut as if we're ripping trade out. Nothing could be further from the truth. We spend a lot of money on trade. We've identified $100 million in trade spend that we don't think does much to help us or our retailers. So when we talk to our customers about being more efficient and impactful with that trade, they're as interested in that as we are because it helps drive quality sales, it helps drives margins, et cetera. And then separately, I'd say our customers also value quality volume as much as we do. They understand that inefficiencies isn't helping anybody. So if we can redeploy inefficiency into brand-building innovation or even more effective merchandising, everybody wins. So think of the payoff as better margins and stronger brands versus cutting merchandising. Then when it comes to shelf price, there are 3 pillars to our pricing actions. Number one is what we call inflation-justified list price increases. Meaning if we've got inflation, we feel totally justified in taking a list price increase, and that's what we will do. The second piece of pricing is the trade efficiency we just talked about, which in large part, reintroduce reliance on deep discount merchandising and redeployment of those the with more effective, more efficient activities. And then the third price -- third piece of our pricing strategy is higher-quality driven pricing. Meaning we improve the food we're selling and we charge more for it. And in any given quarter, we likely to have a mix of all 3 of these things but the ratios could change within each quarter. So that is the strategy the we're pursuing. Our customers are aligned with us on it. They're supportive on it. They believe as we believe its ultimately going to lead to better sales, better profit and higher-quality volume base."

So there's ways there. We are going to be as aggressive as anybody in the industry in terms of getting after that ways. And we'll be open-minded with when we identify ways with where it goes. If we've got a high ROI way of redeploying it, we will redeploy it. If we don't have a higher ROI rate of the redeploying it, we'll drop it right the bottom line. We'll be very pragmatic around what to do in little of ways based on what maximizes value."

I think Banquet is quite a different from our other brands, and I'm going to have Tom share some of our detailed thinking on this business. But what the impact you see on Banquet is again, if you come back to the notion that there are 2 things we're dealing with here. One is shelf price, which is kind of belt baseline volume. The other is promotion strategy and that's promotion volume. We've actually made a meaningful difference, a meaningful change on both. And part of what you're seeing as how aggressive we were in the year-ago period in promoted activity and the choice not to do that. For example, events that might sell at [ph] $0.80 instead of $1. As you might imagine, that drove some pretty significant spikes in the year-ago period. And when you don't repeat that it, obviously you're not selling unprofitable volume but you're going to see a shale off on the promoted side on the volume ledger. At the same time, we also have shelf price increases which shows up as a baseline elasticity factor. So when you get both, it kind of compounds, and that's a bit of what you saw on the results. But again, that was entirely planned. We knew what we would expect there, and we've got to migrate to a higher quality consumer base here over time because there were clearly plenty of consumers in that exact window year ago who were in our franchise for one reason and one reason only. And that's because we basically don't give away pricing or giveaway merchandising, and that's effectively what you saw. Tom, did I miss anything there?"

You -- obviously, we've taken price on Banquet, as Sean said, that impacted both base and promoted. When you take out Banquet and look at the rest of our portfolio, our non-promoted base sales were essentially flat. So we're going through a period, not just ourselves in terms of looking at trade productivity, investing it in the right return activities but the customer environment is also changing. And there's a move for less promotional activity from some customers. I think inherent in what we're driving against is selling more off-the-shelf and low lying less from push activities.

As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered another positive quarter as results exceeded our expectations with comparable EPS of $0.68, up from $0.59 in the prior year.
Yesterday was my 1 year anniversary as Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods, and I can tell you I am pleased with what we are accomplishing. Clearly, it's been an active year as we've methodically taken the necessary steps to help ConAgra start to unlock the value opportunity that I saw so clearly when I first started thinking about taking this job. Simply put, we are driving focus and discipline into the company, and the impact can be seen not only in our P&L but also in our culture, where our team is energized, optimistic and determined about the path ahead. And while we're pleased with our progress over the past year, we're also clear-eyed that there is much more to do. Accordingly, our team remains hard at work on executing our plans to build a stronger, more consistent and more valuable ConAgra Foods.
Before John and I get into the details of our Q3 results, I want to take a step back and provide you with my perspective on where we are relative to our strategic plans. In February, we completed the sale of our private label operations to TreeHouse Foods, marking the conclusion of a robust sale process. The sale enables us to sharpen our focus on our consumer and commercial businesses, and it provides us with meaningful capital. We've already deployed $2.15 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt, and going forward, as part of a balanced capital allocation program, we plan to pursue further debt reductions. As we've discussed previously, the sale also provided a sizable tax benefit, which can be used in the future. 
In addition to completing the sale of our private label operations, we've been hard at work at strengthening the foundation of our 2 businesses. We're executing our $300 million efficiency plan, primarily within consumer, to build ConAgra into a lean, more focused company. We are confident this effort will improve profitability, advance our growth agenda and unlock shareholder value.
As we've said previously, we expect to realize the majority of our efficiency improvements in fiscal 2017 and 2018. We also remain on track to bring our consumer and corporate leadership teams together under one roof at our new headquarters in Chicago this summer. I'm excited about our plans to develop a more open physical space that will facilitate collaboration and accelerate our shift to a leaner, more nimble, innovative and performance-oriented culture.
Finally, we remain on track to complete the separation of ConAgra into 2 public companies in the fall of calendar 2016. As we said when we announced the proposed spinoff, our goal is to enable both Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston to operate as vibrant pure-play companies with enhanced strategic focus and flexibility.
I'll talk more in a moment about the progress we're making in each of these businesses, but let me reiterate that when you take all factors into consideration, we believe the separation of Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston is the right path to maximize value as we expect shareholders to benefit from better operating performance and more consistency from both businesses following the separation.
As you know, there's a lot of work to complete between the announcement of a proposed spin and the separation itself. We're hard at work on that front, and we will have a lot more information to share via SEC filings and Investor Days over time. Ultimately, our ability to drive value across these businesses is a function of how well we execute. To that end, our solid Q3 results exceeded our expectations and give me confidence that we're identifying the right actions to drive improved profitability.
So on to Q3 in detail. Our Q3 results for the Consumer Foods segment reflect continued progress and momentum around establishing a higher-quality, investment-grade volume base. Even though we experienced a volume decline, we had strong price mix during the quarter. We've been implementing initiatives to improve pricing discipline and trade efficiency while driving renovation and targeted brand investment. Importantly, as we undertake these actions, we remain relentlessly focused on execution.
We're making good progress on all these fronts. From a top line perspective, we saw volume declines where we expected them. The vast majority of the Q3 consumer volume decline was on Banquet, 90% to be exact. But more broadly, in the second half of last fiscal year, we funded several major deep discount promotions, particularly in our frozen business. These kinds of deals can drive big spikes in low-margin promoted volume. And given our deliberate plan to reduce our reliance on deep discount promotions and given the promoted volume spikes embedded in our year-ago comps, we expected lower promoted volume. What we were counting on, though, was solid performance on most base consumption trends and strong margin expansion broadly, and that is basically what we got. You see the entire segment's margin expansion in the release, but it's important to note that on Banquet, we saw over 200 basis points of gross margin expansion despite investments in higher quality. Further, we also made other below-the-line investments to build the brand the right way for the long haul, namely A&P support. These collective investments do not have the same immediate impact of promoted price points below $1, but they represent the right way to manage a branded asset for long-term value creation.
This notion has been missing for too long at ConAgra. We will be relentless as we continue these efforts because at the end of the day, we want sustainably stronger margins, which requires strong brands, and strong brands don't compete on the back of giveaway deals.
As a result of our efforts, on a comparable basis, operating profit was $340 million, up about 17%. Operating margins were up more than 300 basis points from the year-ago period, driven by these 3 factors: price/mix, supply chain productivity and modest material deflation.
Our focus in Consumer Foods will continue to be on expanding margins. The cornerstone of this effort is strengthening the brands that generate the best return. By focusing on our strongest brands, we are getting better price realization and trade efficiencies.
As you've heard us discuss before, our approach provides the fuel to reinvest in brands that have the right fundamentals, are consumer relevant and have accretive margins. And we're not just talking about investment. During the third quarter, we supported our brands in a highly disciplined way, as evidenced by our 12% increase in A&P support. We've increased A&P spending 13% year-to-date.
We've been investing in brands with clear differentiators and relevant consumer benefits like Marie Callender's, Hunt’s, Ro*Tel, Reddi-wip, Slim Jim and PAM. I'll talk in a moment about our efforts in the frozen category, but in the center of the store, we continue to make good progress with our real food initiative around the Hunt’s brand, and we're very pleased with the progress we're making with Ro*Tel, which delivered very strong results during the Super Bowl. In addition, through focused execution, we increased sales, built share and won the holiday season across Marie Callender's pies, Reddi-wip and PAM.
Our investments are also coming in the form of innovation and renovation. As you've heard me discuss, we intend to continue enhancing our portfolio with the focus on further premiumization, wellness and authenticity. We expect to achieve this through a combination of organic innovation and smart acquisitions.
A great example of our investment in innovation comes from our Healthy Choice Simply Steamers line, which you've heard us discuss previously. This is a clean label, nothing-artificial version of our Café Steamers offering, and we're continuing to drive wellness-based innovation with this line. In the fourth quarter, we're adding 4 new premium varieties, including 3 cheese tortellini, a sweet and spicy Asian-style noodle bowl, creamy spinach and tomato linguine and an unwrapped burrito bowl. Consistent with the consumer focus on authenticity, these new recipes will spotlight organic, non-GMO ingredients.
Renovation will also be a driver of margin expansion. Building on an example we've touched upon last quarter, our work to restage the Banquet franchise continues. As I noted earlier, Banquet represented the vast majority of our volume decline in the third quarter as we reduced our reliance on deep discount promotion and raised our everyday shelf price above $1. While we recognize it will take time to rebuild the buying rate among households that are long accustomed to $1 Banquet, we are confident that the higher price points enable us to invest in product enhancements and higher-quality A&P that reeducates consumers about the brand. Not all consumers will transition with the brand, and we are okay with that. But given the higher quality, we expect to attract new consumers to the franchise in time. We continue to believe our plan for Banquet is the right one for its long-term brand health and financial strength.
And this highly disciplined approach to margin expansion is one we plan to methodically apply to other brands with similar opportunities. Another prime restaging candidate is Bertolli, which we see as right for the same type of targeted investment. With Bertolli, we are stepping up our work to renovate our frozen skillet business and make the brand even more relevant to today's shoppers. We're expanding occasions through the addition of family-size skillets within our lineup, and looking ahead, we are embarking on major renovation investments in the Bertolli brand to upgrade proteins such as all-natural chicken and dramatically simplified ingredient labels. As we continue to renovate around the brand, we will support the product upgrades with increased marketing spend to drive profitable growth.
As I've said many times, unlocking the full value potential of our branded portfolio will be a process, not a flip of the switch. But it is a battle-tested process, and it will succeed. It all starts with the unwavering belief that strong margins are the key to maximizing value, and that strong margins are the byproduct of executional excellence across disciplines, spanning everything from supply chain productivity to pricing and trade analytics, to mix management and targeted high-ROI marketing, to exciting innovation.
Make no mistake about it. ConAgra is becoming much stronger in each of these disciplines, and you are seeing the impact in our margin expansion. Over time, as we wean ourselves off of our historical overreliance on deep discount trade deals and rebuild our innovation pipeline supported by more effective marketing, you will see sales grow but in a much higher-quality fashion.
We are confident that there is a lot of room for progress, and we are relentlessly focused on continuing to execute against our goals. It is about the delta, meaning the change we can drive, as opposed to a snapshot assessment.
Overall, I'm very encouraged by the work going on in Consumer Foods. Investment creates a virtuous cycle. Over time, stronger brands will lead to better pricing power and higher margins, and we are clearly on the right path to maximizing value.
Now turning to Commercial Foods. Net sales were approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 6% compared to the prior year. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit was $175 million, up 21% on a comparable basis. While the Commercial Foods segment posted strong results across the board, Lamb Weston was particularly strong. Sales for Lamb Weston's potato operations grew across North America during the quarter as well as in international markets. International sales performance for Lamb Weston was noticeably strong, reflecting the lapping of the impact of the West Coast port labor dispute in the year-ago period as well as improving demand in key Asian markets. As we've indicated before, Lamb Weston remains well positioned to capitalize on significant international growth opportunities created by the aggressive emerging market expansion of major quick-service restaurant chains.
In our Lamb Weston North America business, we continue to see positive growth momentum across many of our key customers in the quick-serve restaurant and operator-distributor channels. We have industry-leading innovation and customer service, and our breadth of diversified products continues to position this business as a clear market leader in North America.
Now before I turn it over to John, I want to take a moment to acknowledge our talented team as we work to transform ConAgra into a stronger, more consistent company with a more valuable future. While there has been significant change during the past year, our people are energized and focused on serving our customers, and I am excited about the path forward.
Over to you, John."

In my comment this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our fiscal third quarter performance, including discontinued operations; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance she",1524,"Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. In my comment this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our fiscal third quarter performance, including discontinued operations; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year.
I'll start with some comments on our performance for our fiscal third quarter. Overall, diluted EPS from continuing operations, as reported, was $0.41. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, diluted EPS for the fiscal third quarter, including discontinued operations, was $0.68, which is ahead of our expectations and compares favorably to our prior year quarter's comparable earnings per share of $0.59. Both our Consumer Foods and our Commercial Foods segments performed very well.
In our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.9 billion for the quarter, down about 2% from the year-ago period. This reflects a 4% decline in volume and a negative 1% impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by a 3% improvement in price/mix.
Segment operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $339 million or up about 17% from the year-ago period. Operating margin on a comparable basis expanded about 300 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. Margin expansion reflects pricing discipline, mix management, supply chain efficiencies and favorable input costs, offset by higher marketing and incentive costs. Foreign exchange for this quarter had negative impacts of $28 million on net sales and about $12 million on operating profit.
On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $91 million, up about 12% from the prior year quarter, reflecting our efforts to continue to strengthen and support our brands.
In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion, up about 6% from the prior year quarter. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit was $175 million or 21% above last year's third quarter operating profit. The operating results largely reflect a strong profit increase in our Lamb Weston business, driven by strong volume performance, both domestically and internationally; margin expansion; and the benefit of lapping the West Coast port labor dispute in the year-ago quarter.
Equity method investment earnings, excluding the impact -- excluding items impacting comparability, were $27 million for the quarter and $33 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture, principally driven by unfavorable weak market conditions, which, from time to time, can impact margins.
Moving on to corporate expenses. For the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $155 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $73 million versus $52 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase principally relates to higher incentives, reflecting the significant improvement in operating performance this year and the timing of the related incentive accruals year-over-year.
On our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making good progress and expect to see significant benefits over the next couple of years. I would note that our fiscal third quarter results from continuing operations reflect some initial benefits from our cost savings programs, partially offset by modest stranded costs from our private label divestiture.
Further, I would highlight 2 other points related to our cost savings initiatives. First, the benefits of our previously announced cost savings programs are concentrated in the consumer business. And second, we have developed aggressive targets and plans so that we can offset modest stranded costs as they arrive -- as they arise as well as selectively invest back into the business to build capabilities that will expand operating margins over time.
Discontinued operations posted EPS of $0.05 per diluted share this quarter. It reflects operations of the private label business through February 1, 2016 or about 9 weeks of the fiscal quarter. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, the private label discontinued operations earned $0.11 per share this quarter, including about $0.05 per share of benefit related to the elimination of depreciation and amortization expense. Expected comparable earnings from the private label operations were included in our earlier guidance for the quarter.
Also at this time, we estimate that the divestiture of the private label operations gave rise to a capital loss of approximately $4.2 billion pretax or $1.6 billion after tax, which can be utilized over the next 5 years. We remain confident that the company will be able to realize significant tax benefits in the future as we work to reshape our portfolio in a disciplined manner.
On comparability items, this quarter included 4 items: first, approximately $0.16 per share of net expense related to restructuring charges; second, approximately $0.04 per share of net expense related to transaction costs incurred in connection with debt reduction this quarter; third, approximately $0.03 per share of income related to a pension settlement gain at a joint venture; and finally, we included in comparable earnings approximately $0.11 per share of income related to items in discontinued operations, for which we have provided additional details in our Regulation G disclosures in the release.
On cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, we ended the quarter with $503 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total operating cash flows through the fiscal third quarter were approximately $695 million versus $740 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is principally driven by higher tax payments in the current fiscal year. As a reminder, due to the seasonality in our business and our normal inventory cycle, we typically generate a significant portion of our annual operating cash flows in the latter part of the fiscal year. We remain confident in our ability to generate attractive operating cash flows over the balance of this fiscal year and expect total operating cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations to be in the range of $1.2 billion for the year.
On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $100 million versus $83 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $77 million in the fiscal third quarter versus $80 million in the year-ago quarter. And dividends for this fiscal quarter were $109 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter.
On capital allocation, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments. As we've previously noted, we completed the divestiture of our private label operations this quarter. We received proceeds in excess of $2.6 billion and deployed about $2.15 billion to repay long-term debt. We expect to deploy the majority of the remaining proceeds for debt repayment over the next several months.
During the fiscal third quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, and we have approximately $132 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.
Now I'd like to provide a few comments on the balance of fiscal 2016. Given that we have sold the private label operations, we are now citing guidance in terms of earnings per share from continuing operations. We have given you the quarterly and annual details of EPS from continuing operations for this fiscal year and last fiscal year in our Regulation G tables and in our written Q&A document. 
For the full fiscal year 2016, we expect EPS from continuing operations, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.07. This compares with $1.93 for fiscal year 2015 on that same basis. So far, in fiscal 2016, we have earned $1.56 from continuing operations after adjusting for items affecting -- or comparability items.
To reach our full year guidance, we are expecting fiscal fourth quarter comparable EPS to be in the range of $0.50. This guidance reflects continued strong fundamentals in our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments. This guidance is lower than the prior year comparable amount of $0.55, and the decrease is due mainly to the extra week in the prior year, the impact of FX, higher marketing investments and higher incentives this year.
I'll offer that the guidance for fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations should not be taken as a beginning point on which to make fiscal 2017 estimates for either Conagra Brands or Lamb Weston as there are several details that we need to finalize, including capital allocation and financial policies, the phasing of our SG&A savings and trade efficiency benefits, brand investment targets as well as the short-term impacts of any stranded cost associated with the Lamb Weston spinoff. We will offer details on those items in due course at the Investor Day events we plan to hold ahead of the spin.
In closing, while we are working through a great deal of change, we are pleased with our performance so far this fiscal year in strengthening margins across our businesses and in managing the significant changes in cost structure and portfolio that will we believe will drive value creation over time.
That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I, along with Tom McGough and Tom Werner, will be happy to take your questions. 
Before we turn it over for questions, Chris would like to share a few remarks. Chris?"

We do expect the centerline of our profitability to go north over time. We also expect that the standard deviation around that centerline will decrease over time. And you're absolutely right. In any given quarter, margins could be impacted by short-term inflation or deflation. And what I would say is you won't see us get overly exercised by that because we'll stay focused on what's right for the long haul. But yes, there's some benefit in there from the absence of deflation, but our work is not done. We see further opportunity, and that's where we're going to be relentless in pursuing."

But we are going to continue to make the right investments in our business behind the brand. I think it's really about how do we do that with discipline.

Let me jump in, Dave, on a couple of factors just to address some. So one thing I would remind folks is that, especially in our Consumer Foods business last year in the fourth quarter, we've put through a pretty strong quarter. So we're lapping a stronger quarter, relatively speaking. The other thing is we do have some seasonality in our business in terms of the mix of products we sell in our consumer business, which impacts the margin. So when you look at sequential margins from third quarter to fourth quarter, you should expect to see the seasonality mix impact come down some. And I think we're still looking at some margin expansion year-over-year in the fourth quarter, so I don't think the trends are reversing or significantly flattening out. I really view it as, again, a number of the mechanical issues, in particular, the 53rd week, some FX, the higher incentives, and then we're going to continue to have some higher marketing investments. So that's kind of how we see it right now. And again, I don't think we see any significant break in the trend on the Lamb Weston business either."

Now keep in mind average pricing is a function of shelf price or our list price, but it's also a function of our promoted volume price. And we've actually been active on both fronts. I think with respect to merchandising and the $100 million efficiency that we've talked about within trade, sometimes, what I read is -- and it sounds as if that's coming across as if it's just a cut, as if we're ripping trade out. Nothing could be farther from the truth. We spend a lot of money on trade. We've identified $100 million in trade spend that we don't think does much to help us or our retailers. So when we talk to our customers about being more efficient and impactful with that trade, they're as interested in that as we are because it helps drive quality sales, it helps drive margins, et cetera. And then separately, I'd say our customers also value quality volume as much as we do. They understand that inefficiency isn't helping anybody. So if we can redeploy inefficiency into brand-building innovation or even more effective merchandising, everybody wins. So think of the payoff as better margins and stronger brands versus cutting merchandising. Then when it comes to shelf price, there are 3 pillars to our pricing actions. Number one is what we call inflation-justified list price increases, meaning if we got inflation, we feel totally justified in taking a list price increase, and that's what we'll do. The second piece of pricing is the trade efficiency we just talked about, which, in large part, means reduced reliance on deep discount merchandising and redeployment of those funds toward more effective, more efficient activities. And then the third price -- third piece of our pricing strategy is higher quality-driven pricing, meaning we improve the food we're selling and we charge more for it. And in any given quarter, we're likely to have a mix of all 3 of these things, but the ratios could change within each quarter. So that is the strategy the we're pursuing. Our customers are aligned with us on it. They're supportive on it. They believe, as we believe, it's ultimately going to lead to better sales, better profit and a higher-quality volume base."

I mean, if it's 90% of the volume hit, the elasticity, by going over $1, must have been really, really significant. And I understand why you're doing it, but I guess my question is, as you kind of move through the rest of the portfolio, do you -- should we expect similar levels of elasticity as you try to make your promotion more efficient? Or is it a function of, as you improve the product, eventually getting the consumer to recognize that? Because it just seemed like a very big drop on one brand."

I think Banquet is quite a bit different from our other brands, and I'm going to have Tom kind of share some of our detailed thinking on this business. But the impact you see on Banquet is -- again, you come back to the notion that there are 2 things we're dealing with here. One is shelf price, which is kind of baseline volume. The other is promotion strategy, and that's promoted volume. We've actually made a meaningful difference, a meaningful change on both. And part of what you're seeing is how aggressive we were in the year-ago period in promoted activity and the choice not to do that. For example, events that might sell at $0.80 instead of $1. As you might imagine, that drove some pretty significant spikes in the year-ago period. And when you don't repeat that, obviously, you're not selling unprofitable volume, but you're going to see it show up on the promoted volume side of the volume ledger. At the same time, we also have shelf price increases, which shows up as a baseline elasticity factor. So when you get both, it kind of compounds, and that's a bit of what you saw on the results. But again, that was entirely planned. We knew what we'd expect there, and we've got to migrate to a higher-quality consumer base here over time because there were clearly plenty of consumers in that exact window a year ago who were in our franchise for one reason and one reason only. And that's because we basically don't give away pricing -- or give away merchandising, and that's effectively what you saw. Tom, did I miss anything there?"

Over the past, I don't know, let's say, 3 or 4 months that you've done this, especially on Banquet, do you think there is realistically more upside to the $100 million that you've given us, and therefore, there are more red circles?

If we can find any inefficiency, we're going to try to get it out, whether it's SG&A, whether it's trade. Now today, I can tell you we are squarely focused on hitting that $300 million. We're on track. We feel good about the progress we're making, and we want to make sure we don't get any slippage in that before we start getting stars in our eyes around going beyond that. But I think philosophically and culturally, we don't view cost efficiency as a project. We view it as a way of life because it provides us fuel for investment and innovation, and it just helps us culturally to be more performance-oriented. So we're going to continue to be relentless in that. Certainly, on trade, it's actually great to see the teams do it. Our teams get together as customer teams. They plan these events using significantly improved technology, post-event analytics tools, better systems. And we go through, literarily, event by event, hundreds, if not thousands, of events. We know what they've done in the past. Now we've got visibility to it. We know what we want to get rid of. We know what we want to change. We know what we want to add. Now we do that by customer, and it's making a meaningful difference. And we're going to continue to work it. So if there's more there, we'll get it.

Obviously, we've taken price on Banquet, as Sean said, that impacted both base and promoted. When you take out Banquet and look at the rest of our portfolio, our non-promoted base sales were essentially flat. So we're going through a period, not just ourselves in terms of looking at trade productivity, investing it in the right return activities. But the customer environment is also changing, and there's a move for less promotional activity from some customers. I think inherent in what we're driving against is selling more off-the-shelf and relying less from push activities. So I think that's some of the noise that you see in the most recent results, certainly, ours. But I think more broadly, some of this is being driven by changes in customer strategies as well."

As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered another positive quarter as results exceeded our expectations with comparable EPS of $0.68, up from $0.59 in the prior year.
Yesterday was my 1-year anniversary as Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods, and I can tell you I am pleased with what we are accomplishing. Clearly, it's been an active year as we've methodically taken the necessary steps to help ConAgra start to unlock the value opportunity that I saw so clearly when I first started thinking about taking this job. Simply put, we are driving focus and discipline into the company, and the impact can be seen not only in our P&L but also in our culture, where our team is energized, optimistic and determined about the path ahead. And while we're pleased with our progress over the past year, we're also clear-eyed that there is much more to do. Accordingly, our team remains hard at work on executing our plans to build a stronger, more consistent and more valuable ConAgra Foods.
Before John and I get into the details of our Q3 results, I want to take a step back and provide you with my perspective on where we are relative to our strategic plans. In February, we completed the sale of our private label operations to TreeHouse Foods, marking the conclusion of a robust sale process. The sale enables us to sharpen our focus on our consumer and commercial businesses, and it provides us with meaningful capital. We've already deployed $2.15 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt, and going forward, as part of a balanced capital allocation program, we plan to pursue further debt reduction. As we've discussed previously, the sale also provided a sizable tax benefit, which can be used in the future. 
In addition to completing the sale of our private label operations, we've been hard at work at strengthening the foundation of our 2 businesses. We're executing our $300 million efficiency plan, primarily within consumer, to build ConAgra into a lean, more focused company. We are confident this effort will improve profitability, advance our growth agenda and unlock shareholder value.
As we've said previously, we expect to realize the majority of our efficiency improvements in fiscal 2017 and 2018. We also remain on track to bring our consumer and corporate leadership teams together under one roof at our new headquarters in Chicago this summer. I'm excited about our plans to develop a more open physical space that will facilitate collaboration and accelerate our shift to a leaner, more-nimble innovative and performance-oriented culture.
Finally, we remain on track to complete the separation of ConAgra into 2 public companies in the fall of calendar 2016. As we said when we announced the proposed spinoff, our goal is to enable both Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston to operate as vibrant pure-play companies with enhanced strategic focus and flexibility.
I'll talk more in a moment about the progress we're making in each of these businesses, but let me reiterate that when you take all factors into consideration, we believe the separation of Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston is the right path to maximize value as we expect shareholders to benefit from better operating performance and more consistency from both businesses following the separation.
As you know, there's a lot of work to complete between the announcement of a proposed spin and the separation itself. We're hard at work on that front, and we will have a lot of more information to share via SEC filings and Investor Days over time. Ultimately, our ability to drive value across these businesses is a function of how well we execute. To that end, our solid Q3 results exceeded our expectations and give me confidence that we're identifying the right actions to drive improved profitability.
So on to Q3 in detail. Our Q3 results for the Consumer Foods segment reflect continued progress and momentum around establishing a higher-quality, investment-grade volume base. Even though we experienced a volume decline, we had strong price mix during the quarter. We've been implementing initiatives to improve pricing discipline and trade efficiency while driving renovation and targeted brand investment. Importantly, as we undertake these actions, we remain relentlessly focused on execution.
We're making good progress on all these fronts. From a top line perspective, we saw volume declines where we expected them. The vast majority of the Q3 consumer volume decline was on Banquet, 90% to be exact. But more broadly, in the second half of last fiscal year, we funded several major deep discount promotions, particularly in our frozen business. These kinds of deals can drive big spikes in low-margin promoted volume. And given our deliberate plan to reduce our reliance on deep discount promotions and given the promoted volume spikes embedded in our year-ago comps, we expected lower promoted volume. What we were counting on, though, was solid performance on most base consumption trends and strong margin expansion broadly, and that is basically what we got. You see the entire segment's margin expansion in the release, but it's important to note that on Banquet, we saw over 200 basis points of gross margin expansion despite investments in higher quality. Further, we also made other below-the-line investments to build the brand the right way for the long haul, namely A&P support. These collective investments do not have the same immediate impact of promoted price points below $1, but they represent the right way to manage a branded asset for long-term value creation.
This notion has been missing for too long at ConAgra. We will be relentless as we continue these efforts because, at the end of the day, we want sustainably stronger margins, which requires strong brands, and strong brands don't compete on the back of giveaway deals.
As a result of our efforts, on a comparable basis, operating profit was $340 million, up about 17%. Operating margins were up more than 300 basis points from the year-ago period, driven by these 3 factors: price/mix, supply chain productivity and modest material deflation.
Our focus in Consumer Foods will continue to be on expanding margins. The cornerstone of this effort is strengthening the brands that generate the best return. By focusing on our strongest brands, we are getting better price realization and trade efficiencies.
As you've heard us discuss before, our approach provides the fuel to reinvest in brands that have the right fundamentals, are consumer relevant and have accretive margins. And we're not just talking about investment. During the third quarter, we supported our brands in a highly disciplined way as evidenced by our 12% increase in A&P support. We've increased A&P spending 13% year-to-date.
We've been investing in brands with clear differentiators and relevant consumer benefits like Marie Callender's, Hunt's, Ro*Tel, Reddi-wip, Slim Jim and PAM. I'll talk in a moment about our efforts in the frozen category, but in the center of the store, we continue to make good progress with our real food initiative around the Hunt's brand, and we're very pleased with progress we're making with Ro*Tel, which delivered very strong results during the Super Bowl. In addition, through focused execution, we increased sales, built share and won the holiday season across Marie Callender's pies, Reddi-wip and PAM.
Our investments are also coming in the form of innovation and renovation. As you've heard me discuss, we intend to continue enhancing our portfolio with the focus on further premiumization, wellness and authenticity. We expect to achieve this through a combination of organic innovation and smart acquisitions.
A great example of our investment in innovation comes from our Healthy Choice Simply Steamers line, which you've heard us discuss previously. This is a clean-label, nothing-artificial version of our Café Steamers offering, and we're continuing to drive wellness-based innovation with this line. In the fourth quarter, we're adding 4 new premium varieties, including 3-cheese tortellini, a sweet and spicy Asian-style noodle bowl, creamy spinach and tomato linguine, and an unwrapped burrito bowl. Consistent with the consumer focus on authenticity, these new recipes will spotlight organic, non-GMO ingredients.
Renovation will also be a driver of margin expansion. Building on an example we touched upon last quarter, our work to restage the Banquet franchise continues. As I noted earlier, Banquet represented the vast majority of our volume decline in the third quarter as we reduced our reliance on deep discount promotion and raised our everyday shelf price above $1. While we recognize it will take time to rebuild the buying rate among households that are long accustomed to $1 Banquet, we are confident that the higher price points enable us to invest in product enhancements and higher-quality A&P that reeducates consumers about the brand. Not all consumers will transition with the brand, and we're okay with that. But given the higher quality, we expect to attract new consumers to the franchise in time. We continue to believe our plan for Banquet is the right one for its long-term brand health and financial strength.
And this highly disciplined approach to margin expansion is one we plan to methodically apply to other brands with similar opportunities. Another prime restaging candidate is Bertolli, which we see as right for the same type of targeted investment. With Bertolli, we are stepping up our work to renovate our frozen skillet business and make the brand even more relevant to today's shoppers. We're expanding occasions through the addition of family-size skillets within our lineup, and looking ahead, we are embarking on major renovation investments in the Bertolli brand to upgrade proteins, such as all-natural chicken and dramatically simplified ingredient labels. As we continue to renovate around the brand, we will support the product upgrades with increased marketing spend to drive profitable growth.
As I've said many times, unlocking the full value potential of our branded portfolio will be a process, not a flip of the switch. But it is a battle-tested process, and it will succeed. It all starts with the unwavering belief that strong margins are the key to maximizing value, and that strong margins are the byproduct of executional excellence across disciplines, spanning everything from supply chain productivity to pricing and trade analytics to mix management and targeted high-ROI marketing to exciting innovation.
Make no mistake about it. ConAgra is becoming much stronger in each of these disciplines, and you are seeing the impact in our margin expansion. Over time, as we wean ourselves off of our historical overreliance on deep discount trade deals and rebuild our innovation pipeline supported by more effective marketing, you will see sales grow but in a much higher-quality fashion.
We are confident that there is a lot of room for progress, and we are relentlessly focused on continuing to execute against our goals. It is about the delta, meaning the change we can drive, as opposed to a snapshot assessment.
Overall, I'm very encouraged by the work going on in Consumer Foods. Investment creates a virtuous cycle. Over time, stronger brands will lead to better pricing power and higher margins, and we are clearly on the right path to maximizing value.
Now turning to Commercial Foods. Net sales were approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 6% compared to the prior year. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit was $175 million, up 21% on a comparable basis. While the Commercial Foods segment posted strong results across the board, Lamb Weston was particularly strong. Sales for Lamb Weston's potato operations grew across North America during the quarter as well as in international markets. International sales performance for Lamb Weston was noticeably strong, reflecting the lapping of the impact of the West Coast port labor dispute in the year-ago period as well as improving demand in key Asian markets. As we've indicated before, Lamb Weston remains well positioned to capitalize on the significant international growth opportunities created by the aggressive emerging market expansion of major quick-service restaurant chains.
In our Lamb Weston North America business, we continue to see positive growth momentum across many of our key customers in the quick-serve restaurant and operator-distributor channels. We have industry-leading innovation and customer service, and our breadth of diversified products continues to position this business as a clear market leader in North America.
Now before I turn it over to John, I want to take a moment to acknowledge our talented team as we work to transform ConAgra into a stronger, more consistent company with a more valuable future. While there has been significant change during the past year, our people are energized and focused on serving our customers, and I am excited about the path forward. Over to you, John."

In my comments this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our fiscal third quarter performance, including discontinued operations; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sh",1520,"Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. In my comments this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our fiscal third quarter performance, including discontinued operations; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year.
I'll start with some comments on our performance for our fiscal third quarter. Overall, diluted EPS from continuing operations, as reported, was $0.41. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, diluted EPS for the fiscal third quarter, including discontinued operations, was $0.68, which is ahead of our expectations and compares favorably to our prior year quarter's comparable earnings per share of $0.59. Both our Consumer Foods and our Commercial Foods segments performed very well.
In our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.9 billion for the quarter, down about 2% from the year-ago period. This reflects a 4% decline in volume and a negative 1% impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by a 3% improvement in price/mix.
Segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $339 million or up about 17% from the year-ago period. Operating margin on a comparable basis expanded about 300 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. Margin expansion reflects pricing discipline, mix management, supply chain efficiencies and favorable input costs, offset by higher marketing and incentive costs. Foreign exchange for this quarter had negative impacts of $28 million on net sales and about $12 million on operating profit.
On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $91 million, up about 12% from the prior year quarter, reflecting our efforts to continue to strengthen and support our brands.
In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion, up about 6% from the prior year quarter. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit was $175 million or 21% above last year's third quarter operating profit. The operating results largely reflect a strong profit increase in our Lamb Weston business, driven by strong volume performance, both domestically and internationally; margin expansion; and the benefit of lapping the West Coast port labor dispute in the year-ago quarter.
Equity method investment earnings, excluding the impact -- excluding items impacting comparability, were $27 million for the quarter and $33 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture, principally driven by unfavorable weak market conditions, which, from time to time, can impact margins.
Moving on to corporate expenses. For the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $155 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $73 million versus $52 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase principally relates to higher incentives, reflecting the significant improvement in operating performance this year and the timing of the related incentive accruals year-over-year.
On our SG&A cost-savings initiatives, we are making good progress and expect to see significant benefits over the next couple of years. I would note that our fiscal third quarter results from continuing operations reflect some initial benefits from our cost savings programs partially offset by modest stranded costs from our private label divestiture.
Further, I would highlight 2 other points related to our cost savings initiatives. First, the benefits of our previously announced cost-savings programs are concentrated in the consumer business. And second, we have developed aggressive targets and plans so that we can offset modest stranded costs as they arrive -- as they arise as well as selectively invest back into the business to build capabilities that will expand operating margins over time.
Discontinued operations posted EPS of $0.05 per diluted share this quarter. It reflects operations of the private label business through February 1, 2016, or about 9 weeks of the fiscal quarter. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, the private label discontinued operations earned $0.11 per share this quarter, including about $0.05 per share of benefit related to the elimination of depreciation and amortization expense. Expected comparable earnings from the private label operations were included in our earlier guidance for the quarter.
Also at this time, we estimate that the divestiture of the private label operations gave rise to a capital loss of approximately $4.2 billion pretax or $1.6 billion after tax, which can be utilized over the next 5 years. We remain confident that the company will be able to realize significant tax benefits in the future as we work to reshape our portfolio in a disciplined manner.
On comparability items, this quarter included 4 items: first, approximately $0.16 per share of net expense related to restructuring charges; second, approximately $0.04 per share of net expense related to transaction costs incurred in connection with debt reduction this quarter; third, approximately $0.03 per share of income related to a pension settlement gain at a joint venture; and finally, we included in comparable earnings approximately $0.11 per share of income related to items in discontinued operations, for which we have provided additional details in our Regulation G disclosures in the release.
On cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, we ended the quarter with $503 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total operating cash flows through the fiscal third quarter were approximately $695 million versus $740 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is principally driven by higher tax payments in the current fiscal year. As a reminder, due to the seasonality in our business and our normal inventory cycle, we typically generate a significant portion of our annual operating cash flows in the latter part of the fiscal year. We remain confident in our ability to generate attractive operating cash flows over the balance of this fiscal year and expect total operating cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations to be in the range of $1.2 billion for the year.
On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $100 million versus $83 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $77 million in the fiscal third quarter versus $80 million in the year-ago quarter. And dividends for this fiscal quarter were $109 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter.
On capital allocation, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments. As we've previously noted, we completed the divestiture of our private label operations this quarter. We received proceeds in excess of $2.6 billion and deployed about $2.15 billion to repay long-term debt. We expect to deploy the majority of the remaining proceeds for debt repayment over the next several months.
During the fiscal third quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, and we have approximately $132 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.
Now I'd like to provide a few comments on the balance of fiscal 2016. Given that we have sold the private label operations, we are now citing guidance in terms of earnings per share from continuing operations. We have given you the quarterly and annual details of EPS from continuing operations for this fiscal year and last fiscal year in our Regulation G tables and in our written Q&A document. 
For the full fiscal year 2016, we expect EPS from continuing operations, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.07. This compares with $1.93 for fiscal year 2015 on that same basis. So far in fiscal 2016, we have earned $1.56 from continuing operations after adjusting for items affecting -- comparability items.
To reach our full year guidance, we are expecting fiscal fourth quarter comparable EPS to be in the range of $0.50. This guidance reflects continued strong fundamentals in our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments. This guidance is lower than the prior year comparable amount of $0.55, and the decrease is due mainly to the extra week in the prior year, the impact of FX, higher marketing investments and higher incentives this year.
I'll offer that the guidance for fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations should not be taken as a beginning point on which to make fiscal 2017 estimates for either Conagra Brands or Lamb Weston as there are several details that we need to finalize, including capital allocation and financial policies, the phasing of our SG&A savings and trade efficiency benefits, brand investment targets as well as the short-term impacts of any stranded cost associated with the Lamb Weston spinoff. We will offer details on those items in due course at the Investor Day events we plan to hold ahead of the spin.
In closing, while we are working through a great deal of change, we are pleased with our performance so far this fiscal year in strengthening margins across our businesses and in managing the significant changes in cost structure and portfolio that we believe will drive value creation over time.
That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I along with Tom McGough and Tom Werner will be happy to take your questions. 
Before we turn it over for questions, Chris would like to share a few remarks. Chris?"

Along those lines, I am not relocating to Chicago. I'll be transitioning out of ConAgra Foods over the next few months, but I will still be your point of contact until we have all of the IR resources in place for the new organization. I've worked with many of you for more than 1.5 decades and gotten to know several of you well. And while my more than 16 years of ConAgra Foods have had me in the mix of plenty of the company's ups and downs, it's been very satisfying to play a part in helping advance the company's mission. Looking back on all of it, I tremendously value the relationships that have come with the job, and I'm thankful for the personal growth opportunities that have come with serving more than 16 years in this capacity.

Two quick questions from me. I think, first, Sean, at Hillshire, you had focused much of your effort on really raising what you would call the centerline profitability of the business as input cost moves can play with margins in any given period of time.

We absolutely cannot discount the benefit of increased discipline across the margin expansion leverage that we talked about earlier, things like pricing, trade, productivity, mix, stronger brands. We do expect the centerline of our profitability to go north over time. We also expect that the standard deviation around that centerline will decrease over time. And you're absolutely right. In any given quarter, margins could be impacted by short-term inflation or deflation. And what I would say is you won't see us get overly exercised by that because we'll stay focused on what's right for the long haul. But yes, there's some benefit in there from the absence of deflation, but our work is not done. We see further opportunity, and that's where we're going to be relentless in pursuing."

So one thing I would remind folks is that, especially in our Consumer Foods business last year in the fourth quarter, we put through a pretty strong quarter. So we're lapping a stronger quarter, relatively speaking. The other thing is we do have some seasonality in our business in terms of the mix of products we sell in our consumer business, which impacts the margin. So when you look at sequential margins from third quarter to fourth quarter, you should expect to see the seasonality mix impact come down some. And I think we're still looking at some margin expansion year-over-year in the fourth quarter, so I don't think the trends are reversing or significantly flattening out. I really view it as, again, a number of these mechanical issues, in particular the 53rd week, some FX, the higher incentives, and then we're going to continue to have some higher marketing investment. So that's kind of how we see it right now. And again, I don't think we see any significant break in the trend on the Lamb Weston business either."

Now keep in mind average pricing is a function of shelf price or our list price, but it's also a function of our promoted volume price. And we've actually been active on both fronts. I think with respect to merchandising and the $100 million efficiency that we talked about within trade, sometimes, what I read is it sounds as if that's coming across as if it's just a cut, as if we're ripping trade out. Nothing could be farther from the truth. We spend a lot of money on trade. We've identified $100 million in trade spend that we don't think does much to help us or our retailers. So when we talk to our customers about being more efficient and impactful with that trade, they're as interested in that as we are because it helps drive quality sales; it helps drive margins, et cetera. And then separately, I'd say our customers also value quality volume as much as we do. They understand that inefficiency isn't helping anybody. So if we can redeploy inefficiency into brand-building innovation or even more effective merchandising, everybody wins. So think of the payoff as better margins and stronger brands versus cutting merchandising. Then when it comes to shelf price, there are 3 pillars to our pricing actions. Number one is what we call inflation-justified list price increases, meaning if we got inflation, we feel totally justified in taking a list price increase, and that's what we'll do. The second piece of pricing is the trade efficiency we just talked about, which in large part, means reduced reliance on deep discount merchandising and redeployment of those funds toward more effective, more efficient activities. And then the third price -- third piece of our pricing strategy is higher quality-driven pricing, meaning we improve the food we're selling and we charge more for it. And in any given quarter, we're likely to have a mix of all 3 of these things, but the ratios could change within each quarter. So that is the strategy that we're pursuing. Our customers are aligned with us on it. They're supportive on it. They believe, as we believe, it's ultimately going to lead to better sales, better profit and a higher-quality volume base."

I think Banquet is quite a bit different from our other brands, and I'm going to have Tom kind of share some of our detailed thinking on this business. But the impact you see on Banquet is -- again, you come back to the notion that there are 2 things we're dealing with here. One is shelf price, which is kind of baseline volume. The other is promotion strategy, and that's promoted volume. We've actually made a meaningful difference -- a meaningful change on both. And part of what you're seeing is how aggressive we were in the year-ago period in promoted activity and the choice not to do that. For example, events that might sell at $0.80 instead of $1. As you might imagine, that drove some pretty significant spikes in the year-ago period. And when you don't repeat that, obviously, you're not selling unprofitable volume, but you're going to see it show up on the promoted volume side of the volume ledger. At the same time, we also have shelf price increases, which shows up as a baseline elasticity factor. So when you get both, it kind of compounds, and that's a bit of what you saw on the result. But again, that was entirely planned. We knew what we'd expect there, and we've got to migrate to a higher-quality consumer base here over time because there were clearly plenty of consumers in that exact window a year ago who were in our franchise for one reason and one reason only. And that's because we were basically doing giveaway pricing -- or giveaway merchandising, and that's effectively what you saw. Tom, did I miss anything there?"

Very simplistically, Sean, I'm just curious. You mentioned the red circles. You draw a red circle around areas where you think you can gain efficiency, and then you either redeploy back for higher ROI on those given brands. Over the past, I don't know, let's say, 3 or 4 months as you've done this, especially on Banquet, do you think there is realistically more upside for the $100 million that you've given us, and therefore, there are more red circles? Or is it more of an opportunity to drop some of that to the bottom line?"

And I think my answer before, which will remain intact today, is we're always going to look for more. If we can find any inefficiency, we're going to try to get it out, whether it's SG&A, whether it's trade. Now today, I can tell you we are squarely focused on hitting that $300 million. We're on track. We feel good about the progress we're making, and we want to make sure we don't get any slippage in that before we start getting stars in our eyes around going beyond that. But I think philosophically and culturally, we don't view cost efficiency as a project. We view it as a way of life because it provides us fuel for investment and innovation, and it just helps us culturally to be more performance-oriented. So we're going to continue to be relentless in that. Certainly, on trade, it's actually great to see the teams do it. Our teams get together as customer teams. They plan these events using significantly improved technology, post-event analytics tools, better systems. And we go through, literarily, event by event, hundreds if not thousands of events. We know what they've done in the past now. We've got visibility to it. We know what we want to get rid of. We know what we want to change. We know what we want to add. Now we do that by customer, and it's making a meaningful difference. And we're going to continue to work it. So if there's more there, we'll get it. We're not ready to speculate on that right now, but philosophically, that's our view."

And then the second question, just around -- we've had some very weak IRI Nielsen data. There was a question on this earlier. I guess I'm trying to understand, when I even look at some categories that I regard as sort of focus categories for ConAgra, we are seeing the recent decline in those categories accelerate. And is it a matter of increased spending or maybe getting -- taking some of the trade promotion savings and reinvest those back in the business?

Obviously, we've taken price on Banquet, as Sean said, that impacted both base and promoted. When you take out Banquet and look at the rest of our portfolio, our nonpromoted base sales were essentially flat. So we're going through a period, not just our sales in terms of looking at trade productivity, investing it in the right return activities. But the customer environment is also changing, and there's a move for less promotional activity from some customers. I think inherent in what we're driving against is selling more off-the-shelf and relying less from push activities. So I think that's some of the noise that you see in the most recent results, certainly, ours. But I think more broadly, some of this is being driven by changes in customer strategies as well."

So I think it's a reasonable assumption that as we take pieces of the business out and sell off EBITDA or spin them off, that we'll have some additional debt reduction.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016 earnings.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016 earnings. I am please with our results, which reflect the progress we are making as we continued to execute our strategy to drive focus and discipline across the company. 
Diluted comparable EPS for fiscal 2016 was $2.08 compared with $1.93 in fiscal 2015, which included an extra week. For the fourth quarter, we delivered comparable EPS of $0.52, slightly above our $0.50 guidance.
Before John and I get into details of our full year and Q4 results, I want to provide you with a bit of context and perspective on where we are as we continue to build the foundation to support Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston as separate, pure-play businesses following the spin planned for later this year.
It's been a very busy year, and I am please with the way the organization has embraced the changes needed to drive the value across ConAgra. We've not only implemented many of the structural changes necessary to create a more focused company, but we have materially evolved our culture adopting the discipline, focus and performance orientation we need to succeed going forward.
We began the year with an aggressive agenda and accomplished a tremendous amount. You've heard me discuss many of our accomplishments throughout the year, and we haven't let up. We have much more to do to fully optimize our business, which will take time, but we are committed to the challenge.
Consistent with our efforts to become a more focused company, over the last several weeks, we reached agreements to sell 2 terrific businesses that will be better served by more focused ownership, Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank. We will receive combined proceeds from these sales of approximately $480 million. These divestitures will sharpen our attention around our core product portfolio to drive sustainable growth, and the sales of Spicetec and JM Swank further position us to execute a smooth separation into 2 pure-play companies, Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston, in the coming months.
We expect to utilize the proceeds from the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures as part of our broader balance capital allocation plan, which includes debt reduction and attractive dividend, share repurchases and acquisitions. In addition to bringing more focus, the actions we took during the year enabled us to reduce our debt by approximately $2.5 billion, and our balance sheet is much stronger than it was just 12 months ago. 
Since we last spoke in Q3, we've also continued to build momentum around our $300 million efficiency plan and our efforts to transform ConAgra into a lean, agile and more focused company in order to improve profitability and unlock shareholder value. We recognize there's still more to do on this front, and we continue to expect to realize the majority of our efficiency improvements in fiscal 2017 and 2018.
As part of our transformation to a leaner and more nimble company, we are settling into our corporate headquarters in downtown Chicago. In fact, for the first, we are conducting this call from our new space. We moved in early this week, and we are excited to have the leadership team and our consumer business under 1 roof. It's a great new space, and our team is energized and the more open floor plan will foster and enhance collaboration and accelerate our shift to a more innovative and tightly connected culture, which will play a key role in driving performance and in creating value.
Our team also remains hard at work on the separation of ConAgra into 2 public pure-play companies. We expect to file the initial Form 10 by the middle of July, and we'll be hosting Investor Days for both companies in advance of the completion of the spin. We will be following up later this summer with more specifics regarding the dates, times and locations for those meetings.
Our teams are working diligently to prepare Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston for their lives as standalone public companies. We remain highly confident that this is the right path to maximize value for stakeholders, who will benefit from improved operating performance and consistency from both businesses.
With fiscal 2016 complete, the team is proud of our accomplishments on behalf of shareholders, and we now begin fiscal 2017 ready to build on our momentum. It will take time to truly optimize ConAgra, but this team has developed the refuse-to-lose attitude that I believe will enable our success.
So on to our segment performance. As you know, our focus in Consumer Foods is on unlocking the significant latent potential of the business by expanding margins, improving brand health and delivering more consistent performance. We have aggressively executed against that strategy during fiscal 2016 by allocating resources more efficiently through portfolio segmentation with a focus on building a higher-quality investment-grade volume base. At the same time, we are becoming more effective in pricing, mix management and trade promotion productivity and more efficient from a supply chain perspective. These advancements, coupled with favorable commodity input costs, provided us with fuel to grow profits, reinvesting the business and position our volume base for the long term. Clearly, we still have more to do to realize our full potential as a branded food company. That said, we made tremendous progress by igniting our operating performance this year. For the year, sales declined as we expected, consistent with our efforts to upgrade our volume base; take selective pricing actions, where justified; and improve our trade spend discipline.
As we said early in the year, the payoff was going to be in margins, not sales, and our results reflected our progress against that objective. Gross margins expanded, providing good fuel to reinvest in the business. For the full fiscal year, comparable operating margin grew to just under 17%, almost a 200 basis point improvement over last year; and comparable operating profit grew 7% to $1.2 billion, overall a strong performance by the team.
In addition, we made progress throughout the year as we invested behind A&P ready brands like Reddi-wip, Marie Callender's, PAM, Bertolli, Slim Jim and Hunt's. For the year, we increased A&P spending 12%, including 8% in Q4. Importantly, we have developed a much more rigorous and targeted approach to allocating these dollars against brands where we can drive the greatest margin impact.
Our results for the quarter mirrored our results for the full year, as we experienced a 5% decline in net sales after adjusting for the benefit of the extra week last year, principally driven by volume declines related to the actions we are taking on pricing and trade spend. In fact, virtually all of the volume decline was a result of banquet pricing associated with product upgrade and a broader portfolio decision to walk away from promoted volume that offered weak returns and conditioned the consumer to look for deep discounts. Once again, this was planned as we successfully expanded gross margins, allowing us to increase our brand investments, strengthen our -- and strengthen our non-promoted volume base.
Operating margins also increased during the quarter to slightly over 17%. Although comparable operating profit declined for the quarter to $290 million, this was a function of the extra week in the prior year FX and the volume impact of pricing and trade actions partially offset by lower SG&A. Expanding operating margin was our goal for the quarter, and our focus on price/mix and supply chain and SG&A productivity delivered results.
Our fiscal 2016 results are a testament to the fact that our strategy is working. Important are at the early stages of what we can achieve as a standalone business, and I am more encouraged than ever about the work that is happening in Consumer Foods and the significant opportunity ahead as we continue to accelerate our progress. As I've said before, discipline and investment create a virtuous cycle. Over time, stronger brands lead to better pricing power and higher margins, and we are clearly on the right path to maximizing value here. We look forward to sharing much more with you on Conagra Brands at the Investor Day this fall.
Now turning to Commercial Foods. For the year, net sales were approximately $4 billion, up slightly from the prior year. Operating profit was approximately $630 million, up nearly 12% from the prior year. Fourth quarter net sales were approximately $1 billion, down approximately 6% from the prior year due principally to the 53rd week in the year-ago period. Operating profit was $156 million, in line with the year-ago results.
We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business supported by food away from home trends in the U.S. as well as growing demand in emerging markets. 
Consistent with our plans to capitalize on these trends, we recently announced an important investment in our Richland, Washington facility to expand our domestic production capacity, which we also leverage for exports. We also announced an exciting investment in Russia by our Lamb Weston/Maier joint venture. These advancements will enhance our ability to support increasing consumer demand for value-added potato products and the steady growth in key emerging markets like Russia. Ultimately, we expect these investments will contribute to our ability to continue to grow our share and deliver strong top and bottom line results for shareholders.
More broadly, we continue to make good progress in preparing Lamb Weston to become a standalone business. We will be providing more details in the weeks to come.
Before I turn it over to John, as always, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the resilience and dedication of our talented team as we work to transform ConAgra into a stronger, more consistent company with a more valuable future. While fiscal 2016 was a year of significant change, we remain a work in progress. That said, I am more confident than ever as we look ahead, and I greatly appreciate the energy and focus on serving our customers that I see on display on a daily basis.
Over to you, John."
26893,342121774,1003657,"ConAgra Foods, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Conagra Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. In my comments this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our 2016 fiscal fourth quarter performance; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and some brief com",1913,"Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. In my comments this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our 2016 fiscal fourth quarter performance; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and some brief comments on our outlook for fiscal year 2017.
I'll start with some comments on our performance in our fiscal fourth quarter. Overall, we reported a loss of $0.07 per share from continuing operations compared with $0.54 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the prior year quarter. The decrease from prior year is principally driven by a substantial noncash charge related to the year-end remeasurement of pension amounts. I'll provide some additional comments on this pension charge when I discuss comparability items. 
After adjusting for this charge and other items impacting comparability, diluted EPS from continuing operations for the fiscal fourth quarter was $0.52, slightly better than we had planned and modestly below the $0.55 in the year-ago period.
As a reminder, the prior fiscal year and fourth quarter included an additional week, which added roughly $0.04 per share to the EPS base.
In our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.7 billion for the quarter, down about 12% from the year-ago period. We estimate that the extra week impacted Consumer Foods' sales and volume by approximately 7%. After adjusting for the benefit of the extra week in the prior year, net sales declined 5%, reflecting a 4% decline in volume, flat price mix and a negative 1% impact from foreign exchange.
Segment operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $290 [ph] million in the fourth quarter versus $324 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in comparable earnings reflects lower volumes, including the impact of the extra week in the year-ago quarter; and a negative FX impact of about 2%, partially offset by lower SG&A. 
For the fiscal fourth quarter, operating margins, adjusted for items impacting comparability, expanded modestly, driven by a slightly larger increase in gross margins. While the year-over-year comparable margin expansion slowed this quarter, we note that the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter delivered very strong margin expansion. And during that quarter, we began to see the impacts from our margin expansion efforts.
For the full year, operating margins, adjusted for items impacting comparability, expanded to over 180 basis points, reflecting pricing discipline, mix management, supply chain efficiencies and favorable input costs, offset by higher marketing and incentive costs.
On marketing, Consumer Foods' advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $64 million, up about 8% from the prior year quarter, reflecting our efforts to continue to strengthen and support our brands.
Foreign exchange this fiscal quarter had negative impacts of $15 million on net sales and about $7 million on operating profit.
In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion or about 6% below the prior year quarter, principally reflecting the impact of the extra week in the year-ago period. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $151 million versus $154 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflects the impact of the extra week in the prior year and higher incentives expense, partially offset by good sales and margin performance in our Lamb Weston business.
Equity method investment earnings were $31 million for the current quarter and $30 million in the year-ago period.
Moving on to corporate expenses. For the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $414 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $62 million, in line with the year-ago quarter, reflecting benefits from our cost savings efforts offset by higher incentives expense.
On our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making good progress, and we expect to realize the majority of our $200 million of SG&A cost savings over the next 2 years. Further, as I have previously noted, the benefit of our previously announced cost savings programs are concentrated in our Consumer business, and we have developed aggressive targets and plans so that we can both offset modest stranded costs as they arise and selectively invest back into the business to build capabilities that will expand operating margins over time.
Discontinued operations posted diluted EPS of $0.34 in the fourth quarter. Substantially all of the earnings relate to a $147 million tax benefit associated with the recognition of a portion of the capital loss carryforward asset resulting from the sale of the private label operations earlier this year. We expect to utilize the $147 million of capital loss asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to the recently announced divestitures of our Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business and our JM Swank business, which are expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
On comparability items, this quarter included several items as follows: First, we had approximately $0.49 per diluted share of net expense related to the year-end remeasurement of pension amount. This charge is related to the accounting change we made several years ago, whereby we elected to immediately recognize significant actuarial gains and losses in our P&L rather than amortize them over time. The noncash charge this year is driven by the drop in interest rates and therefore, our discount rate and some lower returns on investments over the short term. Importantly, we remain comfortable with our current funding levels. 
In addition to this item, we also had approximately $0.07 per diluted share of net expense related to an impairment charge for our Chef Boyardee brand, driven by our plans to improve the quality of the volume base, which we expect to result in lower net sales over the near term.
Next, we had approximately $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the previously announced planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. We also had approximately $0.03 per diluted share of net gain related to the mark-to-market impact of derivatives used to hedge input costs, temporarily classified in unallocated corporate expense.
And finally, we had several smaller items, including approximately $0.01 per diluted share of expense for recent developments and a legacy legal matter; approximately $0.01 per diluted share of benefit from selling certain assets within the Commercial Foods segment; approximately $0.01 per diluted share of expense for adjustments to prior year tax credits and about $0.01 of rounding [ph]. 
On cash flow capital and balance sheet items, we ended the quarter with $835 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Operating cash flows from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $1.05 billion versus $1.22 billion in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is driven principally by higher tax payments in the current fiscal year. 
On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $150 million versus $103 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $51 [ph] million in the fiscal fourth quarter versus $88 million in the year-ago quarter. And dividends for this fiscal quarter were $109 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter.
On capital allocation, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments.
For the year, we repaid approximately $2.5 billion of debt, mainly from the proceeds from the sale of the private label operations earlier this year. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, and we have approximately $132 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. 
Also the company recently announced agreements to sell its Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business and the JM Swank business, each of which is part of the Commercial Foods segment. The transactions are expected to generate combined proceeds of approximately $480 million, and both transactions are expected to close during the fiscal first quarter of 2017.
As previously noted, we plan to utilize approximately $147 million of our capital loss carryforwards to substantially eliminate taxes that would otherwise be payable in connection with these sales. Also the remaining capital loss of approximately $3.6 billion pretax or $1.4 billion after tax is available to offset capital gains over the next 5 years. We remain confident that the company will be able to realize significant tax benefit in the future as we work to reshape our portfolio in a disciplined manner. These proceeds are expected to be utilized as part of our broader balanced capital allocation plan.
Now I'd like to provide a few comments on our outlook for fiscal 2017. First of all, given the pending Lamb Weston spinoff, we are not in position today to provide EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. As we have noted, we believe our Investor Days will be the proper form to provide both fiscal 2017 and long-term guidance for both companies.
Further, on the timing of the spinoff, we are on schedule to complete the spin this fall. We expect to file a Form 10 over the next couple of weeks. And once we get further into the Form 10 process later this summer, we expect to be in a position to provide dates for our Investor Day.
For fiscal 2017, while we are not in a position to provide full year EPS guidance, I would note the following: For Q1 fiscal 2017, we expect EPS growth to be in the mid- to high teens from our earnings base of $0.41, driven by continued focus on margin management across both our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments, continued strong top line performance in our Commercial Foods segment, increased benefits from our cost savings programs and lower interest costs. We will also continue to invest in capabilities to strengthen and position our brands for stronger growth over the long term.
Overall, we expect the positive trends from our fiscal 2016 to continue into fiscal 2017. We look forward to building out our long-term expectations at our Investor Day, at which time, we can provide more details about portfolio segmentation and expectations for top line growth, margin expansion, capital allocation and financial policies, phasing of our SG&A and trade efficiency benefits, brand investment targets as well as the short-term impacts of any stranded costs associated with the planned Lamb Weston spinoff.
In closing, we are pleased with our fiscal 2016 performance and the changes we were able to execute to improve the long-term health of the company. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are confident that we're taking the right actions to drive attractive value creation over time.
That concludes our formal remarks. Before I turn it back over to Sean, I just wanted to briefly address my pending retirement. I am excited to begin the next phase of my life, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to allocate more time to my family and interests outside of business. I'm equally excited though about the future of this company. I've enjoyed seeing the new team come together under Sean's leadership, and I'm confident that the company is on the right track. It's been a privilege to work at ConAgra Foods for the past 14-plus years and to have served as its CFO for the last 7.5. Lastly, I will miss the relationships I've developed with many of you in the analyst and investor community over the years, and I appreciate your interest in the company and the insights and questions you've shared over the years.
Now let me turn it back over to Sean."

So I guess, I was a little surprised to see the price/mix in the quarter was flat despite the more significant volume decline in the quarter. So was there any specific reason, I guess, you're discreet this quarter that we didn't see more of that come through? And then in the forward-looking commentary for the first quarter, price/mix was one of the things listed that was expected to be a positive contributor. So maybe what's expected to drive that improvement sequentially versus what the pricing that did not come through in the fourth quarter?"

Let me just kind of set some background on price/mix. We think about pricing in terms of 3 components. The first is just inflation justified; the second driven by trade productivity; and the third, pricing in conjunction with brand and quality upgrades that we made. When you look at Q4, there are several things that are affecting price/mix in the quarter. Our pricing activities are focused on how do we increase our overall margin, which we did in the quarter. So in terms of inflation justified pricing, we're being more disciplined and timely in pricing for commodity changes both up and down. As you know, the vast majority of our brand are not in [indiscernible] categories, but there are a couple of categories that tend to be pass-through, and one of those is fresh meat. Any in Q4, we saw protein deflation that we pass through on brands like Hebrew National and [indiscernible] pride. So that was a deflationary. We built our overall margin. We continue to make progress on the second piece in terms of our trade productivity. We committed to $100 million of productivity savings. That's going to show itself up into additional gross margin, which we saw in the quarter. You see it in the measured results. We're making progress in lowering our percent on deal, and you'll continue to see the positive impacts of that going forward. And then finally, when we retake a brand like Banquet, which we talked about, we will increase our price with those product upgrades. In this quarter, we also launched a line of organic healthy choice steamers in premium pricing, so that was a positive contributor. So what you see overall is the impact of this pricing in market, higher average price, lower promoted volumes and importantly, a healthier more profitable non-promoted base. So over time, I think what you can expect is that our pricing and margins will move up while there maybe some quarter-on-quarter variations."

There's improvement and mix and then margin growth through renovation and innovation. So only the first really inflation-justified pricing is only 1 component of margin, and we did see some deflation of proteins. In light of that, we did see overall gross margins expand from the other components of our plan, predictably productivity, lower commodity. I think you see in market, our average price per unit is increasing. And our margins were up as a result of this holistic approach. Over time, our margins are going to grow. There's going to be quarter-on-quarter variations, but we're committed to continue to drive that holistic approach margin expansion."

The fact of the matter is our absolute margins in consumer continue to be in a significantly improved position versus where they've been historically, and that's because of the discipline that we are driving. And we're going to continue to drive that discipline here in the next couple of quarters because we've got a cleanse out of our base that we're not adding to value. So you're going to continue to see, as we've talked before, we want to see the centerline of our profitability move North over time. There may be some standard -- some variability around that quarter-to-quarter based on the dynamics of the quarter we're in, but our goal is to drive the centerline north over time and reduce the standard deviation around that centerline, and we continue to feel excellent about kind of the progress we're making in the path line."

As I clarified in my script, we look -- we're looking at that to be in the mid- to upper teens. I recognized that double digit's probably means anything from 10 to 99. So I think if you think in terms of mid- to upper teens, so that's probably the range that would help to tighten up that range. I think you asked a question about deflation in the quarter. I'd say it was fairly modest. I don't have the number off the top of my head, but commodities probably showed a little bit of favorability. Our conversion costs were probably up a little bit. As we look forward to FY '17, I would say we probably are looking at continued benign commodity markets as we sit here today. That probably means we may still have some modest inflation just because we're coming off such a low base of commodities. But overall, we feel pretty good about the commodity inputs for '17 as well as our -- we'll have some conversion cost inflation, which is not the majority of our COGS. But important thing is to the extent we have inflation or commodity moves, I think as Tom has indicated and Sean has certainly indicated, I think our muscles and our capabilities around pricing and expanding margins in the face of either increasing or decreasing margins is much better than it was even a few years ago. So I think the whole margin management capability and a holistic capability for us to manage margins higher as commodities move around is much stronger."

First of all, if you look at our overall story in consumer, as I've said many times, we've got to remember, this is a transformation we're undergoing here, not a flip of the switch. And in volume in particular, the bottom line is this. It is an undeniable fact that our past promotional practices have embedded in our volume base a group of consumers who were not brand loyal, we buy on hot deals and who contribute virtually nothing to our profitability. It's also true that by catering to them, we have underserved the bulk of our volume base, and these are consumers who would be willing to pay more for more contemporary higher-quality offerings. The good news here is that around this whole dynamic is that it's reversible if we are willing to stick to our principles around optimizing mix and also refreshing to targeted brands for a new day. No one said this was going to be easy, but it is absolutely the right way to manage a branded asset for value creation. We know from years of experience what the alternative gets us, and that's precisely why we do not get spooked when we see volumes pull back and margins expand. It's exactly what it we expect here. In fact, I think in Q4, the volume back off and consumer was in the ballpark of 3.7%, which frankly, in the scheme of what we're trying to do of purging some of these really bad deep discount promotional behaviors is frankly small in my mind. So that is a key point. The endgame here is obviously what we're all about, which is stronger brands, better innovation, better margins and ultimately stronger growth and shareholder returns. And recall in the last year, we recruited a new Chief Growth Officer to run our growth Center of Excellence, and he is quite busy and installing new work processes and raising our overall capability in this area. Looking forward to sharing some of these updates with you guys at Investor Day. But overall, I am quite optimistic around the growth Center of Excellence in partnership with our brands we'll be able to accomplish in this portfolio. In the meantime, we will absolutely let some of these non-investment grade volume go, and we'll happily take the associated margin expansion."

I'll turn it over to Tom to give you some specific comments on that. But ConAgra historically has probably been the least disciplined company in our space with respect to taking pricing when it's justified, but also we've probably been the most over reliant in terms of deep discount trade and we clearly need to undo that. But what I find interesting is you really see that in the scanner data right now. If you look at the percent of our total volume base sold on deal passed 52 weeks, past 26, past 12 and past 4, you see sequential reduction in percent of our volume sold on deal to the point where we've gone from being one of the most over promoted companies in our space to one of the leaders. And obviously, as we do that, we're going to see some volume impact. We're going to see some efficiency, but we're also going to have to reinvest behind the brand in other ways, which is what we've done this year as you look at our A&P spend and increased year-on-year. But with respect to $100 million program that you're talking about, like the SG&A program, it will build sequentially across '16, '17 and '18, and a big part of that is because we are getting our sea legs. We're going from being fairly rough around the edges, so to speak, in terms of our capabilities here too much more system base, too much more analytical and once you develop the database on what's working, what's not it's a virtuous cycle, you improve on it. So small amount of improvement this past year ramping up this year and continuing to ramp-up through '18. Did I miss anything there, Tom?"

First of all, we will go deep on that with our investors in Investor Day, and we'll have Darren [indiscernible] literally walk through kind of how we went about the process because if you look at our branded portfolio, we have roughly 50 brands. And unlike kind of the old days, we're not going to take a first force to the trough approach to resource around here on those 50 brands. We will be very disciplined around the role of each of those brands play in creating value. The simplest way to think about it is, first, we look at where do we compet in categories that are fundamentally healthy and growing? And within those categories, do we have brands that are proven and strong competitors? If you see those markers, those are obviously places, especially assuming if you've got a good margin structure where you're going to get a good return on A&P investment. So those becomes priorities in terms of renovating the brand, innovating the brand and supporting the brand. In other cases, we find we've got categories where perhaps the format has changed and it has shifted, but we still have perhaps leading -- the leading trademark with respect to product that we haven't moved into adjacencies or uptdated formats with the category. That's a simple kind of innovation opportunity, and that is existing because frankly we were just not minding the shot. There are other businesses where we have historically invested in innovation and growth, but that shouldn't be the role of those businesses. Those businesses are major cash contributors. They're in mature categories. They have excellent margin and cash flow, and we need to manage them for that because if we do that, that will provide fuel to really unlock all of the potential in higher growth categories. And then as we look at the portfolio, there may be 1 or 2 things that we say, ""Geez, we don't necessarily love the category. We don't necessarily have the answer in terms of what to do with these businesses, may be it's more valuable in some deals and it does."" And if we find those, we've got these capital loss carryforward. That's an asset that we've got here for roughly the next 5 years. So it will be a holistic approach to improving the businesses we have, optimizing the mix within our portfolio. And also if we see something at the outside that will be complementary to our portfolio, enable us to refresh our portfolio, especially in the areas of premium, gourmet, organic, natural, that could be a get enhancement and additional portfolio. We did Blake's last year. That was a small 1, but it's the right kind of stuff to really round out our portfolio and capitalize on our manufacturing assets and capabilities."

We anticipate that we would lose some of those households. While we are beginning to seem to date areas that the product quality upgrades are beginning to improve our repeat.

Yes, innovation obviously is going to be a centerpiece of what our new growth Center of Excellence is focused on and partnering with Tom's team on. And as you think about ConAgra with respect to innovation, I think you should anticipate that we will run the gamut from necessary renovation and even some of the stuff we've done this past year, where we've updated the packages designs for the first time literally since the 80s. That's basic renovation stuff. It's not going to set the world on fire, but it is critically important to% our brands in a way that they look like they're from the modern era. But then we also, while working on bolder innovations, we, as an example, last year, we took conducted a test market of a new product called Wicked Kitchen in the Southeast, and we learned the tremendous amount. There were some really exciting things there, so the innovation team has been working on refreshing Wicked Kitchen. And we'll kind of show the market what that's going to look like when we do our Investor Day along with some other things. In terms of the kinds of benefits that you should anticipate we'll bring, well it will be across the board. It will be in line with consumer trends whether it's global flavor adventure, convenience, things like that. But in general, where we under indexing our portfolio the most is in -- really in, as I've talked about, the premium gourmet and then the natural organic. And by not really tapping into those consumers, we are missing incremental sales and profit opportunities. Number  one, they tend to be higher dollar rent. Number two, they are to incremental to a lot of businesses we already have in terms of benefit. And number three, in most cases, we use our existing asset base so it's very economically efficient. So we've got a full suite of things, and we will -- we'll kind of share a lot of this with you in the months and quarters ahead. One of the reasons we've been incredibly focused and aggressive on costs is because frankly, it takes longer to rebuild your insight pipeline and rebuild your innovation pipeline. So we've kind of jumped all over costs. We moved aggressively knowing that it takes sometime to get the branded side of the innovation pipeline rebuilt, but that work has been behind the scenes aggressively underway and we've got some really exciting stuff coming. You saw some of it early stuff this past year with things like Healthy Choice Simply, which is a clean label line there that's done really well for us and some other things.

When you talk about trade efficiency with customers, I may have mentioned this on the last call and I think I used the phrase, you have to have a good bedside manner because you have to be very explicit around what we're talking about and what we are not talking about. When you walk into a buyer's desk and you say I'm ripping out trade and taking it to my bottom line, as you might imagine, that is not the most desirable bedside manner and it doesn't go really well. And that is not the conversation we are having. It is we can think of it in terms of $100 million in EBIT improvement. And certainly, there maybe some trade deals that are just so stupid and inefficient we just eliminate them lock, stock and barrel. However, in other cases because of the advanced analytics that we're investing in, what we're doing most of our customers is saying, well, here are some case studies of where we spend chunks of money with you. Let's look at the empirical evidence together. It's clearly generating a nonexistent or an emic return. Alternatively, here are some things that we can do that can generate a positive return and drive your top line and drive your bottom line. And when we are databased and can bring in the evidence that around the deals that aren't working and also the evidence of the deals that are working and say we're doing less of the former and more of the latter, we find we have a very engaged customer. Because at the end of the day, as tough as growth has been in this industry for manufacturers, it's been the same way for retailers, everybody's looking for profitable growth. And if we can bring intellectual capital to the table that can help, not only our situation but our customers P&L, that's a conversation that's well received."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016 earnings.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016 earnings. I am pleased with our results, which reflect the progress we are making as we continue to execute our strategy to drive focus and discipline across the company. 
Diluted comparable EPS for fiscal 2016 was $2.08 compared with $1.93 in fiscal 2015, which included an extra week. For the fourth quarter, we delivered comparable EPS of $0.52, slightly above our $0.50 guidance.
Before John and I get into details of our full year and Q4 results, I want to provide you with a bit of context and perspective on where we are as we continue to build the foundation to support Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston as separate pure-play businesses following the spin planned for later this year.
It's been a very busy year, and I am pleased with the way the organization has embraced the changes needed to drive value across ConAgra. We have not only implemented many of the structural changes necessary to create a more focused company, but we have materially evolved our culture, adopting the discipline, focus and performance orientation we need to succeed going forward.
We began the year with an aggressive agenda and accomplished a tremendous amount. You've heard me discuss many of our accomplishments throughout the year, and we haven't let up. We have much more to do to fully optimize our business, which will take time, but we are committed to the challenge.
Consistent with our efforts to become a more focused company, over the last several weeks, we reached agreements to sell 2 terrific businesses that will be better served by more focused ownership: Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank. We will receive combined proceeds from these sales of approximately $480 million. These divestitures will sharpen our attention around our core product portfolio to drive sustainable growth, and the sales of Spicetec and JM Swank further position us to execute a smooth separation into 2 pure-play companies, Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston, in the coming months.
We expect to utilize the proceeds from the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures as part of our broader balanced capital allocation plan, which includes debt reduction, an attractive dividend, share repurchases and acquisitions. In addition to bringing more focus, the actions we took during the year enabled us to reduce our debt by approximately $2.5 billion, and our balance sheet is much stronger than it was just 12 months ago. 
Since we last spoke in Q3, we've also continued to build momentum around our $300 million efficiency plan and our efforts to transform ConAgra into a lean, agile and more focused company in order to improve profitability and unlock shareholder value. We recognize there's still more to do on this front, and we continue to expect to realize the majority of our efficiency improvements in fiscal 2017 and 2018.
As part of our transformation to a leaner and more nimble company, we are settling into our corporate headquarters in downtown Chicago. In fact, for the first time, we are conducting this call from our new space. We moved in early this week, and we are excited to have the leadership team and our consumer business under one roof. It's a great new space, and our team is energized. And the more open floor plan will foster enhanced collaboration and accelerate our shift to a more innovative and tightly connected culture, which will play a key role in driving performance and in creating value.
Our team also remains hard at work on the separation of ConAgra into 2 public pure-play companies. We expect to file the initial Form 10 by the middle of July, and we'll be hosting Investor Days for both companies in advance of the completion of the spin. We will be following up later this summer with more specifics regarding the dates, times and locations for those meetings.
Our teams are working diligently to prepare Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston for their lives as stand-alone public companies. We remain highly confident that this is the right path to maximize value for stakeholders, who will benefit from improved operating performance and consistency from both businesses.
With fiscal 2016 complete, the team is proud of our accomplishments on behalf of shareholders, and we now begin fiscal 2017 ready to build on our momentum. It will take time to truly optimize ConAgra, but this team has developed the refuse-to-lose attitude that I believe will enable our success.
So on to our segment performance. As you know, our focus in Consumer Foods is on unlocking the significant latent potential of the business by expanding margins, improving brand health and delivering more consistent performance. We have aggressively executed against that strategy during fiscal 2016 by allocating resources more efficiently through portfolio segmentation with a focus on building a higher-quality, investment-grade volume base. At the same time, we are becoming more effective in pricing, mix management and trade promotion productivity and more efficient from a supply chain perspective. These advancements, coupled with favorable commodity input costs, provided us with fuel to grow profits, reinvest in the business and position our volume base for the long term. Clearly, we still have more to do to realize our full potential as a branded food company. That said, we made tremendous progress by reigniting our operating performance this year. For the year, sales declined as we expected, consistent with our efforts to upgrade our volume base, take selective pricing actions where justified and improve our trade spend discipline.
As we said early in the year, the payoff was going to be in margins, not sales, and our results reflected our progress against that objective. Gross margins expanded, providing good fuel to reinvest in the business. For the full fiscal year, comparable operating margin grew to just under 17%, almost a 200 basis point improvement over last year, and comparable operating profit grew 7% to $1.2 billion, overall a strong performance by the team.
In addition, we made progress throughout the year as we invested behind A&P-ready brands like Reddi-wip, Marie Callender's, PAM, Bertolli, Slim Jim and Hunt's. For the year, we increased A&P spending 12%, including 8% in Q4. Importantly, we have developed a much more rigorous and targeted approach to allocating these dollars against brands where we can drive the greatest margin impact.
Our results for the quarter mirrored our results for the full year as we experienced a 5% decline in net sales after adjusting for the benefit of the extra week last year, principally driven by volume declines related to the actions we are taking on pricing and trade spend. In fact, virtually all of the volume decline was a result of Banquet pricing associated with product upgrades and a broader portfolio decision to walk away from promoted volume that offered weak returns and conditioned the consumer to look for deep discounts. Once again, this was planned as we successfully expanded gross margins, allowing us to increase our brand investments, strengthen our -- and strengthen our non-promoted volume base.
Operating margins also increased during the quarter to slightly over 17%. Although comparable operating profit declined for the quarter to $290 million, this was a function of the extra week in the prior year, FX and the volume impact of pricing and trade actions, partially offset by lower SG&A. Expanding operating margin was our goal for the quarter, and our focus on price/mix and supply chain and SG&A productivity delivered results.
Our fiscal 2016 results are a testament to the fact that our strategy is working. Importantly, we are at the early stages of what we can achieve as a stand-alone business, and I am more encouraged than ever about the work that is happening in Consumer Foods and the significant opportunity ahead as we continue to accelerate our progress. As I've said before, discipline and investment create a virtuous cycle. Over time, stronger brands lead to better pricing power and higher margins, and we are clearly on the right path to maximizing value here. We look forward to sharing much more with you on Conagra Brands at the Investor Day this fall.
Now turning to Commercial Foods. For the year, net sales were approximately $4 billion, up slightly from the prior year. Operating profit was approximately $630 million, up nearly 12% from the prior year. Fourth quarter net sales were approximately $1 billion, down approximately 6% from the prior year due principally to the 53rd week in the year-ago period. Operating profit was $156 million, in line with the year-ago results.
We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business, supported by food-away-from-home trends in the U.S. as well as growing demand in emerging markets.  Consistent with our plans to capitalize on these trends, we recently announced an important investment in our Richland, Washington facility to expand our domestic production capacity, which we also leverage for exports. We also announced an exciting investment in Russia by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture. These investments will enhance our ability to support the increasing consumer demand for value-added potato products and the steady growth in key emerging markets like Russia. Ultimately, we expect these investments will contribute to our ability to continue to grow our share and deliver strong top and bottom line results for shareholders.
More broadly, we continue to make good progress in preparing Lamb Weston to become a stand-alone business. We will be providing more details in the weeks to come.
Before I turn it over to John, as always, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the resilience and dedication of our talented team as we work to transform ConAgra into a stronger, more consistent company with a more valuable future. While fiscal 2016 was a year of significant change, we remain a work in progress. That said, I am more confident than ever as we look ahead, and I greatly appreciate the energy and focus on serving our customers that I see on display on a daily basis.
Over to you, John."
26893,342121774,1003726,"ConAgra Foods, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Conagra Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. In my comments this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our 2016 fiscal fourth quarter performance; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and some brief com",1910,"Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. In my comments this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our 2016 fiscal fourth quarter performance; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and some brief comments on our outlook for fiscal year 2017.
I'll start with some comments on our performance in our fiscal fourth quarter. Overall, we reported a loss of $0.07 per share from continuing operations compared with $0.54 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the prior year quarter. The decrease from prior year is principally driven by a substantial noncash charge related to the year-end remeasurement of pension amounts. I'll provide some additional comments on this pension charge when I discuss comparability items. 
After adjusting for this charge and other items impacting comparability, diluted EPS from continuing operations for the fiscal fourth quarter was $0.52, slightly better than we had planned and modestly below the $0.55 in the year-ago period. As a reminder, the prior fiscal year and fourth quarter included an additional week, which added roughly $0.04 per share to the EPS base.
In our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.7 billion for the quarter, down about 12% from the year-ago period. We estimate that the extra week impacted Consumer Foods' sales and volume by approximately 7%. After adjusting for the benefit of the extra week in the prior year, net sales declined 5%, reflecting a 4% decline in volume, flat price/mix and a negative 1% impact from foreign exchange.
Segment operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $290 million in the fourth quarter versus $324 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in comparable earnings reflects lower volumes, including the impact of the extra week in the year-ago quarter, and a negative FX impact of about 2%, partially offset by lower SG&A. 
For the fiscal fourth quarter, operating margin, adjusted for items impacting comparability, expanded modestly, driven by a slightly larger increase in gross margins. While the year-over-year comparable margin expansion slowed this quarter, we note that the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter delivered very strong margin expansion, and during that quarter, we began to see the impacts from our margin expansion efforts.
For the full year, operating margins, adjusted for items impacting comparability, expanded to over 180 basis points, reflecting pricing discipline, mix management, supply chain efficiencies and favorable input costs, offset by higher marketing and incentive costs.
On marketing, Consumer Foods' advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $64 million, up about 8% from the prior year quarter, reflecting our efforts to continue to strengthen and support our brands.
Foreign exchange this fiscal quarter had negative impacts of $15 million on net sales and about $7 million on operating profit.
In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion or about 6% below the prior year quarter, principally reflecting the impact of the extra week in the year-ago period. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $151 million versus $154 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflects the impact of the extra week in the prior year and higher incentives expense, partially offset by good sales and margin performance in our Lamb Weston business. Equity method investment earnings were $31 million for the current quarter and $30 million in the year-ago period.
Moving on to corporate expenses. For the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $414 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $62 million, in line with the year-ago quarter, reflecting benefits from our cost savings efforts, offset by higher incentives expense.
On our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making good progress, and we expect to realize the majority of our $200 million of SG&A cost savings over the next 2 years. Further, as I have previously noted, the benefit of our previously announced cost savings programs are concentrated in our consumer business, and we have developed aggressive targets and plans so that we can both offset modest stranded costs as they arise and selectively invest back into the business to build capabilities that will expand operating margins over time.
Discontinued operations posted diluted EPS of $0.34 in the fourth quarter. Substantially all of the earnings relate to a $147 million tax benefit associated with the recognition of a portion of the capital loss carryforward asset resulting from the sale of the private label operations earlier this year. We expect to utilize the $147 million of capital loss asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to the recently announced divestitures of our Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business and our JM Swank business, which are expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
On comparability items, this quarter included several items as follows. First, we had approximately $0.49 per diluted share of net expense related to the year-end remeasurement of pension amounts. This charge is related to the accounting change we made several years ago, whereby we elected to immediately recognize significant actuarial gains and losses in our P&L rather than amortize them over time. The noncash charge this year is driven by the drop in interest rates and, therefore, our discount rate and some lower returns on investments over the short term. Importantly, we remain comfortable with our current funding levels. 
In addition to this item, we also had approximately $0.07 per diluted share of net expense related to an impairment charge for our Chef Boyardee brand, driven by our plans to improve the quality of the volume base, which we expect to result in lower net sales over the near term.
Next, we had approximately $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the previously announced planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. We also had approximately $0.03 per diluted share of net gain related to the mark-to-market impact of derivatives used to hedge input costs, temporarily classified in unallocated corporate expense.
And finally, we had several smaller items, including approximately $0.01 per diluted share of expense for recent developments in a legacy legal matter, approximately $0.01 per diluted share of benefit from selling certain assets within the Commercial Foods segment, approximately $0.01 per diluted share of expense for adjustments to prior year tax credits and about $0.01 of rounding.
On cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, we ended the quarter with $835 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Operating cash flows from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $1.05 billion versus $1.22 billion in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is driven principally by higher tax payments in the current fiscal year. 
On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $150 million versus $103 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $61 million in the fiscal fourth quarter versus $88 million in the year-ago quarter. And dividends for this fiscal quarter were $109 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter.
On capital allocation, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments.
For the year, we repaid approximately $2.5 billion of debt mainly from the proceeds from the sale of the private label operations earlier this year. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, and we have approximately $132 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. 
Also, the company recently announced agreements to sell its Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business and the JM Swank business, each of which is part of the Commercial Foods segment. The transactions are expected to generate combined proceeds of approximately $480 million, and both transactions are expected to close during the fiscal first quarter of 2017.
As previously noted, we plan to utilize approximately $147 million of our capital loss carryforwards to substantially eliminate taxes that would otherwise be payable in connection with these sales. Also, the remaining capital loss of approximately $3.6 billion pretax or $1.4 billion after tax is available to offset capital gains over the next 5 years. We remain confident that the company will be able to realize significant tax benefits in the future as we work to reshape our portfolio in a disciplined manner. These proceeds are expected to be utilized as part of our broader balanced capital allocation plan.
Now I'd like to provide a few comments on our outlook for fiscal 2017. First of all, given the pending Lamb Weston spinoff, we are not in position today to provide EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. As we have noted, we believe our Investor Days will be the proper form to provide both fiscal 2017 and long-term guidance for both companies.
Further, on the timing of the spinoff, we are on schedule to complete the spin this fall. We expect to file a Form 10 over the next couple of weeks. And once we get further into the Form 10 process later this summer, we expect to be in a position to provide dates for our Investor Days.
For fiscal 2017, while we are not in a position to provide full year EPS guidance, I would note the following. For Q1 fiscal 2017, we expect EPS growth to be in the mid- to high teens from our earnings base of $0.41, driven by continued focus on margin management across both our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments, continued strong top line performance in our Commercial Foods segment, increased benefits from our cost savings programs and lower interest costs. We will also continue to invest in capabilities to strengthen and position our brands for stronger growth over the long term.
Overall, we expect the positive trends from our fiscal 2016 to continue into fiscal 2017. We look forward to building out our long-term expectations at our Investor Day, at which time we can provide more details about portfolio segmentation and expectations for top line growth, margin expansion, capital allocation and financial policies, phasing of our SG&A and trade efficiency benefits, brand investment targets as well as the short-term impacts of any stranded costs associated with the planned Lamb Weston spinoff.
In closing, we are pleased with our fiscal 2016 performance and the changes we were able to execute to improve the long-term health of the company. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are confident that we're taking the right actions to drive attractive value creation over time.
That concludes our formal remarks. Before I turn it back over to Sean, I just wanted to briefly address my pending retirement. I am excited to begin the next phase of my life, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to allocate more time to my family and interests outside of business. I am equally excited, though, about the future of this company. I've enjoyed seeing the new team come together under Sean's leadership, and I'm confident that the company is on the right track. It's been a privilege to work at ConAgra Foods for the past 14-plus years and to have served as its CFO for the last 7.5. Lastly, I will miss the relationships I've developed with many of you in the analyst and investor community over the years, and I appreciate your interest in the company and the insights and questions you've shared over the years.
Now let me turn it back over to Sean."

So I guess I was a little surprised to see that price/mix in the quarter was flat despite the more significant volume decline in the quarter. So was there any specific reason, I guess, you're discreet this quarter that we didn't see more of that come through? And then in the forward-looking commentary for the first quarter, price/mix was one of the things listed that was expected to be a positive contributor. So maybe what's expected to drive that improvement sequentially versus the pricing that did not come through in the fourth quarter?"

Let me just kind of set the background on price/mix. We think about pricing in terms of 3 components: the first, inflation-justified; the second driven by trade productivity; and the third, pricing in conjunction with brand and quality upgrades that we made. When you look at Q4, there are several things that are affecting price/mix in the quarter. Our pricing activities are focused on how do we increase our overall margin, which we did in the quarter. So in terms of inflation-justified pricing, we're being more disciplined and timely in pricing for commodity changes, both up and down. As you know, the vast majority of our brands are not in pass-through categories, but there are a couple categories that tend to be pass-through, and one of those is fresh meat. Any in Q4, we saw protein deflation that we pass through on brands like Hebrew National and Odom's Tennessee Pride. So that was deflationary. We built our overall margins. We continue to make progress on the second piece in terms of our trade productivity. We committed to $100 million of productivity savings. That's going to show itself up into additional gross margin, which we saw in the quarter. You see it in the measured results. We're making progress in lowering our percent on deal, and you'll continue to see the positive impacts of that going forward. And then finally, when we retake a brand like Banquet, which we talked about, we will increase our price with those product upgrades. In this quarter, we also launched a line of organic Healthy Choice Steamers in premium pricing, so that was a positive contributor. So what you see overall is the impact of this pricing in market; higher average price; lower promoted volumes; and importantly, a healthier, more profitable non-promoted base. So over time, I think what you can expect is that our pricing and margins will move up while there maybe some quarter-on-quarter variations."

There's improvement in mix and then margin growth through renovation and innovation. So only the first -- really, inflation-justified pricing is only one component of margin, and we did see some deflation of protein. In light of that, we did see overall gross margins expand from the other components of our plan, particularly productivity and lower commodities. I think you see in market, our average price per unit is increasing. And our margins were up as a result of this holistic approach. Over time, our margins are going to grow. There's going to be quarter-on-quarter variations, but we're committed to continue to drive that holistic approach to margin expansion."

I think one of the keys as we pursue margin expansion, we pursue a higher-quality volume base, we're not going to get overly exercised about some variability from quarter to quarter because every quarter's got a bit of a different story to it, whether it's the wrap, whether it's seasonality, whether it's the mix of products that we've got moving through it. The fact of the matter is our absolute margins in consumer continue to be in a significantly improved position versus where they've been historically, and that's because of the discipline that we are driving. And we're going to continue to drive that discipline here in the next couple of quarters because we've got to cleanse out of our base some behaviors that were not adding to value. So you're going to continue to see -- as we've talked before, we want to see the centerline of our profitability move north over time. There may be some standard -- some variability around that quarter to quarter based on the dynamics of the quarter we're in, but our goal is to drive the centerline north over time and reduce the standard deviation around that centerline.

I recognize that double digits probably means anything from 10% to 99%, so I think if you think in terms of mid- to upper teens, that's probably the range that would -- that would help you tighten up that range. I think you asked a question about deflation in the quarter. I'd say it was fairly modest. I don't have the number off the top of my head, but commodities probably showed a little bit of favorability. Our conversion costs were probably up a little bit. As we look forward to FY '17, I would say we probably are looking at continued benign commodity markets as we sit here today. That probably means we may still have some modest inflation just because we're coming off such a low base of commodities. But overall, we feel pretty good about the commodity inputs for '17 as well as our -- we'll have some conversion cost inflation, which is not the majority of our COGS. But the important thing is to the extent we have inflation or commodity moves, I think as Tom has indicated and Sean has certainly indicated, I think our muscles and our capabilities around pricing and expanding margins in the face of either increasing or decreasing margins is much better than it was even a few years ago. So I think the whole margin management capability and the holistic capability for us to manage margins higher as commodities move around is much stronger."

First of all, if you look at our overall story in consumer, as I've said many times, we've got to remember this is a transformation we're undergoing here, not a flip of the switch. And on volume, in particular, the bottom line is this. It is an undeniable fact that our past promotional practices have embedded in our volume base a group of consumers who are not brand loyal, who only buy on hot deals and who contribute virtually nothing to our profitability. It's also true that by catering to them, we have underserved the bulk of our volume base, and these are consumers who would be willing to pay more for more contemporary, higher-quality offerings. The good news here is that -- around this whole dynamic is that it's reversible if we are willing to stick to our principles around optimizing mix and also refreshing the targeted brands for a new day. No one said this was going to be easy, but it is absolutely the right way to manage a branded asset for value creation. We know from years of experience what the alternative gets us, and that's precisely why we do not get spooked when we see volumes pull back and margins expand. It's exactly what we expect in the year-end. In fact, I think in Q4, the volume back-off in consumer was in the ballpark of 3.7%, which, frankly, in the scheme of what we're trying to do of purging some of these really bad deep discount promotional behaviors is, frankly, small in my mind. So that is a key point. The endgame here is obviously what we're all about, which is stronger brands, better innovation, better margins and ultimately, stronger growth and shareholder returns. And recall in the last year, we recruited a new Chief Growth Officer to run our Growth Center of Excellence, and he is quite busy installing new work processes and raising our overall capability in this area. I'm looking forward to sharing some of these updates with you guys at Investor Day. But overall, I am quite optimistic around what the Growth Center of Excellence, in partnership with our brands, will be able to accomplish in this portfolio. In the meantime, we will absolutely let some of these non-investment-grade volume go, and we will happily take the associated margin expansion."

But ConAgra historically has probably been the least disciplined company in our space with respect to taking pricing when it's justified. But also, we've probably been the most over-reliant in terms of deep discount trade, and we clearly need to undo that. But what I find interesting is you really see that in the scanner data right now. If you look at the percent of our total volume base sold on deal  past 52 weeks, past 26, past 12 and past 4, you see sequential reductions in percent of our volume sold on deal, to the point where we've gone from being one of the most overpromoted companies in our space to one of the leaders. And obviously, as we do that, we're going to see some volume impact. We're going to see some efficiency, but we're also going to have to reinvest behind the brands in other ways, which is what we've done this year as you look at our A&P spend increase year-on-year. But with respect to the $100 million program that you're talking about, like the SG&A program, it will build sequentially across '16, '17 and '18, and a big part of that is because we are getting our sea legs. We're going from being fairly rough around the edges, so to speak, in terms of our capabilities here to much more system-based, much more analytical.

And the only evidence, I guess, we have seen as a function of that process is you decided to fix Banquet. You're selling some, I guess, ancillary brands or businesses that you have. So those are kind of the biggest things we see so far. Is that a fair assessment? And so just can you give us some insights into timing and where you are really in the process and maybe big buckets in which we should think about your portfolio like fix, sell, ready for A&P and so on and so forth?

First of all, we will go deep on that with our investors at Investor Day, and we'll have Darren Serrao literally walk through kind of how we went about the process because if you look at our branded portfolio, we have roughly 50 brands. And unlike kind of the old days, we're not going to take a first-horse-to-the-trough approach to resources around here on those 50 brands. We will be very disciplined around the role each of those brands play in creating value. The simplest way to think about it is, first, we look at where do we compete in categories that are fundamentally healthy and growing. And within those categories, do we have brands that are proven and strong competitors? If you see those markers, those are obviously places, especially assuming if you've got a good margin structure, where you're going to get a good return on A&P investment. So those become priorities in terms of renovating the brand, innovating the brand and supporting the brand. In other cases, we find we've got categories where, perhaps, the format has changed and it has shifted, but we still have, perhaps, leading -- the leading trademark with respect to the product, but we haven't moved into adjacencies or updated formats with the category. That's a simple kind of innovation opportunity, and that is existing because, frankly, we were just not minding the shop. There are other businesses where we have historically invested in innovation and growth, but that shouldn't be the role of those businesses. Those businesses are major cash contributors. They're in mature categories. They have excellent margin and cash flow, and we need to manage them for that because if we do that, that will provide fuel to really unlock all of the potential in higher-growth categories. And then as we look at the portfolio, there may be 1 or 2 things that we say, geez, we don't necessarily love the category. We don't necessarily have the answer in terms of what to do with these businesses. Maybe it's more valuable to somebody else than it is to us. And if we find those, we've got this capital loss carryforward. That's an asset that we've got here for roughly the next 5 years. So it will be a holistic approach to improving the businesses we have, optimizing the mix within our portfolio. And also, if we see something on the outside that will be complementary to our portfolio, enable us to refresh our portfolio, especially in the areas of premium, gourmet, organic, natural, that could be a good enhancement and addition to our portfolio. We did Blake's last year. That was a small one, but it's the right kind of stuff to really round out our portfolio and capitalize on our manufacturing assets and capabilities."

In terms of Banquet, it's been a very consistent or reliable contributor to profits over time. And then what we've done is we've looked at ways to invest to sustain that, and there are 2 things going on.

We are essentially just a couple of quarters into the migration. We did what's -- what I think is important to highlight is that we made product quality improvements in conjunction with the pricing. What we are seeing from a consumer standpoint is that there are certainly households that bought Banquet because it's a tremendous price value. We anticipated that we would lose some of those households. What we are beginning to see in the data is that the product quality upgrades are beginning to improve our repeat. So over time, we're going to see a business that our repeat purchase rate -- our purchase frequency builds. But we're starting from a base of decades of $1 pricing, and it is going to take several -- it will take time for us to rebuild the business. What we do know is that we've significantly improved the margins of the business that have allowed us to invest."

Yes, innovation, obviously, is going to be a centerpiece of what our new Growth Center of Excellence is focused on and partnering with Tom's team on. And as you think about ConAgra with respect to innovation, I think you should anticipate that we will run the gamut from necessary renovation and even some of the stuff we've done this past year, where we've updated the packages' designs for the first time, literally, since the 80s. That's basic renovation stuff. It's not going to set the world on fire, but it is critically important to present our brands in a way that they look like they're from the modern era. But then we also are working on bolder innovations. As an example, last year, we conducted a test market of a new product called Wicked Kitchen in the Southeast, and we learned a tremendous amount. There were some really exciting things there. So the innovation team has been working on refreshing Wicked Kitchen, and we'll kind of show the market what that's going to look like when we do our Investor Day along with some other things. In terms of the kinds of benefits that you should anticipate we'll bring, well, it will be across the board, and it will be in line with consumer trends, whether it's global flavor adventure, convenience, things like that. But in general, where we under-index in our portfolio the most is in -- really in, as I've talked about, the premium gourmet and then the natural organic. And by not really tapping into those consumers, we are missing incremental sales and profit opportunities. Number  one, they tend to be higher dollar ring. Number two, they are totally incremental to a lot of the businesses we already have in terms of benefit. And number three, in most cases, we use our existing asset base, so it's very economically efficient. So we've got a full suite of things, and we'll kind of share a lot of this with you in the months and quarters ahead. One of the reasons we've been incredibly focused and aggressive on costs is because, frankly, it takes longer to rebuild your insight pipeline and rebuild your innovation pipeline. So we've kind of jumped all over costs. We moved aggressively knowing that it takes some time to get the branded side of the innovation pipeline rebuilt. But that work has been, behind the scenes, aggressively underway, and we've got some really exciting stuff coming. You saw some of the early stuff this past year with things like Healthy Choice Simply, which is a clean label line there that's done really well for us, and some other things. But that's just the beginning. There's plenty more to come."

And that is not the conversation we are having. It is ""We can think of it in terms of $100 million in EBIT improvement."" And certainly, there may be some trade deals that are just so stupid and inefficient we just eliminate them lock, stock and barrel. However, in other cases, because of the advanced analytics that we are investing in, what we're doing with most of our customers is saying, ""Well, here are some case studies of where we spend chunks of money with you. Let's look at the empirical evidence together. It's clearly generating a nonexistent or anemic return. Alternatively, here are some things that we can do that can generate a positive return and drive your top line and drive your bottom line."" And when we are databased and can bring in the evidence that -- around the deals that aren't working and also the evidence of the deals that are working and say, we're doing less of the former and more of the latter, we find we have a very engaged customer. Because at the end of the day, as tough as growth has been in this industry for manufacturers, it's been the same way for retailers, everybody's looking for profitable growth. And if we can bring intellectual capital to the table that can help not only our situation but our customer's P&L, that's a conversation that's well received."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016 earnings. I am pleased with our results, which reflect the progress we are making as we continue to execute our strategy to drive focus and discipline across the company. 
Diluted comparable EPS for fiscal 2016 was $2.08 compared with $1.93 in fiscal 2015, which included an extra week. For the fourth quarter, we delivered comparable EPS of $0.52, slightly above our $0.50 guidance.
Before John and I get into details of our full year and Q4 results, I want to provide you with a bit of context and perspective on where we are as we continue to build the foundation to support Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston as separate pure-play businesses following the spin planned for later this year.
It's been a very busy year, and I am pleased with the way the organization has embraced the changes needed to drive value across ConAgra. We have not only implemented many of the structural changes necessary to create a more focused company, but we have materially evolved our culture, adopting the discipline, focus and performance orientation we need to succeed going forward.
We began the year with an aggressive agenda and accomplished a tremendous amount. You've heard me discuss many of our accomplishments throughout the year, and we haven't let up. We have much more to do to fully optimize our business, which will take time, but we are committed to the challenge.
Consistent with our efforts to become a more focused company, over the last several weeks, we reached agreements to sell 2 terrific businesses that will be better served by more focused ownership: Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank. We will receive combined proceeds from these sales of approximately $480 million. These divestitures will sharpen our attention around our core product portfolio to drive sustainable growth, and the sales of Spicetec and JM Swank further position us to execute a smooth separation into 2 pure-play companies, Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston, in the coming months.
We expect to utilize the proceeds from the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures as part of our broader balanced capital allocation plan, which includes debt reduction, an attractive dividend, share repurchases and acquisitions. In addition to bringing more focus, the actions we took during the year enabled us to reduce our debt by approximately $2.5 billion, and our balance sheet is much stronger than it was just 12 months ago. 
Since we last spoke in Q3, we've also continued to build momentum around our $300 million efficiency plan and our efforts to transform ConAgra into a lean, agile and more focused company in order to improve profitability and unlock shareholder value. We recognize there's still more to do on this front, and we continue to expect to realize the majority of our efficiency improvements in fiscal 2017 and 2018.
As part of our transformation to a leaner and more nimble company, we are settling into our corporate headquarters in downtown Chicago. In fact, for the first time, we are conducting this call from our new space. We moved in early this week, and we are excited to have the leadership team and our consumer business under one roof. It's a great new space, and our team is energized. And the more open floor plan will foster enhanced collaboration and accelerate our shift to a more innovative and tightly connected culture, which will play a key role in driving performance and in creating value.
Our team also remains hard at work on the separation of ConAgra into 2 public pure-play companies. We expect to file the initial Form 10 by the middle of July, and we'll be hosting Investor Days for both companies in advance of the completion of the spin. We will be following up later this summer with more specifics regarding the dates, times and locations for those meetings.
Our teams are working diligently to prepare Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston for their lives as stand-alone public companies. We remain highly confident that this is the right path to maximize value for stakeholders, who will benefit from improved operating performance and consistency from both businesses.
With fiscal 2016 complete, the team is proud of our accomplishments on behalf of shareholders, and we now begin fiscal 2017 ready to build on our momentum. It will take time to truly optimize ConAgra, but this team has developed the refuse-to-lose attitude that I believe will enable our success.
So on to our segment performance. As you know, our focus in Consumer Foods is on unlocking the significant latent potential of the business by expanding margins, improving brand health and delivering more consistent performance. We have aggressively executed against that strategy during fiscal 2016 by allocating resources more efficiently through portfolio segmentation with a focus on building a higher-quality, investment-grade volume base. At the same time, we are becoming more effective in pricing, mix management and trade promotion productivity and more efficient from a supply chain perspective. These advancements, coupled with favorable commodity input costs, provided us with fuel to grow profits, reinvest in the business and position our volume base for the long term. Clearly, we still have more to do to realize our full potential as a branded food company. That said, we made tremendous progress by reigniting our operating performance this year. For the year, sales declined as we expected, consistent with our efforts to upgrade our volume base, take selective pricing actions where justified and improve our trade spend discipline.
As we said early in the year, the payoff was going to be in margins, not sales, and our results reflected our progress against that objective. Gross margins expanded, providing good fuel to reinvest in the business. For the full fiscal year, comparable operating margin grew to just under 17%, almost a 200 basis point improvement over last year, and comparable operating profit grew 7% to $1.2 billion, overall a strong performance by the team.
In addition, we made progress throughout the year as we invested behind A&P-ready brands like Reddi-wip, Marie Callender's, PAM, Bertolli, Slim Jim and Hunt's. For the year, we increased A&P spending 12%, including 8% in Q4. Importantly, we have developed a much more rigorous and targeted approach to allocating these dollars against brands where we can drive the greatest margin impact.
Our results for the quarter mirrored our results for the full year as we experienced a 5% decline in net sales after adjusting for the benefit of the extra week last year, principally driven by volume declines related to the actions we are taking on pricing and trade spend. In fact, virtually all of the volume decline was a result of Banquet pricing associated with product upgrades and a broader portfolio decision to walk away from promoted volume that offered weak returns and conditioned the consumer to look for deep discounts. Once again, this was planned as we successfully expanded gross margins, allowing us to increase our brand investments, strengthen our -- and strengthen our non-promoted volume base.
Operating margins also increased during the quarter to slightly over 17%. Although comparable operating profit declined for the quarter to $290 million, this was a function of the extra week in the prior year, FX and the volume impact of pricing and trade actions, partially offset by lower SG&A. Expanding operating margin was our goal for the quarter, and our focus on price/mix and supply chain and SG&A productivity delivered results.
Our fiscal 2016 results are a testament to the fact that our strategy is working. Importantly, we are at the early stages of what we can achieve as a stand-alone business, and I am more encouraged than ever about the work that is happening in Consumer Foods and the significant opportunity ahead as we continue to accelerate our progress. As I've said before, discipline and investment create a virtuous cycle. Over time, stronger brands lead to better pricing power and higher margins, and we are clearly on the right path to maximizing value here. We look forward to sharing much more with you on Conagra Brands at the Investor Day this fall.
Now turning to Commercial Foods. For the year, net sales were approximately $4 billion, up slightly from the prior year. Operating profit was approximately $630 million, up nearly 12% from the prior year. Fourth quarter net sales were approximately $1 billion, down approximately 6% from the prior year due principally to the 53rd week in the year-ago period. Operating profit was $156 million, in line with the year-ago results.
We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business, supported by food-away-from-home trends in the U.S. as well as growing demand in emerging markets.  Consistent with our plans to capitalize on these trends, we recently announced an important investment in our Richland, Washington facility to expand our domestic production capacity, which we also leverage for exports. We also announced an exciting investment in Russia by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture. These investments will enhance our ability to support the increasing consumer demand for value-added potato products and the steady growth in key emerging markets like Russia. Ultimately, we expect these investments will contribute to our ability to continue to grow our share and deliver strong top and bottom line results for shareholders.
More broadly, we continue to make good progress in preparing Lamb Weston to become a stand-alone business. We will be providing more details in the weeks to come.
Before I turn it over to John, as always, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the resilience and dedication of our talented team as we work to transform ConAgra into a stronger, more consistent company with a more valuable future. While fiscal 2016 was a year of significant change, we remain a work in progress. That said, I am more confident than ever as we look ahead, and I greatly appreciate the energy and focus on serving our customers that I see on display on a daily basis.
Over to you, John."
26893,342121774,1003760,"ConAgra Foods, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Conagra Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. In my comments this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our 2016 fiscal fourth quarter performance; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and some brief com",1907,"Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. In my comments this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our 2016 fiscal fourth quarter performance; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and some brief comments on our outlook for fiscal year 2017.
I'll start with some comments on our performance in our fiscal fourth quarter. Overall, we reported a loss of $0.07 per share from continuing operations compared with $0.54 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the prior year quarter. The decrease from prior year is principally driven by a substantial noncash charge related to the year-end remeasurement of pension amounts. I'll provide some additional comments on this pension charge when I discuss comparability items. 
After adjusting for this charge and other items impacting comparability, diluted EPS from continuing operations for the fiscal fourth quarter was $0.52, slightly better than we had planned and modestly below the $0.55 in the year-ago period. As a reminder, the prior fiscal year and fourth quarter included an additional week, which added roughly $0.04 per share to the EPS base.
In our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.7 billion for the quarter, down about 12% from the year-ago period. We estimate that the extra week impacted Consumer Foods' sales and volume by approximately 7%. After adjusting for the benefit of the extra week in the prior year, net sales declined 5%, reflecting a 4% decline in volume, flat price/mix and a negative 1% impact from foreign exchange.
Segment operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $290 million in the fourth quarter versus $324 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in comparable earnings reflects lower volumes, including the impact of the extra week in the year-ago quarter, and a negative FX impact of about 2%, partially offset by lower SG&A. 
For the fiscal fourth quarter, operating margin, adjusted for items impacting comparability, expanded modestly, driven by a slightly larger increase in gross margins. While the year-over-year comparable margin expansion slowed this quarter, we note that the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter delivered very strong margin expansion, and during that quarter, we began to see the impacts from our margin expansion efforts.
For the full year, operating margins, adjusted for items impacting comparability, expanded over 180 basis points, reflecting pricing discipline, mix management, supply chain efficiencies and favorable input costs, offset by higher marketing and incentive costs.
On marketing, Consumer Foods' advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $64 million, up about 8% from the prior year quarter, reflecting our efforts to continue to strengthen and support our brands.
Foreign exchange this fiscal quarter had negative impacts of $15 million on net sales and about $7 million on operating profit.
In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion or about 6% below the prior year quarter, principally reflecting the impact of the extra week in the year-ago period. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $151 million versus $154 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflects the impact of the extra week in the prior year and higher incentives expense, partially offset by good sales and margin performance in our Lamb Weston business. Equity method investment earnings were $31 million for the current quarter and $30 million in the year-ago period.
Moving on to corporate expenses. For the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $414 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $62 million, in line with the year-ago quarter, reflecting benefits from our cost savings efforts, offset by higher incentives expense.
On our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making good progress, and we expect to realize the majority of our $200 million of SG&A cost savings over the next 2 years. Further, as I have previously noted, the benefit of our previously announced cost savings programs are concentrated in our consumer business, and we have developed aggressive targets and plans so that we can both offset modest stranded costs as they arise and selectively invest back into the business to build capabilities that will expand operating margins over time.
Discontinued operations posted diluted EPS of $0.34 in the fourth quarter. Substantially all of the earnings relate to a $147 million tax benefit associated with the recognition of a portion of the capital loss carryforward asset resulting from the sale of the private-label operations earlier this year. We expect to utilize the $147 million of capital loss asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to the recently announced divestitures of our Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business and our JM Swank business, which are expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
On comparability items, this quarter included several items as follows. First, we had approximately $0.49 per diluted share of net expense related to the year-end remeasurement of pension amounts. This charge is related to the accounting change we made several years ago, whereby we elected to immediately recognize significant actuarial gains and losses in our P&L rather than amortize them over time. The noncash charge this year is driven by the drop in interest rates and, therefore, our discount rate and some lower returns on investments over the short term. Importantly, we remain comfortable with our current funding levels. 
In addition to this item, we also had approximately $0.07 per diluted share of net expense related to an impairment charge for our Chef Boyardee brand, driven by our plans to improve the quality of the volume base, which we expect to result in lower net sales over the near term.
Next, we had approximately $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the previously announced planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. We also had approximately $0.03 per diluted share of net gain related to the mark-to-market impact of derivatives used to hedge input costs, temporarily classified in unallocated corporate expense.
And finally, we had several smaller items, including approximately $0.01 per diluted share of expense for recent developments in a legacy legal matter, approximately $0.01 per diluted share of benefit from selling certain assets within the Commercial Foods segment, approximately $0.01 per diluted share of expense for adjustments to prior year tax credits and about $0.01 of rounding.
On cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, we ended the quarter with $835 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Operating cash flows from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $1.05 billion versus $1.22 billion in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is driven principally by higher tax payments in the current fiscal year. 
On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $150 million versus $103 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $61 million in the fiscal fourth quarter versus $88 million in the year-ago quarter. And dividends for this fiscal quarter were $109 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter.
On capital allocation, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments.
For the year, we repaid approximately $2.5 billion of debt, mainly from the proceeds from the sale of the private-label operations earlier this year. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, and we have approximately $132 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. 
Also, the company recently announced agreements to sell its Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business and the JM Swank business, each of which is part of the Commercial Foods segment. The transactions are expected to generate combined proceeds of approximately $480 million, and both transactions are expected to close during the fiscal first quarter of 2017.
As previously noted, we plan to utilize approximately $147 million of our capital loss carryforwards to substantially eliminate taxes that would otherwise be payable in connection with these sales. Also, the remaining capital loss of approximately $3.6 billion pretax or $1.4 billion after tax is available to offset capital gains over the next 5 years. We remain confident that the company will be able to realize significant tax benefits in the future as we work to reshape our portfolio in a disciplined manner. These proceeds are expected to be utilized as part of our broader balanced capital allocation plan.
Now I'd like to provide a few comments on our outlook for fiscal 2017. First of all, given the pending Lamb Weston spinoff, we are not in position today to provide EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. As we have noted, we believe our Investor Days will be the proper forum to provide both fiscal 2017 and long-term guidance for both companies.
Further, on the timing of the spinoff, we are on schedule to complete the spin this fall. We expect to file a Form 10 over the next couple of weeks. And once we get further into the Form 10 process later this summer, we expect to be in a position to provide dates for our Investor Days.
For fiscal 2017, while we are not in a position to provide full year EPS guidance, I would note the following: For Q1 fiscal 2017, we expect EPS growth to be in the mid- to high teens from our earnings base of $0.41, driven by continued focus on margin management across both our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments, continued strong top line performance in our Commercial Foods segment, increased benefits from our cost savings programs and lower interest costs. We will also continue to invest in capabilities to strengthen and position our brands for stronger growth over the long term.
Overall, we expect the positive trends from our fiscal 2016 to continue into fiscal 2017. We look forward to building out our long-term expectations at our Investor Day, at which time we can provide more details about portfolio segmentation and expectations for top line growth, margin expansion, capital allocation and financial policies, phasing of our SG&A and trade efficiency benefits, brand investment targets as well as the short-term impacts of any stranded costs associated with the planned Lamb Weston spinoff.
In closing, we are pleased with our fiscal 2016 performance and the changes we were able to execute to improve the long-term health of the company. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are confident that we're taking the right actions to drive attractive value creation over time.
That concludes our formal remarks. Before I turn it back over to Sean, I just wanted to briefly address my pending retirement. I am excited to begin the next phase of my life, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to allocate more time to my family and interests outside of business. I am equally excited, though, about the future of this company. I've enjoyed seeing the new team come together under Sean's leadership, and I'm confident that the company is on the right track. It's been a privilege to work at ConAgra Foods for the past 14-plus years and to have served as its CFO for the last 7.5. Lastly, I will miss the relationships I've developed with many of you in the analyst and investor community over the years, and I appreciate your interest in the company and the insights and questions you've shared over the years.
Now let me turn it back over to Sean."

So I guess I was a little surprised to see that price/mix in the quarter was flat despite the more significant volume decline in the quarter. So was there any specific reason, I guess, or discrete this quarter that we didn't see more of that come through? And then in the forward-looking commentary for the first quarter, price/mix was one of the things listed that was expected to be a positive contributor. So maybe what's expected to drive that improvement sequentially versus the pricing that did not come through in the fourth quarter?"

Let me just kind of set the background on price/mix. We think about pricing in terms of 3 components: the first, inflation-justified; the second driven by trade productivity; and the third, pricing in conjunction with brand and quality upgrades that we made. When you look at Q4, there are several things that are affecting price/mix in the quarter. Our pricing activities are focused on how do we increase our overall margin, which we did in the quarter. So in terms of inflation-justified pricing, we're being more disciplined and timely in pricing for commodity changes, both up and down. As you know, the vast majority of our brands are not in pass-through categories, but there are a couple categories that tend to be pass-through, and one of those is fresh meat. And in Q4, we saw protein deflation that we pass through on brands like Hebrew National and Odom's Tennessee Pride. So that was deflationary. We built our overall margins. We continue to make progress on the second piece in terms of our trade productivity. We committed to $100 million of productivity savings. That's going to show itself up into additional gross margin, which we saw in the quarter. You see it in the measured results. We're making progress in lowering our percent on deal, and you'll continue to see the positive impacts of that going forward. And then finally, when we rethink a brand like Banquet, which we talked about, we will increase our price with those product upgrades. In this quarter, we also launched a line of organic Healthy Choice Steamers at premium pricing, so that was a positive contributor. So what you see overall is the impact of this pricing in market; higher average price; lower promoted volumes; and importantly, a healthier, more profitable non-promoted base. So over time, I think what you can expect is that our pricing and margins will move up while there maybe some quarter-on-quarter variations."

There's improvement in mix and then margin growth through renovation and innovation. So only the first -- really, inflation-justified pricing is only one component of margin, and we did see some deflation of protein. In light of that, we did see overall gross margins expand from the other components of our plan, particularly productivity and lower commodities. I think you see in market, our average price per unit is increasing. And our margins were up as a result of this holistic approach. Over time, our margins are going to grow. There's going to be quarter-on-quarter variations, but we're committed to continue to drive that holistic approach to margin expansion."

And we're going to continue to drive that discipline here in the next couple of quarters because we've got to cleanse out of our base some behaviors that were not adding to value. So you're going to continue to see -- as we've talked before, we want to see the centerline of our profitability move north over time. There may be some standard -- some variability around that quarter to quarter based on the dynamics of the quarter we're in, but our goal is to drive the centerline north over time and reduce the standard deviation around that centerline.

As I clarified in my script, we look -- we're looking at that to be in the mid- to upper teens. I recognize that double digits probably means anything from 10% to 99%, so I think if you think in terms of mid- to upper teens, that's probably the range that would -- that would help you tighten up that range. I think you asked a question about deflation in the quarter. I'd say it was fairly modest. I don't have the number off the top of my head, but commodities probably showed a little bit of favorability. Our conversion costs were probably up a little bit. As we look forward to FY '17, I would say we probably are looking at continued benign commodity markets as we sit here today. That probably means we may still have some modest inflation just because we're coming off such a low base of commodities. But overall, we feel pretty good about the commodity inputs for '17 as well as our -- we'll have some conversion cost inflation, which is not the majority of our COGS. But the important thing is to the extent we have inflation or commodity moves, I think as Tom has indicated and Sean has certainly indicated, I think our muscles and our capabilities around pricing and expanding margins in the face of either increasing or decreasing margins is much better than it was even a few years ago. So I think the whole margin management capability and the holistic capability for us to manage margins higher as commodities move around is much stronger."

First of all, if you look at our overall story in consumer, as I've said many times, we've got to remember this is a transformation we're undergoing here, not a flip of the switch. And on volume, in particular, the bottom line is this. It is an undeniable fact that our past promotional practices have embedded in our volume base a group of consumers who are not brand loyal, who only buy on hot deals and who contribute virtually nothing to our profitability. It's also true that by catering to them, we have underserved the bulk of our volume base, and these are consumers who would be willing to pay more for more contemporary, higher-quality offerings. The good news here is that -- around this whole dynamic is that it's reversible if we are willing to stick to our principles around optimizing mix and also refreshing the targeted brands for a new day. No one said this was going to be easy, but it is absolutely the right way to manage a branded asset for value creation. We know from years of experience what the alternative gets us, and that's precisely why we do not get spooked when we see volumes pull back and margins expand. It's exactly what we expect near in. In fact, I think in Q4, the volume back-off in consumer was in the ballpark of 3.7%, which, frankly, in the scheme of what we're trying to do of purging some of these really bad deep discount promotional behaviors is, frankly, small in my mind. So that is a key point. The endgame here is obviously what we're all about, which is stronger brands, better innovation, better margins and ultimately, stronger growth in shareholder returns. And recall in the last year, we recruited a new Chief Growth Officer to run our Growth Center of Excellence, and he is quite busy installing new work processes and raising our overall capability in this area. I'm looking forward to sharing some of these updates with you guys at Investor Day. But overall, I am quite optimistic around what the Growth Center of Excellence, in partnership with our brands, will be able to accomplish in this portfolio. In the meantime, we will absolutely let some of this non-investment-grade volume go, and we will happily take the associated margin expansion."

But ConAgra historically has probably been the least disciplined company in our space with respect to taking pricing when it's justified. But also, we've probably been the most over-reliant in terms of deep-discount trade, and we clearly need to undo that. But what I find interesting is you really see that in the scanner data right now. If you look at the percent of our total volume base sold on deal past 52 weeks, past 26, past 12 and past 4, you see sequential reductions in percent of our volume sold on deal, to the point where we've gone from being one of the most overpromoted companies in our space to one of the leaders. And obviously, as we do that, we're going to see some volume impact. We're going to see some efficiency, but we're also going to have to reinvest behind the brands in other ways, which is what we've done this year as you look at our A&P spend increase year-on-year. But with respect to the $100 million program that you're talking about, like the SG&A program, it will build sequentially across '16, '17 and '18, and a big part of that is because we are getting our sea legs. We're going from being fairly rough around the edges, so to speak, in terms of our capabilities here, to much more system-based, much more analytical. And once you develop the database on what's working, what's not, it's a virtuous cycle, you improve on it. So small amount of improvement this past year, ramping up this year and continuing to ramp up through '18. Did I miss anything there, Tom?"

First of all, we will go deep on that with our investors at Investor Day, and we'll have Darren Serrao literally walk through kind of how we went about the process because if you look at our branded portfolio, we have roughly 50 brands. And unlike kind of the old days, we're not going to take a first-horse-to-the-trough approach to resources around here on those 50 brands. We will be very disciplined around the role each of those brands play in creating value. The simplest way to think about it is, first, we look at where do we compete in categories that are fundamentally healthy and growing. And within those categories, do we have brands that are proven and strong competitors? If you see those markers, those are obviously places, especially assuming if you've got a good margin structure, where you're going to get a good return on A&P investment. So those become priorities in terms of renovating the brand, innovating the brand and supporting the brand. In other cases, we find we've got categories where, perhaps, the format has changed and it has shifted, but we still have, perhaps, leading -- the leading trademark with respect to the product, but we haven't moved into adjacencies or updated formats with the category. That's a simple kind of innovation opportunity, and that is existing because, frankly, we were just not minding the shop. There are other businesses where we have historically invested in innovation and growth, but that shouldn't be the role of those businesses. Those businesses are major cash contributors. They're in mature categories. They have excellent margin and cash flow, and we need to manage them for that because if we do that, that will provide fuel to really unlock all of the potential in higher-growth categories. And then as we look at the portfolio, there may be 1 or 2 things that we say, geez, we don't necessarily love the category. We don't necessarily have the answer in terms of what to do with these businesses. Maybe it's more valuable to somebody else than it is to us. And if we find those, we've got this capital loss carryforward that's an asset that we've got here for roughly the next 5 years. So it will be a holistic approach to improving the businesses we have, optimizing the mix within our portfolio. And also, if we see something on the outside that will be complementary to our portfolio, enable us to refresh our portfolio, especially in the areas of premium, gourmet, organic, natural, that could be a good enhancement and addition to our portfolio. We did Blake's last year. That was a small one, but it's the right kind of stuff to really round out our portfolio and capitalize on our manufacturing assets and capabilities."

So over time, we're going to see a business that our repeat purchase rate -- our purchase frequency builds. But we're starting from a base of decades of $1 pricing, and it is going to take several -- it will take time for us to rebuild the business. What we do know is that we've significantly improved the margins of the business that have allowed us to invest."

And as you think about ConAgra with respect to innovation, I think you should anticipate",456,"Thanks, Alexia. Yes, innovation, obviously, is going to be a centerpiece of what our new Growth Center of Excellence is focused on and partnering with Tom's team on. And as you think about ConAgra with respect to innovation, I think you should anticipate that we will run the gamut from necessary renovation and even some of the stuff we've done this past year, where we've updated the packages' designs for the first time, literally, since the 80s. That's basic renovation stuff. It's not going to set the world on fire, but it is critically important to present our brands in a way that they look like they're from the modern era. But then we also are working on bolder innovations. As an example, last year, we conducted a test market of a new product called Wicked Kitchen in the Southeast, and we learned a tremendous amount. There were some really exciting things there. So the innovation team has been working on refreshing Wicked Kitchen, and we'll kind of show the market what that's going to look like when we do our Investor Day, along with some other things. In terms of the kinds of benefits that you should anticipate we'll bring, well, it will be across the board, and it will be in line with consumer trends, whether it's global flavor adventure, convenience, things like that. But in general, where we under-index in our portfolio the most is in -- really in, as I've talked about, the premium gourmet and then the natural organic. And by not really tapping into those consumers, we are missing incremental sales and profit opportunities. Number one, they tend to be higher dollar ring. Number two, they are totally incremental to a lot of the businesses we already have in terms of benefit. And number three, in most cases, we use our existing asset base, so it's very economically efficient. So we've got a full suite of things, and we'll kind of share a lot of this with you in the months and quarters ahead. One of the reasons we've been incredibly focused and aggressive on costs is because, frankly, it takes longer to rebuild your insight pipeline and rebuild your innovation pipeline. So we've kind of jumped all over costs. We moved aggressively, knowing that it takes some time to get the branded side of the innovation pipeline rebuilt. But that work has been behind the scenes, aggressively underway, and we've got some really exciting stuff coming. You saw some of the early stuff this past year with things like Healthy Choice Simply, which is a clean label line there that's done really well for us, and some other things. But that's just the beginning. There's plenty more to come."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016 earnings. I am pleased with our results, which reflect the progress we are making as we continue to execute our strategy to drive focus and discipline across the company. 
Diluted comparable EPS for fiscal 2016 was $2.08 compared with $1.93 in fiscal 2015, which included an extra week. For the fourth quarter, we delivered comparable EPS of $0.52, slightly above our $0.50 guidance.
Before John and I get into details of our full year and Q4 results, I want to provide you with a bit of context and perspective on where we are as we continue to build the foundation to support Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston as separate pure-play businesses following the spin planned for later this year.
It's been a very busy year, and I am pleased with the way the organization has embraced the changes needed to drive value across ConAgra. We have not only implemented many of the structural changes necessary to create a more focused company, but we have materially evolved our culture, adopting the discipline, focus and performance orientation we need to succeed going forward.
We began the year with an aggressive agenda and accomplished a tremendous amount. You've heard me discuss many of our accomplishments throughout the year, and we haven't let up. We have much more to do to fully optimize our business, which will take time, but we are committed to the challenge.
Consistent with our efforts to become a more focused company, over the last several weeks, we reached agreements to sell 2 terrific businesses that will be better served by more focused ownership: Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank. We will receive combined proceeds from these sales of approximately $480 million. These divestitures will sharpen our attention around our core product portfolio to drive sustainable growth, and the sales of Spicetec and JM Swank further position us to execute a smooth separation into 2 pure-play companies, Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston, in the coming months.
We expect to utilize the proceeds from the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures as part of our broader balanced capital allocation plan, which includes debt reduction, an attractive dividend, share repurchases and acquisitions. In addition to bringing more focus, the actions we took during the year enabled us to reduce our debt by approximately $2.5 billion, and our balance sheet is much stronger than it was just 12 months ago. 
Since we last spoke in Q3, we've also continued to build momentum around our $300 million efficiency plan and our efforts to transform ConAgra into a lean, agile and more focused company in order to improve profitability and unlock shareholder value. We recognize there's still more to do on this front, and we continue to expect to realize the majority of our efficiency improvements in fiscal 2017 and 2018.
As part of our transformation to a leaner and more nimble company, we are settling into our corporate headquarters in downtown Chicago. In fact, for the first time, we are conducting this call from our new space. We moved in early this week, and we are excited to have the leadership team and our consumer business under one roof. It's a great new space, and our team is energized. And the more open floor plan will foster enhanced collaboration and accelerate our shift to a more innovative and tightly connected culture, which will play a key role in driving performance and in creating value.
Our team also remains hard at work on the separation of ConAgra into 2 public pure-play companies. We expect to file the initial Form 10 by the middle of July, and we'll be hosting Investor Days for both companies in advance of the completion of the spin. We will be following up later this summer with more specifics regarding the dates, times and locations for those meetings.
Our teams are working diligently to prepare Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston for their lives as stand-alone public companies. We remain highly confident that this is the right path to maximize value for stakeholders, who will benefit from improved operating performance and consistency from both businesses.
With fiscal 2016 complete, the team is proud of our accomplishments on behalf of shareholders, and we now begin fiscal 2017 ready to build on our momentum. It will take time to truly optimize ConAgra, but this team has developed the refuse-to-lose attitude that I believe will enable our success.
So on to our segment performance. As you know, our focus in Consumer Foods is on unlocking the significant latent potential of the business by expanding margins, improving brand health and delivering more consistent performance. We have aggressively executed against that strategy during fiscal 2016 by allocating resources more efficiently through portfolio segmentation with a focus on building a higher-quality, investment-grade volume base. At the same time, we are becoming more effective in pricing, mix management and trade promotion productivity and more efficient from a supply chain perspective. These advancements, coupled with favorable commodity input costs, provided us with fuel to grow profits, reinvest in the business and position our volume base for the long term. Clearly, we still have more to do to realize our full potential as a branded food company. That said, we made tremendous progress by reigniting our operating performance this year. For the year, sales declined as we expected, consistent with our efforts to upgrade our volume base, take selective pricing actions where justified and improve our trade spend discipline.
As we said early in the year, the payoff was going to be in margins, not sales, and our results reflected our progress against that objective. Gross margins expanded, providing good fuel to reinvest in the business. For the full fiscal year, comparable operating margin grew to just under 17%, almost a 200 basis point improvement over last year, and comparable operating profit grew 7% to $1.2 billion, overall a strong performance by the team.
In addition, we made progress throughout the year as we invested behind A&P-ready brands like Reddi-wip, Marie Callender's, PAM, Bertolli, Slim Jim and Hunt's. For the year, we increased A&P spending 12%, including 8% in Q4. Importantly, we have developed a much more rigorous and targeted approach to allocating these dollars against brands where we can drive the greatest margin impact.
Our results for the quarter mirrored our results for the full year as we experienced a 5% decline in net sales after adjusting for the benefit of the extra week last year, principally driven by volume declines related to the actions we are taking on pricing and trade spend. In fact, virtually all of the volume decline was a result of Banquet pricing associated with product upgrades and a broader portfolio decision to walk away from promoted volume that offered weak returns and conditioned the consumer to look for deep discounts. Once again, this was planned as we successfully expanded gross margins, allowing us to increase our brand investments, strengthen our -- and strengthen our non-promoted volume base.
Operating margins also increased during the quarter to slightly over 17%. Although comparable operating profit declined for the quarter to $290 million, this was a function of the extra week in the prior year, FX and the volume impact of pricing and trade actions, partially offset by lower SG&A. Expanding operating margin was our goal for the quarter, and our focus on price/mix and supply chain and SG&A productivity delivered results.
Our fiscal 2016 results are a testament to the fact that our strategy is working. Importantly, we are at the early stages of what we can achieve as a stand-alone business, and I am more encouraged than ever about the work that is happening in Consumer Foods and the significant opportunity ahead as we continue to accelerate our progress. As I've said before, discipline and investment create a virtuous cycle. Over time, stronger brands lead to better pricing power and higher margins, and we are clearly on the right path to maximizing value here. We look forward to sharing much more with you on Conagra Brands at the Investor Day this fall.
Now turning to Commercial Foods. For the year, net sales were approximately $4 billion, up slightly from the prior year. Operating profit was approximately $630 million, up nearly 12% from the prior year. Fourth quarter net sales were approximately $1 billion, down approximately 6% from the prior year due principally to the 53rd week in the year-ago period. Operating profit was $156 million, in line with the year-ago results.
We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business, supported by food-away-from-home trends in the U.S. as well as growing demand in emerging markets. Consistent with our plans to capitalize on these trends, we recently announced an important investment in our Richland, Washington facility to expand our domestic production capacity, which we also leverage for exports. We also announced an exciting investment in Russia by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture. These investments will enhance our ability to support the increasing consumer demand for value-added potato products and the steady growth in key emerging markets like Russia. Ultimately, we expect these investments will contribute to our ability to continue to grow our share and deliver strong top and bottom line results for shareholders.
More broadly, we continue to make good progress in preparing Lamb Weston to become a stand-alone business. We will be providing more details in the weeks to come.
Before I turn it over to John, as always, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the resilience and dedication of our talented team as we work to transform ConAgra into a stronger, more consistent company with a more valuable future. While fiscal 2016 was a year of significant change, we remain a work in progress. That said, I am more confident than ever as we look ahead, and I greatly appreciate the energy and focus on serving our customers that I see on display on a daily basis.
Over to you, John."
26893,342121774,1003882,"ConAgra Foods, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Conagra Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. In my comments this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our 2016 fiscal fourth quarter performance; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and some brief com",1909,"Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. In my comments this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our 2016 fiscal fourth quarter performance; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and some brief comments on our outlook for fiscal year 2017.
I'll start with some comments on our performance in our fiscal fourth quarter. Overall, we reported a loss of $0.07 per share from continuing operations compared with $0.54 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the prior year quarter. The decrease from prior year is principally driven by a substantial noncash charge related to the year-end remeasurement of pension amounts. I'll provide some additional comments on this pension charge when I discuss comparability items. 
After adjusting for this charge and other items impacting comparability, diluted EPS from continuing operations for the fiscal fourth quarter was $0.52, slightly better than we had planned and modestly below the $0.55 in the year-ago period. As a reminder, the prior fiscal year and fourth quarter included an additional week, which added roughly $0.04 per share to the EPS base.
In our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.7 billion for the quarter, down about 12% from the year-ago period. We estimate that the extra week impacted Consumer Foods' sales and volume by approximately 7%. After adjusting for the benefit of the extra week in the prior year, net sales declined 5%, reflecting a 4% decline in volume, flat price/mix and a negative 1% impact from foreign exchange.
Segment operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $290 million in the fourth quarter versus $324 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in comparable earnings reflects lower volumes, including the impact of the extra week in the year-ago quarter, and a negative FX impact of about 2%, partially offset by lower SG&A. 
For the fiscal fourth quarter, operating margin, adjusted for items impacting comparability, expanded modestly, driven by a slightly larger increase in gross margins. While the year-over-year comparable margin expansion slowed this quarter, we note that the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter delivered very strong margin expansion, and during that quarter, we began to see the impacts from our margin expansion efforts.
For the full year, operating margins, adjusted for items impacting comparability, expanded over 180 basis points, reflecting pricing discipline, mix management, supply chain efficiencies and favorable input costs, offset by higher marketing and incentive costs.
On marketing, Consumer Foods' advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $64 million, up about 8% from the prior year quarter, reflecting our efforts to continue to strengthen and support our brands.
Foreign exchange this fiscal quarter had negative impacts of $15 million on net sales and about $7 million on operating profit.
In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion or about 6% below the prior year quarter, principally reflecting the impact of the extra week in the year-ago period. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $151 million versus $154 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflects the impact of the extra week in the prior year and higher incentives expense, partially offset by good sales and margin performance in our Lamb Weston business. Equity method investment earnings were $31 million for the current quarter and $30 million in the year-ago period.
Moving on to corporate expenses. For the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $414 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $62 million, in line with the year-ago quarter, reflecting benefits from our cost savings efforts, offset by higher incentives expense.
On our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making good progress, and we expect to realize the majority of our $200 million of SG&A cost savings over the next 2 years. Further, as I have previously noted, the benefit of our previously announced cost savings programs are concentrated in our consumer business, and we have developed aggressive targets and plans so that we can both offset modest stranded costs as they arise and selectively invest back into the business to build capabilities that will expand operating margins over time.
Discontinued operations posted diluted EPS of $0.34 in the fourth quarter. Substantially all of the earnings relate to a $147 million tax benefit associated with the recognition of a portion of the capital loss carryforward asset resulting from the sale of the private label operations earlier this year. We expect to utilize the $147 million of capital loss asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to the recently announced divestitures of our Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business and our JM Swank business, which are expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
On comparability items, this quarter included several items as follows. First, we had approximately $0.49 per diluted share of net expense related to the year-end remeasurement of pension amounts. This charge is related to the accounting change we made several years ago, whereby we elected to immediately recognize significant actuarial gains and losses in our P&L rather than amortize them over time. The noncash charge this year is driven by the drop in interest rates and, therefore, our discount rate and some lower returns on investments over the short term. Importantly, we remain comfortable with our current funding levels. 
In addition to this item, we also had approximately $0.07 per diluted share of net expense related to an impairment charge for our Chef Boyardee brand, driven by our plans to improve the quality of the volume base, which we expect to result in lower net sales over the near term.
Next, we had approximately $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the previously announced planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. We also had approximately $0.03 per diluted share of net gain related to the mark-to-market impact of derivatives used to hedge input costs, temporarily classified in unallocated corporate expense.
And finally, we had several smaller items, including approximately $0.01 per diluted share of expense for recent developments in a legacy legal matter, approximately $0.01 per diluted share of benefit from selling certain assets within the Commercial Foods segment, approximately $0.01 per diluted share of expense for adjustments to prior year tax credits and about $0.01 of rounding.
On cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, we ended the quarter with $835 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Operating cash flows from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $1.05 billion versus $1.22 billion in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is driven principally by higher tax payments in the current fiscal year. 
On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $150 million versus $103 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $61 million in the fiscal fourth quarter versus $88 million in the year-ago quarter. And dividends for this fiscal quarter were $109 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter.
On capital allocation, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments.
For the year, we repaid approximately $2.5 billion of debt, mainly from the proceeds from the sale of the private label operations earlier this year. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, and we have approximately $132 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. 
Also, the company recently announced agreements to sell its Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business and the JM Swank business, each of which is part of the Commercial Foods segment. The transactions are expected to generate combined proceeds of approximately $480 million, and both transactions are expected to close during the fiscal first quarter of 2017.
As previously noted, we plan to utilize approximately $147 million of our capital loss carryforwards to substantially eliminate taxes that would otherwise be payable in connection with these sales. Also, the remaining capital loss of approximately $3.6 billion pretax or $1.4 billion after tax is available to offset capital gains over the next 5 years. We remain confident that the company will be able to realize significant tax benefits in the future as we work to reshape our portfolio in a disciplined manner. These proceeds are expected to be utilized as part of our broader balanced capital allocation plan.
Now I'd like to provide a few comments on our outlook for fiscal 2017. First of all, given the pending Lamb Weston spinoff, we are not in position today to provide EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. As we have noted, we believe our Investor Days will be the proper forum to provide both fiscal 2017 and long-term guidance for both companies.
Further, on the timing of the spinoff, we are on schedule to complete the spin this fall. We expect to file a Form 10 over the next couple of weeks. And once we get further into the Form 10 process later this summer, we expect to be in a position to provide dates for our Investor Days.
For fiscal 2017, while we are not in a position to provide full year EPS guidance, I would note the following: For Q1 fiscal 2017, we expect EPS growth to be in the mid- to high teens from our earnings base of $0.41, driven by continued focus on margin management across both our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments, continued strong top line performance in our Commercial Foods segment, increased benefits from our cost savings programs and lower interest costs. We will also continue to invest in capabilities to strengthen and position our brands for stronger growth over the long term.
Overall, we expect the positive trends from our fiscal 2016 to continue into fiscal 2017. We look forward to building out our long-term expectations at our Investor Day, at which time we can provide more details about portfolio segmentation and expectations for top line growth, margin expansion, capital allocation and financial policies, phasing of our SG&A and trade efficiency benefits, brand investment targets as well as the short-term impacts of any stranded costs associated with the planned Lamb Weston spinoff.
In closing, we are pleased with our fiscal 2016 performance and the changes we were able to execute to improve the long-term health of the company. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are confident that we're taking the right actions to drive attractive value creation over time.
That concludes our formal remarks. Before I turn it back over to Sean, I just wanted to briefly address my pending retirement. I am excited to begin the next phase of my life, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to allocate more time to my family and interests outside of business. I am equally excited, though, about the future of this company. I've enjoyed seeing the new team come together under Sean's leadership, and I'm confident that the company is on the right track. It's been a privilege to work at ConAgra Foods for the past 14-plus years and to have served as its CFO for the last 7.5. Lastly, I will miss the relationships I've developed with many of you in the analyst and investor community over the years, and I appreciate your interest in the company and the insights and questions you've shared over the years.
Now let me turn it back over to Sean."

So I guess I was a little surprised to see that price/mix in the quarter was flat despite the more significant volume decline in the quarter. So was there any specific reason, I guess, or discrete this quarter that we didn't see more of that come through? And then in the forward-looking commentary for the first quarter, price/mix was one of the things listed that was expected to be a positive contributor. So maybe what's expected to drive that improvement sequentially versus the pricing that did not come through in the fourth quarter?"

Let me just kind of set the background on price/mix. We think about pricing in terms of 3 components: the first, inflation-justified; the second driven by trade productivity; and the third, pricing in conjunction with brand and quality upgrades that we made. When you look at Q4, there are several things that are affecting price/mix in the quarter. Our pricing activities are focused on how do we increase our overall margin, which we did in the quarter. So in terms of inflation-justified pricing, we're being more disciplined and timely in pricing for commodity changes, both up and down. As you know, the vast majority of our brands are not in pass-through categories, but there are a couple categories that tend to be pass-through, and one of those is fresh meat. And in Q4, we saw protein deflation that we pass through on brands like Hebrew National and Odom's Tennessee Pride. So that was deflationary. We built our overall margins. We continue to make progress on the second piece in terms of our trade productivity. We committed to $100 million of productivity savings. That's going to show itself up into additional gross margin, which we saw in the quarter. You see it in the measured results. We're making progress in lowering our percent on deal, and you'll continue to see the positive impacts of that going forward. And then finally, when we rethink a brand like Banquet, which we talked about, we will increase our price with those product upgrades. In this quarter, we also launched a line of organic Healthy Choice Steamers at premium pricing, so that was a positive contributor. So what you see overall is the impact of this pricing in market; higher average price; lower promoted volumes; and importantly, a healthier, more profitable non-promoted base. So over time, I think what you can expect is that our pricing and margins will move up while there may be some quarter-on-quarter variations."

There's improvement in mix and then margin growth through renovation and innovation. So only the first -- really, inflation-justified pricing is only one component of margin, and we did see some deflation of protein. In light of that, we did see overall gross margins expand from the other components of our plan, particularly productivity and lower commodities. I think you see in market, our average price per unit is increasing. And our margins were up as a result of this holistic approach. Over time, our margins are going to grow. There's going to be quarter-on-quarter variations, but we're committed to continue to drive that holistic approach to margin expansion."

The fact of the matter is our absolute margins in consumer continue to be in a significantly improved position versus where they've been historically, and that's because of the discipline that we are driving. And we're going to continue to drive that discipline here in the next couple of quarters because we've got to cleanse out of our base some behaviors that were not adding to value. So you're going to continue to see -- as we've talked before, we want to see the centerline of our profitability move north over time. There may be some standard -- some variability around that quarter to quarter based on the dynamics of the quarter we're in, but our goal is to drive the centerline north over time and reduce the standard deviation around that centerline.

I think you asked a question about deflation in the quarter. I'd say it was fairly modest. I don't have the number off the top of my head, but commodities probably showed a little bit of favorability. Our conversion costs were probably up a little bit. As we look forward to FY '17, I would say we probably are looking at continued benign commodity markets as we sit here today. That probably means we may still have some modest inflation just because we're coming off such a low base of commodities.

But the important thing is to the extent we have inflation or commodity moves, I think as Tom has indicated and Sean has certainly indicated, I think our muscles and our capabilities around pricing and expanding margins in the face of either increasing or decreasing margins is much better than it was even a few years ago. So I think the whole margin management capability and the holistic capability for us to manage margins higher as commodities move around is much stronger."

First of all, if you look at our overall story in consumer, as I've said many times, we've got to remember this is a transformation we're undergoing here, not a flip of the switch. And on volume, in particular, the bottom line is this. It is an undeniable fact that our past promotional practices have embedded in our volume base a group of consumers who are not brand loyal, who only buy on hot deals and who contribute virtually nothing to our profitability. It's also true that by catering to them, we have underserved the bulk of our volume base, and these are consumers who would be willing to pay more for more contemporary, higher-quality offerings. The good news here is that -- around this whole dynamic is that it's reversible if we are willing to stick to our principles around optimizing mix and also refreshing the targeted brands for a new day. No one said this was going to be easy, but it is absolutely the right way to manage a branded asset for value creation. We know from years of experience what the alternative gets us, and that's precisely why we do not get spooked when we see volumes pull back and margins expand. It's exactly what we expect near in. In fact, I think in Q4, the volume back-off in consumer was in the ballpark of 3.7%, which, frankly, in the scheme of what we're trying to do of purging some of these really bad deep discount promotional behaviors is, frankly, small in my mind. So that is a key point. The endgame here is obviously what we're all about, which is stronger brands, better innovation, better margins and ultimately, stronger growth in shareholder returns. And recall in the last year, we recruited a new Chief Growth Officer to run our Growth Center of Excellence, and he is quite busy installing new work processes and raising our overall capability in this area. I'm looking forward to sharing some of these updates with you guys at Investor Day. But overall, I am quite optimistic around what the Growth Center of Excellence, in partnership with our brands, will be able to accomplish in this portfolio. In the meantime, we will absolutely let some of this non-investment-grade volume go, and we will happily take the associated margin expansion."

But ConAgra historically has probably been the least disciplined company in our space with respect to taking pricing when it's justified. But also, we've probably been the most over-reliant in terms of deep-discount trade, and we clearly need to undo that. But what I find interesting is you really see that in the scanner data right now. If you look at the percent of our total volume base sold on deal past 52 weeks, past 26, past 12 and past 4, you see sequential reductions in percent of our volume sold on deal, to the point where we've gone from being one of the most overpromoted companies in our space to one of the leaders. And obviously, as we do that, we're going to see some volume impact. We're going to see some efficiency, but we're also going to have to reinvest behind the brands in other ways, which is what we've done this year as you look at our A&P spend increase year-on-year. But with respect to the $100 million program that you're talking about, like the SG&A program, it will build sequentially across '16, '17 and '18, and a big part of that is because we are getting our sea legs. We're going from being fairly rough around the edges, so to speak, in terms of our capabilities here, to much more system-based, much more analytical. And once you develop the database on what's working, what's not, it's a virtuous cycle, you improve on it. So small amount of improvement this past year, ramping up this year and continuing to ramp up through '18. Did I miss anything there, Tom?"

First of all, we will go deep on that with our investors at Investor Day, and we'll have Darren Serrao literally walk through kind of how we went about the process because if you look at our branded portfolio, we have roughly 50 brands. And unlike kind of the old days, we're not going to take a first-horse-to-the-trough approach to resources around here on those 50 brands. We will be very disciplined around the role each of those brands play in creating value. The simplest way to think about it is, first, we look at where do we compete in categories that are fundamentally healthy and growing. And within those categories, do we have brands that are proven and strong competitors? If you see those markers, those are obviously places, especially assuming if you've got a good margin structure, where you're going to get a good return on A&P investment. So those become priorities in terms of renovating the brand, innovating the brand and supporting the brand. In other cases, we find we've got categories where, perhaps, the format has changed and it has shifted, but we still have, perhaps, leading -- the leading trademark with respect to the product, but we haven't moved into adjacencies or updated formats with the category. That's a simple kind of innovation opportunity, and that is existing because, frankly, we were just not minding the shop. There are other businesses where we have historically invested in innovation and growth, but that shouldn't be the role of those businesses. Those businesses are major cash contributors. They're in mature categories. They have excellent margin and cash flow, and we need to manage them for that because if we do that, that will provide fuel to really unlock all of the potential in higher-growth categories. And then as we look at the portfolio, there may be 1 or 2 things that we say, geez, we don't necessarily love the category. We don't necessarily have the answer in terms of what to do with these businesses. Maybe it's more valuable to somebody else than it is to us. And if we find those, we've got this capital loss carryforward that's an asset that we've got here for roughly the next 5 years. So it will be a holistic approach to improving the businesses we have, optimizing the mix within our portfolio. And also, if we see something on the outside that will be complementary to our portfolio, enable us to refresh our portfolio, especially in the areas of premium, gourmet, organic, natural, that could be a good enhancement and addition to our portfolio. We did Blake's last year. That was a small one, but it's the right kind of stuff to really round out our portfolio and capitalize on our manufacturing assets and capabilities."

In terms of Banquet, it's been a very consistent and reliable contributor to profits over time.

We are essentially just a couple of quarters into the migration. We did what's -- what I think is important to highlight is that we made product quality improvements in conjunction with the pricing. What we are seeing from a consumer standpoint is that there are certainly households that bought Banquet because it's a tremendous price value. We anticipated that we would lose some of those households. What we are beginning to see in the data is that the product quality upgrades are beginning to improve our repeat. So over time, we're going to see a business that our repeat purchase rate -- our purchase frequency builds.

Yes, innovation, obviously, is going to be a centerpiece of what our new Growth Center of Excellence is focused on and partnering with Tom's team on. And as you think about ConAgra with respect to innovation, I think you should anticipate that we will run the gamut from necessary renovation and even some of the stuff we've done this past year, where we've updated the packages' designs for the first time, literally, since the 80s. That's basic renovation stuff. It's not going to set the world on fire, but it is critically important to present our brands in a way that they look like they're from the modern era. But then we also are working on bolder innovations. As an example, last year, we conducted a test market of a new product called Wicked Kitchen in the Southeast, and we learned a tremendous amount. There were some really exciting things there. So the innovation team has been working on refreshing Wicked Kitchen, and we'll kind of show the market what that's going to look like when we do our Investor Day, along with some other things. In terms of the kinds of benefits that you should anticipate we'll bring, well, it will be across the board, and it will be in line with consumer trends, whether it's global flavor adventure, convenience, things like that. But in general, where we under-index in our portfolio the most is in -- really in, as I've talked about, the premium gourmet and then the natural organic. And by not really tapping into those consumers, we are missing incremental sales and profit opportunities. Number one, they tend to be higher dollar ring. Number two, they are totally incremental to a lot of the businesses we already have in terms of benefit. And number three, in most cases, we use our existing asset base, so it's very economically efficient. So we've got a full suite of things, and we'll kind of share a lot of this with you in the months and quarters ahead. One of the reasons we've been incredibly focused and aggressive on costs is because, frankly, it takes longer to rebuild your insight pipeline and rebuild your innovation pipeline. So we've kind of jumped all over costs. We moved aggressively, knowing that it takes some time to get the branded side of the innovation pipeline rebuilt. But that work has been behind the scenes, aggressively underway, and we've got some really exciting stuff coming. You saw some of the early stuff this past year with things like Healthy Choice Simply, which is a clean label line there that's done really well for us, and some other things.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our First Quarter Conference Call. This will be our last earnings call as ConAgra Foods as we anticipate completing the Lamb Weston spinoff this fall prior to the holidays. 
As you've probably seen by now, we announced the timing of dedicated investor days for each business. Lamb Weston's will be held in New York City on October 13, and ConAgra brands will be held on October 18 here in Chicago. Our teams are hard at work preparing for these meetings, and we are excited about the opportunity to take you through a deeper dive on these businesses and why we believe they will create significant value for investors as separate pure-play public companies. Each company will share more details, including financial outlooks and capital allocation priorities at these events. We are confident you will see the unique opportunities available to both companies and why each is well positioned to seize them. 
Now onto the state of the business and our first quarter results. Once again, it was a very busy quarter at ConAgra as we continue our disciplined and methodical approach to enhancing focus, expanding margins, improving efficiency, energizing our culture and ultimately creating value for our shareholders. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with the progress that we have made to date. 
At a high level, we saw strong results from both Lamb Weston and our branded consumer businesses. On Lamb, we once again saw what a terrific business this is. Sales were up, margins were up and profit was up. The team is looking forward to sharing much more about this jewel of a business on October 13. 
On our branded consumer businesses, we also made terrific progress. Here, we are seeing clear evidence that our strategy to upgrade our revenue base and expand margins is working. As we have discussed previously, we are intensely focused on positioning our U.S. branded portfolio for long-term success, and that starts with building a higher-quality revenue base. As we will discuss in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra brands, we compete in good categories with many well-known brands that are #1 or #2 in their categories. However, ConAgra historically prioritize volume over value and accordingly, we've been overly reliant on deep discounting as our chief demand driver, leading us to under invest and under deliver on brand building and innovation. In short, we under leveraged some of our greatest asset. 
The result of this behavior is a revenue base that is overdeveloped in terms of the presence of low loyalty, price-focused consumer. The problem with catering to these consumers is that, a, it caused us to neglect the needs of the vast majority of our consumer base. People who are hungry for innovation and premiumization and, b, it fundamentally limited our ability to drive higher margins. We are changing that. Specifically, to ensure we leverage our brand strength and unlock our margin potential, we have been methodically infusing focus and discipline around pricing and trade promotion while investing in brand building and innovation. Said differently, we are focusing our efforts on practices that support value over volume and walking away from our previous practices that concentrated on volume over value. It is important to understand that while our efforts to improve brand building and innovation are broad-based, the volume declines we're experiencing are largely concentrated within brands that historically targeted the price-focused consumer and heavily relied on deep discounts and promotion to drive volume. In fact, if you dig into the scanner data, you will see that more than 80% of our Q1 volume declines can be attributed to just 6 brands that have historically been underpriced and over promoted. We are confident that our actions represent the right way to maximize the value of our branded portfolio over time. 
As a supporting data point, gross margins on our U.S. retail brands are up about 700 basis points since Q1 2 years ago. As we continue to execute this strategy, we believe our revenue base will be better positioned to deliver stronger, more consistent performance over the long term. 
We have framed our efforts here around 5 portfolio management principles, or PMPs as we call them, which guide how we intend to manage our branded portfolio going forward. At our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we will go deep on each of these, but I want to give you a sense of our approach. 
PMP #1 is upgrading the revenue base. The second PMP is refreshing the core. PMP #3 is assigning clear portfolio roles. The fourth PMP is ramping up innovation and M&A. And the fifth PMP is effectively backing the winners. These principles represent a tried-and-true approach and in a few weeks, we will discuss the progress we're making on each and how they will help building more focus, higher-margin and higher-performing branded food company over time. 
One note that on PMP #4, ramping up innovation and M&A. I'm sure you've all seen the news from earlier this week about our acquisition of the Frontera, Red Fork and Salpica brands. These businesses make authentic gourmet Mexican food and contemporary American cooking sauces. We believe this gives us another great platform to provide consumers with unique, high-quality food products. And as an extra enticement to attend our Investor Day on October 18, I promise you will have a chance to sample these tremendous brands. 
While we have a lot more work to do, I want to acknowledge our sales force for doing an excellent job working with our retailers to explain how our change in strategy benefits them as well as ConAgra. Similarly, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team for anticipating these volume changes and proactively offsetting any loss absorption benefits. 
With that context in mind, let's turn to our Q1 results. Q1 net sales declined 5%, and the impact of divestitures and FX represented about 2 percentage points of the decline. As I mentioned at the outset, Lamb Weston delivered another strong top line this quarter, offset by sales report in our domestic consumer business. 
In the U.S. consumer market, which as you know, is challenged across our competitive set, we saw declines due to the actions I just outlined related to upgrading our revenue base. This, along with the impact of FX, more than offset an increase in price and mix. Overall profitability was driven by growth and margin expansion in Lamb Weston as well as continued strong gross margin expansion in our domestic consumer businesses. As a result, total segment adjusted operating profit was up 23%. Additionally, our supply chain team continues to excel at finding more efficient ways to manufacture our products and reduce costs. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.61 for the quarter, representing 49% growth from the prior year, significantly in excess of our mid- to high teens growth estimate. As Dave will point down, some of this is timing related. 
Now turning to segment performance. As you saw in this morning's release, we are now reporting results in 5 reporting segments: Grocery and snacks, refrigerated and frozen, international, foodservice and commercial. The grocery and snacks, the refrigerated and frozen, the international and the foodservice segments represent the businesses that will remain with ConAgra Brands and will become the primary 4 [ph] reporting segments of the independent company post spend. The commercial segment consists primarily of the Lamb Weston business. 
Starting with the grocery and snacks segment. Net sales decreased 5% based on the actions I just discussed. These efforts, coupled with increased pricing and trade productivity, savings and supply chain and continued SG&A discipline, helped drive growth of 31% in adjusted segment operating income, which translated to a 680 basis points expansion in adjusted segment operating margin. The volume declines in this segment were largely concentrated on a few brands where we are reversing our historical practice of promoting below the $1 price point. Chef Boyardee, and snack pack are good examples. Importantly, we saw the margin and profit expansion that we were counting on. Equally important, key sales fundamentals like distribution remained on plan, reflecting customer support for our strategy shift towards stronger brands and innovation. Keep in mind, the plan does include some important SKU rationalization. So when you see TPDs pull back in the near term, recognize that is part of a disciplined program to reduce non-value added complexity while increasing facings and velocity on priority SKUs. You'll hear more about this at our ConAgra Brands Investor Day in Dave Biggers [ph] supply chain presentation. 
Last point I'll make in this segment is that we continue to benefit from disciplined investment behind A&P-ready brands, such as Slim Jim and PAM, among others. 
Now turning to the refrigerated and frozen segments. Net sales decreased 8% while adjusted operating profit increased by 310 basis points to 16% of net sales. The volume decline in this segment was heavily focused on banquet, an important brand, as you know, is going through a significant makeover. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work to restage our Banquet brand resulting in increased pricing associated with long-overdue product and packaging upgrades. Accordingly, this was the primary driver of the volume and sales decline in the segment for the quarter. Banquet is now benefiting from much stronger margins, and our consumer data is also showing an improving buying rate from our most loyal consumers at key customers. As we move through the next calendar year and begin to wrap these actions, you will see top line sales declines moderate. From there, we will also fold in new product improvements and innovation. 
Regarding segment profitability here in Q1, our disciplined pricing actions and supply chain productivity more than offset the Banquet impact and the costs related to a product recall. One other planned action in Q1 is worth noting in frozen. While Marie [ph] calendars is not one of our historically over promoted brands, it was over promoted in the year-ago period, and that was not a good business decision so we did not repeat it in Q1 this year. These 2 contributed to our volume decline, but again, we saw the margin gains we were counting on. Elsewhere in the segment, we saw solid top line performance namely in Reddi-wip, which continues to be a strong performer for us. 
The international segment, net sales decreased 6% due to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the effects of currency, segment net sales would have been approximately equal to the prior year's comparable quarter. Net sales for the foodservice segment decreased 1%, and adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $24 million. This segment was negatively affected by normalization of egg prices after last year's avian influenza outbreak. 
Overall, the 4 segments that will primarily comprise ConAgra Brands' ongoing operation post spin have made good progress, demonstrating the strength of our plan and the opportunity that lies ahead. Much of our team have completed their first full quarter in our new headquarters in Chicago, at the Merchandise Mart, and there is tremendous energy and excitement to build upon our momentum as a pure-play branded company. 
Now turning to commercial foods. As I said at the outset of my remarks, Lamb Weston delivered another great quarter, generating approximately 4% net sales growth. In our reported results, the strength of Lamb Weston's performance is masked by the fact that we include the impact of the divestures of Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank, which were completed at the end of July. 
Adjusted segment operating profit grew 33% in the quarter behind Lamb Weston's continued growth and favorable input costs. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business, leveraging its strong brand to capture emerging markets and international growth. Tom and the Lamb team look forward to sharing much more during their Investor Day on October 13 in New York. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of our talented employees. Amidst significant change, including a successful move to our new headquarters, our team remained focused on delivering our goals and serving our customers. In addition to driving strong performance, our team is also dedicated to being a good corporate citizen, and we were honored to be named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the sixth [ph] consecutive year, demonstrating recognition of our commitment to environmental and social goals in addition to economic objectives. 
Now turning to one of our newest team members, I would like to welcome our new CFO, Dave Marberger, who joins us from Prestige brands. Dave brings more than 30 years of finance and leadership experience to ConAgra Foods, including 10 years as the CFO at Khedive Chocolatier Tier and Tasty Baking Company. I first got to know Dave during his time with the Campbell Soup Company, and Dave is a proven and accomplished finance executive and I am confident he will be a tremendous asset going forward. We are extremely happy to welcome him to the team. 
With that, Dave, over to you."

I look forward to getting to know many of you and the investor community in the weeks a",1783,"Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into my comments, I would like to say how energized I am to be part of this organization and leadership team. I look forward to getting to know many of you and the investor community in the weeks and months ahead. I will address several topics in my comments, including our new reporting segments; a recap of our 2017 fiscal first quarter performance; a summary of items impacting comparability, including some brief comments on goodwill impairment, cash flow, capital allocation and the policy; and some brief comments on our upcoming Investor Day. As we outlined in the release, we now report our business results in 5 segments. They are grocery and snacks, refrigerated and frozen, international, foodservice and commercial. The grocery and snacks, refrigerated and frozen and international segments were previously included in our Consumer Foods segment, and foodservice was previously included in our Commercial Foods segment. Upon the completion of the Lamb Weston spin, the commercial segment will include only the historical results of JM Swank and Spicetec through the divestiture date, and the Lamb Weston results will be reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
Now I will provide some comments on our performance for our fiscal 2017 first quarter. Please note that references to adjusted earnings or operating profit referred to measures that exclude items impacting comparability. Overall, net sales for the fiscal first quarter approximated $2.7 billion, down 5% from the year-ago quarter. The divestiture of JM Swank and Spicetec and the negative impact of foreign exchange accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the net sales decline versus the year-ago quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fiscal first quarter of $0.42 compared with $0.38 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.61, 49% above the $0.41 delivered in the year-ago quarter and better than we planned. The strong first quarter EPS performance primarily reflects the benefits from continued gross margin expansion, lower SG&A expense and lower interest expense, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume, lower earnings from our ardent Mills joint venture and some cost related to a product recall. As I will discuss later, the first quarter over delivery versus our plan was driven, in part, by timing items for both SG&A and A&P expense. 
In our grocery and snacks segment, net sales were $757 million for the quarter, down 5% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 6% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $185 million in the first quarter versus $142 million in the year-ago quarter. The strong increase in adjusted profit reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts, driven by pricing discipline and favorable product cost and productivity; reduce SG&A costs; and lower ANP spending due to timing, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume. 
In our refrigerated and frozen segment, net sales were $605 million for the quarter, down 8% from the year-ago period, reflecting an 11% decline in volume and a 3% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $97 million in the first quarter versus $85 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in adjusted profit reflects the same continued progress on margin expansion efforts as outlined for the grocery and snacks segment, offset by approximately $9 million of costs related to a product recall. 
In our international segment, net sales were $195 million for the quarter, down 6% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 2% decline in volume, a 1.5% improvement in price mix and a negative 5% impact from foreign change. We reported a segment operating loss of $149 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by a pretax impairment charge of $164 million related to our Canadian business. I'll say more about this shortly. 
Adjusted segment operating profit was $15 million in the first quarter versus $17 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in adjusted profit reflects lower sales in gross margins and a negative impact from FX, partially offset by modestly lower A&P and SG&A expenses. 
In our foodservice segment, net sales were $268 million for the quarter, down 1% from the year-ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $24 million in the first quarter versus $26 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower sales in gross margins, partially offset by lower A&P and SG&A expenses. 
In the commercial segment, net sales were $843 million or 2% below the prior year quarter, driven by the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures. Lamb Weston had a very solid quarter as net sales increased 4% versus the prior year quarter. The commercial segment's adjusted operating profit was $148 million versus $112 million in the year-ago quarter. This strong increase was driven primarily by the net sales growth and margin expansion in our Lamb Weston business, partially offset by the profit decline resulting from the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures during the quarter. We realized proceeds of $486 million from these divestitures and recognized an aggregate book gain of approximately $198 million. We expect to utilize the capital loss tax asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to these divestitures. 
In addition to the segment information, I will also note the following matters related to corporate or total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $24 million for the current quarter and $37 million in the year-ago period. The decline principally reflects lower profits from our Ardent Mills joint venture. Adjusted corporate expenses were $38 million in the fiscal quarter versus $66 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts, along with lower costs related to the timing of certain expenses that will come later in the fiscal year. Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $69 million, down 18% from the prior year quarter. Most of these decline was due to the timing of expense that will be incurred later in the fiscal year. Despite this lower spend, total gross rating points for our A&P investments were up 7% for the first quarter versus a year ago, reflecting improved efficiency. For the first quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $11 million and operating profit by $4 million versus the year-ago quarter. 
Moving on to our SG&A cost-saving initiatives. We are making very good progress and expect to realize the remainder of our $200 million of SG&A savings over the next few years, as planned. While we saw significant benefits from SG&A savings in the first quarter, I would point out that some of these benefit was due to the timing of certain expenses moving to later in the fiscal year. We estimate that the benefit from timing for SG&A was $25 million to $30 million in the first quarter. 
I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter. We had $0.34 per diluted share of net expense related to impairment charges. Approximately $140 million pretax relates to impairment of goodwill and approximately $24 million pretax relates to impairment of intangible brand assets, both related to our Canadian business. The charges are principally the result of several factors. First, the change in our reporting segments now requires us to evaluate goodwill at a lower level. In the past, under the previous reporting segments, we were only required to evaluate goodwill at the total international business level. We are now required to evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit within the international segment. 
Second, while the performance of our international business has been steady over the last several years on a constant currency basis, the significant weakening of the Canadian dollar has negatively impacted the value of the Canadian business on a U.S. dollar basis, which is used for the goodwill analysis. 
Finally, the brand impairment reflects both the unfavorable foreign exchange movements as well as some weaker top line trends in this portion of the business. 
In addition to the impairment charges, we recognized $0.17 per diluted share of net gain from the sale of the JM Swank and Spicetec businesses. We also recognized $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. And finally, we recognized approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net benefit from favorable adjustments state tax assets. 
Moving onto cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $795 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the first quarter were $337 million versus $64 million in the year-ago quarter. This significant increase is due to the improved operating earnings in the current quarter and higher-than-normal income tax payments in the year-ago quarter. For the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $117 million versus $102 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million in the fiscal first quarter versus $80 million in the year-ago quarter due to the paydown of debt during the past 12 months. For the quarter, we paid down approximately $554 million of long-term debt, and dividends for this fiscal quarter were $110 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $86 million, and we had approximately 46 million remaining -- $46 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization as of the end of the first quarter. We continue to remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments. 
Lastly, our estimated effective tax rate for income from operations remains at 33.5% for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. The first quarter reported tax rate was higher primarily from tax impacts of the noncash impairment charge and the gain on the sale of JM Swank and Spicetec. 
As we have noted in the release, we are not providing any comments on our outlook today. Instead, we will provide more information on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and the long-term algorithm for both ConAgra brands and Lamb Weston at our upcoming investor days. We are excited about opportunities to create value for both of these companies. 
This concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I, along with Tom McGough and Tom Warner, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session."

But on gross margin, obviously, there are a number of different things that are contributing to the gains we are seeing and the gain -- the size of the gains do vary quarter-to-quarter. But the important fact is that over the past 2 years, we've made tremendous progress at gross margin and operating margin, and you saw that again this quarter. Quarter-to-quarter, the progress may vary due to a number of factors, but what I'm focused on is that we continue to move the centerline of our profitability North over time while reducing the standard deviation around that centerline. On supply chain, look, first, clearly, the overall goal of our collective efforts is value and margin maximization. And supply chain productivity programs have always been, and will continue to be, an important component of that. And as Dave Beer [ph] will share at our upcoming ConAgra Brands Investor Day, strong productivity has been a legacy strength at ConAgra, and you saw some of that also this quarter. We do have a strong track record of continuous improvement in terms of network optimization, procurement, TNW, et cetera. And now that we're upgrading our volume base and reducing low-margin business, we are providing a better foundation to build off of as we plan for future margin accretive innovation. And Dave has obviously brought a fresh perspective around how to sustain that strong historic supply chain performance and build on it even further, and he'll share those views in a few weeks."

It's one of the reasons why we move so aggressively on the $300 million efficiency program right out of the gate is because we wanted to stay out ahead of this stuff. Similarly, it's the same reason our supply chain team is aggressively trying to get out ahead of any absorption benefits that we might lose when we pull back on volume. So we tried to look around corners. We try to anticipate it and then we try to stay ahead of it. So with respect to ConAgra Brands, sure, there will be some modest stranded as we go ahead and step through these things but that's part of the reasons why you see us getting so aggressive on costs. Lamb is a stand-alone company, and you'll see the details on that in the Form-10. And obviously when you set up a stand-alone company, you're going to incur some unique costs for doing that but obviously, we strongly believe the benefit of having Lamb as an independent pure-play company with its great performance and growth prospects is really the story there.

First of all, what we're doing is it is a bit like any of you have remodeled a house, it's a bit like that. The process is a bit messy, but if you want to get to the desired outcome, you've got to go to the process. And this is a transformation that we're undertaking here, and our approach is to value profitable growth, not any growth but we do keep a close eye on markers to make sure that the business is in control and doing what we planned. So as an example, if you get into that scanner data and you peel it back, you'll see obvious things that you should expect such as baseline trends being significantly different than promoted trends. And then furthermore, if you get into baseline velocities, you will see that our base line velocities are, in fact, quite stable. You will see TPDs going back, but you'll see TPDs going back because we, along with being very focused on price, have infused into the marketplace over a number of years a long tail of low margins, nonproductive SKUs of multiple sizes that we are, frankly, they have no value so we've to get them out. Our customers appreciate that. It's part of being a good category managers. And then the key is to continue to support the items that are moving at strong velocities, contemporizing them, refreshing them and then adding to them with new innovation and then ultimately proper marketing support. Now with respect to your question of marketing support and the quarter, yes, A&P was down. Some of that is timing because we do want to align our A&P spend with planned in-market like innovation watches and key promotions, things like that. So some of it's timing, but some of it is just good discipline and getting rid of nonworking or attempted working marketing that just, frankly, wasn't. And that is you see -- and also buying better. Your GRPs were up 7% in the quarter on a fewer dollars, so impact was reasonably respectable. And I think it's important that we keep that kind of support out there while we're taking some of these promotion item so we can really evolve the conversation with our consumer to be about something other than price. And that's what we're doing. We'll talk about this quite extensively along with things like portfolio segmentation strategy in a few weeks at our Investor Day."

On the notion that some retailers may be asking for more promotion, quite frankly, that tends to vary fairly meaningfully by category depending upon what a retailer's objectives are with particular category. In general, our customers are asking us for growth and innovation. They want to see us evolve our brand so that we're not competing on price, so that we're competing on quality measures. You see customers giving more and more real state to these challenger brands that have modern food attributes like natural organic premium. These are the things that consumers are demanding, and this is what many of our retailers in our categories are prioritizing. And it's precisely why we're evolving the businesses that we own as well as adding new businesses that are complementarity like Frontera, Blakes and others like that. With respect to our volume piece, let's go back to the point in my prepared remarks, I think, that really describe it best. This is a -- our actions are broad-based but the volume decline, when you add it up, is incredibly concentrated. And in our case, it was [indiscernible] 6 brands. Each of which has its own story as to what we're doing and why we are doing it. But if you use Banquet as an example because that's the big here, here's how to think about Banquet. The bottom line is locking a brand into a $1 price point for decade. It's just not a good business decision because it puts relentless pressure on margins and in turn, food quality. And at the same time, it retrains our Banquet loyalists to buy on ordeal. So the change is long overdue. And while the topline optics can be ugly until you wrap a year later, it's up over 300 basis points, the business and grows margin, which is excellent news. Now we got to continue to support the bus with levers other than price. And that's what we're going to do, and that's what our customers are counting on us to do."

For a long time, our brands communicated deal. We are a deal brand and interestingly, even low income consumers are very interested in a brand communicating with them on other means. For example, there was a period of time in our past where our PAM business was heavily promoted and the only trick in the book that we turn to was dealing. But if you look at consumer trends in oil over the last few years, you see that the oils have changes, moved to things like olive oil, things like coconut oil. So instead of computing on PAM on a price attributes, we've evolved the PAM business, and we've got Olive Oil PAM. We've got Coconut Oil PAM. These are relevant modern-day attributes that changed the discussion with the consumer to be about something that they value and they will pay more for and not about deep discounting. That's just one example. We'll talk more examples at our Investor Day, but that's exactly what we need to do to get really the loyalty up on our business, get our prices up and build our overall brand strength to make it as modern as it can be."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our First Quarter Conference Call. This will be our last earnings call as ConAgra Foods as we anticipate completing the Lamb Weston spin-off this fall prior to the holidays.
As you've probably seen by now, we announced the timing of dedicated Investor Days for each business. Lamb Weston's will be held in New York City on October 13, and ConAgra Brands will be held on October 18 here in Chicago. Our teams are hard at work preparing for these meetings, and we are excited about the opportunity to take you through a deeper dive on these businesses and why we believe they will create significant value for investors as separate pure-play public companies. Each company will share more details, including financial outlooks and capital allocation priorities at these events. We are confident you will see the unique opportunities available to both companies and why each is well positioned to seize them.
Now on to the state of the business and our first quarter results. Once again, it was a very busy quarter at ConAgra as we continue our disciplined and methodical approach to enhancing focus, expanding margins, improving efficiency, energizing our culture and ultimately, creating value for our shareholders. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with the progress that we have made to date.
At a high level, we saw strong results from both Lamb Weston and our branded consumer businesses. On Lamb, we once again saw what a terrific business this is. Sales were up, margins were up and profit was up. The team is looking forward to sharing much more about this jewel of a business on October 13.
On our branded consumer businesses, we also made terrific progress. Here, we are seeing clear evidence that our strategy to upgrade our revenue base and expand margins is working. As we have discussed previously, we are intensely focused on positioning our U.S. branded portfolio for long-term success and that starts with building a higher-quality revenue base. As we will discuss in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we compete in good categories with many well-known brands that are #1 or #2 in their categories. However, ConAgra historically prioritized volume over value and accordingly, we've been overly reliant on deep discounting as our chief demand driver, leading us to underinvest and underdeliver on brand building and innovation. In short, we underleveraged some of our greatest assets.
The result of this behavior is a revenue-based that is overdeveloped in terms of the presence of low-loyalty, price-focused consumers. The problem with catering to these consumers is that: a, it caused us to neglect the needs of the vast majority of our consumer base, people who are hungry for innovation and premiumization and, b, it fundamentally limited our ability to drive higher margins. We are changing that. Specifically, to ensure we leverage our brand strength and unlock our margin potential, we have been methodically infusing focus and discipline around pricing and trade promotion while investing in brand building and innovation. To say it differently, we are focusing our efforts on practices that support value over volume and walking away from our previous practices that concentrated on volume over value. It is important to understand that while our efforts to improve brand building and innovation are broad-based, the volume declines we're experiencing are largely concentrated within brands that historically targeted the price-focused consumer and heavily relied on deep discounts and promotion to drive volume. In fact, if you dig into the scanner data, you will see that more than 80% of our Q1 volume declines can be attributed to just 6 brands that have historically been underpriced and overpromoted. We are confident that our actions represent the right way to maximize the value of our branded portfolio over time.
As a supporting data point, gross margins on our U.S. retail brands are up about 700 basis points since Q1 2 years ago. As we continue to execute this strategy, we believe our revenue base will be better positioned to deliver stronger, more consistent performance over the long term.
We have framed our efforts here around 5 portfolio management principles, or PMPs as we call them, which guide how we intend to manage our branded portfolio going forward. At our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we will go deep on each of these, but I want to give you a sense of our approach.
PMP #1 is upgrading the revenue base. The second PMP is refreshing the core. PMP #3 is assigning clear portfolio roles. The fourth PMP is ramping up innovation and M&A. And the fifth PMP is effectively backing the winners. These principles represent a tried-and-true approach and in a few weeks, we will discuss the progress we're making on each and how they will help build a more focused, higher-margin and higher-performing branded food company over time.
One note on PMP #4, ramping up innovation and M&A. I'm sure you've all seen the news from earlier this week about our acquisition of the Frontera, Red Fork and Salpica brands. These businesses make authentic gourmet Mexican food and contemporary American cooking sauces. We believe this gives us another great platform to provide consumers with unique, high-quality food products. And as an extra enticement to attend our Investor Day on October 18, I promise you will have a chance to sample these tremendous brands.
While we have a lot more work to do, I want to acknowledge our sales force for doing an excellent job working with our retailers to explain how our change in strategy benefits them as well as ConAgra. Similarly, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team for anticipating these volume changes and proactively offsetting any loss absorption benefits.
With that context in mind, let's turn to our Q1 results. Q1 net sales declined 5% and the impact of divestitures and FX represented about 2 percentage points of the decline. As I mentioned at the outset, Lamb Weston delivered another strong top line this quarter, offset by sales results in our domestic consumer business.
In the U.S. consumer market, which, as you know, is challenged across our competitive set, we saw declines due to the actions I just outlined related to upgrading our revenue base. This, along with the impact of FX, more than offset an increase in price and mix. Overall profitability was driven by growth and margin expansion in Lamb Weston as well as continued strong gross margin expansion in our domestic consumer businesses. As a result, total segment adjusted operating profit was up 23%. Additionally, our supply chain team continues to excel at finding more efficient ways to manufacture our products and reduce costs. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.61 for the quarter, representing 49% growth from the prior year, significantly in excess of our mid- to high teens growth estimate. As Dave will point out, some of this is timing related.
Now turning to segment performance. As you saw in this morning's release, we are now reporting results in 5 reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, the Refrigerated & Frozen, the International and the Foodservice segments represent the businesses that will remain with ConAgra Brands and will become the primary 4 reporting segments of the independent company postspin. The Commercial segment consists primarily of the Lamb Weston business.
Starting with the Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales decreased 5% based on the actions I just discussed. These efforts, coupled with increased pricing and trade productivity, savings and supply chain and continued SG&A discipline, helped drive growth of 31% in adjusted segment operating income, which translated to a 680 basis points expansion in adjusted segment operating margin. The volume declines in this segment were largely concentrated on a few brands where we are reversing our historical practice of promoting below the $1 price point. Chef Boyardee, and Snack Pack are good examples. Importantly, we saw the margin and profit expansion that we were counting on. Equally important, key sales fundamentals, like distribution, remained on plan, reflecting customer support for our strategy shift towards stronger brands and innovation. Keep in mind, the plan does include some important SKU rationalization. So when you see TPDs pull back in the near term, recognize that is part of a disciplined program to reduce nonvalue-added complexity while increasing facings and velocity on priority SKUs. You'll hear more about this at our ConAgra Brands Investor Day in Dave Biegger's supply chain presentation.
Last point I'll make in this segment is that we continue to benefit from disciplined investment behind A&P-ready brands, such as Slim Jim and PAM among others.
Now turning to the Refrigerated & Frozen segment. Net sales decreased 8% while adjusted operating profit increased by 310 basis points to 16% of net sales. The volume decline in this segment was heavily focused on Banquet, an important brand, as you know, is going through a significant makeover. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work to restage our Banquet brand resulting in increased pricing associated with long-overdue product and packaging upgrades. Accordingly, this was the primary driver of the volume and sales decline in the segment for the quarter. Banquet is now benefiting from much stronger margins, and our consumer data is also showing an improving buying rate from our most loyal consumers and key customers. As we move through the next calendar year and begin to wrap these actions, you will see top line sales declines moderate. From there, we will also fold in new product improvements and innovation.
Regarding segment profitability here in Q1, our disciplined pricing actions and supply chain productivity more than offset the Banquet impact and the costs related to a product recall. One other planned action in Q1 is worth noting in Frozen. While Marie Callender's is not one of our historically overpromoted brands, it was overpromoted in the year-ago period. And that was not a good business decision, so we did not repeat it in Q1 this year. These 2 contributed to our volume decline, but, again, we saw the margin gains we were counting on. Elsewhere in the segment, we saw solid top line performance, namely in Reddi-wip, which continues to be a strong performer for us.
The International segment, net sales decreased 6% due to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the effects of currency, segment net sales would have been approximately equal to the prior year's comparable quarter. Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 1%, and adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $24 million. This segment was negatively affected by normalization of egg prices after last year's avian influenza outbreak.
Overall, the 4 segments that will primarily comprise ConAgra Brands' ongoing operation postspin have made good progress, demonstrating the strength of our plan and the opportunity that lies ahead. Much of our team have completed their first full quarter in our new headquarters in Chicago, at the Merchandise Mart, and there is tremendous energy and excitement to build upon our momentum as a pure-play branded company.
Now turning to Commercial foods. As I said at the outset of my remarks, Lamb Weston delivered another great quarter, generating approximately 4% net sales growth. In our reported results, the strength of Lamb Weston's performance is masked by the fact that we include the impact of the divestures of Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank, which were completed at the end of July.
Adjusted segment operating profit grew 33% in the quarter behind Lamb Weston's continued growth and favorable input costs. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business, leveraging its strong brand to capture emerging markets and international growth. Tom and the Lamb team look forward to sharing much more during their Investor Day on October 13 in New York. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of our talented employees. Amidst significant change, including a successful move to our new headquarters, our team remained focused on delivering our goals and serving our customers. In addition to driving strong performance, our team is also dedicated to being a good corporate citizen, and we were honored to be named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (sic) [ Dow Jones Sustainability Indices ] for the sixth consecutive year, demonstrating recognition of our commitment to environmental and social goals in addition to economic objectives.
Now turning to one of our newest team members, I would like to welcome our new CFO, Dave Marberger, who joins us from Prestige Brands. Dave brings more than 30 years of finance and leadership experience to ConAgra Foods, including 10 years as the CFO at Godiva Chocolatier and Tasty Baking Company. I first got to know Dave during his time with the Campbell Soup Company, and Dave is a proven and accomplished finance executive, and I am confident he will be a tremendous asset going forward. We are extremely happy to welcome him to the team.
With that, Dave, over to you."

Before I get into my comments, I would like to say how energized I am to be part of this organization and leadership team. I look forward to getting to know many of you and the investor community in the weeks and months ahead. I will address several topics in my comments, including our new reporting segments; a recap of our 2017 fiscal first quarter performance; a summary of items impacting comparability, including some brief comments on goodwill impairment, cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet; and some brief comments on our upcoming Investor Day. As we outlined in the release, we now report our business results in 5 segments. They are Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments were previously included in our Consumer Foods segment and Foodservice was previously included in our Commercial Foods segment. Upon the completion of the Lamb Weston spin, the commercial segment will include only the historical results of JM Swank and Spicetec through the divestiture date, and the Lamb Weston results will be reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Now I will provide some comments on our performance for our fiscal 2017 first quarter. Please note that references to adjusted earnings or operating profit referred to measures that exclude items impacting comparability. Overall, net sales for the fiscal first quarter approximated $2.7 billion, down 5% from the year-ago quarter. The divestiture of JM Swank and Spicetec and the negative impact of foreign exchange accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the net sales decline versus the year-ago quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fiscal first quarter of $0.42 compared with $0.38 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.61, 49% above the $0.41 delivered in the year-ago quarter and better than we planned. The strong first quarter EPS performance primarily reflects the benefits from continued gross margin expansion, lower SG&A expense and lower interest expense, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume, lower earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture and some costs related to a product recall. As I will discuss later, the first quarter overdelivery versus our plan was driven, in part, by timing items for both SG&A and A&P expense.
In our Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales were $757 million for the quarter, down 5% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 6% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $185 million in the first quarter versus $142 million in the year-ago quarter. The strong increase in adjusted profit reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts, driven by pricing discipline and favorable product cost and productivity; reduced SG&A costs; and lower A&P spending due to timing, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume.
In our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, net sales were $605 million for the quarter, down 8% from the year-ago period, reflecting an 11% decline in volume and a 3% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $97 million in the first quarter versus $85 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in adjusted profit reflects the same continued progress on margin expansion efforts as outlined for the Grocery & Snacks segment, offset by approximately $9 million of costs related to a product recall.
In our International segment, net sales were $195 million for the quarter, down 6% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 2% decline in volume, a 1.5% improvement in price mix and a negative 5% impact from foreign exchange. We reported a segment operating loss of $149 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by a pretax impairment charge of $164 million related to our Canadian business. I'll say more about this shortly.
Adjusted segment operating profit was $15 million in the first quarter versus $17 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in adjusted profit reflects lower sales in gross margins and a negative impact from FX, partially offset by modestly lower A&P and SG&A expenses.
In our Foodservice segment, net sales were $268 million for the quarter, down 1% from the year-ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $24 million in the first quarter versus $26 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower sales in gross margins, partially offset by lower A&P and SG&A expenses.
In the Commercial segment, net sales were $843 million or 2% below the prior year quarter, driven by the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures. Lamb Weston had a very solid quarter as net sales increased 4% versus the prior year quarter. The commercial segment's adjusted operating profit was $148 million versus $112 million in the year-ago quarter. This strong increase was driven primarily by the net sales growth and margin expansion in our Lamb Weston business, partially offset by the profit decline resulting from the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures during the quarter. We realized proceeds of $486 million from these divestitures and recognized an aggregate book gain of approximately $198 million. We expect to utilize the capital loss tax asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to these divestitures.
In addition to the segment information, I will also note the following matters related to corporate or total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $24 million for the current quarter and $37 million in the year-ago period. The decline principally reflects lower profits from our Ardent Mills joint venture. Adjusted corporate expenses were $38 million in the fiscal quarter versus $66 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts, along with lower costs related to the timing of certain expenses that will come later in the fiscal year. Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $69 million, down 18% from the prior year quarter. Most of this decline was due to the timing of expense that will be incurred later in the fiscal year. Despite this lower spend, total gross rating points for our A&P investments were up 7% for the first quarter versus a year ago, reflecting improved efficiency. For the first quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $11 million and operating profit by $4 million versus the year-ago quarter.
Moving on to our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making very good progress and expect to realize the remainder of our $200 million of SG&A savings over the next 2 years as planned. While we saw significant benefits from SG&A savings in the first quarter, I would point out that some of this benefit was due to the timing of certain expenses moving to later in the fiscal year. We estimate that the benefit from timing for SG&A was $25 million to $30 million in the first quarter.
I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter. We had $0.34 per diluted share of net expense related to impairment charges. Approximately $140 million pretax relates to impairment of goodwill and approximately $24 million pretax relates to impairment of intangible brand assets, both related to our Canadian business. The charges are principally the result of several factors. First, the change in our reporting segments now requires us to evaluate goodwill at a lower level. In the past, under the previous reporting segments, we were only required to evaluate goodwill at the total International business level. We are now required to evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit within the International segment.
Second, while the performance of our International business has been steady over the last several years on a constant currency basis, the significant weakening of the Canadian dollar has negatively impacted the value of the Canadian business on a U.S. dollar basis, which is used for the goodwill analysis.
Finally, the brand impairment reflects both the unfavorable foreign exchange movements as well as some weaker top line trends in this portion of the business.
In addition to the impairment charges, we recognized $0.17 per diluted share of net gain from the sale of the JM Swank and Spicetec businesses. We also recognized $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. And finally, we recognized approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net benefit from favorable adjustments to state tax assets.
Moving on to cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $795 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the first quarter were $337 million versus $64 million in the year-ago quarter. This significant increase is due to the improved operating earnings in the current quarter and higher-than-normal income tax payments in the year-ago quarter. For the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $117 million versus $102 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million in the fiscal first quarter versus $80 million in the year-ago quarter due to the paydown of debt during the past 12 months. For the quarter, we paid down approximately $554 million of long-term debt, and dividends for this fiscal quarter were $110 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $86 million, and we had approximately $46 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization as of the end of the first quarter. We continue to remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments.
Lastly, our estimated effective tax rate for income from operations remains at 33.5% for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. The first quarter reported tax rate was higher primarily from the tax impacts of the noncash impairment charge and the gain on the sale of JM Swank and Spicetec.
As we have noted in the release, we are not providing any comments on our outlook today. Instead, we will provide more information on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and the long-term algorithm for both ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston at our upcoming Investor Days. We are excited about the opportunities to create value for both of these companies.
This concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I, along with Tom McGough and Tom Werner, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session."

But on gross margin, obviously, there are a number of different things that are contributing to the gains we are seeing and the gain -- the size of the gains do vary quarter-to-quarter. But the important fact is that, over the past 2 years, we've made tremendous progress at gross margin and operating margin, and you saw that again this quarter. Quarter-to-quarter, the progress may vary due to a number of factors, but what I'm focused on is that, we continue to move the centerline of our profitability north over time, while reducing the standard deviation around that centerline. On supply chain, look, first of all, clearly, the overall goal of our collective efforts is value and margin maximization. And supply chain productivity programs have always been, and will continue to be, an important component of that. And as Dave Biegger will share at our upcoming ConAgra Brands Investor Day, strong productivity has been a legacy strength at ConAgra, and you saw some of that also this quarter. We do have a strong track record of continuous improvement in terms of network optimization, procurement, T&W, et cetera, and now that we're upgrading our volume base and reducing low-margin business, we are providing a better foundation to build off of, as we plan for future margin accretive innovation. And Dave has obviously brought a fresh perspective around how to sustain that strong historic supply chain performance and build on it even further, and he'll share those views in a few weeks."

It's one of the reasons why we moved so aggressively on the $300 million efficiency program right out of the gate is because we wanted to stay out ahead of this stuff. Similarly, it's the same reason our supply chain team is aggressively trying to get out ahead of any absorption benefits that we might lose when we pull back on volume. So we try to look around corners. We try to anticipate it and then we try to stay ahead of it. So with respect to ConAgra Brands, sure, there will be some modest stranded as we go ahead and step through these things, but that's part of the reason why you see us getting so aggressive on costs. Lamb is a standalone company, and you'll see the details on that in the Form-10. And obviously when you set up a standalone company, you're going to incur some unique costs for doing that but obviously, we strongly believe the benefit of having Lamb as an independent pure-play company with its great performance and growth prospects is really the story there.

And our focus on trade is trying to improve the ROI on those merchandising events.

First of all, what we're doing it's a bit like if any of you have ever remodeled a house, it's a bit like that. The process is a bit messy, but if you want to get to the desired outcome, you got to go through the process. And this is a transformation that we're undertaking here, and our approach is to value profitable growth, not any growth but we do keep a close eye on markers to make sure that the business is in control and doing what we plan. So as an example, if you get into the scanner data and you peel it back, you'll see obvious things that you should expect such as baseline trends being significantly different from promoted trends. And then furthermore, if you get into baseline velocities, you will see that our baseline velocities are, in fact, quite stable. You will see TPDs going back, but you'll see TPDs going back because we, along with being very focused on price, have infused into the marketplace over a number of years a long tail of low-margin, nonproductive SKUs of multiple sizes that we are -- frankly, they had no value, so we've to get them out. Our customers appreciate that. It's part of being good category managers. And then the key is to continue to support the items that are moving at strong velocities, contemporizing them, refreshing them and then adding to them with new innovation and then ultimately proper marketing support. Now with respect to your question of marketing support in the quarter, yes, A&P was down. Some of that is timing because we do want to align our A&P spend with planned in-market actions like innovation launches and key promotions, things like that. So some of it's timing, but some of it is just good discipline and getting rid of nonworking or attempted working marketing that just, frankly, wasn't. And that is you see -- and also buying better. Your GRPs were up 7% in the quarter on a fewer dollars, so the impact was reasonably respectable. And I think it's important that we keep that kind of support out there while we're taking some of these promotion items, so we can really evolve the conversation with our consumer to be about something other than price and that's we're doing. We'll talk about this quite extensively along with things like portfolio segmentation strategy in a few weeks at our Investor Day."

On the notion that some retailers may be asking for more promotion, quite frankly, that tends to vary fairly meaningfully by category depending upon what a retailer's objectives are with particular categories.

These are the things that consumers are demanding, and this is what many of our retailers in our categories are prioritizing. And it's precisely why we're evolving the businesses that we own as well as adding new businesses that are complementarity like Frontera, Blake's and others like that. With respect to our volume piece, let's go back to the point in my prepared remarks, I think, that really describes it best. This is a -- our actions are broad-based but the volume decline, when you add it up, is incredibly concentrated. And in our case, it was in our 6 brands, each of which has its own story as to what we're doing and why we're doing it. But if you use Banquet as an example because that's the biggie, here's how to think about Banquet. The bottom line is locking a brand into a $1 price point for decade. It's just not a good business decision because it puts relentless pressure on margins and in turn, food quality. And at the same time, it retrains our Banquet loyalists to buy on deal. So the change was long overdue. And while the topline optics can be ugly until you wrap a year later, it's up over 300 basis points, the business and grows margin, which is excellent news. Now we've got to continue to support the business with levers other than price. And that's what we're going to do, and that's what our customers are counting on us to do."

For example, there were -- there was a period of time in our past where our PAM business was heavily promoted and the only trick in the book that we turned to was dealing. But if you look at consumer trends in oil over the last few years, you see that the oils have changed, it's moved to things like olive oil, things like coconut oil. So instead of competing on PAM on price attributes, we've evolved the PAM business, and we've got olive oil PAM. We've got coconut oil PAM. These are relevant modern-day attributes that changed the discussion with the consumer to be about something that they value and they will pay more for and not about deep discounting. That's just one example.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our First Quarter Conference Call. This will be our last earnings call as ConAgra Foods as we anticipate completing the Lamb Weston spin-off this fall prior to the holidays.
As you've probably seen by now, we announced the timing of dedicated Investor Days for each business. Lamb Weston's will be held in New York City on October 13, and ConAgra Brands will be held on October 18 here in Chicago. Our teams are hard at work preparing for these meetings, and we are excited about the opportunity to take you through a deeper dive on these businesses and why we believe they will create significant value for investors as separate, pure-play public companies. Each company will share more details, including financial outlooks and capital allocation priorities at these events. We are confident you will see the unique opportunities available to both companies and why each is well positioned to seize them.
Now on to the state of the business and our first quarter results. Once again, it was a very busy quarter at ConAgra as we continue our disciplined and methodical approach to enhancing focus, expanding margins, improving efficiency, energizing our culture and ultimately, creating value for our shareholders. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with the progress that we have made to date.
At a high level, we saw strong results from both Lamb Weston and our branded consumer businesses. On Lamb, we once again saw what a terrific business this is. Sales were up, margins were up and profit was up. The team is looking forward to sharing much more about this jewel of a business on October 13.
On our branded consumer businesses, we also made terrific progress. Here, we are seeing clear evidence that our strategy to upgrade our revenue base and expand margins is working. As we have discussed previously, we are intensely focused on positioning our U.S. branded portfolio for long-term success and that starts with building a higher-quality revenue base. As we will discuss in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we compete in good categories with many well-known brands that are #1 or #2 in their categories. However, ConAgra historically prioritized volume over value and accordingly, we've been overly reliant on deep discounting as our chief demand driver, leading us to underinvest and underdeliver on brand building and innovation. In short, we underleveraged some of our greatest assets.
The result of this behavior is a revenue-based that is overdeveloped in terms of the presence of low-loyalty, price-focused consumers. The problem with catering to these consumers is that: a, it caused us to neglect the needs of the vast majority of our consumer base, people who are hungry for innovation and premiumization and, b, it fundamentally limited our ability to drive higher margins. We are changing that. Specifically, to ensure we leverage our brand strength and unlock our margin potential, we have been methodically infusing focus and discipline around pricing and trade promotion while investing in brand building and innovation. Said differently, we are focusing our efforts on practices that support value over volume and walking away from our previous practices that concentrated on volume over value. It is important to understand that while our efforts to improve brand building and innovation are broad-based, the volume declines we're experiencing are largely concentrated within brands that historically targeted the price-focused consumer and heavily relied on deep discounts and promotion to drive volume. In fact, if you dig into the scanner data, you will see that more than 80% of our Q1 volume declines can be attributed to just 6 brands that have historically been underpriced and overpromoted. We are confident that our actions represent the right way to maximize the value of our branded portfolio over time.
As a supporting data point, gross margins on our U.S. retail brands are up about 700 basis points since Q1, 2 years ago. As we continue to execute this strategy, we believe our revenue base will be better positioned to deliver stronger, more consistent performance over the long term.
We have framed our efforts here around 5 portfolio management principles, or PMPs as we call them, which guide how we intend to manage our branded portfolio going forward. At our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we will go deep on each of these, but I want to give you a sense of our approach.
PMP #1 is upgrading the revenue base. The second PMP is refreshing the core. PMP #3 is assigning clear portfolio roles. The fourth PMP is ramping up innovation and M&A. And the fifth PMP is effectively backing the winners. These principles represent a tried-and-true approach and in a few weeks, we will discuss the progress we're making on each and how they will help build a more focused, higher-margin and higher-performing branded food company over time.
One note on PMP #4, ramping up innovation and M&A. I'm sure you've all seen the news from earlier this week about our acquisition of the Frontera, Red Fork and Salpica brands. These businesses make authentic gourmet Mexican food and contemporary American cooking sauces. We believe this gives us another great platform to provide consumers with unique, high-quality food products. And as an extra enticement to attend our Investor Day on October 18, I promise you will have a chance to sample these tremendous brands.
While we have a lot more work to do, I want to acknowledge our sales force for doing an excellent job working with our retailers to explain how our change in strategy benefits them as well as ConAgra. Similarly, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team for anticipating these volume changes and proactively offsetting any loss absorption benefits.
With that context in mind, let's turn to our Q1 results. Q1 net sales declined 5% and the impact of divestitures and FX represented about 2 percentage points of the decline. As I mentioned at the outset, Lamb Weston delivered another strong top line this quarter, offset by sales results in our domestic consumer business.
In the U.S. consumer market, which, as you know, is challenged across our competitive set, we saw declines due to the actions I just outlined related to upgrading our revenue base. This, along with the impact of FX, more than offset an increase in price and mix. Overall profitability was driven by growth and margin expansion in Lamb Weston as well as continued strong gross margin expansion in our domestic consumer businesses. As a result, total segment adjusted operating profit was up 23%. Additionally, our supply chain team continues to excel at finding more efficient ways to manufacture our products and reduce costs. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.61 for the quarter, representing 49% growth from the prior year, significantly in excess of our mid- to high teens growth estimate. As Dave will point out, some of this is timing related.
Now turning to segment performance. As you saw in this morning's release, we are now reporting results in 5 reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, the Refrigerated & Frozen, the International and the Foodservice segments represent the businesses that will remain with ConAgra Brands and will become the primary 4 reporting segments of the independent company postspin. The Commercial segment consists primarily of the Lamb Weston business.
Starting with the Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales decreased 5% based on the actions I just discussed. These efforts, coupled with increased pricing and trade productivity, savings and supply chain and continued SG&A discipline, helped drive growth of 31% in adjusted segment operating income, which translated to a 680 basis points expansion in adjusted segment operating margin. The volume declines in this segment were largely concentrated on a few brands where we are reversing our historical practice of promoting below the $1 price point. Chef Boyardee, and Snack Pack are good examples. Importantly, we saw the margin and profit expansion that we were counting on. Equally important, key sales fundamentals, like distribution, remained on plan, reflecting customer support for our strategy shift towards stronger brands and innovation. Keep in mind, the plan does include some important SKU rationalization. So when you see TPDs pull back in the near term, recognize that is part of a disciplined program to reduce nonvalue-added complexity while increasing facings and velocity on priority SKUs. You'll hear more about this at our ConAgra Brands Investor Day in Dave Biegger's supply chain presentation.
Last point I'll make in this segment is that we continue to benefit from disciplined investment behind A&P-ready brands, such as Slim Jim and PAM among others.
Now turning to the Refrigerated & Frozen segment. Net sales decreased 8% while adjusted operating profit increased by 310 basis points to 16% of net sales. The volume decline in this segment was heavily focused on Banquet, an important brand, as you know, is going through a significant makeover. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work to restage our Banquet brand resulting in increased pricing associated with long-overdue product and packaging upgrades. Accordingly, this was the primary driver of the volume and sales decline in the segment for the quarter. Banquet is now benefiting from much stronger margins, and our consumer data is also showing an improving buying rate from our most loyal consumers at key customers. As we move through the next calendar year and begin to wrap these actions, you will see top line sales declines moderate. From there, we will also fold in new product improvements and innovation.
Regarding segment profitability here in Q1, our disciplined pricing actions and supply chain productivity more than offset the Banquet impact and the costs related to a product recall. One other planned action in Q1 is worth noting in Frozen. While Marie Callender's is not one of our historically overpromoted brands, it was overpromoted in the year-ago period. And that was not a good business decision, so we did not repeat it in Q1 this year. This too contributed to our volume decline, but, again, we saw the margin gains we were counting on. Elsewhere in the segment, we saw solid top line performance, namely in Reddi-wip, which continues to be a strong performer for us.
The International segment, net sales decreased 6% due to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the effects of currency, segment net sales would have been approximately equal to the prior year's comparable quarter. Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 1%, and adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $24 million. This segment was negatively affected by normalization of egg prices after last year's avian influenza outbreak.
Overall, the 4 segments that will primarily comprise ConAgra Brands' ongoing operations postspin have made good progress, demonstrating the strength of our plan and the opportunity that lies ahead. Much of our team have completed their first full quarter in our new headquarters in Chicago, at the Merchandise Mart, and there is tremendous energy and excitement to build upon our momentum as a pure-play branded company.
Now turning to Commercial foods. As I said at the outset of my remarks, Lamb Weston delivered another great quarter, generating approximately 4% net sales growth. In our reported results, the strength of Lamb Weston's performance is masked by the fact that we include the impact of the divestures of Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank, which were completed at the end of July.
Adjusted segment operating profit grew 33% in the quarter behind Lamb Weston's continued growth and favorable input costs. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business, leveraging its strong brand to capture emerging markets and international growth. Tom and the Lamb team look forward to sharing much more during their Investor Day on October 13 in New York. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of our talented employees. Amidst significant change, including a successful move to our new headquarters, our team remained focused on delivering our goals and serving our customers. In addition to driving strong performance, our team is also dedicated to being a good corporate citizen, and we were honored to be named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (sic) [ Dow Jones Sustainability Indices ] for the sixth consecutive year, demonstrating recognition of our commitment to environmental and social goals in addition to economic objectives.
Now turning to one of our newest team members, I would like to welcome our new CFO, Dave Marberger, who joins us from Prestige Brands. Dave brings more than 30 years of finance and leadership experience to ConAgra Foods, including 10 years as the CFO at Godiva Chocolatier and Tasty Baking Company. I first got to know Dave during his time with the Campbell Soup Company, and Dave is a proven and accomplished finance executive, and I am confident he will be a tremendous asset going forward. We are extremely happy to welcome him to the team.
With that, Dave, over to you."

Before I get into my comments, I would like to say how energized I am to be part of this organization and leadership team. I look forward to getting to know many of you in the investor community in the weeks and months ahead. I will address several topics in my comments, including our new reporting segments; a recap of our 2017 fiscal first quarter performance; a summary of items impacting comparability, including some brief comments on goodwill impairment, cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet; and some brief comments on our upcoming Investor Day. As we outlined in the release, we now report our business results in 5 segments. They are Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments were previously included in our Consumer Foods segment and Foodservice was previously included in our Commercial Foods segment. Upon the completion of the Lamb Weston spin, the commercial segment will include only the historical results of JM Swank and Spicetec through the divestiture date, and the Lamb Weston results will be reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Now I will provide some comments on our performance for our fiscal 2017 first quarter. Please note that references to adjusted earnings or operating profit refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability. Overall, net sales for the fiscal first quarter approximated $2.7 billion, down 5% from the year-ago quarter. The divestiture of JM Swank and Spicetec and the negative impact of foreign exchange accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the net sales decline versus the year-ago quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fiscal first quarter of $0.42 compared with $0.38 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.61, 49% above the $0.41 delivered in the year-ago quarter and better than we planned. The strong first quarter EPS performance primarily reflects the benefits from continued gross margin expansion, lower SG&A expense and lower interest expense, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume, lower earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture and some costs related to a product recall. As I will discuss later, the first quarter overdelivery versus our plan was driven, in part, by timing items for both SG&A and A&P expense.
In our Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales were $757 million for the quarter, down 5% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 6% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $185 million in the first quarter versus $142 million in the year-ago quarter. The strong increase in adjusted profit reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts, driven by pricing discipline and favorable product cost and productivity; reduced SG&A costs; and lower A&P spending due to timing, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume.
In our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, net sales were $605 million for the quarter, down 8% from the year-ago period, reflecting an 11% decline in volume and a 3% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $97 million in the first quarter versus $85 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in adjusted profit reflects the same continued progress on margin expansion efforts as outlined for the Grocery & Snacks segment, offset by approximately $9 million of costs related to a product recall.
In our International segment, net sales were $195 million for the quarter, down 6% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 2% decline in volume, a 1.5% improvement in price mix and a negative 5% impact from foreign exchange. We reported a segment operating loss of $149 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by a pretax impairment charge of $164 million related to our Canadian business. I'll say more about this shortly.
Adjusted segment operating profit was $15 million in the first quarter versus $17 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in adjusted profit reflects lower sales and gross margins and a negative impact from FX, partially offset by modestly lower A&P and SG&A expenses.
In our Foodservice segment, net sales were $268 million for the quarter, down 1% from the year-ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $24 million in the first quarter versus $26 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower sales and gross margins, partially offset by lower A&P and SG&A expenses.
In the Commercial segment, net sales were $843 million or 2% below the prior year quarter, driven by the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures. Lamb Weston had a very solid quarter as net sales increased 4% versus the prior year quarter. The commercial segment's adjusted operating profit was $148 million versus $112 million in the year-ago quarter. This strong increase was driven primarily by the net sales growth and margin expansion in our Lamb Weston business, partially offset by the profit decline resulting from the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures during the quarter. We realized proceeds of $486 million from these divestitures and recognized an aggregate book gain of approximately $198 million. We expect to utilize the capital loss tax asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to these divestitures.
In addition to the segment information, I will also note the following matters related to corporate or total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $24 million for the current quarter and $37 million in the year-ago period. The decline principally reflects lower profits from our Ardent Mills joint venture. Adjusted corporate expenses were $38 million in the fiscal quarter versus $66 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts, along with lower costs related to the timing of certain expenses that will come later in the fiscal year. Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $69 million, down 18% from the prior year quarter. Most of this decline was due to the timing of expense that will be incurred later in the fiscal year. Despite this lower spend, total gross rating points for our A&P investments were up 7% for the first quarter versus a year ago, reflecting improved efficiency. For the first quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $11 million and operating profit by $4 million versus the year-ago quarter.
Moving on to our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making very good progress and expect to realize the remainder of our $200 million of SG&A savings over the next 2 years as planned. While we saw significant benefits from SG&A savings in the first quarter, I would point out that some of this benefit was due to the timing of certain expenses moving to later in the fiscal year. We estimate that the benefit from timing for SG&A was $25 million to $30 million in the first quarter.
I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter. We had $0.34 per diluted share of net expense related to impairment charges. Approximately $140 million pretax relates to impairment of goodwill and approximately $24 million pretax relates to impairment of intangible brand assets, both related to our Canadian business. The charges are principally the result of several factors. First, the change in our reporting segments now requires us to evaluate goodwill at a lower level. In the past, under the previous reporting segments, we were only required to evaluate goodwill at the total International business level. We are now required to evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit within the International segment.
Second, while the performance of our International business has been steady over the last several years on a constant currency basis, the significant weakening of the Canadian dollar has negatively impacted the value of the Canadian business on a U.S. dollar basis, which is used for the goodwill analysis.
Finally, the brand impairment reflects both the unfavorable foreign exchange movements as well as some weaker top line trends in this portion of the business.
In addition to the impairment charges, we recognized $0.17 per diluted share of net gain from the sale of the JM Swank and Spicetec businesses. We also recognized $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. And finally, we recognized approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net benefit from favorable adjustments to state tax assets.
Moving on to cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $795 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the first quarter were $337 million versus $64 million in the year-ago quarter. This significant increase is due to the improved operating earnings in the current quarter and higher-than-normal income tax payments in the year-ago quarter. For the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $117 million versus $102 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million in the fiscal first quarter versus $80 million in the year-ago quarter due to the paydown of debt during the past 12 months. For the quarter, we paid down approximately $554 million of long-term debt, and dividends for this fiscal quarter were $110 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $86 million, and we had approximately $46 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization as of the end of the first quarter. We continue to remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments.
Lastly, our estimated effective tax rate for income from operations remains at 33.5% for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. The first quarter reported tax rate was higher primarily from the tax impacts of the noncash impairment charge and the gain on the sale of JM Swank and Spicetec.
As we have noted in the release, we are not providing any comments on our outlook today. Instead, we will provide more information on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and the long-term algorithm for both ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston at our upcoming Investor Days. We are excited about the opportunities to create value for both of these companies.
This concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I, along with Tom McGough and Tom Werner, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session."

But on gross margin, obviously, there are a number of different things that are contributing to the gains we are seeing and the gain -- the size of the gains do vary quarter-to-quarter. But the important fact is that, over the past 2 years, we've made tremendous progress at gross margin and operating margin, and you saw that again this quarter. Quarter-to-quarter, the progress may vary due to a number of factors, but what I'm focused on is that, we continue to move the centerline of our profitability north over time, while reducing the standard deviation around that centerline. On supply chain, look, first of all, clearly, the overall goal of our collective efforts is value and margin maximization. And supply chain productivity programs have always been, and will continue to be, an important component of that. And as Dave Biegger will share at our upcoming ConAgra Brands Investor Day, strong productivity has been a legacy strength at ConAgra, and you saw some of that also this quarter. We do have a strong track record of continuous improvement in terms of network optimization, procurement, T&W, et cetera, and now that we're upgrading our volume base and reducing low-margin business, we are providing a better foundation to build off of, as we plan for future margin accretive innovation. And Dave has obviously brought a fresh perspective around how to sustain that strong historic supply chain performance and build on it even further, and he'll share those views in a few weeks."

It's one of the reasons why we moved so aggressively on the $300 million efficiency program right out of the gate is because we wanted to stay out ahead of this stuff. Similarly, it's the same reason our supply chain team is aggressively trying to get out ahead of any absorption benefits that we might lose when we pull back on volume. So we try to look around corners. We try to anticipate it and then we try to stay ahead of it. So with respect to ConAgra Brands, sure, there will be some modest stranded as we go ahead and step through these things, but that's part of the reason why you see us getting so aggressive on costs. Lamb is a standalone company, and you'll see the details on that in the Form-10. And obviously when you set up a standalone company, you're going to incur some unique costs for doing that but obviously, we strongly believe the benefit of having Lamb as an independent pure-play company with its great performance and growth prospects is really the story there. That's a terrific equity, and we can't wait to tell investors about the story in a few weeks."

And our focus on trade is trying to improve the ROI on those merchandising events.

And I guess, related to that, just could you confirm, it sounds like with advertising and marketing may be down in the quarter, you're still going through this process of resetting volume at a time where there's going to -- you're not really maybe necessarily fully supporting the brands with the advertising you tend to?"

First of all, what we're doing it's a bit like if any of you have ever remodeled a house, it's a bit like that. The process is a bit messy, but if you want to get to the desired outcome, you got to go through the process. And this is a transformation that we're undertaking here, and our approach is to value profitable growth, not any growth but we do keep a close eye on markers to make sure that the business is in control and doing what we planned. So as an example, if you get into the scanner data and you peel it back, you'll see obvious things that you should expect such as baseline trends being significantly different from promoted trends. And then furthermore, if you get into baseline velocities, you will see that our baseline velocities are, in fact, quite stable. You will see TPDs going back, but you'll see TPDs going back because we, along with being very focused on price, have infused into the marketplace over a number of years a long tail of low-margin, nonproductive SKUs of multiple sizes that we are -- frankly, they add no value, so we've to get them out. Our customers appreciate that. It's part of being good category managers. And then the key is to continue to support the items that are moving at strong velocities, contemporizing them, refreshing them and then adding to them with new innovation and then ultimately proper marketing support. Now with respect to your question on marketing support in the quarter, yes, A&P was down. Some of that is timing because we do want to align our A&P spend with planned in-market actions like innovation launches and key promotions, things like that. So some of it's timing, but some of it is just good discipline and getting rid of nonworking or attempted working marketing that just, frankly, wasn't. And that is you see -- and also buying better. Our GRPs were up 7% in the quarter on fewer dollars, so the impact was reasonably respectable. And I think it's important that we keep that kind of support out there while we're taking some of these promotion items, so we can really evolve the conversation with our consumer to be about something other than price and that's what we're doing. We'll talk about this quite extensively along with things like portfolio segmentation strategy in a few weeks at our Investor Day."

And further, are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of overall volumes are associated with these consumer segments that you're really not that interested in? So volume is the first one. The second question is we're hearing from a number of places that retailers, particularly large retailers, are beginning to demand more reinvestment in price and promotional activity, which seems to be the opposite direction from where you're going. How do think that's going to play out in 2017? And are you confident that you can sort of hold your ground without losing distribution?"

On the notion that some retailers may be asking for more promotion, quite frankly, that tends to vary fairly meaningfully by category depending upon what a retailer's objectives are with particular categories.",344,"Sure. Alexia, I'll take the second one first. On the notion that some retailers may be asking for more promotion, quite frankly, that tends to vary fairly meaningfully by category depending upon what a retailer's objectives are with particular categories. In general, our customers are asking us for growth and innovation. They want to see us evolve our brand so that we're not competing on price, so that we're competing on quality measures. You see customers giving more and more real estate to these challenger brands that have modern food attributes like natural, organic, premium. These are the things that consumers are demanding, and this is what many of our retailers in our categories are prioritizing. And it's precisely why we're evolving the businesses that we own as well as adding new businesses that are complementarity like Frontera, Blake's and others like that. With respect to our volume piece, let's go back to the point in my prepared remarks, I think, that really describes it best. This is a -- our actions are broad-based but the volume decline, when you add it up, is incredibly concentrated. And in our case, it was on 6 brands, each of which has its own story as to what we're doing and why we're doing it. But if you use Banquet as an example because that's the biggie, here's how to think about Banquet. The bottom line is locking a brand into a $1 price point for decades. It's just not a good business decision because it puts relentless pressure on margins and in turn, food quality. And at the same time, it retrains our Banquet loyalists to buy on deal. So the change was long overdue. And while the topline optics can be ugly until you wrap a year later, it's up over 300 basis points, the business in gross margin, which is excellent news. Now we've got to continue to support the business with levers other than price. And that's what we're going to do, and that's what our customers are counting on us to do."

So instead of competing on PAM on price attributes, we've evolved the PAM business, and we've got olive oil PAM. We've got coconut oil PAM. These are relevant modern-day attributes that change the discussion with the consumer to be about something that they value and they will pay more for and not about deep discounting.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our First Quarter Conference Call. This will be our last earnings call as ConAgra Foods as we anticipate completing the Lamb Weston spin-off this fall prior to the holidays.
As you've probably seen by now, we announced the timing of dedicated Investor Days for each business. Lamb Weston's will be held in New York City on October 13, and ConAgra Brands will be held on October 18 here in Chicago. Our teams are hard at work preparing for these meetings, and we are excited about the opportunity to take you through a deeper dive on these businesses and why we believe they will create significant value for investors as separate, pure-play public companies. Each company will share more details, including financial outlooks and capital allocation priorities at these events. We are confident you will see the unique opportunities available to both companies and why each is well positioned to seize them.
Now on to the state of the business and our first quarter results. Once again, it was a very busy quarter at ConAgra as we continue our disciplined and methodical approach to enhancing focus, expanding margins, improving efficiency, energizing our culture and ultimately, creating value for our shareholders. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with the progress that we have made to date.
At a high level, we saw strong results from both Lamb Weston and our branded consumer businesses. On Lamb, we once again saw what a terrific business this is. Sales were up, margins were up and profit was up. The team is looking forward to sharing much more about this jewel of a business on October 13.
On our branded consumer businesses, we also made terrific progress. Here, we are seeing clear evidence that our strategy to upgrade our revenue base and expand margins is working. As we have discussed previously, we are intensely focused on positioning our U.S. branded portfolio for long-term success and that starts with building a higher-quality revenue base. As we will discuss in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we compete in good categories with many well-known brands that are #1 or #2 in their categories. However, ConAgra historically prioritized volume over value and accordingly, we've been overly reliant on deep discounting as our chief demand driver, leading us to underinvest and underdeliver on brand building and innovation. In short, we underleveraged some of our greatest assets.
The result of this behavior is a revenue-based that is overdeveloped in terms of the presence of low-loyalty, price-focused consumers. The problem with catering to these consumers is that: a, it caused us to neglect the needs of the vast majority of our consumer base, people who are hungry for innovation and premiumization and, b, it fundamentally limited our ability to drive higher margins. We are changing that. Specifically, to ensure we leverage our brand strength and unlock our margin potential, we have been methodically infusing focus and discipline around pricing and trade promotion while investing in brand building and innovation. Said differently, we are focusing our efforts on practices that support value over volume and walking away from our previous practices that concentrated on volume over value. It is important to understand that while our efforts to improve brand building and innovation are broad-based, the volume declines we're experiencing are largely concentrated within brands that historically targeted the price-focused consumer and heavily relied on deep discounts and promotion to drive volume. In fact, if you dig into the scanner data, you will see that more than 80% of our Q1 volume declines can be attributed to just 6 brands that have historically been underpriced and overpromoted. We are confident that our actions represent the right way to maximize the value of our branded portfolio over time.
As a supporting data point, gross margins on our U.S. retail brands are up about 700 basis points since Q1, 2 years ago. As we continue to execute this strategy, we believe our revenue base will be better positioned to deliver stronger, more consistent performance over the long term.
We have framed our efforts here around 5 portfolio management principles, or PMPs as we call them, which guide how we intend to manage our branded portfolio going forward. At our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we will go deep on each of these, but I want to give you a sense of our approach.
PMP #1 is upgrading the revenue base. The second PMP is refreshing the core. PMP #3 is assigning clear portfolio roles. The fourth PMP is ramping up innovation and M&A. And the fifth PMP is effectively backing the winners. These principles represent a tried-and-true approach and in a few weeks, we will discuss the progress we're making on each and how they will help build a more focused, higher-margin and higher-performing branded food company over time.
One note on PMP #4, ramping up innovation and M&A. I'm sure you've all seen the news from earlier this week about our acquisition of the Frontera, Red Fork and Salpica brands. These businesses make authentic gourmet Mexican food and contemporary American cooking sauces. We believe this gives us another great platform to provide consumers with unique, high-quality food products. And as an extra enticement to attend our Investor Day on October 18, I promise you will have a chance to sample these tremendous brands.
While we have a lot more work to do, I want to acknowledge our sales force for doing an excellent job working with our retailers to explain how our change in strategy benefits them as well as ConAgra. Similarly, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team for anticipating these volume changes and proactively offsetting any loss absorption benefits.
With that context in mind, let's turn to our Q1 results. Q1 net sales declined 5% and the impact of divestitures and FX represented about 2 percentage points of the decline. As I mentioned at the outset, Lamb Weston delivered another strong top line this quarter, offset by sales results in our domestic consumer business.
In the U.S. consumer market, which, as you know, is challenged across our competitive set, we saw declines due to the actions I just outlined related to upgrading our revenue base. This, along with the impact of FX, more than offset an increase in price and mix. Overall profitability was driven by growth and margin expansion in Lamb Weston as well as continued strong gross margin expansion in our domestic consumer businesses. As a result, total segment adjusted operating profit was up 23%. Additionally, our supply chain team continues to excel at finding more efficient ways to manufacture our products and reduce costs. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.61 for the quarter, representing 49% growth from the prior year, significantly in excess of our mid- to high teens growth estimate. As Dave will point out, some of this is timing related.
Now turning to segment performance. As you saw in this morning's release, we are now reporting results in 5 reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, the Refrigerated & Frozen, the International and the Foodservice segments represent the businesses that will remain with ConAgra Brands and will become the primary 4 reporting segments of the independent company postspin. The Commercial segment consists primarily of the Lamb Weston business.
Starting with the Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales decreased 5% based on the actions I just discussed. These efforts, coupled with increased pricing and trade productivity, savings and supply chain and continued SG&A discipline, helped drive growth of 31% in adjusted segment operating income, which translated to a 680 basis points expansion in adjusted segment operating margin. The volume declines in this segment were largely concentrated on a few brands where we are reversing our historical practice of promoting below the $1 price point. Chef Boyardee, and Snack Pack are good examples. Importantly, we saw the margin and profit expansion that we were counting on. Equally important, key sales fundamentals, like distribution, remained on plan, reflecting customer support for our strategy shift towards stronger brands and innovation. Keep in mind, the plan does include some important SKU rationalization. So when you see TPDs pull back in the near term, recognize that is part of a disciplined program to reduce nonvalue-added complexity while increasing facings and velocity on priority SKUs. You'll hear more about this at our ConAgra Brands Investor Day in Dave Biegger's supply chain presentation.
Last point I'll make in this segment is that we continue to benefit from disciplined investment behind A&P-ready brands, such as Slim Jim and PAM among others.
Now turning to the Refrigerated & Frozen segment. Net sales decreased 8% while adjusted operating profit increased by 310 basis points to 16% of net sales. The volume decline in this segment was heavily focused on Banquet, an important brand, as you know, is going through a significant makeover. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work to restage our Banquet brand resulting in increased pricing associated with long-overdue product and packaging upgrades. Accordingly, this was the primary driver of the volume and sales decline in the segment for the quarter. Banquet is now benefiting from much stronger margins, and our consumer data is also showing an improving buying rate from our most loyal consumers at key customers. As we move through the next calendar year and begin to wrap these actions, you will see top line sales declines moderate. From there, we will also fold in new product improvements and innovation.
Regarding segment profitability here in Q1, our disciplined pricing actions and supply chain productivity more than offset the Banquet impact and the costs related to a product recall. One other planned action in Q1 is worth noting in Frozen. While Marie Callender's is not one of our historically overpromoted brands, it was overpromoted in the year-ago period. And that was not a good business decision, so we did not repeat it in Q1 this year. This too contributed to our volume decline, but, again, we saw the margin gains we were counting on. Elsewhere in the segment, we saw solid top line performance, namely in Reddi-wip, which continues to be a strong performer for us.
The International segment, net sales decreased 6% due to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the effects of currency, segment net sales would have been approximately equal to the prior year's comparable quarter. Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 1%, and adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $24 million. This segment was negatively affected by normalization of egg prices after last year's avian influenza outbreak.
Overall, the 4 segments that will primarily comprise ConAgra Brands' ongoing operations postspin have made good progress, demonstrating the strength of our plan and the opportunity that lies ahead. Much of our team have completed their first full quarter in our new headquarters in Chicago, at the Merchandise Mart, and there is tremendous energy and excitement to build upon our momentum as a pure-play branded company.
Now turning to Commercial foods. As I said at the outset of my remarks, Lamb Weston delivered another great quarter, generating approximately 4% net sales growth. In our reported results, the strength of Lamb Weston's performance is masked by the fact that we include the impact of the divestures of Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank, which were completed at the end of July.
Adjusted segment operating profit grew 33% in the quarter behind Lamb Weston's continued growth and favorable input costs. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business, leveraging its strong brand to capture emerging markets and international growth. Tom and the Lamb team look forward to sharing much more during their Investor Day on October 13 in New York. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of our talented employees. Amidst significant change, including a successful move to our new headquarters, our team remained focused on delivering our goals and serving our customers. In addition to driving strong performance, our team is also dedicated to being a good corporate citizen, and we were honored to be named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (sic) [ Dow Jones Sustainability Indices ] for the sixth consecutive year, demonstrating recognition of our commitment to environmental and social goals in addition to economic objectives.
Now turning to one of our newest team members, I would like to welcome our new CFO, Dave Marberger, who joins us from Prestige Brands. Dave brings more than 30 years of finance and leadership experience to ConAgra Foods, including 10 years as the CFO at Godiva Chocolatier and Tasty Baking Company. I first got to know Dave during his time with the Campbell Soup Company, and Dave is a proven and accomplished finance executive, and I am confident he will be a tremendous asset going forward. We are extremely happy to welcome him to the team.
With that, Dave, over to you."

Before I get into my comments, I would like to say how energized I am to be part of this organization and leadership team. I look forward to getting to know many of you in the investor community in the weeks and months ahead. I will address several topics in my comments, including our new reporting segments; a recap of our 2017 fiscal first quarter performance; a summary of items impacting comparability, including some brief comments on goodwill impairment, cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet; and some brief comments on our upcoming Investor Day. As we outlined in the release, we now report our business results in 5 segments. They are Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments were previously included in our Consumer Foods segment and Foodservice was previously included in our Commercial Foods segment. Upon the completion of the Lamb Weston spin, the commercial segment will include only the historical results of JM Swank and Spicetec through the divestiture date, and the Lamb Weston results will be reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Now I will provide some comments on our performance for our fiscal 2017 first quarter. Please note that references to adjusted earnings or operating profit refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability. Overall, net sales for the fiscal first quarter approximated $2.7 billion, down 5% from the year-ago quarter. The divestiture of JM Swank and Spicetec and the negative impact of foreign exchange accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the net sales decline versus the year-ago quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fiscal first quarter of $0.42 compared with $0.38 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.61, 49% above the $0.41 delivered in the year-ago quarter and better than we planned. The strong first quarter EPS performance primarily reflects the benefits from continued gross margin expansion, lower SG&A expense and lower interest expense, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume, lower earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture and some costs related to a product recall. As I will discuss later, the first quarter overdelivery versus our plan was driven, in part, by timing items for both SG&A and A&P expense.
In our Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales were $757 million for the quarter, down 5% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 6% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $185 million in the first quarter versus $142 million in the year-ago quarter. The strong increase in adjusted profit reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts, driven by pricing discipline and favorable product cost and productivity; reduced SG&A costs; and lower A&P spending due to timing, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume.
In our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, net sales were $605 million for the quarter, down 8% from the year-ago period, reflecting an 11% decline in volume and a 3% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $97 million in the first quarter versus $85 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in adjusted profit reflects the same continued progress on margin expansion efforts as outlined for the Grocery & Snacks segment, offset by approximately $9 million of costs related to a product recall.
In our International segment, net sales were $195 million for the quarter, down 6% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 2% decline in volume, a 1.5% improvement in price mix and a negative 5% impact from foreign exchange. We reported a segment operating loss of $149 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by a pretax impairment charge of $164 million related to our Canadian business. I'll say more about this shortly.
Adjusted segment operating profit was $15 million in the first quarter versus $17 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in adjusted profit reflects lower sales and gross margins and a negative impact from FX, partially offset by modestly lower A&P and SG&A expenses.
In our Foodservice segment, net sales were $268 million for the quarter, down 1% from the year-ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $24 million in the first quarter versus $26 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower sales and gross margins, partially offset by lower A&P and SG&A expenses.
In the Commercial segment, net sales were $843 million or 2% below the prior year quarter, driven by the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures. Lamb Weston had a very solid quarter as net sales increased 4% versus the prior year quarter. The commercial segment's adjusted operating profit was $148 million versus $112 million in the year-ago quarter. This strong increase was driven primarily by the net sales growth and margin expansion in our Lamb Weston business, partially offset by the profit decline resulting from the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures during the quarter. We realized proceeds of $486 million from these divestitures and recognized an aggregate book gain of approximately $198 million. We expect to utilize the capital loss tax asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to these divestitures.
In addition to the segment information, I will also note the following matters related to corporate or total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $24 million for the current quarter and $37 million in the year-ago period. The decline principally reflects lower profits from our Ardent Mills joint venture. Adjusted corporate expenses were $38 million in the fiscal quarter versus $66 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts, along with lower costs related to the timing of certain expenses that will come later in the fiscal year. Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $69 million, down 18% from the prior year quarter. Most of this decline was due to the timing of expense that will be incurred later in the fiscal year. Despite this lower spend, total gross rating points for our A&P investments were up 7% for the first quarter versus a year ago, reflecting improved efficiency. For the first quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $11 million and operating profit by $4 million versus the year-ago quarter.
Moving on to our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making very good progress and expect to realize the remainder of our $200 million of SG&A savings over the next 2 years as planned. While we saw significant benefits from SG&A savings in the first quarter, I would point out that some of this benefit was due to the timing of certain expenses moving to later in the fiscal year. We estimate that the benefit from timing for SG&A was $25 million to $30 million in the first quarter.
I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter. We had $0.34 per diluted share of net expense related to impairment charges. Approximately $140 million pretax relates to impairment of goodwill and approximately $24 million pretax relates to impairment of intangible brand assets, both related to our Canadian business. The charges are principally the result of several factors. First, the change in our reporting segments now requires us to evaluate goodwill at a lower level. In the past, under the previous reporting segments, we were only required to evaluate goodwill at the total International business level. We are now required to evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit within the International segment.
Second, while the performance of our International business has been steady over the last several years on a constant currency basis, the significant weakening of the Canadian dollar has negatively impacted the value of the Canadian business on a U.S. dollar basis, which is used for the goodwill analysis.
Finally, the brand impairment reflects both the unfavorable foreign exchange movements as well as some weaker top line trends in this portion of the business.
In addition to the impairment charges, we recognized $0.17 per diluted share of net gain from the sale of the JM Swank and Spicetec businesses. We also recognized $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. And finally, we recognized approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net benefit from favorable adjustments to state tax assets.
Moving on to cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $795 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the first quarter were $337 million versus $64 million in the year-ago quarter. This significant increase is due to the improved operating earnings in the current quarter and higher-than-normal income tax payments in the year-ago quarter. For the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $117 million versus $102 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million in the fiscal first quarter versus $80 million in the year-ago quarter due to the paydown of debt during the past 12 months. For the quarter, we paid down approximately $554 million of long-term debt, and dividends for this fiscal quarter were $110 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $86 million, and we had approximately $46 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization as of the end of the first quarter. We continue to remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments.
Lastly, our estimated effective tax rate for income from operations remains at 33.5% for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. The first quarter reported tax rate was higher primarily from the tax impacts of the noncash impairment charge and the gain on the sale of JM Swank and Spicetec.
As we have noted in the release, we are not providing any comments on our outlook today. Instead, we will provide more information on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and the long-term algorithm for both ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston at our upcoming Investor Days. We are excited about the opportunities to create value for both of these companies.
This concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I, along with Tom McGough and Tom Werner, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session."

But on gross margin, obviously, there are a number of different things that are contributing to the gains we are seeing and the gain -- the size of the gains do vary quarter-to-quarter. But the important fact is that, over the past 2 years, we've made tremendous progress at gross margin and operating margin, and you saw that again this quarter. Quarter-to-quarter, the progress may vary due to a number of factors, but what I'm focused on is that, we continue to move the centerline of our profitability north over time, while reducing the standard deviation around that centerline. On supply chain, look, first of all, clearly, the overall goal of our collective efforts is value and margin maximization. And supply chain productivity programs have always been, and will continue to be, an important component of that. And as Dave Biegger will share at our upcoming ConAgra Brands Investor Day, strong productivity has been a legacy strength at ConAgra, and you saw some of that also this quarter. We do have a strong track record of continuous improvement in terms of network optimization, procurement, T&W, et cetera, and now that we're upgrading our volume base and reducing low-margin business, we are providing a better foundation to build off of, as we plan for future margin accretive innovation. And Dave has obviously brought a fresh perspective around how to sustain that strong historic supply chain performance and build on it even further, and he'll share those views in a few weeks."

It's one of the reasons why we moved so aggressively on the $300 million efficiency program right out of the gate is because we wanted to stay out ahead of this stuff. Similarly, it's the same reason our supply chain team is aggressively trying to get out ahead of any absorption benefits that we might lose when we pull back on volume. So we try to look around corners. We try to anticipate it and then we try to stay ahead of it. So with respect to ConAgra Brands, sure, there will be some modest stranded as we go ahead and step through these things, but that's part of the reason why you see us getting so aggressive on costs. Lamb is a standalone company, and you'll see the details on that in the Form-10. And obviously when you set up a standalone company, you're going to incur some unique costs for doing that but obviously, we strongly believe the benefit of having Lamb as an independent pure-play company with its great performance and growth prospects is really the story there.

As you know, we started the savings in fiscal '16 really in the Q3 and 4, so Q2 will be another big incremental quarter, and then it'll start to wrap in the second half of this year where the increases will be less. But by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be 85% to 90% complete in terms of the total $200 million reduction plan."

That's not about anyone in particular, I like John, I'm just not sure how much confidence investors are going to have in whatever path is, I guess, outlined at the Analyst Day given that there is a new CFO coming in a few months later.

And as you'll see at Lamb's Investor Day in a couple of weeks, it is an extremely strong business with excellent cash flows, and we are quite confident that it will continue to thrive. Beyond that, we're going to hold off until the Investor Day to get into details on things like capital priorities. With respect to the Lamb CFO, I think the big picture here that I don't want investors to lose is, we are making excellent progress rounding out the Lamb management team. You're going to learn more about these folks here in short order as well as populating the Board with seasoned veterans that are really going to help this company get off, I believe, to a flying start. We are very far along in terms of the CFO search process. I don't want to get into the details of that process or our motives publicly for obvious reasons, but with the Investor Day just a couple of weeks away, we are very fortunate to have John Gehring help us get things launched. And for those of you who weren't tracking with Ken's comments, you might have missed it in this morning's announcement that John will be the Interim CFO here over the course of the next couple of months, as we stand Lamb up. But again, we'll have more to talk about on our permanent CFO in the not-so-distant future."

What the circuit breakers are just to make sure that you don't get yourself into a situation where you've got the sort of the volume base right but it's hard to restart some velocity because of where the momentum is? And I guess, related to that, just could you confirm, it sounds like with advertising and marketing may be down in the quarter, you're still going through this process of resetting volume at a time where there's going to -- you're not really maybe necessarily fully supporting the brands with the advertising you tend to?"

First of all, what we're doing it's a bit like if any of you have ever remodeled a house, it's a bit like that. The process is a bit messy, but if you want to get to the desired outcome, you got to go through the process. And this is a transformation that we're undertaking here, and our approach is to value profitable growth, not any growth but we do keep a close eye on markers to make sure that the business is in control and doing what we planned. So as an example, if you get into the scanner data and you peel it back, you'll see obvious things that you should expect such as baseline trends being significantly different from promoted trends. And then furthermore, if you get into baseline velocities, you will see that our baseline velocities are, in fact, quite stable. You will see TPDs going back, but you'll see TPDs going back because we, along with being very focused on price, have infused into the marketplace over a number of years a long tail of low-margin, nonproductive SKUs of multiple sizes that we are -- frankly, they add no value, so we've to get them out. Our customers appreciate that. It's part of being good category managers. And then the key is to continue to support the items that are moving at strong velocities, contemporizing them, refreshing them and then adding to them with new innovation and then ultimately proper marketing support. Now with respect to your question on marketing support in the quarter, yes, A&P was down. Some of that is timing because we do want to align our A&P spend with planned in-market actions like innovation launches and key promotions, things like that. So some of it's timing, but some of it is just good discipline and getting rid of nonworking or attempted working marketing that just, frankly, wasn't. And that is you see -- and also buying better. Our GRPs were up 7% in the quarter on fewer dollars, so the impact was reasonably respectable. And I think it's important that we keep that kind of support out there while we're taking some of these promotion items, so we can really evolve the conversation with our consumer to be about something other than price and that's what we're doing. We'll talk about this quite extensively along with things like portfolio segmentation strategy in a few weeks at our Investor Day."

Are you able to tell us if you hadn't taken those actions, what the underlying volume decline would have been? And further, are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of overall volumes are associated with these consumer segments that you're really not that interested in? So volume is the first one. The second question is we're hearing from a number of places that retailers, particularly large retailers, are beginning to demand more reinvestment in price and promotional activity, which seems to be the opposite direction from where you're going. How do think that's going to play out in 2017? And are you confident that you can sort of hold your ground without losing distribution?"

On the notion that some retailers may be asking for more promotion, quite frankly, that tends to vary fairly meaningfully by category depending upon what a retailer's objectives are with particular categories.",344,"Sure. Alexia, I'll take the second one first. On the notion that some retailers may be asking for more promotion, quite frankly, that tends to vary fairly meaningfully by category depending upon what a retailer's objectives are with particular categories. In general, our customers are asking us for growth and innovation. They want to see us evolve our brand so that we're not competing on price, so that we're competing on quality measures. You see customers giving more and more real estate to these challenger brands that have modern food attributes like natural, organic, premium. These are the things that consumers are demanding, and this is what many of our retailers in our categories are prioritizing. And it's precisely why we're evolving the businesses that we own as well as adding new businesses that are complementarity like Frontera, Blake's and others like that. With respect to our volume piece, let's go back to the point in my prepared remarks, I think, that really describes it best. This is a -- our actions are broad-based but the volume decline, when you add it up, is incredibly concentrated. And in our case, it was on 6 brands, each of which has its own story as to what we're doing and why we're doing it. But if you use Banquet as an example because that's the biggie, here's how to think about Banquet. The bottom line is locking a brand into a $1 price point for decades. It's just not a good business decision because it puts relentless pressure on margins and in turn, food quality. And at the same time, it retrains our Banquet loyalists to buy on deal. So the change was long overdue. And while the topline optics can be ugly until you wrap a year later, it's up over 300 basis points, the business in gross margin, which is excellent news. Now we've got to continue to support the business with levers other than price. And that's what we're going to do, and that's what our customers are counting on us to do."

For a long time, our brands communicated deal. We are a deal brand and interestingly, even low income consumers are very interested in a brand communicating with them on other means. For example, there were -- there was a period of time in our past where our PAM business was heavily promoted and the only trick in the book that we turned to was dealing. But if you look at consumer trends in oil over the last few years, you see that the oils have changed, it's moved to things like olive oil, things like coconut oil. So instead of competing on PAM on price attributes, we've evolved the PAM business, and we've got olive oil PAM. We've got coconut oil PAM. These are relevant modern-day attributes that change the discussion with the consumer to be about something that they value and they will pay more for and not about deep discounting. That's just one example. We'll talk about more examples at our Investor Day, but that's exactly what we need to do to get really the loyalty up on our business, get our prices up and build our overall brand strength to make it as modern as it can be."

We're excited to be with you this morning for our first call as Conagra Brands. With the spinoff of Lamb Weston successfully behind us, we have embarked on a new era as a branded pure play CPG company. We've made a lot of progress to get to this point, but more importantly, we're confident that we have a lot of runway to deliver significant improvement and profitability in the years to come.
On today's call, I'm going to take a few minutes to provide some context around where we are and our expectations going forward. I'll also touch on the progress we're making against our strategic plan. I'll cover a few highlights from the quarter, and Dave will get into the details before we take your questions.
For those of you who we were able to join us at our Investor Day in October, you will recall that I left you with 6 key takeaways about the business and our plans for the future. First, we have clearly moved beyond our roots as ag company, and later, a global conglomerate. ConAgra Brands today is a much different organization. And as we discussed with you in October, the differences aren't just structural, our culture has fundamentally evolved. The team has developed the focus and discipline required to succeed.
Hand-in-hand with these cultural changes are the revenue management capabilities we've developed and the deep commitment to cost and complexity reduction efforts now embedded in our organization. We expect these efforts will fuel will additional margin expansion over time, which in turn will fuel improved growth and cash flow. It's also worth repeating that we're in a unique position to reshape our portfolio in an efficient manner. We have a strong balance sheet and an attractive tax asset. Over time, we can leverage both in a disciplined manner to drive additional growth and maximize value.
We have driven a lot of change in our organization, and we won't stand still. But as I've said before, as we continue to implement changes, we will do so in an orderly, thoughtful and patient manner. We will continue to move with urgency, but our efforts will require time and investment.
Moving to Slide 7, our actions will continue to be guided by the 5 Portfolio Management Principles that I introduced on our Q1 call, and that Tom and Darren described in detail at our Investor Day. We will stay focused on: number one, upgrading the volume base; two, refreshing our core; and three, the clear roles we've assigned to the brands within our portfolio, via our rigorous portfolio segmentation process. We will also, four, ramp up innovation and disciplined M&A. And five, effectively back our winners with proper A&P and trade investment.
Make no mistake, we intend to grow. But we will do so in a manner that is profitable and drive shareholder value. Our PMPs will continue to guide us in that regard. We've already made significant progress in shifting our approach to managing the portfolio. The segmentation we described at Investor Day, shown here on Slide 8, reflects the renewed focus we have brought to our brand. We have grouped each brand into 1 of 4 categories: reinvigorate, accelerate growth, reliable contributors and then, grow core and extend.
This framework guides our investment priorities, particularly around A&P and innovation. And as we discussed at our Investor Day, it provides the lens for our SKU optimization efforts, which is really a broad-based initiative, focus on eliminating a long tail of SKUs that add up to a small amount of volume and weak margins. This effort has -- this effort is important to driving improved overall profitability and has been recognized and commended by our customers, particularly our early efforts on brands like Chef Boyardee and Healthy Choice.
Moving to Slide 9, we are clear [ph] that our success will require us to break a number of bad habits, and we are making meaningful progress. We are moving from a focus on volume at any cost to a focus on value creation, from a reliance on trade-driven push tools to a reliance on stronger brands, stronger innovation and consumer pull. As I just mentioned, we're shifting away from SKU proliferation to optimizing our SKUs, with a focus on sustainable returns. And we're continuing to make strides in our approach to A&P, which is now more focused, consistent and tied to ROI.
Our focus on the fundamentals is translating into results. As you can see on Slide 10, it was another quarter of progress. We continued to execute our strategy of building a higher-quality revenue base, consistent with Portfolio Management Principle #1. The headline on net sales is the 11.5% decline, but I want to call your attention to the next line, where we note the 5.5% of estimated impact of the divestitures and foreign exchange. Our net sales were down a result of the actions we're taking to optimize our portfolio and drive our value-over-volume strategy to upgrade our revenue base.
Adjusted operating profit was up 11.6%, driven by strong gross margin expansion, improved mix, more efficient pricing and trade and continued SG&A savings. This resulted in a 350 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin to 17%. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.49 for the quarter, up 26% from the prior year's quarter, driven by operating income growth and lower interest expense. It's worth noting that our bottom line reflects core operating performance that were slightly ahead of our expectations, offset by weaker-than-expected performance from our Ardent Mills JV. Ardent has been negatively impacted by a broader set of market dynamics in the milling industry.
To illustrate the point on value over volume, Slide 11 shows some of the information that Tom McGough shared at our Investor Day. The chart on the left shows that we've been willing to walk away from lower ROI promotional activities, and thus, our incremental volume sales can [ph] significantly decline as planned. We began to reduce our reliance on promotions during the second quarter and third quarter last year, so we will soon be lapping these results. The chart on the right shows a steady increase in base sales velocity trends, which illustrates that our efforts are working to build a stronger foundation as core consumers are staying with our brands.
Looking ahead at our margins -- looking at our margins, we are clearly making progress. Versus last year's Q2, we have driven 250 basis points of gross margin improvement behind our pricing and trade promotion discipline, supply chain productivity as well as some input cost favorability. While our second quarter has traditionally delivered a higher margin, we are confident that we will be able to sustain the improvement and hit our gross margin guidance for the year.
On the right side of the slide, you can see our operating margin improvement. Helping this number is the fact that our SG&A optimization efforts are coming quicker than we anticipated. In the back half of the year, we will continue our efforts to invest new capabilities at our brands, and thus, we expect operating margins to fall in line with our guidance. 
While we're pleased with our margin results to date, we know there is more we can do from here. Our game plan is to grow the centerline of our profitability over time. We understand that there is a standard deviation from quarter-to-quarter, but we're taking a longer-term view. We're focused on the centerline and we continue to see room to grow. Our gross margin progress reflects our ability to quickly capture some of the low-hanging fruit we identified early on. Looking ahead, there are no major structural issues preventing us from delivering further improvement, so we will continue to chip away at that opportunity.
Another opportunity we're focused on is successfully expanding into on-trend categories. The Frontera acquisition is a great example. It opens up an opportunity to capitalize on the rapid growth in gourmet Mexican cuisine. It has been a pleasure working with Chef Rick Bayless, and the integration process is moving forward according to plan.
Turning to Slide 15, as we move forward to the remainder of fiscal 2017 and beyond, we will continue to execute against our Portfolio Management Principles. In the second half of fiscal 2017, we'll be lapping last year's pricing actions and expect to see corresponding improvement in our top-line trend, as we continue to expand our margins. Our innovation progress is also accelerating, and we expect to see our new products hit the market in early fiscal 2018. And as I just said, we will continue to chip away at the gross margin opportunity, while we deliver profitable growth.
And finally, we will look to continue to reshape our portfolio. This may include exiting brands in an efficient manner using our tax asset, it will also include augmenting our current portfolio through a disciplined approach to M&A. We still have a lot of work to do, but we're pleased with the progress we're making. We are confident that the plans we have in motion are the right ones to drive improved consistency and profitability at ConAgra and long-term value for our shareholders.
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to thank our talented and dedicated ConAgra Brands employees who continue to do a tremendous job serving our customers and executing our strategy. I'm grateful for all you do and wish all of you a happy holiday season.
Now over to you, Dave."

Slide 17 outlines a few key points related to our basis of presentation. Lamb Weston and the related joint ventures are now reclassified as discontinued operations. The commercial reporting segment for the second quarter and ongoing will have no current operating results, it will only include the historical results for Spicetec and JM Swank. 
Please note that references to adjusted items refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability, and are reconciled to the closest GAAP measure and tables that are included in the earnings release and in the presentation deck. The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses, which was divested in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, are included in the historical results and are not called out as items impacting comparability.
Moving to Slide 18, reported net sales for the second quarter were down 11.5% compared to a year ago. Adjusted gross profit dollars were down 3.6% versus the second quarter a year ago, as gross margin improvement was more than offset by volume declines, unfavorable FX and the sale of the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. Adjusted gross margin was 31.1% in the second quarter, an increase of 250 basis points compared to a year ago. This increase was driven by supply chain cost reductions and productivity gains, and improvements in pricing and trade efficiency.
Adjusted operating profit increased 11.6% due to the large reduction in SG&A, which offset the gross profit dollar decline. I will discuss SG&A in more detail shortly. Importantly, adjusted operating margin was 17% for the second quarter, up 350 basis points from the second quarter a year ago, due to the gross margin improvement and SG&A reductions. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 for the second quarter, up 26% from the prior year due to significant SG&A reductions and lower interest expense.
Slide 19 shows the drivers of our second quarter net sales change versus a year ago. Total net sales were down 11.5%. Divestitures and FX negatively impacted net sales by 5.5%. Volume declines contributed 7% of the decrease, partially offset by a 1% improvement in price/mix and trade productivity.
Slide 20 highlights our continued strong SG&A performance, resulting from the restructuring we started in fiscal year 2016. Note that this chart represents adjusted SG&A, excluding A&P expense. A&P is included as part of SG&A on the face of the financial statements. Adjusted SG&A was down 21% in the second quarter versus a year ago. And the for the first half of fiscal year 2017, adjusted SG&A was down $129 million, or 25%. 
SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, was 9.5% for the second quarter, and was 9.8% for the first half of fiscal year 2017. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from timing on certain SG&A expenses, which we expect to hit in the second half of fiscal year 2017. Having said that, we are pleased with our first half SG&A performance as we are realizing our cost savings goals a bit faster than we planned.
Moving to Slide 21, this chart outlines the drivers of EPS improvement from $0.39 in the second quarter a year ago to $0.49 this quarter, which is a 26% increase. As we expected, the EPS impact of the volume decline was offset by the gross margin expansion from supply chain cost reductions and productivity gains, as well as pricing and trade efficiency improvements. The supply chain gains represented approximately 2/3 of the gross margin increase, while pricing and trade represented 1/3. Negative FX from the weakening of the Mexican peso and the divestiture of Spicetec and JM Swank were more than offset by the EPS benefit of SG&A cost reductions and interest expense declines due to lower debt.
Slide 22 highlights the net sales and adjusted operating profit by reporting segment. In our  Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales were $854 million for the quarter, down 6%, reflecting a 7% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price/mix. Adjusted operating profit was $222 million in the quarter, an increase of 18%. The increase in adjusted operating profit reflects continued progress on gross margin expansion, reduced SG&A cost and lower A&P spending, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume.
In our refrigerated and frozen segment, net sales were $740 million for the quarter, down 10.5%, reflecting an 11.4% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price/mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $120 million in the second quarter, down 7.5%. The decrease reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts that were more than offset by volume declines and the impact of benefits in the prior year's quarter from avian flu-related higher volume and sales for Egg Beaters. Our Egg Beater product supply was not impacted as a result of the avian flu outbreak, creating the sales opportunity in the prior year quarter.
In our International segment, net sales were $211 million for the quarter, down 4.5%. This reflects a 2.5% decline in volume, a 2% improvement in price/mix and a negative 4% impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted segment operating profit was $18 million in the second quarter, down 17%, driven primarily by the negative impact of the weakening Mexican peso. Reported segment operating profit includes a $44 million pretax impairment charge to goodwill due to the impact of the weakening peso on our business in Mexico.
In our Foodservice segment, net sales were $283 million for the quarter, down 1%. Adjusted operating profit was $32 million in the second quarter, an increase of 56% versus a year ago. The net sales results reflected decrease in sales from exiting a noncore foodservice snack business. The adjusted segment operating profit increase was primarily due to a onetime inventory write-down cost incurred in the year-ago quarter for the business we exited. As mentioned earlier, there were no sales or adjusted operating profits in the Commercial segment this quarter, given the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures and the reclassification of the Lamb Weston business to discontinued operations.
Slide 23 summarizes select cash flow and balance sheet information for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 versus the year-ago period. We ended the second quarter with $3.5 billion of total debt, and approximately $1.4 billion of cash on hand. This results in net debt of approximately $2 billion, with no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. In the first half, total debt was reduced by approximately $2 billion. As we have stated in the past, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating for the business.
We had capital expenditures of $118 million for the first half of 2017 versus $110 million in the comparable year period. As previously announced, the Board of Directors approved its first dividend since the completion of the spinoff of the Lamb Weston business on November 9, 2016. A quarterly dividend payment of $0.20 per share will be paid on March 1, 2017, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 30, 2017. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $85 million. Approximately 300,000 of these shares were repurchased before the spinoff.
In addition, I will also note the following items related to corporate for total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $17 million for the quarter, down 2% versus the prior year, due to the company's Ardent Mills joint venture performing below expectations due to market conditions. Adjusted corporate expenses were $36 millionfor  the second quarter versus $54 million a year ago, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts.
Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $97 million, down 9%. Advertising and promotion as a percentage of net sales was approximately 4.7% for the second quarter, up from 4.5% a year ago. Net interest expense was $54 million in the second quarter versus $79 million a year ago due to the paydown of debt during the past 12 months. For the second quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $9 million and operating profit by $6 million versus the year-ago quarter. Lastly, the second quarter effective tax rate was 32.4%. The effective tax rate was slightly lower than planned due to reduced tax expense related to stock compensation expense.
I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter: approximately $0.03 per diluted share of net expense or $20 million pretax related to restructuring plans; approximately $0.09 per diluted share of net expense or $61 million pretax related to extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the Lamb Weston spinoff; approximately $0.09 per diluted share of net expense or $44 million pretax, related to an impairment of goodwill in the Mexican business; and approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net expense related to tax items associated with the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures.
Slide 24 summarizes our full year fiscal 2017 financial outlook, which is the same outlook we provided at Investor Day in October. As we communicated at Investor Day, this outlook was based upon a pro forma fiscal year 2016 P&L base, which excluded the Lamb Weston and JM Swank and Spicetec results. Lamb Weston is now included in discontinued operations and is excluded from the Conagra Brands historical information. However, JM Swank and Spicetec are not accounted for as discontinued operations. So those results are included in the historical financial information for Conagra [ph] Brands. 
As footnoted on this chart, if you include the JM Swank and Spicetec net sales, the fiscal year 2017 net sales outlook is minus 8.5% to minus 9.5%. To be clear, this is not a change in our outlook, we just wanted to provide you with the additional detail of the fiscal year 2017 outlook with Spicetec and JM Swank included.
So in summary, ConAgra [ph] Brands continues to make progress upgrading our volume base. Gross margins are expanding and our SG&A cost-reduction program is progressing well. Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the flexibility to evaluate various opportunities to drive shareowner value. And our outlook for fiscal year 2017 remains unchanged as we start the second half.
Thank you. This concludes my formal remarks. Sean, Tom McGough and I will be happy to take your questions. I will now pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the session."

And to the best of our ability in tracking some of the recent scanner data or more recent scanner data by brand, it just seems like the volume declines have broadened out maybe to a much broader set of brands across the portfolio, and even some of those that are in the accelerating growth sort of quadrant. So I just want to get a sense of -- is that something that you see in your data? Is -- if so, what brings that about? And is it consistent with the expectation, obviously, that volume trends look -- start to improve in the back half of the fiscal year?"

What we're seeing is pretty much exactly what we expect to see. Our actions are in fact broad based and largely around promotion and pricing. But I think big picture, clearly, we're out to transform this company and unlock value. For some time now, we've been very proactive in communicating that we need to change some of our legacy practices and walk away from some of the low-margin volume that those practices has embedded in our base. And we're doing that, and it is working. And big picture, we're focused on unlocking margin potential. And for that to happen, it is a mandate that we change our practices across our brands and upgrade our volume base and to ramp-up and improve brand building and innovation capabilities. So that's what we're doing. And I do like what I see. And in the back half, you will see trends improve. In fact, as the most recent takeaway data shows, that's already beginning to happen. But I do want to remind everybody that this is not a flip of a switch, this is a process and we're going to manage it over time. But it's definitely going to benefit shareholders. In terms of any other particulars, Tom, is it still very largely concentrated, do you want to add any color to that?"

As you highlighted, we are taking a very focused and disciplined approach to price for brands that were underpriced, overpromoted, and it also includes proactively optimizing our SKU mix. What you see is that we're upgrading our volume base, one that is less promotionally-driven, higher margin. And as you highlighted in your chart, the fundamental base sales velocity performance is improving on the portfolio. So when you look at Q2 in particular, there's a couple of things that are somewhat unique. First, Egg Beaters, is -- our frozen and refrigerated segments include Egg Beaters. In the year-ago period, there was a sales benefit associated with the avian flu impact, where our supply was relatively unaffected from that. The second thing that's unique is Q2 of last year was a significant promotional period for us on our premium meals brands: Healthy Choice, Marie Callender, Bertolli. That's part of our trade promotion productivity is to optimize that spending. It will begin to lap those as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. And then the third component would be supply issues. At the beginning of the quarter, we still had some residual impact from P.F. Chang's. Recall that showed up in lower merchandising at the beginning of the quarter. And at the end of the quarter, there was some industry issue on Reddi-wip -- or industry issue on nitrous oxide that impacted Reddi-wip. So overall, we're fundamentally on track building and upgrading our volume base."

As we innovate, particularly when we go into adjacencies as you look at our segmentation, in some cases, before -- until we build a successful model in the marketplace and have empirical evidence that the new innovation is going to work, we may go to a co-packer. And then we do that because we don't want to commit capital upfront. Then once we've got the evidence that it's a successful innovation, we repatriated, we'll invest the capital, we'll bring it in-house. So sometimes you got to bit of gross margin headwind on kind of breakthrough new innovations in the early days until you prove it out. But that is we think the right way of having done this for a long time, to manage innovation because you don't always hit them all out of the park. You have some hits and misses, you want to be judicious on capital investment in support of new innovation."

So we don't want to have pretty capital of items like that sitting around our warehouses. We've got to clean that up and we've been very proactively doing that.

A lot of what we are doing at certain brands will be through this year. There are other brands as we talked about at Investor Day with respect to mass and complexity that we won't even get to until next year. I think big picture, the way to think about it instead of getting overly exercised around the upticks of a top-line trend, step back and think about whether or not there's real value associated with that volume to begin with.

But it's going to be obviously, you're going to see a change in SG&A in the back half and you'll see an improvement on the top line."

We're excited to be with you this morning for our first call as Conagra Brands. With the spinoff of Lamb Weston successfully behind us, we have embarked on a new era as a branded pure play CPG company. We've made a lot of progress to get to this point, but more importantly, we're confident that we have a lot of runway to deliver significant improvement and profitability in the years to come.
On today's call, I'm going to take a few minutes to provide some context around where we are and our expectations going forward. I'll also touch on the progress we're making against our strategic plan. I'll cover a few highlights from the quarter, and Dave will get into the details before we take your questions.
For those of you who we were able to join us at our Investor Day in October, you will recall that I left you with 6 key takeaways about the business and our plans for the future. First, we have clearly moved beyond our roots as ag company, and later, a global conglomerate. Conagra Brands today is a much different organization. And as we discussed with you in October, the differences aren't just structural, our culture has fundamentally evolved. The team has developed the focus and discipline required to succeed.
Hand-in-hand with these cultural changes are the revenue management capabilities we've developed and the deep commitment to cost and complexity reduction efforts now embedded in our organization. We expect these efforts will fuel will additional margin expansion over time, which in turn will fuel improved growth and cash flow. It's also worth repeating that we're in a unique position to reshape our portfolio in an efficient manner. We have a strong balance sheet and an attractive tax asset. Over time, we can leverage both in a disciplined manner to drive additional growth and maximize value.
We have driven a lot of change in our organization, and we won't stand still. But as I've said before, as we continue to implement changes, we will do so in an orderly, thoughtful and patient manner. We will continue to move with urgency, but our efforts will require time and investment.
Moving to Slide 7, our actions will continue to be guided by the 5 Portfolio Management Principles that I introduced on our Q1 call, and that Tom and Darren described in detail at our Investor Day. We will stay focused on: number one, upgrading the volume base; two, refreshing our core; and three, the clear roles we've assigned to the brands within our portfolio, via our rigorous portfolio segmentation process. We will also, four, ramp up innovation and disciplined M&A. And five, effectively back our winners with proper A&P and trade investment.
Make no mistake, we intend to grow. But we will do so in a manner that is profitable and drive shareholder value. Our PMPs will continue to guide us in that regard. We've already made significant progress in shifting our approach to managing the portfolio. The segmentation we described at Investor Day, shown here on Slide 8, reflects the renewed focus we have brought to our brand. We have grouped each brand into 1 of 4 categories: reinvigorate, accelerate growth, reliable contributors and then, grow core and extend.
This framework guides our investment priorities, particularly around A&P and innovation. And as we discussed at our Investor Day, it provides the lens for our SKU optimization efforts, which is really a broad-based initiative, focus on eliminating a long tail of SKUs that add up to a small amount of volume and weak margins. This effort has -- this effort is important to driving improved overall profitability and has been recognized and commended by our customers, particularly our early efforts on brands like Chef Boyardee and Healthy Choice.
Moving to Slide 9, we are clear-eyed that our success will require us to break a number of bad habits, and we are making meaningful progress. We are moving from a focus on volume at any cost to a focus on value creation, from a reliance on trade-driven push tools to a reliance on stronger brands, stronger innovation and consumer pull. As I just mentioned, we're shifting away from SKU proliferation to optimizing our SKUs, with a focus on sustainable returns. And we're continuing to make strides in our approach to A&P, which is now more focused, consistent and tied to ROI.
Our focus on the fundamentals is translating into results. As you can see on Slide 10, it was another quarter of progress. We continued to execute our strategy of building a higher-quality revenue base, consistent with Portfolio Management Principle #1. The headline on net sales is the 11.5% decline, but I want to call your attention to the next line, where we note the 5.5% of estimated impact of the divestitures and foreign exchange. Our net sales were down a result of the actions we're taking to optimize our portfolio and drive our value-over-volume strategy to upgrade our revenue base.
Adjusted operating profit was up 11.6%, driven by strong gross margin expansion, improved mix, more efficient pricing and trade and continued SG&A savings. This resulted in a 350 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin to 17%. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.49 for the quarter, up 26% from the prior year's quarter, driven by operating income growth and lower interest expense. It's worth noting that our bottom line reflects core operating performance that were slightly ahead of our expectations, offset by weaker-than-expected performance from our Ardent Mills JV. Ardent has been negatively impacted by a broader set of market dynamics in the milling industry.
To illustrate the point on value over volume, Slide 11 shows some of the information that Tom McGough shared at our Investor Day. The chart on the left shows that we've been willing to walk away from lower ROI promotional activities, and thus, our incremental volume sales can significantly decline as planned. We began to reduce our reliance on promotions during the second quarter and third quarter last year, so we will soon be lapping these results. The chart on the right shows a steady increase in base sales velocity trends, which illustrates that our efforts are working to build a stronger foundation as core consumers are staying with our brands.
Looking ahead at our margins -- looking at our margins, we are clearly making progress. Versus last year's Q2, we have driven 250 basis points of gross margin improvement behind our pricing and trade promotion discipline, supply chain productivity as well as some input cost favorability. While our second quarter has traditionally delivered a higher margin, we are confident that we will be able to sustain the improvement and hit our gross margin guidance for the year.
On the right side of the slide, you can see our operating margin improvement. Helping this number is the fact that our SG&A optimization efforts are coming quicker than we anticipated. In the back half of the year, we will continue our efforts to invest new capabilities at our brands, and thus, we expect operating margins to fall in line with our guidance. 
While we're pleased with our margin results to date, we know there is more we can do from here. Our game plan is to grow the centerline of our profitability over time. We understand that there is a standard deviation from quarter-to-quarter, but we're taking a longer-term view. We're focused on the centerline and we continue to see room to grow. Our gross margin progress reflects our ability to quickly capture some of the low-hanging fruit we identified early on. Looking ahead, there are no major structural issues preventing us from delivering further improvement, so we will continue to chip away at that opportunity.
Another opportunity we're focused on is successfully expanding into on-trend categories. The Frontera acquisition is a great example. It opens up an opportunity to capitalize on the rapid growth in gourmet Mexican cuisine. It has been a pleasure working with Chef Rick Bayless, and the integration process is moving forward according to plan.
Turning to Slide 15, as we move forward to the remainder of fiscal 2017 and beyond, we will continue to execute against our Portfolio Management Principles. In the second half of fiscal 2017, we'll be lapping last year's pricing actions and expect to see corresponding improvement in our top-line trend, as we continue to expand our margins. Our innovation progress is also accelerating, and we expect to see our new products hit the market in early fiscal 2018. And as I just said, we will continue to chip away at the gross margin opportunity, while we deliver profitable growth.
And finally, we will look to continue to reshape our portfolio. This may include exiting brands in an efficient manner using our tax asset, it will also include augmenting our current portfolio through a disciplined approach to M&A. We still have a lot of work to do, but we're pleased with the progress we're making. We are confident that the plans we have in motion are the right ones to drive improved consistency and profitability at ConAgra and long-term value for our shareholders.
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to thank our talented and dedicated Conagra Brands employees who continue to do a tremendous job serving our customers and executing our strategy. I'm grateful for all you do and wish all of you a happy holiday season.
Now over to you, Dave."

Slide 17 outlines a few key points related to our basis of presentation. Lamb Weston and the related joint ventures are now reclassified as discontinued operations. The commercial reporting segment for the second quarter and ongoing will have no current operating results, it will only include the historical results for Spicetec and JM Swank. 
Please note that references to adjusted items refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability, and are reconciled to the closest GAAP measure and tables that are included in the earnings release and in the presentation deck. The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses, which was divested in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, are included in the historical results and are not called out as items impacting comparability.
Moving to Slide 18, reported net sales for the second quarter were down 11.5% compared to a year ago. Adjusted gross profit dollars were down 3.6% versus the second quarter a year ago, as gross margin improvement was more than offset by volume declines, unfavorable FX and the sale of the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. Adjusted gross margin was 31.1% in the second quarter, an increase of 250 basis points compared to a year ago. This increase was driven by supply chain cost reductions and productivity gains, and improvements in pricing and trade efficiency.
Adjusted operating profit increased 11.6% due to the large reduction in SG&A, which offset the gross profit dollar decline. I will discuss SG&A in more detail shortly. Importantly, adjusted operating margin was 17% for the second quarter, up 350 basis points from the second quarter a year ago, due to the gross margin improvement and SG&A reductions. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 for the second quarter, up 26% from the prior year due to significant SG&A reductions and lower interest expense.
Slide 19 shows the drivers of our second quarter net sales change versus a year ago. Total net sales were down 11.5%. Divestitures and FX negatively impacted net sales by 5.5%. Volume declines contributed 7% of the decrease, partially offset by a 1% improvement in price/mix and trade productivity.
Slide 20 highlights our continued strong SG&A performance, resulting from the restructuring we started in fiscal year 2016. Note that this chart represents adjusted SG&A, excluding A&P expense. A&P is included as part of SG&A on the face of the financial statements. Adjusted SG&A was down 21% in the second quarter versus a year ago. And the for the first half of fiscal year 2017, adjusted SG&A was down $129 million, or 25%. 
SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, was 9.5% for the second quarter, and was 9.8% for the first half of fiscal year 2017. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from timing on certain SG&A expenses, which we expect to hit in the second half of fiscal year 2017. Having said that, we are pleased with our first half SG&A performance as we are realizing our cost savings goals a bit faster than we planned.
Moving to Slide 21, this chart outlines the drivers of EPS improvement from $0.39 in the second quarter a year ago to $0.49 this quarter, which is a 26% increase. As we expected, the EPS impact of the volume decline was offset by the gross margin expansion from supply chain cost reductions and productivity gains, as well as pricing and trade efficiency improvements. The supply chain gains represented approximately 2/3 of the gross margin increase, while pricing and trade represented 1/3. Negative FX from the weakening of the Mexican peso and the divestiture of Spicetec and JM Swank were more than offset by the EPS benefit of SG&A cost reductions and interest expense declines due to lower debt.
Slide 22 highlights the net sales and adjusted operating profit by reporting segment. In our  Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales were $854 million for the quarter, down 6%, reflecting a 7% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price/mix. Adjusted operating profit was $222 million in the quarter, an increase of 18%. The increase in adjusted operating profit reflects continued progress on gross margin expansion, reduced SG&A cost and lower A&P spending, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume.
In our refrigerated and frozen segment, net sales were $740 million for the quarter, down 10.5%, reflecting an 11.4% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price/mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $120 million in the second quarter, down 7.5%. The decrease reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts that were more than offset by volume declines and the impact of benefits in the prior year's quarter from avian flu-related higher volume and sales for Egg Beaters. Our Egg Beater product supply was not impacted as a result of the avian flu outbreak, creating the sales opportunity in the prior year quarter.
In our International segment, net sales were $211 million for the quarter, down 4.5%. This reflects a 2.5% decline in volume, a 2% improvement in price/mix and a negative 4% impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted segment operating profit was $18 million in the second quarter, down 17%, driven primarily by the negative impact of the weakening Mexican peso. Reported segment operating profit includes a $44 million pretax impairment charge to goodwill due to the impact of the weakening peso on our business in Mexico.
In our Foodservice segment, net sales were $283 million for the quarter, down 1%. Adjusted operating profit was $32 million in the second quarter, an increase of 56% versus a year ago. The net sales results reflected decrease in sales from exiting a noncore foodservice snack business. The adjusted segment operating profit increase was primarily due to a onetime inventory write-down cost incurred in the year-ago quarter for the business we exited. As mentioned earlier, there were no sales or adjusted operating profits in the Commercial segment this quarter, given the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures and the reclassification of the Lamb Weston business to discontinued operations.
Slide 23 summarizes select cash flow and balance sheet information for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 versus the year-ago period. We ended the second quarter with $3.5 billion of total debt, and approximately $1.4 billion of cash on hand. This results in net debt of approximately $2 billion, with no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. In the first half, total debt was reduced by approximately $2 billion. As we have stated in the past, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating for the business.
We had capital expenditures of $118 million for the first half of 2017 versus $110 million in the comparable year period. As previously announced, the Board of Directors approved its first dividend since the completion of the spinoff of the Lamb Weston business on November 9, 2016. A quarterly dividend payment of $0.20 per share will be paid on March 1, 2017, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 30, 2017. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $85 million. Approximately 300,000 of these shares were repurchased before the spinoff.
In addition, I will also note the following items related to corporate for total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $17 million for the quarter, down 2% versus the prior year, due to the company's Ardent Mills joint venture performing below expectations due to market conditions. Adjusted corporate expenses were $36 million for the second quarter versus $54 million a year ago, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts.
Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $97 million, down 9%. Advertising and promotion as a percentage of net sales was approximately 4.7% for the second quarter, up from 4.5% a year ago. Net interest expense was $54 million in the second quarter versus $79 million a year ago due to the pay down of debt during the past 12 months. For the second quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $9 million and operating profit by $6 million versus the year-ago quarter. Lastly, the second quarter effective tax rate was 32.4%. The effective tax rate was slightly lower than planned due to reduced tax expense related to stock compensation expense.
I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter: approximately $0.03 per diluted share of net expense or $20 million pretax related to restructuring plans; approximately $0.09 per diluted share of net expense or $61 million pretax related to extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the Lamb Weston spinoff; approximately $0.09 per diluted share of net expense or $44 million pretax, related to an impairment of goodwill in the Mexican business; and approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net expense related to tax items associated with the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures.
Slide 24 summarizes our full year fiscal 2017 financial outlook, which is the same outlook we provided at Investor Day in October. As we communicated at Investor Day, this outlook was based upon a pro forma fiscal year 2016 P&L base, which excluded the Lamb Weston and JM Swank and Spicetec results. Lamb Weston is now included in discontinued operations and is excluded from the Conagra Brands historical information. However, JM Swank and Spicetec are not accounted for as discontinued operations. So those results are included in the historical financial information for Conagra Brands. 
As footnoted on this chart, if you include the JM Swank and Spicetec net sales, the fiscal year 2017 net sales outlook is minus 8.5% to minus 9.5%. To be clear, this is not a change in our outlook, we just wanted to provide you with the additional detail of the fiscal year 2017 outlook with Spicetec and JM Swank included.
So in summary, Conagra Brands continues to make progress upgrading our volume base. Gross margins are expanding and our SG&A cost-reduction program is progressing well. Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the flexibility to evaluate various opportunities to drive shareowner value. And our outlook for fiscal year 2017 remains unchanged as we start the second half.
Thank you. This concludes my formal remarks. Sean, Tom McGough and I will be happy to take your questions. I will now pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the session."

And to the best of our ability in tracking some of the recent scanner data or more recent scanner data by brand, it just seems like the volume declines have broadened out maybe to a much broader set of brands across the portfolio, and even some of those that are in the accelerating growth sort of quadrant. So I just want to get a sense of -- is that something that you see in your data? Is -- if so, what brings that about? And is it consistent with the expectation, obviously, that volume trends look -- start to improve in the back half of the fiscal year?"

What we're seeing is pretty much exactly what we expect to see. Our actions are in fact broad based and largely around promotion and pricing. But I think big picture, clearly, we're out to transform this company and unlock value. For some time now, we've been very proactive in communicating that we need to change some of our legacy practices and walk away from some of the low-margin volume that those practices has embedded in our base. And we're doing that, and it is working. And big picture, we're focused on unlocking margin potential. And for that to happen, it is a mandate that we change our practices across our brands and upgrade our volume base and to ramp-up and improve brand building and innovation capabilities. So that's what we're doing. And I do like what I see. And in the back half, you will see trends improve. In fact, as the most recent takeaway data shows, that's already beginning to happen. But I do want to remind everybody that this is not a flip of a switch, this is a process and we're going to manage it over time. But it's definitely going to benefit shareholders. In terms of any other particulars, Tom, is it still very largely concentrated, do you want to add any color to that?"

As you highlighted, we are taking a very focused and disciplined approach to price for brands that were underpriced, overpromoted, and it also includes proactively optimizing our SKU mix. What you see is that we're upgrading our volume base, one that is less promotionally-driven, higher margin. And as you highlighted in your chart, the fundamental base sales velocity performance is improving on the portfolio. So when you look at Q2 in particular, there's a couple of things that are somewhat unique. First, Egg Beaters, is -- our frozen and refrigerated segments include Egg Beaters. In the year-ago period, there was a sales benefit associated with the avian flu impact, where our supply was relatively unaffected from that. The second thing that's unique is Q2 of last year was a significant promotional period for us on our premium meals brands: Healthy Choice, Marie Callender, Bertolli. That's part of our trade promotion productivity is to optimize that spending. It will begin to lap those as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. And then the third component would be supply issues. At the beginning of the quarter, we still had some residual impact from P.F. Chang's. Recall that showed up in lower merchandising at the beginning of the quarter. And at the end of the quarter, there was some industry issue on Reddi-wip -- or industry issue on nitrous oxide that impacted Reddi-wip. So overall, we're fundamentally on track building and upgrading our volume base."

As we innovate, particularly when we go into adjacencies as you look at our segmentation, in some cases, before -- until we build a success model in the marketplace and have empirical evidence that the new innovation is going to work, we may go to a co-packer. And then we do that because we don't commit capital upfront. Then once we've got the evidence that it's a successful innovation, we repatriate it, we'll invest the capital, we'll bring it in-house. So sometimes you've got a bit of gross margin headwind on kind of breakthrough new innovations in the early days until you prove it out. But that is, we think, the right way to, having done this for a long time, to manage innovation. Because you don't always hit them all out of the park.

So we have a lot of complexity and a lot of SKU proliferation that's not adding up to a lot of volume. And as you might imagine, on shelf, it doesn't add up to a lot of productivity. So we don't want to have working capital of items like that sitting around our warehouses. We've got to clean that up. And we've been very proactively doing that, and you see that in some of the distribution trends. But when you do that, as you can imagine, what remains is higher velocity stuff. So you see a -- the equal and opposite effect, usually, of improvements in velocity. And that's what we've been looking for and that's pretty much exactly what we're seeing."

And when you take out SKUs, that's a negative base driver. When you increase price, that's a negative base driver. But conversely, when you have effective A&P and effective innovation, that's positive base drivers. So this is a process for us, kind of continuing to upgrade this volume base. A lot of what we are doing at certain brands will be through this year. There are other brands as we talked about at Investor Day with respect to mass [ph] and complexity that we won't even get to till next year. So I think big picture, the way to think about it is instead of getting overly exercised around the optics of a top-line trend, step back and think about whether or not there's real value associated with that volume to begin with. Because if there's not value associated with it, there's not margin associated with it. Frankly, all it's giving us is optics and that's not where we're in business for. We're in this for value creation."

So we put a couple few points on top of that, and we call it a renewal rate. We want to get to 15%, but as you might imagine, rebuilding the innovation pipeline takes longer than, say, taking out costs. So one of the reasons why we got so aggressive on costs in the early days of this transformation is we were grounded in a clear-eyed recognition that rebuilding the innovation pipe does take longer. So it's been important to us to get at some of these low-hanging fruit cost opportunities early on, while we repopulate the innovation funnel. We're already doing it. As I said, we moved it from 9% to call it 12%, and it will continue to ramp up from here. Importantly, it's also got to be -- it's proverbial fewer, bigger better idea, but for us that's particularly important given our track record of proliferating so many teeny little SKUs, and we're working at that because we want shelf efficiency for every item we put out there for our customers."

Is it just kind of putting an average gross margin on it firstly?

And quite frankly, it's time because there's a lot of grumbling around lack of growth in the industry, but as Darren pointed out at Investor Day, when you peel back the onion and you look at it, there are clear pockets of growth. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the big companies that have been getting after, it's been the small companies because they tend to be faster to market, they tend to be more externally focused. So that brings me to the second piece of your question, which is, what are we structurally changing? We are much more externally focused, I would say, than we've been. In fact, external focus is one of our company values. And we are determined to activate our insights and turn them into action and to get our new innovation ideas to market quicker. So historically, it's been a slow slog for us to get insight, convert them into action and get them into market. That is making progress.

We're excited to be with you this morning for our first call as Conagra Brands. With the spinoff of Lamb Weston successfully behind us, we have embarked on a new era as a branded pure play CPG company. We've made a lot of progress to get to this point, but more importantly, we're confident that we have a lot of runway to deliver significant improvement and profitability in the years to come.
On today's call, I'm going to take a few minutes to provide some context around where we are and our expectations going forward. I'll also touch on the progress we're making against our strategic plan. I'll cover a few highlights from the quarter, and Dave will get into the details before we take your questions.
For those of you who were able to join us at our Investor Day in October, you will recall that I left you with 6 key takeaways about the business and our plans for the future. First, we have clearly moved beyond our roots as an ag company, and later, a global conglomerate. Conagra Brands today is a much different organization. And as we discussed with you in October, the differences aren't just structural, our culture has fundamentally evolved. The team has developed the focus and discipline required to succeed.
Hand-in-hand with these cultural changes are the revenue management capabilities we've developed and the deep commitment to cost and complexity reduction efforts now embedded in our organization. We expect these efforts will fuel additional margin expansion over time, which in turn will fuel improved growth and cash flow. It's also worth repeating that we're in a unique position to reshape our portfolio in an efficient manner. We have a strong balance sheet and an attractive tax asset. Over time, we can leverage both in a disciplined manner to drive additional growth and maximize value.
We have driven a lot of change in our organization, and we won't stand still. But as I've said before, as we continue to implement changes, we will do so in an orderly, thoughtful and patient manner. We will continue to move with urgency, but our efforts will require time and investment.
Moving to Slide 7, our actions will continue to be guided by the 5 Portfolio Management Principles that I introduced on our Q1 call, and that Tom and Darren described in detail at our Investor Day. We will stay focused on: number one, upgrading the volume base; two, refreshing our core; and three, the clear roles we've assigned to the brands within our portfolio, via our rigorous portfolio segmentation process. We will also, four, ramp up innovation and disciplined M&A. And five, effectively back our winners with proper A&P and trade investment.
Make no mistake, we intend to grow. But we will do so in a manner that is profitable and drive shareholder value. Our PMPs will continue to guide us in that regard. We've already made significant progress in shifting our approach to managing the portfolio. The segmentation we described at Investor Day, shown here on Slide 8, reflects the renewed focus we have brought to our brand. We have grouped each brand into 1 of 4 categories: reinvigorate, accelerate growth, reliable contributors and then, grow core and extend.
This framework guides our investment priorities, particularly around A&P and innovation. And as we discussed at our Investor Day, it provides the lens for our SKU optimization efforts, which is really a broad-based initiative, focused on eliminating a long tail of SKUs that add up to a small amount of volume and weak margins. This effort has -- this effort is important to driving improved overall profitability and has been recognized and commended by our customers, particularly our early efforts on brands like Chef Boyardee and Healthy Choice.
Moving to Slide 9, we are clear-eyed that our success will require us to break a number of bad habits, and we are making meaningful progress. We are moving from a focus on volume at any cost to a focus on value creation, from a reliance on trade-driven push tools to a reliance on stronger brands, stronger innovation and consumer pull. As I just mentioned, we're shifting away from SKU proliferation to optimizing our SKUs, with a focus on sustainable returns. And we're continuing to make strides in our approach to A&P, which is now more focused, consistent and tied to ROI.
Our focus on the fundamentals is translating into results. As you can see on Slide 10, it was another quarter of progress. We continued to execute our strategy of building a higher-quality revenue base, consistent with Portfolio Management Principle #1. The headline on net sales is the 11.5% decline, but I want to call your attention to the next line, where we note the 5.5% of estimated impact of divestitures and foreign exchange. Our net sales were down as a result of the actions we're taking to optimize our portfolio and drive our value-over-volume strategy to upgrade our revenue base.
Adjusted operating profit was up 11.6%, driven by strong gross margin expansion, improved mix, more efficient pricing and trade and continued SG&A savings. This resulted in a 350 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin to 17%. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.49 for the quarter, up 26% from the prior year's quarter, driven by operating income growth and lower interest expense. It's worth noting that our bottom line reflects core operating performance that was slightly ahead of our expectations, offset by weaker-than-expected performance from our Ardent Mills JV. Ardent has been negatively impacted by a broader set of market dynamics in the milling industry.
To illustrate the point on value over volume, Slide 11 shows some of the information that Tom McGough first shared at our Investor Day. The chart on the left shows that we've been willing to walk away from lower ROI promotional activities, and thus, our incremental volume sales has significantly declined as planned. We began to reduce our reliance on promotions during the second quarter and third quarter last year, so we will soon be lapping these results. The chart on the right shows a steady increase in base sales velocity trends, which illustrates that our efforts are working to build a stronger foundation as core consumers are staying with our brands.
Looking ahead at our margins -- looking at our margins, we are clearly making progress. Versus last year's Q2, we have driven 250 basis points of gross margin improvement behind our pricing and trade promotion discipline, supply chain productivity as well as some input cost favorability. While our second quarter has traditionally delivered a higher margin, we are confident that we will be able to sustain the improvement and hit our gross margin guidance for the year.
On the right side of the slide, you can see our operating margin improvement. Helping this number is the fact that our SG&A optimization efforts are coming quicker than we anticipated. In the back half of the year, we will continue our efforts to invest new capabilities at our brands, and thus, we expect operating margins to fall in line with our guidance. 
While we're pleased with our margin results to date, we know there is more we can do from here. Our game plan is to grow the centerline of our profitability over time. We understand that there is a standard deviation from quarter-to-quarter, but we're taking a longer-term view. We're focused on the centerline and we continue to see room to grow. Our gross margin progress reflects our ability to quickly capture some of the low-hanging fruit we identified early on. Looking ahead, there are no major structural issues preventing us from delivering further improvement, so we will continue to chip away at that opportunity.
Another opportunity we're focused on is successfully expanding into on-trend categories. The Frontera acquisition is a great example. It opens up an opportunity to capitalize on the rapid growth in gourmet Mexican cuisine. It has been a pleasure working with Chef Rick Bayless, and the integration process is moving forward according to plan.
Turning to Slide 15, as we move forward to the remainder of fiscal 2017 and beyond, we will continue to execute against our Portfolio Management Principles. In the second half of fiscal 2017, we'll be lapping last year's pricing actions and expect to see corresponding improvement in our top-line trend, as we continue to expand our margins. Our innovation progress is also accelerating, and we expect to see our new products hit the market in early fiscal 2018. And as I just said, we will continue to chip away at the gross margin opportunity, while we deliver profitable growth.
And finally, we will look to continue to reshape our portfolio. This may include exiting brands in an efficient manner using our tax asset, it will also include augmenting our current portfolio through a disciplined approach to M&A. We still have a lot of work to do, but we're pleased with the progress we're making. We are confident that the plans we have in motion are the right ones to drive improved consistency and profitability at ConAgra and long-term value for our shareholders.
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to thank our talented and dedicated Conagra Brands employees who continue to do a tremendous job serving our customers and executing our strategy. I'm grateful for all you do and wish all of you a happy holiday season.
Now over to you, Dave."

Slide 17 outlines a few key points related to our basis of presentation. Lamb Weston and the related joint ventures are now reclassified as discontinued operations. The commercial reporting segment for the second quarter and ongoing will have no current operating results, it will only include the historical results for Spicetec and JM Swank. 
Please note that references to adjusted items refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability, and are reconciled to the closest GAAP measure and tables that are included in the earnings release and in the presentation deck. The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses, which were divested in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, are included in the historical results and are not called out as items impacting comparability.
Moving to Slide 18, reported net sales for the second quarter were down 11.5% compared to a year ago. Adjusted gross profit dollars were down 3.6% versus the second quarter a year ago, as gross margin improvement was more than offset by volume declines, unfavorable FX and the sale of the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. Adjusted gross margin was 31.1% in the second quarter, an increase of 250 basis points compared to a year ago. This increase was driven by supply chain cost reductions and productivity gains, and improvements in pricing and trade efficiency.
Adjusted operating profit increased 11.6% due to the large reduction in SG&A, which offset the gross profit dollar decline. I will discuss SG&A in more detail shortly. Importantly, adjusted operating margin was 17% for the second quarter, up 350 basis points from the second quarter a year ago, due to the gross margin improvement and SG&A reductions. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 for the second quarter, up 26% from the prior year due to significant SG&A reductions and lower interest expense.
Slide 19 shows the drivers of our second quarter net sales change versus a year ago. Total net sales were down 11.5%. Divestitures and FX negatively impacted net sales by 5.5%. Volume declines contributed 7% of the decrease, partially offset by a 1% improvement in price/mix and trade productivity.
Slide 20 highlights our continued strong SG&A performance, resulting from the restructuring we started in fiscal year 2016. Note that this chart represents adjusted SG&A, excluding A&P expense. A&P is included as part of SG&A on the face of the financial statements. Adjusted SG&A was down 21% in the second quarter versus a year ago. And the for the first half of fiscal year 2017, adjusted SG&A was down $129 million, or 25%. 
SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, was 9.5% for the second quarter, and was 9.8% for the first half of fiscal year 2017. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from timing on certain SG&A expenses, which we expect to hit in the second half of fiscal year 2017. Having said that, we are pleased with our first half SG&A performance as we are realizing our cost savings goals a bit faster than we planned.
Moving to Slide 21, this chart outlines the drivers of EPS improvement from $0.39 in the second quarter a year ago to $0.49 this quarter, which is a 26% increase. As we expected, the EPS impact of the volume decline was offset by the gross margin expansion from supply chain cost reductions and productivity gains, as well as pricing and trade efficiency improvements. The supply chain gains represented approximately 2/3 of the gross margin increase, while pricing and trade represented 1/3. Negative FX from the weakening of the Mexican peso and the divestiture of Spicetec and JM Swank were more than offset by the EPS benefit of SG&A cost reductions and interest expense declines due to lower debt.
Slide 22 highlights the net sales and adjusted operating profit by reporting segment. In our Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales were $854 million for the quarter, down 6%, reflecting a 7% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price/mix. Adjusted operating profit was $222 million in the quarter, an increase of 18%. The increase in adjusted operating profit reflects continued progress on gross margin expansion, reduced SG&A cost and lower A&P spending, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume.
In our refrigerated and frozen segment, net sales were $740 million for the quarter, down 10.5%, reflecting an 11.4% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price/mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $120 million in the second quarter, down 7.5%. The decrease reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts that were more than offset by volume declines and the impact of benefits in the prior year's quarter from avian flu-related higher volume and sales for Egg Beaters. Our Egg Beater product supply was not impacted as a result of the avian flu outbreak, creating the sales opportunity in the prior year quarter.
In our International segment, net sales were $211 million for the quarter, down 4.5%. This reflects a 2.5% decline in volume, a 2% improvement in price/mix and a negative 4% impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted segment operating profit was $18 million in the second quarter, down 17%, driven primarily by the negative impact of the weakening Mexican peso. Reported segment operating profit includes a $44 million pretax impairment charge to goodwill due to the impact of the weakening peso on our business in Mexico.
In our Foodservice segment, net sales were $283 million for the quarter, down 1%. Adjusted operating profit was $32 million in the second quarter, an increase of 56% versus a year ago. The net sales results reflected decrease in sales from exiting a noncore foodservice snack business. The adjusted segment operating profit increase was primarily due to a onetime inventory write-down cost incurred in the year-ago quarter for the business we exited. As mentioned earlier, there were no sales or adjusted operating profits in the Commercial segment this quarter, given the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures and the reclassification of the Lamb Weston business to discontinued operations.
Slide 23 summarizes select cash flow and balance sheet information for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 versus the year-ago period. We ended the second quarter with $3.5 billion of total debt, and approximately $1.4 billion of cash on hand. This results in net debt of approximately $2 billion, with no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. In the first half, total debt was reduced by approximately $2 billion. As we have stated in the past, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating for the business.
We had capital expenditures of $118 million for the first half of 2017 versus $110 million in the comparable year period. As previously announced, the Board of Directors approved its first dividend since the completion of the spinoff of the Lamb Weston business on November 9, 2016. A quarterly dividend payment of $0.20 per share will be paid on March 1, 2017, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 30, 2017. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $85 million. Approximately 300,000 of these shares were repurchased before the spinoff.
In addition, I will also note the following items related to corporate or total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $17 million for the quarter, down 2% versus the prior year, due to the company's Ardent Mills joint venture performing below expectations due to market conditions. Adjusted corporate expenses were $36 million for the second quarter versus $54 million a year ago, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts.
Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $97 million, down 9%. Advertising and promotion as a percentage of net sales was approximately 4.7% for the second quarter, up from 4.5% a year ago. Net interest expense was $54 million in the second quarter versus $79 million a year ago due to the pay down of debt during the past 12 months. For the second quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $9 million and operating profit by $6 million versus the year-ago quarter. Lastly, the second quarter effective tax rate was 32.4%. The effective tax rate was slightly lower than planned due to reduced tax expense related to stock compensation expense.
I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter: approximately $0.03 per diluted share of net expense or $20 million pretax related to restructuring plans; approximately $0.09 per diluted share of net expense or $61 million pretax related to extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the Lamb Weston spinoff; approximately $0.09 per diluted share of net expense or $44 million pretax, related to an impairment of goodwill in the Mexican business; and approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net expense related to tax items associated with the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures.
Slide 24 summarizes our full year fiscal 2017 financial outlook, which is the same outlook we provided at Investor Day in October. As we communicated at Investor Day, this outlook was based upon a pro forma fiscal year 2016 P&L base, which excluded the Lamb Weston and JM Swank and Spicetec results. Lamb Weston is now included in discontinued operations and is excluded from the Conagra Brands historical information. However, JM Swank and Spicetec are not accounted for as discontinued operations. So those results are included in the historical financial information for Conagra Brands. 
As footnoted on this chart, if you include the JM Swank and Spicetec net sales, the fiscal year 2017 net sales outlook is minus 8.5% to minus 9.5%. To be clear, this is not a change in our outlook, we just wanted to provide you with the additional detail of the fiscal year 2017 outlook with Spicetec and JM Swank included.
So in summary, Conagra Brands continues to make progress upgrading our volume base. Gross margins are expanding and our SG&A cost-reduction program is progressing well. Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the flexibility to evaluate various opportunities to drive shareowner value. And our outlook for fiscal year 2017 remains unchanged as we start the second half.
Thank you. This concludes my formal remarks. Sean, Tom McGough and I will be happy to take your questions. I will now pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the session."

And to the best of our ability in tracking some of the recent scanner data or more recent scanner data by brand, it just seems like the volume declines have broadened out maybe to a much broader set of brands across the portfolio, and even some of those that are in the accelerating growth sort of quadrant. So I just want to get a sense of -- is that something that you see in your data? Is -- if so, what brings that about? And is it consistent with the expectation, obviously, that volume trends look -- start to improve in the back half of the fiscal year?"

What we're seeing is pretty much exactly what we expect to see. Our actions are, in fact, broad based and largely around promotion and pricing. But I think big picture, clearly, we're out to transform this company to unlock value. And for some time now, we've been very proactive in communicating that we need to change some of our legacy practices and walk away from some of the low-margin volume that those practices has embedded in our base. And we're doing that, and it is working. And big picture, we're focused on unlocking margin potential. And for that to happen, it is a mandate that we change our practices across our brands and upgrade our volume base and to ramp-up and improve brand building and innovation capabilities. So that's what we're doing. And I do like what I see. And in the back half, you will see trends improve. In fact, as the most recent takeaway data shows, that's already beginning to happen. But I do want to remind everybody that this is not a flip of a switch, this is a process and we're going to manage it over time. But it's definitely going to benefit shareholders. In terms of any other particulars, Tom, it's still very largely concentrated, do you want to add any color to that?"

As you highlighted, we are taking a very focused and disciplined approach to price for brands that were underpriced, overpromoted, and it also includes proactively optimizing our SKU mix. What you see is that we're upgrading our volume base, one that is less promotionally-driven, higher margin. And as you highlighted in your chart, the fundamental base sales velocity performance is improving on the portfolio. So when you look at Q2 in particular, there's a couple of things that are somewhat unique. First, Egg Beaters, is -- our frozen and refrigerated segments include Egg Beaters. In the year-ago period, there was a sales benefit associated with the avian flu impact, where our supply was relatively unaffected from that. The second thing that's unique is Q2 of last year was a significant promotional period for us on our premium meals brands: Healthy Choice, Marie Callender, Bertolli. That's part of our trade promotion productivity is to optimize that spending. It will begin to lap those as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. And then the third component would be supply issues. At the beginning of the quarter, we still had some residual impact from P.F. Chang's. Recall that showed up in lower merchandising at the beginning of the quarter. And at the end of the quarter, there was some industry issue on Reddi-wip -- or industry issue on nitrous oxide that impacted Reddi-wip. So overall, we're fundamentally on track building and upgrading our volume base."

One other bit of perspective that I think is helpful for people, too, because sometimes I get the question, why not more mix impact for margin-accretive innovation faster, why not more gross margin faster? As we innovate, particularly when we go into adjacencies as you look at our segmentation, in some cases, before -- until we build a success model in the marketplace and have empirical evidence that the new innovation is going to work, we may go to a co-packer. And then we do that because we don't commit capital upfront. Then once we've got the evidence that it's a successful innovation, we repatriate it, we'll invest the capital, we'll bring it in-house. So sometimes you've got a bit of a gross margin headwind on kind of breakthrough new innovations in the early days until you prove it out. But that is, we think, the right way to, having done this for a long time, to manage innovation. Because you don't always hit them all out of the park.

So we have a lot of complexity and a lot of SKU proliferation that's not adding up to a lot of volume. And as you might imagine, on shelf, it doesn't add up to a lot of productivity. So we don't want to have working capital of items like that sitting around our warehouses. We've got to clean that up. And we've been very proactively doing that, and you see that in some of the distribution trends. But when you do that, as you can imagine, what remains is higher velocity stuff.

A lot of what we are doing at certain brands will be through this year. There are other brands as we talked about at Investor Day with respect to mass [ph] and complexity that we won't even get to till next year. So I think big picture, the way to think about it is instead of getting overly exercised around the optics of a top-line trend, step back and think about whether or not there's real value associated with that volume to begin with.

So it's been important to us to get at some of these low-hanging fruit cost opportunities early on, while we repopulate the innovation funnel. We're already doing it.

Is it just kind of putting an average gross margin on it firstly?

And so it really becomes a blend. So that's really how this comes together in terms of what's the overall margin impact from that blended overall volume decline. I'm not going to make any commentary on this specific volume piece of EPS going forward.

Beef and oil, eggs, dairy would be some of those. So on Hebrew National, for example, there's pricing reduction with commensurate reduction in cost of goods that shows up as a negative to pricing, a positive to cost of goods and, obviously, a better kind of margin. Egg Beaters is another situation, given the industry dynamics last year with costs coming down. So those are some of the offsets that suppress the overall pricing. What we really focus on is the gross margin expansion.

So you got a sneak peak of that, and it's pretty exciting what we're going to be able to do with brands like Healthy Choice and Slim Jim and other brands that are really ramping up some excellent innovation on. And quite frankly, it's time because there's a lot of grumbling around lack of growth in the industry, but as Darren pointed out at Investor Day, when you peel back the onion and you look at it, there are clear pockets of growth. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the big companies that have been getting after, it's been the small companies because they tend to be faster to market, they tend to be more externally focused. So that brings me to the second piece of your question, which is, what are we structurally changing? We are much more externally focused, I would say, than we've been. In fact, external focus is one of our company values. And we are determined to activate our insights and turn them into action and to get our new innovation ideas to market quicker. So historically, it's been a slow slog for us to get insight, convert them into action and get them into market. That is making progress. We're not all the way to bright yet, but very excited about some of the things that are in our pipe and it's only going to get better from here."

We're excited to be with you this morning for our first call as Conagra Brands. With the spinoff of Lamb Weston successfully behind us, we have embarked on a new era as a branded pure play CPG company. We've made a lot of progress to get to this point, but more importantly, we're confident that we have a lot of runway to deliver significant improvement and profitability in the years to come.
On today's call, I'm going to take a few minutes to provide some context around where we are and our expectations going forward. I'll also touch on the progress we're making against our strategic plan. I'll cover a few highlights from the quarter, and Dave will get into the details before we take your questions.
For those of you who were able to join us at our Investor Day in October, you will recall that I left you with 6 key takeaways about the business and our plans for the future. First, we have clearly moved beyond our roots as an ag company, and later, a global conglomerate. Conagra Brands today is a much different organization. And as we discussed with you in October, the differences aren't just structural, our culture has fundamentally evolved. The team has developed the focus and discipline required to succeed.
Hand-in-hand with these cultural changes are the revenue management capabilities we've developed and the deep commitment to cost and complexity reduction efforts now embedded in our organization. We expect these efforts will fuel additional margin expansion over time, which in turn will fuel improved growth and cash flow. It's also worth repeating that we're in a unique position to reshape our portfolio in an efficient manner. We have a strong balance sheet and an attractive tax asset. Over time, we can leverage both in a disciplined manner to drive additional growth and maximize value.
We have driven a lot of change in our organization, and we won't stand still. But as I've said before, as we continue to implement changes, we will do so in an orderly, thoughtful and patient manner. We will continue to move with urgency, but our efforts will require time and investment.
Moving to Slide 7, our actions will continue to be guided by the 5 Portfolio Management Principles that I introduced on our Q1 call, and that Tom and Darren described in detail at our Investor Day. We will stay focused on: number one, upgrading the volume base; two, refreshing our core; and three, the clear roles we've assigned to the brands within our portfolio, via our rigorous portfolio segmentation process. We will also, four, ramp up innovation and disciplined M&A. And five, effectively back our winners with proper A&P and trade investment.
Make no mistake, we intend to grow. But we will do so in a manner that is profitable and drive shareholder value. Our PMPs will continue to guide us in that regard. We've already made significant progress in shifting our approach to managing the portfolio. The segmentation we described at Investor Day, shown here on Slide 8, reflects the renewed focus we have brought to our brand. We have grouped each brand into 1 of 4 categories: reinvigorate, accelerate growth, reliable contributors and then, grow core and extend.
This framework guides our investment priorities, particularly around A&P and innovation. And as we discussed at our Investor Day, it provides the lens for our SKU optimization efforts, which is really a broad-based initiative, focused on eliminating a long tail of SKUs that add up to a small amount of volume and weak margins. This effort has -- this effort is important to driving improved overall profitability and has been recognized and commended by our customers, particularly our early efforts on brands like Chef Boyardee and Healthy Choice.
Moving to Slide 9, we are clear-eyed that our success will require us to break a number of bad habits, and we are making meaningful progress. We are moving from a focus on volume at any cost to a focus on value creation, from a reliance on trade-driven push tools to a reliance on stronger brands, stronger innovation and consumer pull. As I just mentioned, we're shifting away from SKU proliferation to optimizing our SKUs, with a focus on sustainable returns. And we're continuing to make strides in our approach to A&P, which is now more focused, consistent and tied to ROI.
Our focus on the fundamentals is translating into results. As you can see on Slide 10, it was another quarter of progress. We continued to execute our strategy of building a higher-quality revenue base, consistent with Portfolio Management Principle #1. The headline on net sales is the 11.5% decline, but I want to call your attention to the next line, where we note the 5.5% of estimated impact of divestitures and foreign exchange. Our net sales were down as a result of the actions we're taking to optimize our portfolio and drive our value-over-volume strategy to upgrade our revenue base.
Adjusted operating profit was up 11.6%, driven by strong gross margin expansion, improved mix, more efficient pricing and trade and continued SG&A savings. This resulted in a 350 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin to 17%. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.49 for the quarter, up 26% from the prior year's quarter, driven by operating income growth and lower interest expense. It's worth noting that our bottom line reflects core operating performance that was slightly ahead of our expectations, offset by weaker-than-expected performance from our Ardent Mills JV. Ardent has been negatively impacted by a broader set of market dynamics in the milling industry.
To illustrate the point on value over volume, Slide 11 shows some of the information that Tom McGough first shared at our Investor Day. The chart on the left shows that we've been willing to walk away from lower ROI promotional activities, and thus, our incremental volume sales has significantly declined as planned. We began to reduce our reliance on promotions during the second quarter and third quarter last year, so we will soon be lapping these results. The chart on the right shows a steady increase in base sales velocity trends, which illustrates that our efforts are working to build a stronger foundation as core consumers are staying with our brands.
Looking ahead at our margins -- looking at our margins, we are clearly making progress. Versus last year's Q2, we have driven 250 basis points of gross margin improvement behind our pricing and trade promotion discipline, supply chain productivity as well as some input cost favorability. While our second quarter has traditionally delivered a higher margin, we are confident that we will be able to sustain the improvement and hit our gross margin guidance for the year.
On the right side of the slide, you can see our operating margin improvement. Helping this number is the fact that our SG&A optimization efforts are coming quicker than we anticipated. In the back half of the year, we will continue our efforts to invest new capabilities at our brands, and thus, we expect operating margins to fall in line with our guidance. 
While we're pleased with our margin results to date, we know there is more we can do from here. Our game plan is to grow the centerline of our profitability over time. We understand that there is a standard deviation from quarter-to-quarter, but we're taking a longer-term view. We're focused on the centerline and we continue to see room to grow. Our gross margin progress reflects our ability to quickly capture some of the low-hanging fruit we identified early on. Looking ahead, there are no major structural issues preventing us from delivering further improvement, so we will continue to chip away at that opportunity.
Another opportunity we're focused on is successfully expanding into on-trend categories. The Frontera acquisition is a great example. It opens up an opportunity to capitalize on the rapid growth in gourmet Mexican cuisine. It has been a pleasure working with Chef Rick Bayless, and the integration process is moving forward according to plan.
Turning to Slide 15, as we move forward to the remainder of fiscal 2017 and beyond, we will continue to execute against our Portfolio Management Principles. In the second half of fiscal 2017, we'll be lapping last year's pricing actions and expect to see corresponding improvement in our top-line trend, as we continue to expand our margins. Our innovation progress is also accelerating, and we expect to see our new products hit the market in early fiscal 2018. And as I just said, we will continue to chip away at the gross margin opportunity, while we deliver profitable growth.
And finally, we will look to continue to reshape our portfolio. This may include exiting brands in an efficient manner using our tax asset, it will also include augmenting our current portfolio through a disciplined approach to M&A. We still have a lot of work to do, but we're pleased with the progress we're making. We are confident that the plans we have in motion are the right ones to drive improved consistency and profitability at ConAgra and long-term value for our shareholders.
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to thank our talented and dedicated Conagra Brands employees who continue to do a tremendous job serving our customers and executing our strategy. I'm grateful for all you do and wish all of you a happy holiday season.
Now over to you, Dave."

Slide 17 outlines a few key points related to our basis of presentation. Lamb Weston and the related joint ventures are now reclassified as discontinued operations. The commercial reporting segment for the second quarter and ongoing will have no current operating results, it will only include the historical results for Spicetec and JM Swank. 
Please note that references to adjusted items refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability, and are reconciled to the closest GAAP measure and tables that are included in the earnings release and in the presentation deck. The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses, which were divested in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, are included in the historical results and are not called out as items impacting comparability.
Moving to Slide 18, reported net sales for the second quarter were down 11.5% compared to a year ago. Adjusted gross profit dollars were down 3.6% versus the second quarter a year ago, as gross margin improvement was more than offset by volume declines, unfavorable FX and the sale of the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. Adjusted gross margin was 31.1% in the second quarter, an increase of 250 basis points compared to a year ago. This increase was driven by supply chain cost reductions and productivity gains, and improvements in pricing and trade efficiency.
Adjusted operating profit increased 11.6% due to the large reduction in SG&A, which offset the gross profit dollar decline. I will discuss SG&A in more detail shortly. Importantly, adjusted operating margin was 17% for the second quarter, up 350 basis points from the second quarter a year ago, due to the gross margin improvement and SG&A reductions. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 for the second quarter, up 26% from the prior year due to significant SG&A reductions and lower interest expense.
Slide 19 shows the drivers of our second quarter net sales change versus a year ago. Total net sales were down 11.5%. Divestitures and FX negatively impacted net sales by 5.5%. Volume declines contributed 7% of the decrease, partially offset by a 1% improvement in price/mix and trade productivity.
Slide 20 highlights our continued strong SG&A performance, resulting from the restructuring we started in fiscal year 2016. Note that this chart represents adjusted SG&A, excluding A&P expense. A&P is included as part of SG&A on the face of the financial statements. Adjusted SG&A was down 21% in the second quarter versus a year ago. And the for the first half of fiscal year 2017, adjusted SG&A was down $129 million, or 25%. 
SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, was 9.5% for the second quarter, and was 9.8% for the first half of fiscal year 2017. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from timing on certain SG&A expenses, which we expect to hit in the second half of fiscal year 2017. Having said that, we are pleased with our first half SG&A performance as we are realizing our cost savings goals a bit faster than we planned.
Moving to Slide 21, this chart outlines the drivers of EPS improvement from $0.39 in the second quarter a year ago to $0.49 this quarter, which is a 26% increase. As we expected, the EPS impact of the volume decline was offset by the gross margin expansion from supply chain cost reductions and productivity gains, as well as pricing and trade efficiency improvements. The supply chain gains represented approximately 2/3 of the gross margin increase, while pricing and trade represented 1/3. Negative FX from the weakening of the Mexican peso and the divestiture of Spicetec and JM Swank were more than offset by the EPS benefit of SG&A cost reductions and interest expense declines due to lower debt.
Slide 22 highlights the net sales and adjusted operating profit by reporting segment. In our Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales were $854 million for the quarter, down 6%, reflecting a 7% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price/mix. Adjusted operating profit was $222 million in the quarter, an increase of 18%. The increase in adjusted operating profit reflects continued progress on gross margin expansion, reduced SG&A cost and lower A&P spending, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume.
In our refrigerated and frozen segment, net sales were $740 million for the quarter, down 10.5%, reflecting an 11.4% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price/mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $120 million in the second quarter, down 7.5%. The decrease reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts that were more than offset by volume declines and the impact of benefits in the prior year's quarter from avian flu-related higher volume and sales for Egg Beaters. Our Egg Beater product supply was not impacted as a result of the avian flu outbreak, creating the sales opportunity in the prior year quarter.
In our International segment, net sales were $211 million for the quarter, down 4.5%. This reflects a 2.5% decline in volume, a 2% improvement in price/mix and a negative 4% impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted segment operating profit was $18 million in the second quarter, down 17%, driven primarily by the negative impact of the weakening Mexican peso. Reported segment operating profit includes a $44 million pretax impairment charge to goodwill due to the impact of the weakening peso on our business in Mexico.
In our Foodservice segment, net sales were $283 million for the quarter, down 1%. Adjusted operating profit was $32 million in the second quarter, an increase of 56% versus a year ago. The net sales results reflected decrease in sales from exiting a noncore foodservice snack business. The adjusted segment operating profit increase was primarily due to a onetime inventory write-down cost incurred in the year-ago quarter for the business we exited. As mentioned earlier, there were no sales or adjusted operating profits in the Commercial segment this quarter, given the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures and the reclassification of the Lamb Weston business to discontinued operations.
Slide 23 summarizes select cash flow and balance sheet information for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 versus the year-ago period. We ended the second quarter with $3.5 billion of total debt, and approximately $1.4 billion of cash on hand. This results in net debt of approximately $2 billion, with no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. In the first half, total debt was reduced by approximately $2 billion. As we have stated in the past, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating for the business.
We had capital expenditures of $118 million for the first half of 2017 versus $110 million in the comparable year period. As previously announced, the Board of Directors approved its first dividend since the completion of the spinoff of the Lamb Weston business on November 9, 2016. A quarterly dividend payment of $0.20 per share will be paid on March 1, 2017, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 30, 2017. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $85 million. Approximately 300,000 of these shares were repurchased before the spinoff.
In addition, I will also note the following items related to corporate or total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $17 million for the quarter, down 2% versus the prior year, due to the company's Ardent Mills joint venture performing below expectations due to market conditions. Adjusted corporate expenses were $36 million for the second quarter versus $54 million a year ago, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts.
Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $97 million, down 9%. Advertising and promotion as a percentage of net sales was approximately 4.7% for the second quarter, up from 4.5% a year ago. Net interest expense was $54 million in the second quarter versus $79 million a year ago due to the pay down of debt during the past 12 months. For the second quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $9 million and operating profit by $6 million versus the year-ago quarter. Lastly, the second quarter effective tax rate was 32.4%. The effective tax rate was slightly lower than planned due to reduced tax expense related to stock compensation expense.
I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter: approximately $0.03 per diluted share of net expense or $20 million pretax related to restructuring plans; approximately $0.09 per diluted share of net expense or $61 million pretax related to extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the Lamb Weston spinoff; approximately $0.09 per diluted share of net expense or $44 million pretax, related to an impairment of goodwill in the Mexican business; and approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net expense related to tax items associated with the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures.
Slide 24 summarizes our full year fiscal 2017 financial outlook, which is the same outlook we provided at Investor Day in October. As we communicated at Investor Day, this outlook was based upon a pro forma fiscal year 2016 P&L base, which excluded the Lamb Weston and JM Swank and Spicetec results. Lamb Weston is now included in discontinued operations and is excluded from the Conagra Brands historical information. However, JM Swank and Spicetec are not accounted for as discontinued operations. So those results are included in the historical financial information for Conagra Brands. 
As footnoted on this chart, if you include the JM Swank and Spicetec net sales, the fiscal year 2017 net sales outlook is minus 8.5% to minus 9.5%. To be clear, this is not a change in our outlook, we just wanted to provide you with the additional detail of the fiscal year 2017 outlook with Spicetec and JM Swank included.
So in summary, Conagra Brands continues to make progress upgrading our volume base. Gross margins are expanding and our SG&A cost-reduction program is progressing well. Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the flexibility to evaluate various opportunities to drive shareowner value. And our outlook for fiscal year 2017 remains unchanged as we start the second half.
Thank you. This concludes my formal remarks. Sean, Tom McGough and I will be happy to take your questions. I will now pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the session."

And to the best of our ability in tracking some of the recent scanner data or more recent scanner data by brand, it just seems like the volume declines have broadened out maybe to a much broader set of brands across the portfolio, and even some of those that are in the accelerating growth sort of quadrant. So I just want to get a sense of -- is that something that you see in your data? Is -- if so, what brings that about? And is it consistent with the expectation, obviously, that volume trends look -- start to improve in the back half of the fiscal year?"

What we're seeing is pretty much exactly what we expect to see. Our actions are, in fact, broad based and largely around promotion and pricing. But I think big picture, clearly, we're out to transform this company to unlock value. And for some time now, we've been very proactive in communicating that we need to change some of our legacy practices and walk away from some of the low-margin volume that those practices has embedded in our base. And we're doing that, and it is working. And big picture, we're focused on unlocking margin potential. And for that to happen, it is a mandate that we change our practices across our brands and upgrade our volume base and to ramp-up and improve brand building and innovation capabilities. So that's what we're doing. And I do like what I see. And in the back half, you will see trends improve. In fact, as the most recent takeaway data shows, that's already beginning to happen. But I do want to remind everybody that this is not a flip of a switch, this is a process and we're going to manage it over time. But it's definitely going to benefit shareholders. In terms of any other particulars, Tom, it's still very largely concentrated, do you want to add any color to that?"

As you highlighted, we are taking a very focused and disciplined approach to price for brands that were underpriced, overpromoted, and it also includes proactively optimizing our SKU mix. What you see is that we're upgrading our volume base, one that is less promotionally-driven, higher margin. And as you highlighted in your chart, the fundamental base sales velocity performance is improving on the portfolio. So when you look at Q2 in particular, there's a couple of things that are somewhat unique. First, Egg Beaters, is -- our frozen and refrigerated segments include Egg Beaters. In the year-ago period, there was a sales benefit associated with the avian flu impact, where our supply was relatively unaffected from that. The second thing that's unique is Q2 of last year was a significant promotional period for us on our premium meals brands: Healthy Choice, Marie Callender, Bertolli. That's part of our trade promotion productivity is to optimize that spending. It will begin to lap those as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. And then the third component would be supply issues. At the beginning of the quarter, we still had some residual impact from P.F. Chang's. Recall that showed up in lower merchandising at the beginning of the quarter. And at the end of the quarter, there was some industry issue on Reddi-wip -- or industry issue on nitrous oxide that impacted Reddi-wip. So overall, we're fundamentally on track building and upgrading our volume base."

So when you look at that, we're going to be closer to the target for SG&A that we talked about at Investor Day at 10.8% of sales. So that's kind of how we look at the second half related to SG&A, excluding A&P. I think Sean covered the A&P piece of that as we look at the second half."

One other bit of perspective that I think is helpful for people, too, because sometimes I get the question, why not more mix impact for margin-accretive innovation faster, why not more gross margin faster? As we innovate, particularly when we go into adjacencies as you look at our segmentation, in some cases, before -- until we build a success model in the marketplace and have empirical evidence that the new innovation is going to work, we may go to a co-packer. And then we do that because we don't commit capital upfront. Then once we've got the evidence that it's a successful innovation, we repatriate it, we'll invest the capital, we'll bring it in-house. So sometimes you've got a bit of a gross margin headwind on kind of breakthrough new innovations in the early days until you prove it out. But that is, we think, the right way to, having done this for a long time, to manage innovation. Because you don't always hit them all out of the park. You have some hits and you have some misses, and you want to be judicious on capital investment in support of new innovation."

You have the one slide, I think it's Slide 11, where you show base velocity is actually accelerating.

So I -- guys, correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think the quote I had at Investor day was something like the last 20% of our volume accounts for roughly 70% of our SKU, something like that. So we have a lot of complexity and a lot of SKU proliferation that's not adding up to a lot of volume. And as you might imagine, on shelf, it doesn't add up to a lot of productivity. So we don't want to have working capital of items like that sitting around our warehouses. We've got to clean that up. And we've been very proactively doing that, and you see that in some of the distribution trends. But when you do that, as you can imagine, what remains is higher velocity stuff. So you see a -- the equal and opposite effect, usually, of improvements in velocity. And that's what we've been looking for and that's pretty much exactly what we're seeing."

A lot of what we are doing at certain brands will be through this year. There are other brands as we talked about at Investor Day with respect to mass [ph] and complexity that we won't even get to till next year. So I think big picture, the way to think about it is instead of getting overly exercised around the optics of a top-line trend, step back and think about whether or not there's real value associated with that volume to begin with. Because if there's not value associated with it, there's not margin associated with it. Frankly, all it's giving us is optics and that's not where we're in business for.

So it's been important to us to get at some of these low-hanging fruit cost opportunities early on, while we repopulate the innovation funnel. We're already doing it. As I said, we moved it from 9% to call it 12%, and it will continue to ramp up from here.

So you got a sneak peek of that, and it's pretty exciting what we're going to be able to do with brands like Healthy Choice and Slim Jim and other brands that are really ramping up some excellent innovation on. And quite frankly, it's time because there's a lot of grumbling around lack of growth in the industry, but as Darren pointed out at Investor Day, when you peel back the onion and you look at it, there are clear pockets of growth. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the big companies that have been getting after, it's been the small companies because they tend to be faster to market, they tend to be more externally focused. So that brings me to the second piece of your question, which is, what are we structurally changing? We are much more externally focused, I would say, than we've been. In fact, external focus is one of our company values. And we are determined to activate our insights and turn them into action and to get our new innovation ideas to market quicker. So historically, it's been a slow slog for us to get insight, convert them into action and get them into market. That is making progress. We're not all the way to bright yet, but very excited about some of the things that are in our pipe and it's only going to get better from here."

We're excited to be with you this morning for our first call as Conagra Brands. With the spinoff of Lamb Weston successfully behind us, we have embarked on a new era as a branded pure play CPG company. We've made a lot of progress to get to this point, but more importantly, we're confident that we have a lot of runway to deliver significant improvement and profitability in the years to come.
On today's call, I'm going to take a few minutes to provide some context around where we are and our expectations going forward. I'll also touch on the progress we're making against our strategic plan. I'll cover a few highlights from the quarter, and Dave will get into the details before we take your questions.
For those of you who were able to join us at our Investor Day in October, you will recall that I left you with 6 key takeaways about the business and our plans for the future. First, we have clearly moved beyond our roots as an ag company, and later, a global conglomerate. Conagra Brands today is a much different organization. And as we discussed with you in October, the differences aren't just structural, our culture has fundamentally evolved. The team has developed the focus and discipline required to succeed.
Hand-in-hand with these cultural changes are the revenue management capabilities we've developed and the deep commitment to cost and complexity reduction efforts now embedded in our organization. We expect these efforts will fuel additional margin expansion over time, which in turn will fuel improved growth and cash flow. It's also worth repeating that we're in a unique position to reshape our portfolio in an efficient manner. We have a strong balance sheet and an attractive tax asset. Over time, we can leverage both in a disciplined manner to drive additional growth and maximize value.
We have driven a lot of change in our organization, and we won't stand still. But as I've said before, as we continue to implement changes, we will do so in an orderly, thoughtful and patient manner. We will continue to move with urgency, but our efforts will require time and investment.
Moving to Slide 7, our actions will continue to be guided by the 5 Portfolio Management Principles that I introduced on our Q1 call, and that Tom and Darren described in detail at our Investor Day. We will stay focused on: number one, upgrading the volume base; two, refreshing our core; and three, the clear roles we've assigned to the brands within our portfolio, via our rigorous portfolio segmentation process. We will also, four, ramp up innovation and disciplined M&A. And five, effectively back our winners with proper A&P and trade investment.
Make no mistake, we intend to grow. But we will do so in a manner that is profitable and drive shareholder value. Our PMPs will continue to guide us in that regard. We've already made significant progress in shifting our approach to managing the portfolio. The segmentation we described at Investor Day, shown here on Slide 8, reflects the renewed focus we have brought to our brand. We have grouped each brand into 1 of 4 categories: reinvigorate, accelerate growth, reliable contributors and then, grow core and extend.
This framework guides our investment priorities, particularly around A&P and innovation. And as we discussed at our Investor Day, it provides the lens for our SKU optimization efforts, which is really a broad-based initiative, focused on eliminating a long tail of SKUs that add up to a small amount of volume and weak margins. This effort has -- this effort is important to driving improved overall profitability and has been recognized and commended by our customers, particularly our early efforts on brands like Chef Boyardee and Healthy Choice.
Moving to Slide 9, we are clear-eyed that our success will require us to break a number of bad habits, and we are making meaningful progress. We are moving from a focus on volume at any cost to a focus on value creation, from a reliance on trade-driven push tools to a reliance on stronger brands, stronger innovation and consumer pull. As I just mentioned, we're shifting away from SKU proliferation to optimizing our SKUs, with a focus on sustainable returns. And we're continuing to make strides in our approach to A&P, which is now more focused, consistent and tied to ROI.
Our focus on the fundamentals is translating into results. As you can see on Slide 10, it was another quarter of progress. We continued to execute our strategy of building a higher-quality revenue base, consistent with Portfolio Management Principle #1. The headline on net sales is the 11.5% decline, but I want to call your attention to the next line, where we note the 5.5% of estimated impact of divestitures and foreign exchange. Our net sales were down as a result of the actions we're taking to optimize our portfolio and drive our value-over-volume strategy to upgrade our revenue base.
Adjusted operating profit was up 11.6%, driven by strong gross margin expansion, improved mix, more efficient pricing and trade and continued SG&A savings. This resulted in a 350 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin to 17%. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.49 for the quarter, up 26% from the prior year's quarter, driven by operating income growth and lower interest expense. It's worth noting that our bottom line reflects core operating performance that was slightly ahead of our expectations, offset by weaker-than-expected performance from our Ardent Mills JV. Ardent has been negatively impacted by a broader set of market dynamics in the milling industry.
To illustrate the point on value over volume, Slide 11 shows some of the information that Tom McGough first shared at our Investor Day. The chart on the left shows that we've been willing to walk away from lower ROI promotional activities, and thus, our incremental volume sales has significantly declined as planned. We began to reduce our reliance on promotions during the second quarter and third quarter last year, so we will soon be lapping these results. The chart on the right shows a steady increase in base sales velocity trends, which illustrates that our efforts are working to build a stronger foundation as core consumers are staying with our brands.
Looking ahead at our margins -- looking at our margins, we are clearly making progress. Versus last year's Q2, we have driven 250 basis points of gross margin improvement behind our pricing and trade promotion discipline, supply chain productivity as well as some input cost favorability. While our second quarter has traditionally delivered a higher margin, we are confident that we will be able to sustain the improvement and hit our gross margin guidance for the year.
On the right side of the slide, you can see our operating margin improvement. Helping this number is the fact that our SG&A optimization efforts are coming quicker than we anticipated. In the back half of the year, we will continue our efforts to invest new capabilities at our brands, and thus, we expect operating margins to fall in line with our guidance. 
While we're pleased with our margin results to date, we know there is more we can do from here. Our game plan is to grow the centerline of our profitability over time. We understand that there is a standard deviation from quarter-to-quarter, but we're taking a longer-term view. We're focused on the centerline and we continue to see room to grow. Our gross margin progress reflects our ability to quickly capture some of the low-hanging fruit we identified early on. Looking ahead, there are no major structural issues preventing us from delivering further improvement, so we will continue to chip away at that opportunity.
Another opportunity we're focused on is successfully expanding into on-trend categories. The Frontera acquisition is a great example. It opens up an opportunity to capitalize on the rapid growth in gourmet Mexican cuisine. It has been a pleasure working with Chef Rick Bayless, and the integration process is moving forward according to plan.
Turning to Slide 15, as we move forward to the remainder of fiscal 2017 and beyond, we will continue to execute against our Portfolio Management Principles. In the second half of fiscal 2017, we'll be lapping last year's pricing actions and expect to see corresponding improvement in our top-line trend, as we continue to expand our margins. Our innovation progress is also accelerating, and we expect to see our new products hit the market in early fiscal 2018. And as I just said, we will continue to chip away at the gross margin opportunity, while we deliver profitable growth.
And finally, we will look to continue to reshape our portfolio. This may include exiting brands in an efficient manner using our tax asset, it will also include augmenting our current portfolio through a disciplined approach to M&A. We still have a lot of work to do, but we're pleased with the progress we're making. We are confident that the plans we have in motion are the right ones to drive improved consistency and profitability at ConAgra and long-term value for our shareholders.
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to thank our talented and dedicated Conagra Brands employees who continue to do a tremendous job serving our customers and executing our strategy. I'm grateful for all you do and wish all of you a happy holiday season.
Now over to you, Dave."
26893,413165273,2482943,"Conagra Brands, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2016",2016-12-22,"Earnings Calls","Conagra Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sean.

Slide 17 outlines a few key points related to our basis of presentation. Lamb Weston and the related joint ventures are now reclassified as discontinued operations. The commercial reporting segment for the second quarter and ongoing will have no current operating results, it will only include the historical results for Spicetec and JM Swank. 
Please note that references to adjusted items refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability, and are reconciled to the closest GAAP measure and tables that are included in the earnings release and in the presentation deck. The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses, which were divested in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, are included in the historical results and are not called out as items impacting comparability.
Moving to Slide 18, reported net sales for the second quarter were down 11.5% compared to a year ago. Adjusted gross profit dollars were down 3.6% versus the second quarter a year ago, as gross margin improvement was more than offset by volume declines, unfavorable FX and the sale of the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. Adjusted gross margin was 31.1% in the second quarter, an increase of 250 basis points compared to a year ago. This increase was driven by supply chain cost reductions and productivity gains, and improvements in pricing and trade efficiency.
Adjusted operating profit increased 11.6% due to the large reduction in SG&A, which offset the gross profit dollar decline. I will discuss SG&A in more detail shortly. Importantly, adjusted operating margin was 17% for the second quarter, up 350 basis points from the second quarter a year ago, due to the gross margin improvement and SG&A reductions. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 for the second quarter, up 26% from the prior year due to significant SG&A reductions and lower interest expense.
Slide 19 shows the drivers of our second quarter net sales change versus a year ago. Total net sales were down 11.5%. Divestitures and FX negatively impacted net sales by 5.5%. Volume declines contributed 7% of the decrease, partially offset by a 1% improvement in price/mix and trade productivity.
Slide 20 highlights our continued strong SG&A performance, resulting from the restructuring we started in fiscal year 2016. Note that this chart represents adjusted SG&A, excluding A&P expense. A&P is included as part of SG&A on the face of the financial statements. Adjusted SG&A was down 21% in the second quarter versus a year ago. And the for the first half of fiscal year 2017, adjusted SG&A was down $129 million, or 25%. 
SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, was 9.5% for the second quarter, and was 9.8% for the first half of fiscal year 2017. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from timing on certain SG&A expenses, which we expect to hit in the second half of fiscal year 2017. Having said that, we are pleased with our first half SG&A performance as we are realizing our cost savings goals a bit faster than we planned.
Moving to Slide 21, this chart outlines the drivers of EPS improvement from $0.39 in the second quarter a year ago to $0.49 this quarter, which is a 26% increase. As we expected, the EPS impact of the volume decline was offset by the gross margin expansion from supply chain cost reductions and productivity gains, as well as pricing and trade efficiency improvements. The supply chain gains represented approximately 2/3 of the gross margin increase, while pricing and trade represented 1/3. Negative FX from the weakening of the Mexican peso and the divestiture of Spicetec and JM Swank were more than offset by the EPS benefit of SG&A cost reductions and interest expense declines due to lower debt.
Slide 22 highlights the net sales and adjusted operating profit by reporting segment. In our Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales were $854 million for the quarter, down 6%, reflecting a 7% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price/mix. Adjusted operating profit was $222 million in the quarter, an increase of 18%. The increase in adjusted operating profit reflects continued progress on gross margin expansion, reduced SG&A cost and lower A&P spending, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume.
In our refrigerated and frozen segment, net sales were $740 million for the quarter, down 10.5%, reflecting an 11.4% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price/mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $120 million in the second quarter, down 7.5%. The decrease reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts that were more than offset by volume declines and the impact of benefits in the prior year's quarter from avian flu-related higher volume and sales for Egg Beaters. Our Egg Beater product supply was not impacted as a result of the avian flu outbreak, creating the sales opportunity in the prior year quarter.
In our International segment, net sales were $211 million for the quarter, down 4.5%. This reflects a 2.5% decline in volume, a 2% improvement in price/mix and a negative 4% impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted segment operating profit was $18 million in the second quarter, down 17%, driven primarily by the negative impact of the weakening Mexican peso. Reported segment operating profit includes a $44 million pretax impairment charge to goodwill due to the impact of the weakening peso on our business in Mexico.
In our Foodservice segment, net sales were $283 million for the quarter, down 1%. Adjusted operating profit was $32 million in the second quarter, an increase of 56% versus a year ago. The net sales results reflected decrease in sales from exiting a noncore foodservice snack business. The adjusted segment operating profit increase was primarily due to a onetime inventory write-down cost incurred in the year-ago quarter for the business we exited. As mentioned earlier, there were no sales or adjusted operating profits in the Commercial segment this quarter, given the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures and the reclassification of the Lamb Weston business to discontinued operations.
Slide 23 summarizes select cash flow and balance sheet information for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 versus the year-ago period. We ended the second quarter with $3.5 billion of total debt, and approximately $1.4 billion of cash on hand. This results in net debt of approximately $2 billion, with no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. In the first half, total debt was reduced by approximately $2 billion. As we have stated in the past, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating for the business.
We had capital expenditures of $118 million for the first half of 2017 versus $110 million in the comparable year period. As previously announced, the Board of Directors approved its first dividend since the completion of the spinoff of the Lamb Weston business on November 9, 2016. A quarterly dividend payment of $0.20 per share will be paid on March 1, 2017, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 30, 2017. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $85 million. Approximately 300,000 of these shares were repurchased before the spinoff.
In addition, I will also note the following items related to corporate or total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $17 million for the quarter, down 2% versus the prior year, due to the company's Ardent Mills joint venture performing below expectations due to market conditions. Adjusted corporate expenses were $36 million for the second quarter versus $54 million a year ago, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts.
Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $97 million, down 9%. Advertising and promotion as a percentage of net sales was approximately 4.7% for the second quarter, up from 4.5% a year ago. Net interest expense was $54 million in the second quarter versus $79 million a year ago due to the pay down of debt during the past 12 months. For the second quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $9 million and operating profit by $6 million versus the year-ago quarter. Lastly, the second quarter effective tax rate was 32.4%. The effective tax rate was slightly lower than planned due to reduced tax expense related to stock compensation expense.
I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter: approximately $0.03 per diluted share of net expense or $20 million pretax related to restructuring plans; approximately $0.09 per diluted share of net expense or $61 million pretax related to extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the Lamb Weston spinoff; approximately $0.09 per diluted share of net expense or $44 million pretax, related to an impairment of goodwill in the Mexican business; and approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net expense related to tax items associated with the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures.
Slide 24 summarizes our full year fiscal 2017 financial outlook, which is the same outlook we provided at Investor Day in October. As we communicated at Investor Day, this outlook was based upon a pro forma fiscal year 2016 P&L base, which excluded the Lamb Weston and JM Swank and Spicetec results. Lamb Weston is now included in discontinued operations and is excluded from the Conagra Brands historical information. However, JM Swank and Spicetec are not accounted for as discontinued operations. So those results are included in the historical financial information for Conagra Brands. 
As footnoted on this chart, if you include the JM Swank and Spicetec net sales, the fiscal year 2017 net sales outlook is minus 8.5% to minus 9.5%. To be clear, this is not a change in our outlook, we just wanted to provide you with the additional detail of the fiscal year 2017 outlook with Spicetec and JM Swank included.
So in summary, Conagra Brands continues to make progress upgrading our volume base. Gross margins are expanding and our SG&A cost-reduction program is progressing well. Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the flexibility to evaluate various opportunities to drive shareowner value. And our outlook for fiscal year 2017 remains unchanged as we start the second half.
Thank you. This concludes my formal remarks. Sean, Tom McGough and I will be happy to take your questions. I will now pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the session."

And to the best of our ability in tracking some of the recent scanner data or more recent scanner data by brand, it just seems like the volume declines have broadened out maybe to a much broader set of brands across the portfolio, and even some of those that are in the accelerating growth sort of quadrant. So I just want to get a sense of -- is that something that you see in your data? Is -- if so, what brings that about?

But I think big picture, clearly, we're out to transform this company to unlock value. And for some time now, we've been very proactive in communicating that we need to change some of our legacy practices and walk away from some of the low-margin volume that those practices has embedded in our base. And we're doing that, and it is working. And big picture, we're focused on unlocking margin potential. And for that to happen, it is a mandate that we change our practices across our brands and upgrade our volume base and to ramp-up and improve brand building and innovation capabilities. So that's what we're doing. And I do like what I see. And in the back half, you will see trends improve. In fact, as the most recent takeaway data shows, that's already beginning to happen. But I do want to remind everybody that this is not a flip of a switch, this is a process and we're going to manage it over time. But it's definitely going to benefit shareholders.

As you highlighted, we are taking a very focused and disciplined approach to price for brands that were underpriced, overpromoted, and it also includes proactively optimizing our SKU mix. What you see is that we're upgrading our volume base, one that is less promotionally-driven, higher margin. And as you highlighted in your chart, the fundamental base sales velocity performance is improving on the portfolio. So when you look at Q2 in particular, there's a couple of things that are somewhat unique. First, Egg Beaters, is -- our frozen and refrigerated segments include Egg Beaters. In the year-ago period, there was a sales benefit associated with the avian flu impact, where our supply was relatively unaffected from that. The second thing that's unique is Q2 of last year was a significant promotional period for us on our premium meals brands: Healthy Choice, Marie Callender, Bertolli. That's part of our trade promotion productivity is to optimize that spending. It will begin to lap those as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. And then the third component would be supply issues. At the beginning of the quarter, we still had some residual impact from P.F. Chang's. Recall that showed up in lower merchandising at the beginning of the quarter. And at the end of the quarter, there was some industry issue on Reddi-wip -- or industry issue on nitrous oxide that impacted Reddi-wip. So overall, we're fundamentally on track building and upgrading our volume base."

As we innovate, particularly when we go into adjacencies as you look at our segmentation, in some cases, before -- until we build a success model in the marketplace and have empirical evidence that the new innovation is going to work, we may go to a co-packer. And then we do that because we don't commit capital upfront. Then once we've got the evidence that it's a successful innovation, we repatriate it, we'll invest the capital, we'll bring it in-house. So sometimes you've got a bit of a gross margin headwind on kind of breakthrough new innovations in the early days until you prove it out. But that is, we think, the right way to, having done this for a long time, to manage innovation. Because you don't always hit them all out of the park.

A lot of what we are doing at certain brands will be through this year. There are other brands as we talked about at Investor Day with respect to mass [ph] and complexity that we won't even get to till next year. So I think big picture, the way to think about it is instead of getting overly exercised around the optics of a top-line trend, step back and think about whether or not there's real value associated with that volume to begin with.

And how quickly can you get there without innovation?"

So we put a couple few points on top of that, and we call it a renewal rate. We want to get to 15%, but as you might imagine, rebuilding the innovation pipeline takes longer than, say, taking out costs. So one of the reasons why we got so aggressive on costs in the early days of this transformation is we were grounded in a clear-eyed recognition that rebuilding the innovation pipe does take longer. So it's been important to us to get at some of these low-hanging fruit cost opportunities early on, while we repopulate the innovation funnel. We're already doing it. As I said, we moved it from 9% to call it 12%, and it will continue to ramp up from here. Importantly, it's also got to be -- it's the proverbial fewer, bigger, better idea, but for us that's particularly important given our track record of proliferating so many teeny little SKUs, and we're working at that because we want shelf efficiency for every item we put out there for our customers."

You give us a EPS allocation, which is very helpful, by the way, that EPS bridge, give us an EPS allocation for the net EPS impact of volume loss. And I'm wondering, you multiply that out, it looks like you have $0.09 you gave us. At $60 million, it's 31-odd percent, which is roughly about your gross margin. I'm trying to understand, though, within that, I would think maybe if it were some of the lower margin products you were eliminating, maybe some -- and certainly the 21% decline in incremental sales, that contribution margin might be a little bit lower, so how much kind of thought and allocation went into that number? Is it just kind of putting an average gross margin on it firstly? And secondly, is that a good indicator, maybe going forward, of the kind of cost of volume loss, operating, deleveraging included as you go forward, that might be offset by pricing and other stuff in the year ahead?"

We spend a lot of time on what I call bridge accounting. And most companies do, I've done everywhere I've been. The way these things come together, you tend to start to look at what's the price/mix piece of it because you can quantify that. You obviously look at supply chain pieces and then the volume piece is sometimes tricky, right? Because we have a portfolio of 55 brands that are all at different rates of change. And so it really becomes a blend. So that's really how this comes together in terms of what's the overall margin impact from that blended overall volume decline. I'm not going to make any commentary on this specific volume piece of EPS going forward. But I would say is -- what I would say is the guidance we've given on gross margin improvements factors in our estimates of what the volume impact would be.

So as you think about some of the -- obviously, we've had positive in terms of upgrades, trade productivity, but there's some businesses in categories that are more pass-through. Beef and oil, eggs, dairy would be some of those. So on Hebrew National, for example, there's pricing reduction with commensurate reduction in cost of goods that shows up as a negative to pricing, a positive to cost of goods and, obviously, a better kind of margin. Egg Beaters is another situation, given the industry dynamics last year with costs coming down. So those are some of the offsets that suppress the overall pricing. What we really focus on is the gross margin expansion. And that's what you see in our results is continued progress on gross margin expansion, and we're doing this in a very focused and disciplined way across the portfolio."

And quite frankly, it's time because there's a lot of grumbling around lack of growth in the industry, but as Darren pointed out at Investor Day, when you peel back the onion and you look at it, there are clear pockets of growth. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the big companies that have been getting after, it's been the small companies because they tend to be faster to market, they tend to be more externally focused. So that brings me to the second piece of your question, which is, what are we structurally changing? We are much more externally focused, I would say, than we've been. In fact, external focus is one of our company values. And we are determined to activate our insights and turn them into action and to get our new innovation ideas to market quicker. So historically, it's been a slow slog for us to get insight, convert them into action and get them into market. That is making progress.
