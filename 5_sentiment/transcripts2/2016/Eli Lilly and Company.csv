I'm John Lechleiter. I'm Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me here on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of the Lilly Investor Relations Team.
During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
So let me begin by recapping key events since our last earnings call in October. On the commercial front, we received approval for, and launched, Portrazza in combination with gemcitabine and in the United States for first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. On the regulatory front, just last week, along with Insight, we announced FDA submission of once-daily baricitinib for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. We also submitted baricitinib the European Medicines Agency for the same indication. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received final U.S. approval for our insulin glargine product Basaglar with launch set for December 15 this year. We also submitted an 80-unit Basaglar pen for FDA review. We announced that FDA accepted the filing of data from infrared outcome with Jardiance cardiovascular outcomes trial. The data was also submitted to European regulators. If you may recall, Jardiance is the only diabetes medicine to have demonstrated a significant reduction in both cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular death in a dedicated outcomes trial. And finally, we submitted a fixed-dose combination' tablet containing and to European regulators. We also received FDA approval for the Humalog regular 500 KwikPen. We received European Commission approval following positive CHMP recommendations for Cyramza for both second line non-small lung cancer and second-line metastatic colorectal cancer and European -- and Europe's CHMP issued a positive recommendation for approval of Portrazza in first-line EGFR-expressing squamous non-small cell lung cancer. On the political front, we had a number of notable developments. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we presented additional data from the infrared outcome study. At the American Society of nephrology, initial renal outcomes data was presented that showed empagliflozin when used in addition to standard of care significantly improved renal outcomes compared to standard of care alone, and we expect more comprehensive renal results to be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal this year. And at the American Heart Association, further data are related to the reduction of heart failure and cardiovascular death was presented. And earlier this week, European Heart Journal published comprehensive heart failure results. 
At the World Diabetes Congress, we presented data from the Award 8 Study showing the treatment with Trulicity plus showed produced greater reductions in Hgb A1 C and treatment with a urea alone. Alone Insight, we presented data at the ACR meeting from the baricitinib Phase III rheumatoid arthritis program, including data from the RA begin study that baricitinib is superior to methotrexate in improving multiple measures of the signs and symptoms of RA in treatment-na√Øve patients. And data from the RA study that showed baricitinib was superior to adalimumab in improving multiple measures of the signs and symptoms of RA in patients who had an inadequate response to methotrexate. At the ACR Annual Meeting, we presented data from the Phase III Spirit P1 ixekizumab study showing patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with ixekizumab for 24 weeks achieved significant improvements in signs and symptoms of their disease when compared to placebo. They also experienced significantly less progression of structural joint damage, reduced disability when performing certain physical functions and improved skin clearance of psoriasis. Finally, we terminated the development of  Basel insulin peglispro. 
On the business development front, we extended our agreement with Merck to evaluate Alimta in combination with Keytruda in a Phase III study in a first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We also announced a collaboration with Merck to evaluate our CDK 4 and 6 inhibitor and in combination with Keytruda in multiple tumor types. And we announced an agreement with Roche Diagnostics related to Roche's development of a commercially scalable cerebral spinal fluid assay for 1 to 42. In other news, we announced an expansion of our R&D facilities here in Indianapolis. We also announced that we will close our animal health manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland. Manufacturing operations and commercialization activity will conclude this quarter with full closure targeted by year-end. As a result of this position, the company will recognize a charge in the first quarter of approximately $100 million. In addition, we decided to exit ownership of our animal health manufacturing site in Dundee, Scotland. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased roughly $250 million [ph] of stock, leaving $2.95 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we distribute over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. And in December, we announced a 2% increase in dividend for 2016. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?"

Before I discuss our Q4 results, it may be helpful to review key features of our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. When interpreting our GAAP results and the growth rate versus 2014, keep in mind that 2014 does not include Novartis Animal Health, while 2015  includes the operating results of this business as well as all the costs associated with acquisition. For our non-GAAP measures, we now exclude amortization of intangibles. And to provide you a better idea of underlying trends in our business, we've adjusted our non-GAAP measures for 2014 to exclude the expense associated amortization of intangibles and to include Novartis Animal Health as if we closed the acquisition on January 1, 2014. This places 2014 on the same basis upon we're reporting our financials this year. Now let's look at our results for the quarter. 
Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our fourth quarter reported results. Moving to Slide 10. You can see the Q4 2015 revenue was relatively flat compared toQ4  2014 at just under $5.4 billion. FX continued to provide a significant top line headwind. Excluding FX, our Q4 revenue increased 5% on a non-GAAP basis, driven by higher volume for Trulicity, Cyramza Humalog and the take-back of North American rights for ERBITUX and U.S. prices. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 1 percentage point to 77.3%. This increase was driven by productivity improvements from our diabetes manufacturing technical agenda, efficiencies and other manufacturing processes and increased prices in the U.S. This quarter, the gross margin percent was not affected by changes in foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold as the benefit realized in this year's Q4 was very similar to that realized in Q4 last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin increased by 1 percentage point going from 74.7% in last year's quarter to 75.7% this quarter. As on prior calls, you'll find a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect. 
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of our R&D and SG&A, increased 5% compared to Q4 of 2014. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 3%, while research and development expenses increased 19%. The reduction of marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and continued expense control, partially offset by expenses to support recent product launches. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by charges associated with the termination of and peglispro and by higher late-stage clinical development cost. Excluding the termination charges, R&D expense increased 8%. Other income and expense was income of $45 million this quarter. This represents an improvement of $33 million compared to Q4 2014, primarily due to lower net interest expense. Our tax rate was 13.5%, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease is primarily due to a discrete tax benefits recognized this quarter. Also, our tax rate in both periods included the full year benefit of the extension of certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit. At the bottom line, net income decreased 6%, and earnings per share decreased 5%. As I'll discuss in a few moments, net income and EPS actually increased when excluding the effect of FX, and R&D termination charges, as mentioned earlier, was also a headwind. 
Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the full year. On a high level, you'll see the full year revenue decrease 4% as did operating expenses, and the gross margin percent grew substantially, leading to double-digit EPS growth. As for the quarter, FX was a big factor on a number of line items. In a few months, I'll cover our full year results on a performance basis, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. 
Slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 24 and 25. Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on Q4 revenue growth. 
On Slide 18, the yellow box at the bottom of the page, you'll see the flat Non-GAAP revenue I mentioned earlier. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies drove this decline, as you see the 6% negative effect from FX this quarter. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 5% this quarter, with price growth of 3 percentage points and volume growth of 2 percentage points. By geography, the U.S. pharma revenue increased 14%, driven by price and, to a lesser extent, volume. Humalog, Trulicity, Cialis, Cyramza and all made significant contributions to U.S. pharma revenue growth. Having completed the take-back of North American rights for ERBITUX on September 1, we also benefited from booking a full quarter in sales of ERBITUX. The decline in revenue of 17% was primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange, while our constant currency a performance basis, revenue decreased 6%. This decrease was driven by a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sales, resulting from a loss of exclusivity late in '14. Excluding European Cymbalta, sales increased 3.5% in constant currency terms. 
In Japan, pharma revenue increased 8% in total, driven by mid-teen volume growth while on a constant currency our performance basis, Japan's revenue increased 16%. This performance growth attributable to a number of products, chief among them, Cyramza and Cymbalta. 
Turning to Emerging Markets. We saw revenue decline 12%, driven entirely by the negative effect of FX. On a performance basis, Emerging Markets revenue increased 1% or 4% when adjusting for the Brazil Humalog tender that we had in 2014 but not in 2015. Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China increased 2%, with the volume increase of 5% partially offset by FX. 
On a non-GAAP basis, again, we adjust 2014 as if we've completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 of that year, Elanco Animal Health revenue declined 11%. Excluding the negative effect a foreign exchange, Elanco revenue decreased 5%. This performance decrease was primarily driven by OUS products. 
Turning to Slide 14. You can see the FX trend full year non-GAAP revenue growth by 7 percentage points or nearly $1.5 billion. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 4%, primarily driven by volume, with significant contributions from the U.S. and Japan. 
Moving to Slide 15, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q4 and full year 2015 results. As mentioned earlier, this quarter, FX was a top line headwind, reducing revenue in the U.S. dollars by over 5 percentage points. Excluding FX, revenue grew nearly 5.5% on a non-GAAP basis. In performance terms, we saw a slightly lower growth in cost of sales, resulting in somewhat faster growth in gross margin. Unlike prior quarters this year, operating expenses were a bit faster than revenue on a performance basis this quarter. Much of the OpEx increase was due to the R&D charges for the termination of and baseline peglispro. Excluding these charges, on a performance basis, non-GAAP OpEx grew about 4% or roughly 125 basis points slower than revenue. Excluding FX, operating income declined 2% while slightly higher other income and a slightly lower tax rate led to a non-GAAP EPS increasing 5%. 
Turning to the full year, we delivered strong leverage on an operating basis. Excluding the negative effect of foreign exchange, revenue grew 4% on a non-GAAP basis, while our operating expenses were flat, and EPS increased 14%. These are outstanding results. And with that, now let me turn the call over to Derica."

Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrow showing progression and red arrow showing movement out of the portfolio. In terms of advancement, you'll see that necitumumab was by approved by the U.S. FDA for first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer visit. baricitinib submitted in both the U.S. and Europe for RA, and we advanced 2 biologics and 1 small molecule into Phase II, and 3 biologics began Phase I testing. Since our last update, we also terminated the development of Basel insulin peglispro and 2 Phase II molecules exited our portfolio, 1 for termination and 1 for licensing. You may also noticed that we provided the mechanism of action for a number of our Phase I assets to give you a better visibility into where we are focusing our early-stage development work. The positive pipeline progress we've had over the past few years has brought a number of significant opportunities for life cycle investment and new indications and line extensions. Going forward, we'll be including a slide, like Slide 17 in today's presentation, that details the new indications in line extensions including movement and nutrition as we do for our pipeline. We hope this provides you and the investment community with greater visibility into the future potential of our pipeline investments. 
As in prior calls, I'll recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2015, briefly discuss the key events you should monitor during 2016 and then review our 2016 financial guidance. 
Turning to Slide 18. We're pleased with the positive progress we made under key events we laid out for 2015. This progress is represented by the large number of green check marks you see. The yellow boxes, we've highlighted key events that occurred since our last earnings call. We already discussed many of these earlier in this call, so let me draw your attention to for which we initiated our FDA ruling submission. We expect to complete the submission during the first half of the year. 
Now reflecting on 2015, it was a landmark year for our innovation efforts. Among the year's achievements, I highlight: the reduction in risk, CV death and all causes showed by Jardiance and the infrared outcome study. Baricitinib showing superior superiority to methotrexate are many measures of the signs and symptoms of RA in both receiving breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. 
Slide 19 lists key events to watch for in 2016, and we'll update this list on each of our quarterly calls to help you monitor our progress. Since I discussed this list in detail on our January 5 call, I won't go through each item again today. However, I do want to draw your attention to those key events that occurred in the past few weeks. Specifically, we began Phase III testing of our CGRP monoclonal antibody for migraine prevention, and we submitted baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis in both the U.S. and Europe. In the coming months, we look forward to submitting baricitinib also to the Japanese regulators. We are very pleased with the data generated in the baricitinib Phase III RA program. We believe baricitinib, if approved, could be best-in-class medicine and can help improve outcomes for patients living with RA. 
Now turning to our 2016 financial guidance. We are reconfirming the non-GAAP guidance we provided just a few weeks ago on January 5. We are, however, updating our GAAP guidance to reflect the decision to close our animal health manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland. Consequently, our GAAP tax rate guidance has been raised by the 50 basis points to roughly 21%, and our GAAP EPS guidance range has been lowered to a range of $2.83 to $2.93. 
In summary, 2015 was a strong year both for our underlying financial performance and for continued positive movement of our pipeline. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 4% with growing contributions for large products. On the same basis, or focus on improving productivity resulted in flat operating expenses compared to 2014, which drove 14% EPS growth. We have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Continued execution of this strategy should position us to drive revenue growth and expand margins throughout the balance of this decade and make major contributions to medical progress. In 2015, we've made steady progress against our strategic objectives, providing revenue growth of expending margins, sustaining the flow of innovation and deploying capital to create value. As reflected in our 2016 financial guidance and the key events on tap for the year, we expect to make continued progress against each of these goals this year as well. We entered this post-patent period in a position of strength with launches underway and important finds being done in our labs, and we are very optimistic about the opportunities before us to improve patient lives and create value for shareholders. Now this concludes our prepared remarks, I'll now turn the call over to Phil to moderate our Q&A session."

Clearly, the AAC issued new guidelines, but they really did not fully incorporate the EMPA-REG outcome data as they were looking in this guideline some of those guidelines in early January. I am pretty confident that different societies will have a thorough review of the different treatment guidelines.

Clearly, we do -- we will launch with psoriasis first, and we're psoriatic arthritis as is mentioned on this call and those indications will come later. That said, I think there's really no direct comparisons between the molecules on immunogenicity. And if you study this issue, you'd learn that the assay cut points, which are proprietary to each molecule, there's really no standard for setting those, so there's no basis to compare products within a classroom and outside classes. I think the most important thing is that the end of the long-term studies, how many patients developed neutralizing antibodies to the medicine. And in the case of ixekizumab, that number is around 1% after 1 year, which is very low relative to other immunotherapies for conditions like psoriasis. As it relates to injection site reactions, we have a similar comparison problem that reported injection site reactions, it was one of the most frequent issues in our studies, but they were mostly mild. We're transient and we have good data that shows that after the second and third injection, those rates drop significantly. It's important to note that ixekizumab also has far fewer injections from in an annual dosing regimen, so fewer opportunities to get that kind of reaction. So we're confident about our posture as we go to market. We feel good about our data and the primary basis for that statement is the efficacy we see with ixekizumab, which we see as breakthrough and best in class."

And we believe that, that is due to the relative contribution between the activities against CDK 4 and 6. The other thing is the continuous dosing. I mean these are self inhibitors.

I think, yes, M&A from within our major trade organization, so this will be pharma and bio, there has been -- certainly, since the last time we discussed this, I think, a number of initiatives aimed at putting prices in perspective and in also providing the kind of information that policymakers and key advocacy groups need to have, we believe, to make sure that this debate remains balanced and that the -- that this industry, we all hope in the future can provide cures for things like Alzheimer's, cancer this remains strong and viable in this country. I think that when you look at it from that aspect, the old saying goes, ""Facts are stubborn things."" I think when you look at the comparison here that in many cases being used as ammunition in this debate, 2014 is a breakout year in terms of pricing, driven by the launch of the Hep C drugs, which in some cases cure up to 90% of the people who take those medicines and the warehousing, in other words sort of inventory of patients willing to receive those medicines. If you go back and look at 2009, 2013, these are not Lilly's numbers. These are -- this data is from CMS that the overall price of drugs, retail and nonretail, the price increases in that period lagged significantly overall health care inflation. I mean we felt the pain, obviously, by the fact that we lost patents on 4 of our biggest products during that period. CMS projections out to 2024 show that based on everything we know and everything we can see that the rate of increase in drug prices is going to fall roughly within the same line as the rate increases in overall health care. So I think that's one side of the equation. The second side of the equation is the consumer aspect, it's great to talk facts and figures with policymakers, but if you're hearing from consumers that they got walloped with a huge co-pay or they're not able to access medicines, they need, obviously, we're sympathetic and empathetic to that and tuned into that with various patient assistance programs, co-pay assistance, et cetera. But also I think it's a vitamin pushing sure that everybody in this country has access to quality insurance. Medicines after all help prevent disease in many cases or treat disease and avoid higher downstream costs. This is well documented. I think we got to keep that in perspective as well. In terms of what we can expect after the election, I mean, anybody who thinks I can predict the nomination, much less the election right now, I'd like to talk to them. But I think this is going to continue to be an issue or is going to continue to be on the stream because of demographics and to some extent, as people get older, they're going to be more and more reliant on our medicines. I think we've got to continue to demonstrate that there's value in the medicines we bring. Yes, they can be expensive. A disease is a lot more expensive, and emphasize the fact that low-cost generics, which account for over 4 out of 5 prescriptions today, represent ultimately the legacy of these investment efforts on our part and provide the American consumer with tremendous value. So I think you can assume the industry is going to continue to maintain an active dialogue with each of the candidates and to work across the party lines to make sure that years that ultimately translate into policy and that's really what we need to be focused on, remain balanced and factual over time. So I don't think there's -- while I think we are and should be concerned about the rhetoric, I think the facts of the underlying story remains very strong, and I think in surveys of consumers that we've done, I think, the interest is just skewed and what we can do to prevent or slow down the progression of the disease like Alzheimer's, have we retained more incremental -- incrementally take more steps in treating -- curing cancer and even with diabetes, what can we do there to go from, in essence, slowing down the progression of the disease today perhaps, someday abating the complications altogether. I think, clearly, we're working on all of those things, and I think that's what people expect us the research-based industry to do. And we got to distinguish the research-based industry from other aspects of this price debate."

We launched it more than 13 years ago. We're still growing this product, really in every geography in the world, notably, in Asia now, we're in double-digit growth, both emerging markets and Japan. And performance is 5% last quarter. As we look ahead, I would say 3 things. First, this is a disease that has tremendous under-treatment. So today in the U.S., if you have a fracture, an osteoporotic fracture, less than 1 in 10 women receive an anabolic therapy, which is really a problem. So there's a lot of room for new voices and new mechanisms to improve treatment for severe osteoporosis. I think as a target is a great target. We have our own asset in the space although move back to Phase I as we look for acceptable commercial formulation. Risk-benefit has to be borne out in the larger trials, and we look forward to seeing that from the program, but I think there's room for more than 1 mechanism to build bone and for people to suffer from severe osteoporosis and, frankly, the patients probably need choices. Then I'll say this, as we think about our midterm mark, it's important to note that research, the IP on Forteo in the U.S. and in other major markets really begins to expire at the end of this decade. So although we would expect continuing good performance through the end of the decade, around 2019, 2020, we would expect to see some form of biosimilar or generic competition depending on the geography we're talking about."

It's important to note that we're carrying 2 doses into the Phase III program because we think optimizing efficacy and dosing convenience in a preventative setting like this will be critical. We like our chances in doing that but want to make sure we have the optimal those frequency and to get maximal efficacy. Those studies are rolling now, and we expect data before the end of '17. These are not long studies, the study of this condition. The only reminder I'd drop there is we also have a cluster headache program, which is episodic and chronic cluster, and that is also enrolling. We also expect data in the chronic cluster setting this year as was indicated by Derica on the key events. Now that would be the first Phase III information we have on CGRP."

The data looks strong as presented last year at the American Diabetes Association, but I would point out 2 things that I think are laying on my mind. One is the way in which these studies are conducted under the current regulatory guidance are not a simple as studies can be long patient selection can be difficult and equipment rates on the industry are very low for the studies are slow I should say and we need to then balance what looks like strong clinical data against other opportunities we have right now with the molecule in psoriasis data, atopic dermatitis. We're looking at several other more immunology indications. So to be determined. I would expect through the year we'll exit path to Phase III for baricitinib or line extensions. Ixekizumab, I think we're in great shape. We're anticipating approval around -- in the world's major markets Japan U.S. and Europe in this calendar year. We are prepared to rapidly, or immediately after approval, commercialize the product. We think we've got great value proposition for payers.

First of all, on the economies for the Emerging Markets, there aren't many, as everybody knows, bright spots starting last year, except perhaps for Mexico, given its proximity to the U.S. And as the economy goes, so does the health care sector in many of the markets. So we've had a very, very tough year even on a constant exchange rate for many of our markets. And I think we see that for the next 18 months. Clearly, the one that has had a significant decline over the previous years has been China. The prognosis is it will continue to see about a 4% to 5% market growth in China, which is what we had in 2015, and that will continue perhaps in 2016. Now that growth can be worse depending on how the Chinese government really implements their pricing policies that have been pretty strong and pretty robust in terms of trying to drive prices primarily for off-patent products. As so for us, it's critical that we focus on brands that have significant growth opportunities. I think there was a question earlier on for Forteo. We see Forteo, we're very bullish about Forteo on emerging markets. We grew mid-teens in 2015. We expect to accelerate that growth further. China grew 60% on Forteo. So we're very bullish, and I think there's tremendous opportunities for growth in Forteo for all the business. And so we continue to invest heavily in that brand. Humalog grew 15% last year for us in emerging markets. We expect to accelerate that growth really across the Emerging Markets. And then, of course, you've got the rest of the diabetes portfolio: Jardiance should do very well as well. Now we are pressured clearly with the products that have lost exclusivity, and we've had a number of those patent losses in our key markets, primarily Alimta and then recently, the rest of our neuroscience portfolio. So for us, the key is to focus on our growth brands. We need to make sure we are sufficient with the resources that we've had and drive our growth agenda using digital channels and other channels to drive better efficiencies and be more effective in the use of our resources."

It also was isolated to companion animals, very consistent with our last few quarters. We've seen this from increased competition with new entries and the companion animal person to side market as well as some distraction as we're still integrated and a couple of key European markets. So those are the key drivers. I would note though that our U.S. companion business grew in the quarter. This was due to launch of a couple of key new innovations, for hepatitis in dogs as well as interceptor-plus for 
So as we look at returning to growth, we've said, clearly, in Boston at our investor conference in December, we do expect to return to growth in 2016 before the impact of FX. We do see some continuation of these trends from 2015 in the first half of 2016, and we'll return to growth at industry levels in the second half. I would note that when including the impact of FX, which should be more significant to Elanco, we anticipate 2016 revenues will be roughly flat versus '15. I think key drivers, and I want to note that will return us to growth gives us a lot of confidence in our long-term future is the successful launch of new innovations. As we noted, we have 7 significant innovations that we'll launch this year and into 2017. We're starting to see the impact of those already with 3 approvals and losses already. And I think the other is our key growth areas such as geographies, companion animal therapeutics, vaccines, enzymes, et cetera. So those would be the drivers of our launch. So last day will just say that the resentment on the Novartis deal continues. We do see at a minimum the $300 million, not $200 million, but we changed our guidance to $300 million of savings. And we saw this with our margins in Q4 go up to 19% from starting the year at 15%, and we see that moving to low to mid-20s EBIT by the end of 2016.

I'll start on the Roche and, Jan, jump in Yesterday, we announced the collaboration with Roche diagnostics, which allows the 2 of us to see a way for that technology to get to market. This is a methodology that runs on the Roche standard diagnostic test, which is pretty well established around the world to measure a beta on CSF of patients in the standardized way. As we outlined at our Alzheimer's December 8, if we moved to the mode of saying, we do see a number of challenges in early adoption and in treatment of patients. One of them will be the detection of positivity. And almost pet scanning is available in some countries, it's not widely available in others is in order to enable patients to have easy and most convenient access to detect amyloid positivity. This is one step of many we're taking or have taken to expand access to the attention of amyloid positivity, which is key to Sun optic assuming success. There is nothing that we know about. This is just part of our market prep, which we need to do to get a running Starcher that be successful."

We have seen some flattening over the past few months, and that is based on the competitive set that we talked about previously. Our focus is lung is to continue to identify patients that seeking a benefit from the Cyramza dose combination. The feedback that we get from physicians is still very positive when we use a Cyramza. And clearly, we need to be sure that we break through the noise in the second-line market with all the competition that's there. With gastric, we continue to have an opportunity. Clearly, gastric is a smaller market in the U.S. than lung. We continue to have an opportunity to bring usage from maintenance of therapy into the second-line setting and to ensure that the combination data is well known by the physicians who treat gastric cancer. And our finding is that because gastric cancer is not as prevalent as lung cancer often, doctors don't see as many patients, so we need to make sure we continue to. We have an opportunity to continue to grow there. And with the colorectal, though that is not a key focus for us in the U.S., that is actually exceeding our expectations with regard to the uptake. We are also launching across the globe with Europe, we're in the second wave of launching gastric cancer access in reimbursement and also just got approval for lung and colorectal cancer in Europe, so we'll be launching those this year. And we launched mid last year in June the Gastric Cancer Indications, and that launch is going exceedingly well, and we are very pleased with both the feedback and the update that we've seen a Japan."

So as we're in speaking earlier with the diagnostic test, there's no doubt that Alzheimer's is a prevalent condition with horrible outcomes and we need disease-modifying agents. But, again, as we pointed out in our December talk, the market isn't set up to really treat on mass people disease-modifying therapies, 1 barrier you're pointing out here, which is available is pet scanning. Now I think Lilly is in a bit of a unique position here, and I think we demonstrated that pretty clearly in the Phase III enrollment world. We feel we're best-in-class and identified patients to pet scanning centers to get them in our studies. EXPEDITION3 is one of the most recent example were enrolled 2,000 people in 20 months. But enrollment study is small comparison to getting market acceptance of a drug. So we're working hard at that issue. A reminder, we which is the leading mode of detection for is a Lilly asset approved in Europe and the U.S. We have the only pet detecting technique in the clinic that could also have some utility, and we need to look at that substudy in the program. So we have those assets and I think could invest in a way that we'd look at the whole rather than the parts that put us living in a unique strategic position. But I do want to continue to emphasize, I think there are structural barriers to rapid adoption of the technology, payer systems, the ability even the ability to infuse and have patients treated consistently. We're working all those things prudently because we don't have the EXPEDITION3 outcomes yet, but working to put us in a position to maximize the opportunity should it present itself at the end of this year.
And then on I think your question is would we or planning to replicate study At this point, we have not announced such plans. Of course, we're always looking at our options with I think the first step now is to get some regulatory feedback and likely labor comes from the program we just submitted, and we don't know how strong or weak that is right now, and I think any decision like the one you're suggesting. We want to like to be informed by the regulatory military process. So we can tackle that one maybe later this year, early next year."

During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
So let me begin by recapping key events since our last earnings call in October. On the commercial front, we received approval for, and launched, Portrazza in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in the United States for first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. On the regulatory front, just last week, along with Incyte, we announced FDA submission of once-daily baricitinib for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis. We also submitted baricitinib to the European Medicines Agency for the same indication. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received final U.S. approval for our insulin glargine product, BASAGLAR with launch set for December 15 this year. We also submitted an 80-unit BASAGLAR pen for FDA review. We announced that FDA accepted the filing of data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME and the Jardiance cardiovascular outcomes trial. The data were also submitted to European regulators. If you may recall, Jardiance is the only diabetes medicine to have demonstrated a significant reduction in both cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular death in a dedicated outcomes trial. And finally, we submitted the fixed-dose combination tablet, containing empagliflozin and linagliptin to European regulators. We also received FDA approval for the Humulin regular U-500 KwikPen. We received European Commission approval following positive CHMP recommendations for Cyramza for both second line non-small lung cancer and second-line metastatic colorectal cancer, and European -- and Europe's CHMP issued a positive recommendation for approval of Portrazza in first-line EGFR-expressing squamous non-small cell lung cancer. On the political front, we had a number of notable developments. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we presented additional data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study. At the American Society of Nephrology, initial renal outcomes data were presented that showed empagliflozin, when used in addition to standard of care, significantly improved renal outcomes compared to standard of care alone, and we expect more comprehensive renal results. It'll be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal this year. And at the American Heart Association, further data related to the reduction of heart failure and cardiovascular death were presented. And earlier this week, European Heart Journal published comprehensive heart failure results. 
At the World Diabetes Congress, we presented data from the AWARD-8 Study, showing the treatment with Trulicity plus a sulfonylurea produced greater reductions in HbA1c and treatment with a sulfonylurea alone. Along with Incyte, we presented data at the ACR meeting from the baricitinib Phase III rheumatoid arthritis program, including data from the RA-BEGIN study that showed baricitinib was superior to methotrexate in improving multiple measures of the signs and symptoms of RA in treatment-na√Øve patients. And data from the RA-BEAM study that showed baricitinib was superior to adalimumab in improving multiple measures of the signs and symptoms of RA in patients who had an inadequate response to methotrexate. At the ACR Annual Meeting, we presented data from the Phase III SPIRIT-P1 ixekizumab study, showing that patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with ixekizumab for 24 weeks achieved significant improvements in signs and symptoms of their disease when compared to placebo. They also experienced significantly less progression of radiographic structural joint damage, reduced disability when performing certain physical functions and improved skin clearance of plaque psoriasis. Finally, we terminated the development of basal insulin peglispro. 
On the business development front, we extended our agreement with Merck to evaluate Alimta in combination with Keytruda in a Phase III study, in the first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We also announced a collaboration with Merck to evaluate our CDK 4 and 6 inhibitor abemaciclib, in combination with Keytruda in multiple tumor types. And we announced an agreement with Roche Diagnostics related to Roche's ongoing development of a commercially-scalable cerebrospinal fluid assay for amyloid-beta 1 to 42. In other news, we announced an expansion of our R&D facilities here in Indianapolis. We also announced that we will close our animal health manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland. Manufacturing operations and commercialization activity will conclude this quarter, with full closure targeted by year-end. As a result of this position, the company will recognize a charge in the first quarter of approximately $100 million. In addition, we decided to exit ownership of our animal health manufacturing site in Dundee, Scotland. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased roughly $250 million of stock, leaving $2.95 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. In addition, during the fourth quarter we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. And in December, we announced a 2% increase in dividend for 2016. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?"

Before I discuss our Q4 results, it may be helpful to review key features of our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. When interpreting our GAAP results and the growth rate versus 2014, keep in mind that 2014 does not include Novartis Animal Health, while 2015 includes the operating results of this business as well as all the costs associated with the acquisition. For our non-GAAP measures, we now exclude amortization of intangibles. And to provide you a better idea of underlying trends in our business, we've adjusted our non-GAAP measures for 2014 to exclude the expense associated with amortization of intangibles and to include Novartis Animal Health as if we'd closed the acquisition on January 1, 2014. This places 2014 on the same basis upon which we're reporting our financials this year. Now let's look at our results for the quarter. 
Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our fourth quarter reported results. Moving to Slide 10. You can see the Q4 2015 revenue was relatively flat compared to Q4 2014 at just under $5.4 billion. FX continued to provide a significant top line headwind. Excluding FX, our Q4 revenue increased 5% on a non-GAAP basis, driven by higher volume for TRULICITY, Cyramza Humalog and Trajenta the take back of North American rights for ERBITUX and U.S. prices. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 1 percentage point to 77.3%. This increase was driven by productivity improvements from our diabetes manufacturing technical agenda, efficiencies in other manufacturing processes and increased prices in the U.S. This quarter, the gross margin percent was not affected by changes in foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, and the benefit realized in this year's Q4 was very similar to that realized in Q4 last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 1 percentage point, going from 74.7% in last year's quarter to 75.7% this quarter. As on prior calls, you'll find a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect. 
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased 5% compared to Q4 of 2014. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 3%, while research and development expenses increased 19%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and continued expense control, partially offset by expenses to support recent product launches. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by charges associated with the termination of evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro and by higher late-stage clinical development costs. Excluding the termination charges, R&D expense increased 8%. Other income and expense was income of $45 million this quarter. This represents an improvement of $33 million compared to Q4 2014, primarily due to lower net interest expense. Our tax rate was 13.5%, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease is primarily due to a discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter. Also, our tax rate in both periods included the full year benefit of the extension of certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit. At the bottom line, net income decreased 6% and earnings per share decreased 5%. As I'll discuss in a few moments, net income and EPS actually increased, when excluding the effect of FX, and R&D termination charges, I mentioned earlier, were also a headwind. 
Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the full year. In a high level, you'll see the full year revenue decreased 4% as did operating expenses, and the gross margin percent grew substantially, leading to a double-digit EPS growth. As with the quarter, FX was a big factor on a number of line items. In a few months, I'll cover our full year results on a performance basis, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. 
Slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 24 and 25. Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on Q4 revenue growth. 
On Slide 13, in the yellow box at the bottom of the page, you'll see the flat non-GAAP revenue I mentioned earlier. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies drove this decline, as you see the 6% negative effect from FX this quarter. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 5% this quarter, with price growth of 3 percentage points and volume growth of 2 percentage points. By geography, you'll notice the U.S. pharma revenue increased 14%, driven by price and to a lesser extent, volume. Humalog, TRULICITY, Cialis, Cyramza and Strattera, all made significant contributions to U.S. pharma revenue growth. Having completed the take back of North American rights for ERBITUX on October 1, we also benefited from booking a full quarter's end sales of ERBITUX. The decline in EuCan revenue of 17% was primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange. While on a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 6%. This decrease was driven by a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sale, resulting from a loss of data package of Trulicity late in '14. Excluding European Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased about 3.5% in constant currency terms. 
In Japan, pharma revenue increased 8% in total, driven by mid-teen volume growth. While on a constant currency or performance basis, Japan revenue increased 16%. This performance growth attributable to a number of products, chief among them, Cyramza and Cymbalta. 
Turning to Emerging Markets. We saw revenue decline 12%, driven entirely by the negative effect of FX. On a performance basis, Emerging Markets revenue increased 1% or 4% when adjusting for the Brazil Humulin tender that we had in 2014 but not in 2015. Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China increased 2%, with a volume increase of 5% partially offset by FX. 
On a non-GAAP basis, again, which adjust 2014 as if we'd completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 of that year, Elanco Animal Health revenue declined 11%. Excluding the negative effect a foreign exchange, Elanco revenue decreased 5%. This performance decrease was primarily driven by OUS products. 
Turning to Slide 14. You can see the FX trend full year non-GAAP revenue growth by 7 percentage points or nearly $1.5 billion. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 4%, primarily driven by volume, with significant contributions from the U.S. and Japan. 
Moving to Slide 15, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q4 and full year 2015 results. As mentioned earlier, this quarter, FX was a top line headwind, reducing revenue in U.S. dollars by over 5 percentage points. Excluding FX, revenue grew nearly 5.5% on a non-GAAP basis. In performance terms, we saw a slightly lower growth in cost of sales, resulting in somewhat faster growth in gross margin. Unlike prior quarters this year, operating expenses grew a bit faster than revenue on a performance basis this quarter. Much of the OpEx increase is due to the R&D charges for the termination of evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro. Excluding these charges, on a performance basis, non-GAAP OpEx grew about 4% or roughly 125 basis points slower than revenue. Excluding FX, operating income declined 2% while slightly higher other income and a slightly lower tax rate led to non-GAAP EPS increasing 5%. 
Turning to full year, we delivered strong leverage on an operating basis. Excluding the negative effect of foreign exchange, revenue grew 4% on a non-GAAP basis, while our operating expenses were flat and EPS increased 14%. These are outstanding results. With that, now let me turn the call over to Derica."

Now moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 16 shows our pipeline as of January 25. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrow showing progression and red arrow showing movement out of the portfolio. In terms of advancement, you'll see that necitumumab was approved by the U.S. FDA for first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Baricitinib was submitted in both the U.S. and Europe for RA, and we advanced 2 biologics and 1 small molecule into Phase II, and 3 biologics began Phase I testing. Since our last update, we also terminated development of basal insulin peglispro and 2 Phase II molecules exited our portfolio, 1 for termination and 1 for out-licensing. You may also notice that we provided the mechanism of action for a number of our Phase I assets to give you a better visibility into where we are focusing our early-stage development work. The positive pipeline progress we've had over the past few years has brought a number of significant opportunities for life cycle investments and new indications and line extensions. Going forward, we'll be including a slide, like Slide 17 in today's presentation, that details select new indications and line extensions, or NILEX, including movement and attrition as we do for our NME pipeline. We hope this provides you and the investment community with greater visibility into the future potential of our pipeline investments. 
As on prior calls, I'll recap the progress we made on the key events we projected for 2015. Briefly discuss the key events you should monitor during 2016 and then review our 2016 financial guidance. 
Turning to Slide 18. We're pleased with the positive progress we made under key events, we laid out, for 2015. This progress is represented by the large number of green check marks you see. In yellow boxes, we've highlighted key events that have occurred since our last earnings call. We've already discussed many of these earlier in this call, so let me draw your attention to olaratumab for which we've initiated our FDA rolling submission. We expect to complete the submission during the first half of the year. 
Now reflecting on 2015, it was a landmark year for our innovation efforts. Among the year's achievement, I highlight: the reduction in risk, CV deaths and all causes mortality shown by Jardiance in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study. Baricitinib showing superiority to Humira and to methotrexate are many measures of the signs and symptoms of RA and both olaratumab and abemaciclib receiving breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. 
Slide 19 lists key events to watch for in 2016, and we'll update this list on each of our quarterly calls to help you monitor our progress. Since I discussed this list in detail on our January 5 call, I won't go through each item again today. However, I do want to draw your attention to those key events that occurred in the past few weeks. Specifically, we began Phase III testing of our CGRP monoclonal antibody for migraine prevention, and we submitted baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis in both the U.S. and Europe. In the coming months, we look forward to submitting baricitinib also to the Japanese regulators. We are very pleased with the data generated in the baricitinib Phase III RA program. We believe baricitinib, if approved, could be best-in-class medicine and can help improve outcomes for patients living with RA. 
Now turning to our 2016 financial guidance. We are reconfirming the non-GAAP guidance we provided just a few weeks ago on January 5. We are, however, updating our GAAP guidance to reflect the decision to close our animal health manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland. Consequently, our GAAP tax rate guidance has been raised by 50 basis points to roughly 21%, and our GAAP EPS guidance range has been lowered to a range of $2.83 to $2.93. 
In summary, 2015 was a strong year, both for our underlying financial performance and for continued positive movement of our pipeline. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 4% with growing contributions from recently launched products. On the same basis, our focus on improving productivity resulted in flat operating expenses compared to 2014, which drove 14% EPS growth. We have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Continued execution of this strategy should position us to drive revenue growth and expand margins throughout the balance of this decade and make major contributions to medical progress. In 2015, we made steady progress against our strategic objectives, providing revenue growth, expanding margins, sustaining the flow of innovation and deploying capital to create value. As reflected in our 2016 financial guidance and the key events on tap for the year, we expect to make continued progress against each of these goals this year as well. We entered this post-patent period in a position of strength, with launches underway and important finds being done in our labs, and we are very optimistic about the opportunity before us to improve patient lives and create value for shareholders. Now this concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Phil to moderate our Q&A session. Great. Phil."

And while I understand that the label does not yet include the data from EMPA-REG, I'm just wondering what you guys are seeing out there. Is this -- is -- are physicians looking at EMPA-REG  as a class effect? Could it be that the SGLT2 is facing class-action lawsuits related to side effects.

Our U.S. Jardiance revenue is not consistent with the sequential TRx growth that we're basically observing for the overall franchise, which was basically 30%.

Right now, that is the franchise as we look at the latest week's discussion over 26% of the new patients. The reason of the lack of consistency is we had a onetime adjustment due to changes in assumptions, when it comes to the accrual for the inventory that we have in the channel. Without that accrual, you would have seen revenue growth, our sequential revenue growth consistent with the TRx growth. Now as it relates to when do we expect the new label. Clearly, we have now shared that the FDA has designated this to be a standard review, which basically means that we would be launching in the second half of this year. It's -- I'm not in a position to speculate in terms of what the label would read like, but we clearly are bullish on our data, the consistency and the strength of the data.

And then secondly, Novartis also said yesterday that its Phase III study of ribociclib is quite likely to stop early based on modeling the company has done versus palbociclib.

As you know, we're in the final stages of regulatory view on ixekizumab and preparing for launch later this year. I'm not surprised to hear what they said on their call, Steve, but I think we can only say for certain that the third one might be true. Clearly, we do -- we will launch with psoriasis first, and we're pursuing psoriatic arthritis as is mentioned on this call as well as ankylosing spondylitis. Those indications will come later. That said, I think there's really no direct comparisons between the molecules on immunogenicity. And if you study this issue, you've learn that the assay cut points, which are proprietary to each molecule, there's really no standard for setting those. So there's no basis to compare products within a class or even outside a classes on immunogenicity. I think the most important thing is at the end of the long-term studies, how many patients developed neutralizing antibodies to the medicine. And in the case of ixekizumab, that number is around 1% after 1 year, which is very low relative to other immunotherapies for conditions like psoriasis. As it relates to injection site reactions, you have a similar comparison problem that we reported injection site reactions. It was one of the most frequent issues in our studies, but they were mostly mild, were transient, and we have good data that shows that after the second and third injection, those rates drop significantly. It's important to note that ixekizumab also has far fewer injections than COSENTYX in an annual dosing regimen, so fewer opportunities to get that kind of reaction. So we're confident about our posture as we go to market. We feel good about our data and the primary basis for that statement is the efficacy we see with ixekizumab, which we see as breakthrough and best in class."

Again, that is the single-agent data that as we mentioned earlier is the data that we got breakthrough therapy on. And depending on what that data looks like, we will go to regulatory authorities.

But we do have interims, they are high buying interims, and clearly, depending on what we see there, we'll take action accordingly. I think it's key to note from -- as we see things, the single-agent activity is important. We have not seen that kind of robust single-agent activity with other CDK4/6 inhibitors. And we believe that, that is due to the relative contribution between the activity against CDK 4 and CDK 6. The other thing is the continuous dosing. I mean, these are cell cycle inhibitors. And so you would hope that you will be at a continuously dose feed, and we have seen that we are able to continuously dose those agents. So again, that's where we will see, we believe, could potentially differentiate this from the other 2 CDK4/6 inhibitors going forward."

I think, yes, M&A from within the -- our major trade organization, so this would be pharma and bio. There has been, certainly since the last time we discussed this, I think a number of initiatives aimed at putting prices in perspective and in also providing the kind of information that the policymakers and key advocacy groups need to have, we believe, to make sure that this debate remains balanced and that the -- that this industry, which we all hope in the future can provide cures for things like Alzheimer's, cancer and other diseases that remain strong and viable in this country. I think that when you look at it from that aspect, the old saying goes, ""Facts are stubborn things."" I think when you look at the comparison year that in many cases being used and initiated in this debate, 2014, as all of you know, was a breakout year in terms of pricing, driven by the launch of the Hep C drugs, which in some cases cure up to 90% of the people who take those medicines and the warehousing, in other words the sort of inventory of patients willing to receive those medicines. If you go back and look at 2009, 2013, these are not Lilly's numbers. These are -- this data is from CMS that the overall price of drugs, retail and non-retail, the price increases in that period lag significantly overall health care inflation. I mean, we felt the pain, obviously, by the fact that we lost patents on 4 of our biggest products during that period. CMS projections out to 2024 show that based on everything we know and everything they can see that the rate of increase in drug prices is going to fall roughly within the same line as the rate increases in overall health care. So I think that's one side of the equation. The second side of the equation is the consumer aspect. It's great to talk facts and figures with policymakers, but if you're hearing from consumers that they got walloped with a huge co-pay or that they're not able to access medicines they need, obviously, we're sympathetic and empathetic to that and tuned into that with various patient assistance programs, co-pay assistance, et cetera. But also I think a continuing approach to ensure that everybody in this country has access to quality insurance. Medicines after all help prevent disease in many cases or treat disease and avoid higher downstream costs. This is well documented. I think we got to keep that in perspective as well. In terms of what we can expect after the election, I mean, anybody that thinks they can predict the nomination, much less the election right now, I'd love to talk to him. But I mean, I think this is going to continue to be an issue or it's going to continue to be on the radar screen because of demographics and, to some extent, as people get older, they're going to be more and more reliant on our medicines. I think we've got to continue to demonstrate that there's value in the medicines we bring. Yes, they can be expensive, but disease is a lot more expensive, and emphasized the fact that low-cost generics, which account for over 4 out of 5 prescriptions today, represent, ultimately, the legacy of these investment efforts on our part and provide the American consumer with tremendous value. So I think you can assume the industry is going to continue to maintain an active dialogue with each of the candidates and to work across the party lines to make sure that the years that ultimately translate into policy and that's what we really got to be focused on, remain balanced and factual over time. So I don't think there's -- while I think we are and should be concerned about the rhetoric, I think the facts of the underlying story remain very strong, and I think in surveys of consumers that we've done, I think the interest is just as keen and what we can do to prevent or slow down the progression of the diseases like Alzheimer's, how we gain more -- incrementally take more steps in treating -- curing cancer and even with diabetes, what can we do there to go from, in essence, slowing down the progression of the disease today to, perhaps, someday abating the complications altogether. I mean, clearly, we're working on all of those things, and I think that's what people expect us, the research-based industry, to do. And we've got to distinguish the research-based industry from other aspects of this price debate."

We're still growing this product, really in every geography in the world, notably in Asia, now we're in double-digit growth, both emerging markets and Japan. And performance terms 5% last quarter. As we look ahead, I would say 3 things. First, this is a disease that has tremendous under-treatment. So today in the U.S., if you have a fracture, an osteoporotic fracture, less than 1 in 10 women receive an anabolic therapy, which is really a problem. So there's a lot of room for new voices and new mechanisms to improve treatment for severe osteoporosis. I think sclerostin as a target is a great target. We have our own asset in the space, although moved back to Phase I as we look for acceptable commercial formulation. Risk-benefit has to be borne out in the larger trials, and we look forward to seeing that from the competitive program. But I think there's room for more than one mechanism to build bone and for people to suffer from severe osteoporosis and, frankly, the patients probably need choices. Then I'll say this, as we think about our midterm mark, it's important to note that, as I'm sure you've already researched, the IP on Forteo in the U.S. and in other major markets really begins to expire at the end of this decade. So although we would expect good -- continued good performance through the end of the decade, around 2019, 2020, we would expect to see some form of biosimilar or generic competition depending on the geography we're talking about."

We also believe that we've got actually a very nice offering to thoracic physicians across the thoracic portfolio. Now in the first-line setting, in the non-squamous, we've got Alimta. In the squamous, we've now got [indiscernible] with a launch just now -- just recently and, of course, with Cyramza across the second line in both histologies.

A key driver for that is the launch of our Humalog U-200; KwikPen, which is basically adding growth to this important brand for us. When we look at specifically in the U.S., which grew 20% for the quarter, we have to keep in mind that we had a negative adjustment in Q4 of last year. So this is an easier comparison. That adjustment was about 10 points. So if we were to take that out, I think -- or maybe a fair way of saying is, it's probably better to look at the entire year as a better reflection of the overall growth for the product in the U.S. market."

Yes, as you know, we have a number of interesting Phase II initiatives to explore future indications for baricitinib. I would say there's a high priority for the company to work through those and make life cycle decisions this year on baricitinib. Diabetic nephropathy is one of them. The data looks strong as presented last year at the American Diabetes Association, but I would point out 2 things that, I think, are laying on our minds. One is the way in which these studies are conducted under the current regulatory guidance is not the simplest past the market. The studies can be long. Patient selection can be difficult and recruitment rates that are starting on the industry are very low for these studies are slow, I should say, and we need to then balance what looks like strong clinical data against other opportunities we have right now with the molecule. In psoriasis, we've data, and we are studying atopic dermatitis. We're looking at several other more immunology indications. So to be determined, I would expect, through the year, we'll exit here with lots of clarity on the path to Phase III for baricitinib [indiscernible] or line extensions. Ixekizumab, I think we're in great shape. We're anticipating approval around -- in the world's major markets, Japan, U.S. and Europe, in this calendar year. We are prepared to rapidly, or immediately after approval, commercialize the product. We think we've got a great value proposition for payers. We've got a compelling efficacy for patients, and the KOLs I talked to are highly interested in the class and in ixekizumab.

First on the economies for the Emerging Markets, there aren't many, as everybody knows, bright spots starting last year, except perhaps for Mexico, given its proximity to the U.S. And as the economy goes, so do the -- so does the health care sector in many of the markets. So we've had a very, very tough year, even on a constant exchange rate for many of our markets. And I think we see that for the next 18 months. Clearly, the one that has had a significant decline over the previous years has been China. The prognosis is, it will continue to see about a 4% to 5% market growth in China, which is what we had in 2015, and that will continue perhaps in 2016. Now that growth could be worse depending on how the Chinese government really implements their whole pricing policies that they've been pretty strong and pretty robust in terms of trying to drive prices primarily for off-patent products. And so for us, it's critical that we focus on brands that have significant growth opportunities. I think there was a question earlier on Forteo. We see Forteo, we're very bullish about Forteo in the emerging markets. We grew mid-teens in 2015. We expect to accelerate that growth further. China grew 60% on Forteo. So we're very bullish, and I think there's tremendous opportunities for growth in Forteo for all the business. And so we continue to invest heavily in that brand. Humalog grew 15% last year for us in the emerging markets. We expect to accelerate that growth really across the Emerging Markets. And then, of course, you've got the rest of the diabetes portfolio: Tradjenta, Jardiance should do very well as well. Now we are pressured clearly with the products that have lost exclusivity, and we've had a number of those patent losses in our key markets, primarily Alimta and then recently the rest of our neuroscience portfolio. So for us, the key is to focus on our growth brands. We need to make sure we are sufficient with the resources that we've had and drive our growth agenda using digital channels and other channels to drive better efficiencies and be more effective in the use of our resources."

It also was isolated to companion animals, very consistent with our last few quarters. We've seen this from increased competition with new entries, and the companion animal parasiticide market as well as some distraction as we're still integrating in a couple of key European markets. So those are the key drivers. I would note though that our U.S. companion animal business grew in the quarter. This was due to launch of a couple of key new innovations, Cerenia for otitis in dogs as well as Interceptor Plus for heartworm.
So as we look at returning to growth, we've said, clearly, in Boston at our investor conference in December, we do anticipate to return to growth in 2016, before the impact of FX. We do see some of the continuation of these trends from 2015 in the first half of 2016, and we'll return to growth at industry levels in the second half. I would note that when including the impact of FX, which will be more significant to Elanco, we anticipate 2016 revenues will be roughly flat versus '15. I think key drivers, and I want to note that will return us to growth gives us a lot of confidence in our long-term future, is the successful launch of new innovations. As we noted, we have 7 significant innovations that we'll launch this year and into 2017. We're starting to see the impact of those already with 3 approvals and launches already. And then, I think, the other is our key growth engines, areas such as key emerging geographies, companion animal therapeutics, vaccines, enzymes, et cetera. So those would be the drivers to our launch. And then I think lastly, I'll just say that our excitement on the Novartis deal continues. We do see at a minimum the $300 million, not $200 million, but we changed our guidance there to $300 million of savings. And we saw this with our margins in Q4 go up to 19% from starting the year at 15%, and we see that moving to low to mid-20s EBIT by the end of 2016. So this gives us a lot of confidence about the strategic elements of Novartis really playing out in the market."

As we outlined at our Alzheimer's day on December 8, if we move to the mode of saying so successful, we do see a number of challenges in early adoption and in treatment of patients. One of them will be the detection of amyloid positivity. And although PET scanning is available in some countries, it's not widely available in others. And so in order to enable patients to have easy and the most convenient access to detect whether they have amyloid positivity, this is one step of many we're taking or have taken to expand access to detection of amyloid positivity, which is key to solar uptake, assuming success. There is nothing that we know about. So what? This is just part of our market prep, which we need to do to get a running start, should that be successful."

We have seen some flattening over the past few months, and that is based on the competitive set that we talked about previously. Our focus in lung is to continue to identify the patients that seeking benefit from the Cyramza-docetaxel combination. The feedback that we get from physicians is still very positive when we they use Cyramza. And clearly, we need to make sure that we break through the noise in the second-line market with all the competition that's there. With gastric, we continue to have an opportunity. Clearly, gastric is a smaller market in the U.S. than lung. We continue to have an opportunity to bring usage from later lines of therapy into the second-line setting and to ensure that the combination data with paclitaxel is well known by the physicians who treat gastric cancer. And what we finding is that because gastric cancer is not as prevalent as lung cancer, often doctors don't see as many patients. So we need to make sure we continue to go back. We see that we have an opportunity to continue to grow there. And with the colorectal, though that is not a key focus for us in the U.S., that is actually exceeding our expectations with regard to the uptake. We are also launching across the globe. And with Europe, we're in the second wave of launch using gastric cancer, now that we've got access and reimbursement. We've also just got approval for lung and colorectal cancer in Europe, so we'll be launching those this year. And we launched mid last year, the end of June, in Japan, the Gastric Cancer Indications, and that launch is going exceedingly well, and we are very pleased with both the feedback and the update that we've seen in Japan."

Well, so on this map, as we're speaking that earlier with the diagnostic test, there's no doubt that Alzheimer's is a prevalent condition with horrible outcomes and we need disease-modifying agents. But, again, as we pointed out in our December talk, the market isn't set up to really treat on mass people with disease-modifying therapies. One barrier you're pointing out here, which is available is PET scanning. Now I think Lilly is in a bit of a unique position here, and I think we demonstrated that pretty clearly in the Phase III enrollment world. We feel we're best-in-class in the ability to identify patients, put them through PET scanning centers and get them in our studies. EXPEDITION3 is one of the most recent example. We enrolled 2,000 people in 20 months. But enrollment and study is small by comparison to getting market acceptance of a drug. So we're working hard on that issue. A reminder, we [indiscernible] which is the leading mode of detection for amyloid as the Lilly asset approved in Europe and the U.S. We have the only [indiscernible] PET detecting technique in the clinic that could also be -- have some utility, and we need to look at that [indiscernible] sub-study in this whole program. So we have those assets, and I think could invest in a way that would look at the whole rather than the parts that puts Lilly in a unique strategic position. But I do want to continue to emphasize, I think there are structural barriers to rapid adoption of the technology, payer systems, even the ability to infuse and have patients treated consistently. We're working all those things prudently because we don't have the EXPEDITION3 outcomes yet, but working to put us also in a position to maximize the opportunity, should it present itself at the end of this year.
And then on [indiscernible], I think your question is would we or are we planning to replicate the beam study [indiscernible]? At this point, we have not announced such plans. Of course, we're always looking at our options, but I think the first step now is to get some regulatory feedback and likely labor claims from the program we just submitted. And we don't know how strong or weak that is right now, and I think any decision like from one you're suggesting, we want to be informed by the regulatory process. So we can tackle that one maybe later this year or early next year."

During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
So let me begin by recapping key events since our last earnings call in October. On the commercial front, we received approval for, and launched, Portrazza in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in the United States for first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. On the regulatory front, just last week, along with Incyte, we announced FDA submission of once-daily baricitinib for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis. We also submitted baricitinib to the European Medicines Agency for the same indication. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received final U.S. approval for our insulin glargine product, BASAGLAR with launch set for December 15 this year. We also submitted an 80-unit BASAGLAR pen for FDA review. We announced that FDA accepted the filing of data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME, the Jardiance cardiovascular outcomes trial. The data were also submitted to European regulators. If you may recall, Jardiance is the only diabetes medicine to have demonstrated a significant reduction in both cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular death in a dedicated outcomes trial. And finally, we submitted the fixed-dose combination tablet, containing empagliflozin and linagliptin to European regulators. We also received FDA approval for the Humulin regular U-500 KwikPen. We received European Commission approval following positive CHMP recommendations for Cyramza for both second line non-small lung cancer and second-line metastatic colorectal cancer, and European -- and Europe's CHMP issued a positive recommendation for approval of Portrazza in first-line EGFR-expressing squamous non-small cell lung cancer. On the political front, we had a number of notable developments. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we presented additional data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study. At the American Society of Nephrology, initial renal outcomes data were presented that showed empagliflozin, when used in addition to standard of care, significantly improved renal outcomes compared to standard of care alone, and we expect more comprehensive renal results to be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal this year. And at the American Heart Association, further data related to the reduction of heart failure and cardiovascular death were presented. And earlier this week, European Heart Journal published comprehensive heart failure results. 
At the World Diabetes Congress, we presented data from the AWARD-8 Study, showing the treatment with TRULICITY plus a sulfonylurea produced greater reductions in HbA1c than treatment with a sulfonylurea alone. Along with Incyte, we presented data at the ACR meeting from the baricitinib Phase III rheumatoid arthritis program, including data from the RA-BEGIN study that showed baricitinib was superior to methotrexate in improving multiple measures of the signs and symptoms of RA in treatment-na√Øve patients. And data from the RA-BEAM study that showed baricitinib was superior to adalimumab in improving multiple measures of the signs and symptoms of RA in patients who had an inadequate response to methotrexate. At the ACR Annual Meeting, we presented data from the Phase III SPIRIT-P1 ixekizumab study, showing that patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with ixekizumab for 24 weeks achieved significant improvements in signs and symptoms of their disease when compared to placebo. They also experienced significantly less progression of radiographic structural joint damage, reduced disability when performing certain physical functions and improved skin clearance of plaque psoriasis. Finally, we terminated the development of basal insulin peglispro. 
On the business development front, we extended our agreement with Merck to evaluate Alimta in combination with KEYTRUDA in a Phase III study, in first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We also announced a collaboration with Merck to evaluate our CDK 4 and 6 inhibitor abemaciclib, in combination with KEYTRUDA in multiple tumor types. And we announced an agreement with Roche Diagnostics related to Roche's ongoing development of a commercially scalable cerebrospinal fluid assay for amyloid-beta 1 to 42. In other news, we announced an expansion of our R&D facilities here in Indianapolis. We also announced that we will close our animal health manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland. Manufacturing operations and commercialization activity will conclude this quarter, with full closure targeted by year-end. As a result of this decision, the company will recognize a charge in the first quarter of approximately $100 million. In addition, we decided to exit ownership of our animal health manufacturing site in Dundee, Scotland. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased roughly $250 million of stock, leaving $2.95 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. In addition, during the fourth quarter we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. And in December, we announced a 2% increase in the dividend for 2016. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?"

Before I discuss our Q4 results, it may be helpful to review key features of our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. When interpreting our GAAP results and the growth rates versus 2014, keep in mind that 2014 does not include Novartis Animal Health, while 2015 includes the operating results of this business as well as all the costs associated with the acquisition. For our non-GAAP measures, we now exclude amortization of intangibles. And to provide you a better idea of underlying trends in our business, we've adjusted our non-GAAP measures for 2014 to exclude the expense associated with amortization of intangibles and to include Novartis Animal Health as if we'd closed the acquisition on January 1, 2014. This places 2014 on the same basis upon which we're reporting our financials this year. Now let's look at our results for the quarter. 
Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our fourth quarter reported results. Moving to Slide 10. You can see the Q4 2015 revenue was relatively flat compared to Q4 2014 at just under $5.4 billion. FX continued to provide a significant top line headwind. Excluding FX, our Q4 revenue increased 5% on a non-GAAP basis, driven by higher volume for TRULICITY, Cyramza, Humalog and Trajenta, the take back of North American rights for ERBITUX and U.S. prices. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 1 percentage point to 77.3%. This increase was driven by productivity improvements from our diabetes manufacturing technical agenda, efficiencies in other manufacturing processes and increased prices in the U.S. This quarter, the gross margin percent was not affected by changes in foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, and the benefit realized in this year's Q4 was very similar to that realized in Q4 last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 1 percentage point, going from 74.7% in last year's quarter to 75.7% this quarter. As on prior calls, you'll find a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect. 
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased 5% compared to Q4 of 2014. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 3%, while research and development expenses increased 19%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and continued expense control, partially offset by expenses to support recent product launches. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by charges associated with the termination of evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro and by higher late-stage clinical development costs. Excluding the termination charges, R&D expense increased 8%. Other income and expense was income of $45 million this quarter. This represents an improvement of $33 million compared to Q4 2014, primarily due to lower net interest expense. Our tax rate was 13.5%, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease is primarily due to a discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter. Also, our tax rate in both periods included the full year benefit of the extension of certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit. At the bottom line, net income decreased 6% and earnings per share decreased 5%. As I'll discuss in a few moments, net income and EPS actually increased when excluding the effect of FX, and R&D termination charges I mentioned earlier were also a headwind. 
Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the full year. In a high level, you'll see the full year revenue decreased 4% as did operating expenses, and the gross margin percent grew substantially, leading to a double-digit EPS growth. As with the quarter, FX was a big factor on a number of line items. In a few moments, I'll cover our full year results on a performance basis, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. 
Slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 24 and 25. Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on Q4 revenue growth. 
On Slide 13, in the yellow box at the bottom of the page, you'll see the flat non-GAAP revenue I mentioned earlier. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies drove this decline, as you see the 6% negative effect from FX this quarter. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 5% this quarter, with price growth of 3 percentage points and volume growth of 2 percentage points. By geography, you'll note the U.S. pharma revenue increased 14%, driven by price and to a lesser extent, volume. Humalog, TRULICITY, Cialis, Cyramza and Strattera all made significant contributions to U.S. pharma revenue growth. Having completed the takeback of North American rights for ERBITUX on October 1, we also benefited from booking a full quarter's end sales of ERBITUX. The decline in EuCan revenue of 17% was primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange. While on a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 6%. This decrease was driven by a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sale, resulting from a loss of data package exclusivity late in '14. Excluding European Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased about 3.5% in constant currency terms. 
In Japan, pharma revenue increased 8% in total, driven by mid-teen volume growth. While on a constant currency or performance basis, Japan revenue increased 16%. This performance growth was attributable to a number of products, chief among them, Cyramza and Cymbalta. 
Turning to Emerging Markets. We saw revenue decline 12%, driven entirely by the negative effect of FX. On a performance basis, Emerging Markets revenue increased 1% or 4% when adjusting for the Brazil Humulin tender that we had in 2014 but not in 2015. Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China increased 2%, with a volume increase of 5% partially offset by FX. 
On a non-GAAP basis, again, which adjusts 2014 as if we'd completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 of that year, Elanco Animal Health revenue declined 11%. Excluding the negative effect of foreign exchange, Elanco revenue decreased 5%. This performance decrease was primarily driven by OUS products. 
Turning to Slide 14. You could see the FX trimmed full year non-GAAP revenue growth by 7 percentage points or nearly $1.5 billion. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 4%, primarily driven by volume, with significant contributions from the U.S. and Japan. 
Moving to Slide 15, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q4 and full year 2015 results. As mentioned earlier, this quarter, FX was a top line headwind, reducing revenue in U.S. dollars by over 5 percentage points. Excluding FX, revenue grew nearly 5.5% on a non-GAAP basis. In performance terms, we saw a slightly slower growth in cost of sales, resulting in somewhat faster growth in gross margin. Unlike prior quarters this year, operating expenses grew a bit faster than revenue on a performance basis this quarter. Much of the OpEx increase is due to the R&D charges for the termination of evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro. Excluding these charges, on a performance basis, non-GAAP OpEx grew about 4% or roughly 125 basis points slower than revenue. Excluding FX, operating income declined 2% while slightly higher other income and a slightly lower tax rate led to non-GAAP EPS increasing 5%. 
Turning to full year, we delivered strong leverage on an operating basis. Excluding the negative effect of foreign exchange, revenue grew 4% on a non-GAAP basis, while our operating expenses were flat and EPS increased 14%. These are outstanding results. And with that, now let me turn the call over to Derica."

Now moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 16 shows our pipeline as of January 25. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrow showing progression and red arrow showing movement out of the portfolio. In terms of advancement, you'll see that necitumumab was approved by the U.S. FDA for first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Baricitinib was submitted in both the U.S. and Europe for RA, and we advanced 2 biologics and 1 small molecule into Phase II, and 3 biologics began Phase I testing. Since our last update, we also terminated development of basal insulin peglispro and 2 Phase II molecules exited our portfolio, 1 for termination and 1 for out-licensing. You may also notice that we provided the mechanism of action for a number of our Phase I assets to give you a better visibility into where we are focusing our early-stage development work. The positive pipeline progress we've had over the past few years has brought a number of significant opportunities for life cycle investments and new indications and line extensions. Going forward, we'll be including a slide, like Slide 17 in today's presentation, that details select new indications and line extensions, or NILEX, including movement and attrition as we do for our NME pipeline. We hope this provides you and the investment community with greater visibility into the future potential of our pipeline investments. 
As on prior calls, I'll recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2015, briefly discuss the key events you should monitor during 2016 and then review our 2016 financial guidance. 
Turning to Slide 18. We're pleased with the positive progress we made under key events we laid out for 2015. This progress is represented by the large number of green check marks you see. In yellow boxes, we've highlighted key events that have occurred since our last earnings call. We've already discussed many of these earlier in this call, so let me draw your attention to olaratumab, for which we've initiated our FDA rolling submission. We expect to complete the submission during the first half of the year. 
Now reflecting on 2015, it was a landmark year for our innovation efforts. Among the year's achievement, I highlight: the reduction in CV risk, CV death and all caused mortality shown by Jardiance in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study; baricitinib showing superiority to Humira and to methotrexate on many measures of the signs and symptoms of RA; and both olaratumab and abemaciclib receiving breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. 
Slide 19 lists key events to watch for in 2016, and we'll update this list on each of our quarterly calls to help you monitor our progress. Since I discussed this list in detail on our January 5 call, I won't go through each item again today. However, I do want to draw your attention to those key events that occurred in the past few weeks. Specifically, we began Phase III testing of our CGRP monoclonal antibody for migraine prevention, and we submitted baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis in both the U.S. and Europe. In the coming months, we look forward to submitting baricitinib also to the Japanese regulators. We are very pleased with the data generated in the baricitinib Phase III RA program. We believe baricitinib, if approved, could be best-in-class medicine and can help improve outcomes for patients living with RA. 
Now turning to our 2016 financial guidance. We are reconfirming the non-GAAP guidance we provided just a few weeks ago on January 5. We are, however, updating our GAAP guidance to reflect the decision to close our animal health manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland. Consequently, our GAAP tax rate guidance has been raised by 50 basis points to roughly 21%, and our GAAP EPS guidance range has been lowered to a range of $2.83 to $2.93. 
In summary, 2015 was a strong year, both for our underlying financial performance and for continued positive movement of our pipeline. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 4% with growing contributions from recently launched products. On the same basis, our focus on improving productivity resulted in flat operating expenses compared to 2014, which drove 14% EPS growth. We have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Continued execution of this strategy should position us to drive revenue growth and expand margins throughout the balance of this decade and make major contributions to medical progress. In 2015, we made steady progress against our strategic objectives, providing revenue growth, expanding margins, sustaining the flow of innovation and deploying capital to create value. As reflected in our 2016 financial guidance and the key events on tap for the year, we expect to make continued progress against each of these goals this year as well. We entered this post-patent period in a position of strength, with launches underway and important finds being done in our labs, and we are very optimistic about the opportunity before us to improve patient lives and create value for shareholders. Now this concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Phil to moderate our Q&A session. Great. Phil."

Our U.S. Jardiance revenue is not consistent with the sequential TRx growth that we're basically observing for the overall franchise, which was basically 30%.

Right now, that is the franchise as we look at the latest week's discussion over 26% of the new patients. The reason of the lack of consistency is we had a onetime adjustment due to changes in assumptions, when it comes to the accrual for the inventory that we have in the channel. Without that accrual, you would have seen revenue growth, our sequential revenue growth consistent with the TRx growth. Now as it relates to when do we expect the new label. Clearly, we have now shared that the FDA has designated this to be a standard review, which basically means that we would be launching in the second half of this year. It's -- I'm not in a position to speculate in terms of what the label would read like, but we clearly are bullish on our data, the consistency and the strength of the data.

As you know, we're in the final stages of regulatory view on ixekizumab and preparing for launch later this year. I'm not surprised to hear what they said on their call, Steve, but I think we can only say for certain that the third one might be true. Clearly, we do -- we will launch with psoriasis first, and we're pursuing psoriatic arthritis as was mentioned on this call as well as ankylosing spondylitis. Those indications will come later. That said, I think there's really no direct comparisons between the molecules on immunogenicity. And if you study this issue, you've learned that the assay cut points, which are proprietary to each molecule, there's really no standard for setting those. So there's no basis to compare products within a class or even outside of classes on immunogenicity. I think the most important thing is at the end of the long-term studies, how many patients developed neutralizing antibodies to the medicine. And in the case of ixekizumab, that number is around 1% after 1 year, which is very low relative to other immunotherapies for conditions like psoriasis. As it relates to injection site reactions, you have a similar comparison problem that were reported injection site reactions. It was one of the most frequent issues in our studies, but they were mostly mild, they were transient, and we have good data that shows that after the second and third injection, those rates drop significantly. It's important to note that ixekizumab also has far fewer injections than COSENTYX in an annual dosing regimen, so fewer opportunities to get that kind of reaction. So we're confident about our posture as we go to market. We feel good about our data and the primary basis for that statement is the efficacy we see with ixekizumab, which we see as breakthrough and best in class."

I think, yes, M&A from within the -- our major trade organization, so this would be pharma and bio. There has been, certainly since the last time we discussed this, I think a number of initiatives aimed at putting prices in perspective and in also providing the kind of information that the policymakers and key advocacy groups need to have, we believe, to make sure that this debate remains balanced and that the -- that this industry, which we all hope in the future can provide cures for things like Alzheimer's, cancer and other diseases, remains strong and viable in this country. I think that when you look at it from that aspect, the old saying goes, ""Facts are stubborn things."" I think when you look at the comparison year that in many cases being used as ammunition in this debate, 2014, as all of you know, was a breakout year in terms of pricing, driven by the launch of the Hep C drugs, which in some cases cure up to 90% of the people who take those medicines and the warehousing, in other words the sort of inventory of patients waiting to receive those medicines. If you go back and look at 2009, 2013, these are not Lilly's numbers. These are -- this data is from CMS that the overall price of drugs, retail and non-retail, the price increases in that period lag significantly overall health care inflation. I mean, we felt the pain, obviously, by the fact that we lost patents on 4 of our biggest products during that period. CMS projections out to 2024 show that based on everything we know and everything they can see that the rate of increase in drug prices is going to fall roughly within the same line as the rate of increases in overall health care. So I think that's one side of the equation. The second side of the equation is the consumer aspect. It's great to talk facts and figures with policymakers, but if they're hearing from consumers that they got walloped with a huge co-pay or that they're not able to access medicines they need, obviously, we're sympathetic and empathetic to that and tuned into that with various patient assistance programs, co-pay assistance, et cetera. But also I think a continuing push to ensure that everybody in this country has access to quality insurance. Medicines after all help prevent disease in many cases or treat disease and avoid higher downstream costs. This is well documented. I think we got to keep that in perspective as well. In terms of what we can expect after the election, I mean, anybody that thinks they can predict the nominations, much less the election right now, I'd love to talk to him. But I mean, I think this is going to continue to be an issue or it's going to continue to be on the radar screen because of demographics and, to some extent, as people get older, they're going to be more and more reliant on our medicines. I think we've got to continue to demonstrate that there's value in the medicines we bring. Yes, they can be expensive, but disease is a lot more expensive, and emphasize the fact that low-cost generics, which account for over 4 out of 5 prescriptions today, represent, ultimately, the legacy of these investment efforts on our part and provide the American consumer with tremendous value. So I think you can assume the industry is going to continue to maintain an active dialogue with each of the candidates and to work across party lines to make sure that the years that ultimately translate into policy, and that's what we really got to be focused on, remain balanced and factual over time. So I don't think there's -- while I think we are and should be concerned about the rhetoric, I think the facts of the underlying story remain very strong, and I think in surveys of consumers that we've done, I think the interest is just as keen in what we can do to prevent or slow down the progression of diseases like Alzheimer's, how we gain more -- incrementally take more steps in treating and curing cancer and even with diabetes, what can we do there to go from, in essence, slowing down the progression of the disease today to, perhaps, someday abating the complications altogether. I mean, clearly, we're working on all of those things, and I think that's what people expect us, the research-based industry, to do. And we've got to distinguish the research-based industry from other aspects of this price debate."

We're still growing this product, really in every geography in the world, notably in Asia, now we're in double-digit growth, both emerging markets and Japan. And performance terms 5% last quarter. As we look ahead, I would say 3 things. First, this is a disease that has tremendous under-treatment. So today in the U.S., if you have a fracture, an osteoporotic fracture, less than 1 in 10 women receive an anabolic therapy, which is really a problem. So there's a lot of room for new voices and new mechanisms to improve treatment for severe osteoporosis. I think sclerostin as a target is a great target. We have our own asset in the space, although moved back to Phase I as we look for acceptable commercial formulation. Risk-benefit has to be borne out in the larger trials, and we look forward to seeing that from the competitive program. But I think there's room for more than one mechanism to build bone and people to suffer from severe osteoporosis and, frankly, the patients probably need choices. That I'll say is, as we think about our midterm, Mark, it's important to note that, as I'm sure you've already researched, the IP on Forteo in the U.S. and in other major markets really begins to expire at the end of this decade. So although we would expect good -- continued good performance through the end of the decade, around 2019, 2020, we would expect to see some form of biosimilar or generic competition depending on the geography we're talking about."

With regards to abemaciclib, again from a single-agent activity, if you want to look at a comparison, you probably should be looking around Eribulin. I think the key thing around that as well is to look at the other single-agent activity across all the CDKs."

Yes, as you know, we have a number of interesting Phase II initiatives to explore future indications for baricitinib. I would say there's a high priority for the company to work through those and make life cycle decisions this year on baricitinib. Diabetic nephropathy is one of them. The data looks strong as presented last year at the American Diabetes Association, but I would point out 2 things that, I think, are things weighing on our minds. One is the way in which these studies are conducted under the current regulatory guidance is not the simplest past the market. The studies can be long. Patient selection can be difficult and recruitment rates start from the industry are very low for these studies or slow, I should say, and we need to then balance what looks like strong clinical data against other opportunities we have right now with the molecule. In psoriasis, we have data, and we are studying atopic dermatitis. We're looking at several other more immunology indications. So to be determined, I would expect, Colin, through the year, we'll exit the year with lots of clarity on the path to Phase III for baricitinib NILEX or line extensions. Ixekizumab, I think we're in great shape. We're anticipating approval around -- in the world's major markets, Japan, U.S. and Europe, in this calendar year. We are prepared to rapidly, or immediately after approval, commercialize the product. We think we've got a great value proposition for payers. We've got a compelling efficacy for patients, and the KOLs I talked to are highly interested in the class and in ixekizumab. And we see, actually, the class leader doing extremely well, I think, relative to our expectations. I think it bodes very well for ixekizumab."

First on the economies for the Emerging Markets, there aren't many, as everybody knows, bright spots starting last year, except perhaps for Mexico, given its proximity to the U.S. And as the economies go, so do the -- so does the health care sector in many of the markets. So we've had a very, very tough year, even on a constant exchange rate for many of our markets. And I think we see that for the next 18 months. Clearly, the one that has had a significant decline over the previous years has been China. The prognosis is, it will continue to see about a 4% to 5% market growth in China, which is what we had in 2015, and that will continue perhaps in 2016. Now that growth could be worse depending on how the Chinese government really implements their whole pricing policies that they've been pretty strong and pretty robust in terms of trying to drive prices primarily for off-patent products. And so for us, it's critical that we focus on brands that have significant growth opportunities. I think there was a question earlier on Forteo. We see Forteo, we're very bullish about Forteo in the emerging markets. We grew mid-teens in 2015. We expect to accelerate that growth further. China grew 60% on Forteo. So we're very bullish, and I think there's tremendous opportunities for growth in Forteo for all the business. And so we continue to invest heavily in that brand. Humalog grew 15% last year for us in the emerging markets. We expect to accelerate that growth really across the Emerging Markets. And then, of course, you've got the rest of the diabetes portfolio: Trajenta, Jardiance should do very well as well. Now we are pressured clearly with the products that have lost exclusivity, and we've had a number of those patent losses in our key markets, primarily Alimta and then recently the rest of our neuroscience portfolio. So for us, the key is to focus on our growth brands. We need to make sure we are as efficient with the resources that we've had and drive our growth agenda using digital channels and other channels to drive better efficiencies and be more effective in the use of our resources."

It also was isolated to companion animals, very consistent with our last few quarters. We've seen this from increased competition with new entries, and the companion animal parasiticide market as well as some distraction as we're still integrating in a couple key European markets. So those are the key drivers. I would note though that our U.S. companion animal business grew in the quarter. This was due to launch of a couple of key new innovations, Cerenia for otitis in dogs as well as Interceptor Plus for heartworm.
So as we look at returning to growth, we've said, clearly, in Boston at our investor conference in December, we do anticipate to return to growth in 2016, before the impact of FX. We do see some of the continuation of these trends from 2015 in the first half of 2016, and we'll return to growth at industry levels in the second half. I would note that when including the impact of FX, which will be more significant to Elanco, we anticipate 2016 revenues will be roughly flat versus '15. I think key drivers, and I want to note that will return us to growth, give us a lot of confidence in our long-term future, is the successful launch of new innovations. As we noted, we have 7 significant innovations that will launch this year and into 2017. We're starting to see the impact of those already with 3 approvals and launches already. And then, I think, the other is our key growth engines, areas such as key emerging geographies, companion animal therapeutics, vaccines, enzymes, et cetera. So those would be the drivers to our launch. And then I think lastly, I'll just say that our excitement on the Novartis deal continues. We do see at a minimum the $300 million, not $200 million, but we changed our guidance there to $300 million of savings. And we saw this with our margins in Q4 go up to 19% from starting the year at 15%, and we see that moving to low to mid-20s EBIT by the end of 2016. So this gives us a lot of confidence about the strategic elements of Novartis are really playing out in the market."

As we outlined at our Alzheimer's day on December 8, if we move to the mode of saying if sola is successful, we do see a number of challenges in early adoption and in treatment of patients. One of them will be the detection of amyloid positivity. And although PET scanning is available in some countries, it's not widely available in others. And so in order to enable patients to have easy and the most convenient access to detect whether they have amyloid positivity, this is one step of many we're taking or have taken to expand access to detection of amyloid positivity, which is key to sola uptake, assuming success. There is nothing new we know about sola. This is just part of our market prep, which we need to do to get a running start, should that be successful."

We have seen some flattening over the last few months, and that is based on the competitive set that we talked about previously. Our focus in lung is to continue to identify the patients that will be seeking benefit from the Cyramza-docetaxel combination. The feedback that we get from physicians is still very positive when we they use Cyramza. And clearly, we need to make sure that we break through the noise in the second-line market with all the competition that's there. With gastric, we continue to have an opportunity. Clearly, gastric is a smaller market in the U.S. than lung. We continue to have an opportunity to bring usage from later lines of therapy into the second-line setting and to ensure that the combination data with paclitaxel is well known by the physicians who treat gastric cancer. And what we're finding is that because gastric cancer is not as prevalent as lung cancer, often doctors don't see as many patients. So we need to make sure that we continue to go back. We see that we have an opportunity to continue to grow there. And with the colorectal, though that is not a key focus for us in the U.S., that is actually exceeding our expectations with regard to the uptake. We are also launching across the globe. With Europe, we're in the second wave of launch using gastric cancer, now that we've got access and reimbursement. We've also just got approval for lung and colorectal cancer in Europe, so we'll be launching those this year. And we launched mid last year, the end of June, in Japan, the Gastric Cancer Indications, and that launch is going exceedingly well, and we are very pleased with both the feedback and the uptake that we've seen in Japan."

Well, on solanezumab, as we're speaking about earlier with the diagnostic test, there's no doubt that Alzheimer's is a prevalent condition with horrible outcomes and we need disease-modifying agents. But, again, as we pointed out in our December talk, the market isn't set up to really treat en masse people with disease-modifying therapies. One barrier you're pointing out here, which is available, PET scanning. Now I think Lilly is in a bit of a unique position here, and I think we demonstrated that pretty clearly in the Phase III enrollment world. We feel we're best-in-class in the ability to identify patients, put them through PET scanning centers and get them in our studies. EXPEDITION3 is the most recent example. We enrolled 2,000 people in 20 months. But enrollment and study is small by comparison to getting market acceptance of a drug. So we're working hard on that issue. A reminder, we -- Enovid, which is the leading mode of detection for amyloid, is a Lilly asset approved in Europe and the U.S. We have the only tau PET detecting technique in the clinic that could also be -- have some utility, and we need to look at the tau sub-study in the sola program. So we have those assets, and I think could invest in a way that would look at the whole rather than the parts. That puts Lilly in a unique strategic position. But I do want to continue to emphasize, I think there are structural barriers to rapid adoption of the technology, payer systems, even the ability to infuse and have patients treated consistently. We're working all those things prudently because we don't have the EXPEDITION3 outcomes yet, but working to put ourselves in a position to maximize the opportunity, should it present itself at the end of this year.
And then on bari, I think your question is would we or are we planning to replicate the beam study head-to-head against adalimumab? At this point, we have not announced such plans. Of course, we're always looking at our options, but I think the first step now is to get some regulatory feedback on likely labor claims from the program we just submitted. And we don't know how strong or weak that is right now, and I think any decision like the one you're suggesting, we want to be informed by the regulatory process. So we can tackle that one maybe later this year or early next year."

I'm John Lechleiter , Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me on today's call and some from remote locations are Derica Rice, our CFO; Dr. Jan Lundberg, president of Lilly Research Labs; Dr. Sue Mahony, president of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, who is President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, president of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, president of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of the Investor Relations team. 
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Successful execution of our innovation-based strategy has put Lilly on a positive trajectory that became most evident in 2014 and 2015, particularly with regard to sustaining the flow of innovation. Building on that positive momentum, 2016 is off to a good start. 
Let me begin our call today by recapping progress we've made on our strategic objectives since our last earnings call in January. Slide 4 should be familiar to you, depicting the 4 strategic objectives for our postpatent exploration period tath we first laid out in January of 2015. 
On our first strategic objective, growth revenue. In the first quarter, we grew revenue 8% on a constant currency or performance basis. Nearly all of this performance growth was driven by volume. And in total, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, BASAGLAR and Portrazza, drove 5 percentage points of this volume growth. 
Starting with today's call, we'll include in our earnings calls an update on the performance of new products for their first 3 years on the market. In addition, you'll see that we've included additional product information in our supplementary slides. Of course, we welcome your feedback on this approach.
Turning to our next strategic objective, expand margins. Our non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue was up slightly compared to the first quarter 2015, due to the baricitinib milestone payments paid to Incyte, which totaled $55 million in the quarter. Excluding these payments, our OpEx percent was flat. We are on track to achieve our full year guidance, which, at the mid-point of our ranges, implies an improvement of 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue, even including the baricitinib milestones. 
Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, I've highlighted a few examples of the continued success we're experiencing. Along with AstraZeneca, we announced that our BACE inhibitor advanced into the Phase III portion of the AMARANTH study in early Alzheimer's Disease. 
Taltz, discovered here at Lilly, was approved in the U.S. for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. And initial shipments left our warehouse earlier this month. And just yesterday, we received European approval. 
Also, [indiscernible], a monoclonal antibody from our [indiscernible] acquisition, has now been submitted to U.S. and European regulatory authorities for soft tissue sarcoma.
During this call, we'll provide a more complete list of the pipeline progress we've achieved over the last 3 months. 
Finally, on our strategic objectives, deployed capital to create value. During the quarter, we returned over $800 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and ongoing share repurchase plan. On the business development front, we completed a number of smaller deals, including the [indiscernible] deal, to bolster our companion animal business. And we continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
In summary, I'm confident that we're on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives and assure you that their achievement remains a top priority of our entire management team. 
Now let's move on to review the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On the commercial front, in Europe, following European Commission approval in late January, we launched Cyramza for second-line non-small cell lung cancer and for second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. We also received European Commission approval for, and earlier this month launched, Portrazza for first-line EGFR-expressing squamous non-small cell lung cancer. 
As I just mentioned, earlier this month, we launched Taltz in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, following FDA approval in the first quarter.
And also here in the U.S., we launched the Humulin regular U500 KwikPen. 
It was a busy 3 months on the regulatory front as well. In addition to the U.S. and European approvals of Taltz and European approval of Portrazza, in Japan, we submitted baricitinib for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. This represents an outstanding achievement, as regulatory submissions in the U.S., Europe and Japan occurred within a span of less than 40 working days.
This also demonstrates that our focus on development execution is paying off. 
As an update to the submission announcement to be made with Incyte, here in the U.S., the FDA has now accepted our submission for baricitinib, and we look forward to regulatory action in early 2017. As I mentioned earlier in both the U.S. and Europe, we submitted olaratumab for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we submitted the once-daily combination tablet of [indiscernible] and metformin XR to the FDA. And on the animal health front, we received U.S. approval for Imrestor, a nonantibiotic animal health product for reduction of the incidence of clinical mastitis in dairy cows. Imrestor is a protein and a first-of-its-kind therapy that helps support the natural function of a dairy cow's immune system during the critical time around calving when the risk for mastitis is heightened. 
On the clinical front, we announced a change to the EXPEDITION3 trial in patients with mild Alzheimer's Disease, making the [indiscernible] 14 cognitive scale the sole primary endpoint. Functional outcomes will be evaluated as key secondary endpoints.
Along with AstraZeneca, we announced that AMARANTH, a Phase II/III study of AZD3293, an oral beta-secretase cleaving enzyme for BACE inhibitor, currently in development as a potential treatment for early Alzheimer's Disease, will move into the Phase III portion of this Phase II/III seamless trial. This movement into Phase III triggers a milestone payment from Lilly to AstraZeneca, which will result in a second quarter pretax charge of $100 million to Lilly's GAAP and non-GAAP research and development expense.
As mentioned at our December 8 Investment Community Meeting, the transition of AMARANTH into Phase III will also trigger the start of a second Phase II study with AZD3293. That study called DAYBREAK will focus on patients with mild Alzheimer's Disease and is scheduled to begin enrolling patients in the third quarter of this year.
Similar to the EXPEDITION3 trial, solanezumab, also in patients with mild Alzheimer's Disease, DAYBREAK will use a single cognitive primary endpoint, in this case, ADAS-cog 13. Further, the AMARANTH trial in patients with early Alzheimer's Disease will also be changed to use ADAS-cog 13 as a single primary endpoint. So we're consistently moving to a single cognitive primary endpoint across our trials in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
And following the successful result of the EMPA-REG outcome trial, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we announced plans to conduct 2 outcome trials investigating Jardiance for the treatment of people with chronic heart failure. The trials are expected to begin within the next 12 months and are planned to enroll people with chronic heart failure both with and without type 2 diabetes.
On the business development front, we modified our existing baricitinib agreement to provide Incyte with the right to develop [indiscernible] for graft versus host disease. We retained rights to develop baricitinib for this indication. As part of this deal, Lilly will receive a $35 million upfront payment that will be recognized as other income in the second quarter both in our GAAP and non-GAAP results.
Of the Animal Health side of the business, yesterday, we announced that we licensed rights to [indiscernible], Galliprant, an FDA-approved therapeutic for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. This deal includes an upfront payment of $45 million, plus additional milestone and royalty payments upon meeting certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. Galliprant will support the growth of our companion animal therapeutic segment, one of the key growth engines for our animal health business. 
In other news, the U.K. High Court decided the Alimta vitamin regimen patent would not presently be infringed by Actavis, marketing pemetrexed in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain, with instructions to dilute the product only with dextrose solution. We plan to appeal this decision for the U.K. Court of Appeal.
Finally, in the first quarter, we repurchased $300 million of stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. During the quarter, we also distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter."
285467,319564321,962719,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, John. Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results.

Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insight on the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first quarter GAAP results. 
Of note, you will see in our GAAP other income and expense, the recognized pretax charge of $204 million, equivalent to $0.19 per share, related to the significant deterioration of the Venezuelan economy and its impact on the bolivar. This charge represents the effect revaluing our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities at a rate of 275.
Moving to non-GAAP measure on Slide 9. You can see the Q1 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q1 2015, reaching $4.865 billion. Foreign exchange rate continued to provide a top line headwind. Excluding FX, our Q1 revenue increased 8%, driven by higher volume from Trulicity, Cyramza, Humalog, Jardiance and TRADJENTA, among others, as well as by the takeback of North American rights for Erbitux. The effective price was 1%. 
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.9 percentage points to 76.3%. This decrease was primarily driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in the benefit both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 40 basis points, going from 75.3% in the last year's quarter to 74.9% this quarter, driven primarily by product mix and the timing of production.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of our R&D and SG&A, increased by 7% compared to Q1 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 1%, while R&D increased 17%. The reduction in marketing, selling administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower litigation expenses, partially offset by expenses to support new products.
The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs, including $55 million in milestone payments to Incyte, triggered by regulatory submissions for baricitinib in the U.S. and Europe. These milestone payments added over 5 percentage points to R&D expense growth and over 2 percentage points to total operating expense growth. Excluding these milestone payments, total operating expenses increased about 4.5%, which was slightly slower than revenue growth.
Other income and expense was income of $55 million this quarter, and it represents a reduction of $38 million compared to Q1 2015, primarily due to lower net gains on investments.
Our tax rate was 17.9%, a decrease of 5 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease is due to a net discrete tax benefit of roughly $50 million this quarter and the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit that were enforced during this year's quarter, but it lapsed during last year's quarter.
It was partially offset by a higher percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions this year compared to last year.
At the bottom line, net income decreased 4%, and earnings per share decreased 5%.
While I'll cover the FX effect on our income statement in a subsequent slide, I would highlight that when excluding the effect of FX, non-GAAP net income and EPS actually increased 5% this quarter. 
Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slide 23. 
Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on Q1 revenue growth. 
On Slide 11, in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 5% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. When compared to Q1 last year, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies was a headwind to revenue growth, as shown by the 3% negative effect from FX this quarter. 
On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 8%, driven by volume growth of 7 percentage points with price growth of 1 percentage point.
By geography, you'll notice the U.S. pharma revenue increased 17%, driven by volume and, to a much lesser extent, price. Trulicity, Humalog, Jardiance in Humulin all made substantial contributions to U.S. pharma volume growth. 
Having completed the takeback of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1, we also benefited from booking a full quarter's end sales of Erbitux.
The decline in EuCan revenue of 5% was entirely driven by the negative effect of FX, while a constant currency and performance basis, EuCan revenue increased 1%. This increase was driven by volume gains on many products, most notably, Trulicity and Cyramza, but also including Basaglar, Forteo, Jardiance, Humulin, TRADJENTA and Strattera that more than offset a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sales, resulting from loss of data package exclusivity.
Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased 10% in constant currency term.
In Japan, pharma revenue increased 16% in total, driven by high teens volume growth. You'll also see a slightly larger negative impact from price, as the latest round of price revision in Japan took effect on March 1.
On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 14%, and this performance growth was attributable to a number of products, led by Cyramza but also including Strattera, Basaglar, TRADJENTA and ALIMTA as well as by Cymbalta, following a restructuring of our agreement with [indiscernible] last April. 
Turning to Emerging Markets. We saw revenue decline 17%, driven primarily by the negative effect of foreign exchange. On a performance basis, Emerging Markets revenue decreased 7% due to the continued impact of generics, including CIALIS in Brazil and Korea and ALIMTA in Australia and Korea; the impact of the Brazil federal Humulin tender and stocking patterns in Russia and China.
Also, this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 14% or 9% on a constant currency basis and, with the growth rate negatively affected by high customer buying in Q1 of last year. Adjusting for customer buying patterns, we see growth in our China pharma revenue. 
Turning to Animal Health. We completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year, so year-on-year revenue growth comparisons are now on an apples-to-apples basis.
This quarter, Elanco Health -- Elanco Animal  Health revenue increased 1%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, it actually increased 5%. This performance increase was primarily driven by U.S. products, both food animal and companion animal, including contributions from recent launched products, Interceptor Plus and [indiscernible].
As I mentioned a moment ago, excluding FX on worldwide revenue, our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter, with nearly all of that growth 7% coming from higher volume. Our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar and Portrazza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. 
Slide 12 shows these products drove over 5 percentage points of volume growth.
The takeback of Erbitux contributed 1.7 percentage points of volume growth, while in total, Humalog, Animal Health, TRADJENTA, Portrazza and ALIMTA contributed over 2 percentage points of our volume growth.
You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror, still was a negative drag of over 150 basis points on our volume growth this quarter.
To anticipate a couple of likely product-specific questions, on this slide, you can see that Humalog contributed nearly a full percentage point for our worldwide volume growth. You'll also see in our press release, however, that our U.S. sales declined 14% this quarter. This decline is not reflective of the underlying trends. 
Adjustments for estimated rebates and discounts, primarily related to the fourth quarter of last year, affected our reported results for Q1 this year.
We believe the underlying revenue trend for Humalog is similar to the first 9 months of 2015, representing mid-single-digit growth. 
And for Alimta, you can see that contributed about 30 basis points to our worldwide volume growth this quarter. I'll highlight that in the U.S., our year-on-year growth rate benefited by a few percentage points from customer buying patterns, while in Europe, our sales benefited from increased clinical trial demand. 
We continue to be exposed to generic entry in multiple countries in Europe during 2016 that may erode sales significantly from Q1 levels. 
Now let me turn the call over to Derica."
285467,319564321,962719,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil. While Phil quantified the contribution to our worldwide volume growth coming from new products, I'd like to share some color behind the numbers. While it's too early to say much about Portrazza, I will provide a brief update on the other 4",1328,"Thanks, Phil. While Phil quantified the contribution to our worldwide volume growth coming from new products, I'd like to share some color behind the numbers. 
While it's too early to say much about Portrazza, I will provide a brief update on the other 4 new products: Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance and Basaglar. 
During the Q&A session, Sue and Enrique will be happy to provide more details. 
As you can see on the graph on Slide 13, our new products generated $325 million in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This represents about 7% of our total worldwide revenue. 
After a limited access for Trulicity in 2015, following its approval in late 2014, sales have accelerated this year. Both commercial and Part D access are now in excess of 70%. And Trulicity's total prescriptions share of the GOP-1 class is now 17% and growing, making Trulicity the second-most prescribed GOP-1 brand.
During the quarter, the class continued to grow at over 30%, and we see continue upside from here. 
For Cyramza, this product continues to grow, driven largely by increasing sales in Japan and Europe, as sales growth in the U.S. has slowed due in part to the competition from the immuno-oncology agent. Japan now makes up nearly 30% of our Cyramza's global sales. We had a strong launch in gastric cancer, and we look forward to regulatory action in Japan later this year on our submissions for non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. 
While in Europe, we just launched those 2 indications during the first quarter.
With Jardiance, we've seen an substantial increase in our new-to-brand share of market with both endocrinologists and primary care physicians. In total, our new-to-brand share approached 30% in Q1, nearly double what it was a year ago. The overall class continues to experience significant growth, with class total prescription volume up about 45% in the first quarter. We continue to see regulatory approval of EMPA-REG outcome data as a catalyst for growth for both the class and for Jardiance. 
The other catalyst for growth is inclusion of these data in treatment guidelines. In general, we expect guideline updates to come after regulators implement label updates, and we are pleased with the first treatment guidelines update issued in Canada during Q1.
Basaglar is early in its global launch cycle and is now marketed in a number of European countries, Japan and Canada. Early share of the total basal insulin market varies greatly by country. To provide an idea of the difference of the rate of adoption, BASAGLAR's share of market is 17% in Slovakia, 11% in Japan and 2% in Germany. We look forward to launching Basaglar in the U.S. in mid-December this year. 
Finally, our newest product, Portrazza, launched in the U.S. in December and in Europe earlier this month. 
Moving to Slide 14. You'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q1 2016 results. As mentioned earlier, this quarter, FX was a top line headwind, reducing revenues in U.S. dollars by over 3 percentage points. Excluding FX, revenue grew 8%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 12% outpaced revenue growth due to the negative effect of product mix and the lower production volume. 
Excluding FX, non-GAAP operating expense growth also slightly outpaced revenue growth due to the baricitinib milestone payments. Excluding these payments, non-GAAP operating expenses grew more slowly than revenue. 
Excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 1%, while a lower tax rate led to a 5% increase in non-GAAP EPS.
Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 15 shows our pipeline as of April 19. Changes since our last earnings calls are highlighted, with green arrow showing progression and red arrow showing movement out of the portfolio. 
In terms of advancement, you'll see that Taltz was approved by the U.S. FDA and by the European Commission for psoriasis. Olaratumab was submitted in the U.S. and Europe. The BACE inhibitor with AstraZeneca successfully passed its safety assessment and advanced into Phase III. And 2 earlier stage molecules advanced, our [indiscernible] inhibitor for cancer moved into Phase II and a dyslipidemia molecule moved into Phase I.
Since our last update, we also terminated development of 3 Phase II molecules and a Phase I molecule for diabetic nephropathy. 
Slide 16 shows select new indications and line extensions. You'll see the advancement of the empagliflozin/metformin XR combination tablet into regulatory review as well as the initiation of Phase II work for baricitinib in both atopic dermatitis and lupus. 
Turning to Slide 17. Let's recap the progress we made on the key events we projected for 2016.
Since our last call, we've green checkmarks for the transition of the BACE inhibitor for early Alzheimer's disease from Phase II to Phase III; a number of regulatory submissions, including U.S. and European submissions of olaratumab, Japanese submission of baricitinib and U.S. submission of empagliflozin XR; and regulatory approval for Portrazza in Europe and Taltz in the U.S. and Europe.
You're off to a strong start in this year and we look forward to sustaining this momentum throughout the remainder of the year and into the years to come.
Now turning to our 2016 financial guidance.
The first thing you may notice on Slide 18 is that there is a lot of yellow highlighting changes from our last call. For our non-GAAP guidance, what this really represents, however, is just 2 changes. First, we lowered our full year non-GAAP tax rate and raised our non-GAAP EPS rage by $0.05 to reflect the discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter. Second, we've updated our line item guidance for revenue, gross margin percent, SG&A and R&D to reflect recent foreign exchange movements. At the bottom of the slide, you'll see the major foreign exchange rates used for our revised guidance. 
We've also updated our GAAP guidance for other income and EPS to reflect the Venezuela charge Phil mentioned earlier as well as the charges related to the closure of a manufacturing facility and Novartis Animal Health integration costs.
It's important to point out that our outlook for the underlying fundamentals of our business in 2016 have not changed since our last update in late January. To illustrate this point, let's look at an updated version of a slide we showed you when we provided our initial 2016 guidance in early January.
You may recall that the version of Slide 19 we showed in early January highlighted our expectation for non-GAAP EPS growth of roughly 15%, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. 
As you can see, we continue to expect mid-teens non-GAAP EPS growth on the same basis. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect robust operational growth in non-GAAP EPS, driven by positive leverage, as revenue growth exceeds operating expense growth. This reflects our commitment to reduce operating expenses as a percent of revenue and expand margins. 
In summary, we're off to a good start to the year. Excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 8%, with growing contributions from our recently launched products, which, this quarter, drove 5 percentage points of our growth. We're pleased to add Taltz to this group beginning in the second quarter. 
We have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Yet again, in Q1, we made significant progress advancing our pipeline. Among many others, key milestones included the approval and launch of Taltz for psoriasis, the submission of olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma and the transition of our BACE inhibitor for early Alzheimer's disease into Phase III testing. 
And as John mentioned when he kicked off the call, we continue to make steady progress against each of our strategic objectives, driving revenue growth, expanding margins, sustaining the flow of innovation and deploying capital to create value. 
Continued execution of this strategy should position us to make major contributions to medical progress and create value for shareholders. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session."

FDA and other relators have been consistent over the last 4, 5 years, that they would like to see coprimaries in these studies. However, I think Lilly believes, and I don't think we're alone in the field, is the field has moved and that both that changes and function in these early patients as well as maybe the utility of the scales we 'are's using is more questionable. However, cognition is clearly something that can be detected easily. As you know, we've moved cognition to the key secondary endpoint or a function, rather, so that we'll continue to measure this. And if we get statistical significance on that, key secondary, we feel confident that this is not very different in scientific sense from dual primaries. And I think it does allow some additional degrees to release freedom in submissions look at 2 different ways to measure functional in early Alzheimer's patients."

Dave, you've been obviously very proactive  in defending industry and calling attention to the big difference between list and realized price. Don't know if politicians understand that yet, but I think it's important story to be told. Can you just talk about how -- is the 4% price that you took or were able to sustain in the first quarter, how sustainable is that? What do you see with respect to realized price going forward for the industry? And if you could comment on whether or not there has been a change in gross-to-net in various therapeutic categories. Specifically, I think, we've seen some differences in diabetes. If you can comment on that. And then Sue, maybe if you could comment generally, just the impact of your oncology portfolio from PB1 antibodies.

Thanks for your question. I think a bit of the irony to me is that as we hear a lot of rhetoric about drug prices increasing sort of in the, I guess, what you'd say, the press, I don't think there's ever been a time where there's been a more competitive -- when this marketplace in the U.S. has ever been more competitive. And I think that means ultimately that medicines the provide clear differentiation and clear value propositions are going to fare better in the future here than medicines that can be easily commoditized, which really don't adequately differentiate themselves from lower cost alternatives. Your question about is the 4% price, net price we realized in the U.S. in the first quarter sustainable. Well, I think that's difficult to say. I mean, obviously, there are different dynamics going on within different categories. For Lilly, I think, for most companies,  I think diabetes tends to be one of the most price competitive parts of the business. I think we've seen that and felt that with respect to net realized prices on our insulins, for example, over rather a prolonged period of time. I recently -- I think in The Wall Street Journal, we talked about trying to sort of net realized price. And clearly, we get better pricing and commercial plans by far than we get from government programs, where there's largely based on the regulatory mandates a much greater discount realized. So I think rather than -- to answer your question, rather to say there's going to be different pressure in different therapeutic areas, I think it's going to come down more to the products that are competing against one another and I think products really do differentiate themselves. We believe that a number of the products we're launching really do differentiate themselves. And therefore, while uptake, as you know, tends to be somewhat slower today based on getting listed on formularies, the way calendar often works, we're nonetheless remain very optimistic about the prospects for those new products."

And I think it's hard to say from a first-line perspective what may or may not be the impact because there's a lot of questions that remain a this point in time. Will they be selected patients? There's a lot of combo studies ongoing, for example, with Alimta. And we have a combination studies in Cyramza as well. I think there's a lot of questions to the opposite we'll see over the coming months and years. I firmly believe that we will continue to have an important role for both Alimta and Cyramza and Portrazza in the nonmutated patient population. And what's going to be key going forward is really identifying those patients that benefit from particular agents and the role of combination therapies. Also I think of note is important as we're looking at our Cyramza sales, the majority of our Cyramza sales actually now are in the G.I. setting, with both gastric and colorectal cancer. So I continue to see, although the lung space is going to continue to be increasingly competitive, we have plenty of opportunities to continue to grow in the other indications as well."

Well, we are pretty enthusiastic about our prospects with Jardiance overall, not just in the U.S., but outside of the U.S. Probably the most significant aspect of our overall growth for these important products is going to be the overall class growth. We are pretty pleased with the type of share growth that we have seen when it comes to new patient share and total prescriptions. And there are, indeed, some dynamics at the beginning of the year when it comes to switching and so forth. But our overall access is very good. It's 85% plus in commercial and over 65% when it comes to Part D access. Now the one thing that we have to watch out for is, once again, when we look at the class growth, even though total prescriptions are still growing above [ph] 30% -- 46%, I believe, year-to-date, when we look at new patients growth, that is basically in single digits. Now we may recall that last year, we saw the class starting to slow growth and some the report when it comes to the  U.K. and so forth. With EMPA-REG outcome data, we saw some rebound in overall class growth when it comes to, once again, new patients. So overall, I think we have to wait and see. Once again, I think what I have shared is that it is critical that we see both a new label and new guidelines. And both of them, each of them independently will represent importance inflection points. I do want to provide a little bit of color on Jardiance outside of the U.S. because we are seeing some acceleration of the overall class growth outside of the U.S. We see our share, whether it's Germany at over 30%, Spain at 22%, Italy at over 40% and in the U.K. and Canada, over 10%, basically, a few months after launch. All of the trends are very positive, and we're actually very bullish when it comes to Jardiance overall."

First, just writing some context on Trulicity because I think it's important as we look at that type of acceptance of the product that's happening right now. We're seeing excellent sequential growth, $74 million in Q3, $113 million in Q4 and $144 million in Q1 of '16. Class growth is exceptional, higher than we had expected. You may recall, before Trulicity launch, we were in high single digits, hovering around 10%. So we did see Trulicity as a catalyst for growth in the overall plasm. That has actually exceeded our expectations. And Derica spoke to this about our share gains and so forth. We are now at 18% when we look at the total subscription growth. Probably the one element that I do want to share is that the feedback that we see, sort of patients and physicians, from using the products, from the doctors of the product, this is truly exceptional. So unprecedented rates in terms of overall satisfaction and result of the product. Now -- so what does that mean when we look at oral GLP-1s? We like where Trulicity stands. We do believe it's going to be a very important option long term for us, regardless of whether or oral GLP-1s coming to the market or not. Now oral GLP-1s are going to have to show efficacy and tolerability. I think, given the bioavailability of some of the options out there, you have the question what is going to be the relevance outside of the U.S. from the cost of products sold, how profitable is that going to be? Now having said all of that, we do like oral GLP-1s, but we are behind novel. This is an area of interest and one that we are investing to try to catch up."

So from our perspective, everything continues to be on track and really spurred by the uptake of the new product launches that we've been talking about. In regards to the changing guidance, it really was just 2 things. One, we made some assumptions at the beginning of the year about the FX rate. Those -- while it's a headwind, it's been a bit less of a headwind than we anticipated. So it has a line item impact but not a bottom line impact. What drove the EPS change is really the discrete tax benefit that we received in the first quarter. And we're essentially saying that should carry through for the year.

We've been one of the fastest-growing, if not the fastest growing, company in Japan now for a number of years actually. And these recent new product launches are keeping us on a strong trajectory there. We are very concerned about the threat of annual repricing. The industry has been quite active and engaging with policymakers in Japan. I, myself, have been engaged in that quite recently. Japan has seen a more rapid uptake of generics. They're ahead of sort of that time scale for generic adoption that was initially laid out by the government. We believe that, in combination with the current biannual price decreases, puts Japan on a trajectory to keep their growth cost essentially flat for the remainder of this decade and beyond. Now of course, their macroeconomic considerations that the government sort of building in to the entire calculus there. They try to help the economy recover but certainly, part of that economic recovery. A key part of all these platform has been to actually develop and grow the indigenous biopharmaceutical industry there. So part of our messaging has also included the fact that without an opportunity to gain -- to realize full value from the products that we do launch there, I think the emphasis on the discovery development and innovative new medicines in Japan is going to suffer as well."

You have the time line correct from our previous communications in terms of what we expect October and then sometime before Christmas, maybe just before a top line readout. I think it's probably premature to comment on the exact content of that, although, As usual, we try to be as transparent with our investors as we can be without jeopardizing publication. I think we've also said it's difficult to predict right now what meeting we will be presenting that data because there isn't actually an obvious one shortly after that. So we're working on finalizing all of this. And if we can, we'd like to be as transparent as we can with the top line results, including key secondary endpoints like function, and make sure we -- regarding jeopardizing publication, which hopefully will be shortly thereafter. So feel free to jump on that, Phil, if I'm getting that wrong. And then in terms of commercial impact. We do believe demonstrating impact on function as well as biomarkers is important. But I think the most important thing is to establish that solanezumab is a disease-modifying agents, meaning unlike symptomatics, that if you remove the therapy, patients don't simply return to their previous state, but there's a permanent alteration and trajectory of decline and decline measured by whatever measure we want, whether that be function or cognition. I think we established some important information around that with EXPEDITION extension data presented last summer. But obviously, we need to repeat that finding in EXPEDITION3 and really demonstrate that there's a building effect through time and that's in the open label expansions, as they come out of all the studies, we can again replicate that. So disease modification is a key commercial handle I think to set up a new class for really changing the outcome of the patients will Alzheimer's."

I guess, I'll start with sort of a constructive question and then transition to a more critical question. So with respect to changing the endpoint, could you just talk a little bit how making cognition the only primary endpoint makes it easier to achieve statistical significance and explain how the statistics are now different in that function, I believe, I guess, will be tested as a .05 [ph] statistical hurdle. Previously, as a core primary endpoint, the statistical hurdle would have potentially been more challenging. So if you could just please explain how does the statistics benefit that would be helpful. And then in looking at -- and trying to understand the lack of confidence that you have in showing a functional benefit, it's a little bit perplexing because Aricept shows a functional benefit within 6 months in just a few hundred patients. Now granted it's a different type of drug, and their test did include moderate patients, but since EXPEDITION3 has 2,100 patients, so it's dramatically larger than historical Alzheimer's trials, I'm just wondering how to think about a potential lack of functional benefit over 18 months, particularly since the mild patients will transition to being moderate patients over time. And I think Lilly's conclusion is that sola doesn't work in moderate patients. So just, I guess, the question is specifically, how should we think about a potential lack of functional benefit in a 2,100-patient trial if patients are progressing towards being moderate and the general view is that sola doesn't work in moderate patients?"

Let me address the second question first, Dave, because I don't think, based on your question, we see things the way you characterized them. We don't have a lack of confidence that solanezumab won't affect function. In fact, if we go back to the pool",691,"Yes. Let me address the second question first, Dave, because I don't think, based on your question, we see things the way you characterized them. We don't have a lack of confidence that solanezumab won't affect function. In fact, if we go back to the pool of mild disclosure back in 2011, sorry 2012, you will see that we had a point .001 impact on all measures of cognition that we listed and a .057 on ADL, a .045 p-value on IADL. So it's based on how we selected ABS cog-14 in IADL as original endpoints, our design for both our study more significantly and excludes patients who lack amyloid, which we believe should give us a better signal-to-noise ratio for anti-amyloid therapy. So don't -- I would encourage investors not to be confused at this stage has any bearing on our confidence. And again, remind everyone, we'll see nothing as it relates to the blinded data on EXPEDITION3 in lungs until the final data later this year. So why did we do this? I guess, there's 3 hypothetical scenarios at the outcome. On the extremes, you have a total failure to replicate the pooled mild date up meaning there is no relevant effects of solanezumab. Truth out of EXPEDITION3, I don't think this matters and probably nothing would have. We don't believe that's the most probable case, but I guess, critics might highlight that. On the other hand is a scenario where we hit or replicate EXPEDITION1 and 2 pooled mild data at a strongly or maybe even with a better p-value than the pooled mild information previously published. In that case, this change doesn't really matter either because we will have the primary, hit the key secondaries. We'll go to the regulators with both of those data sets and, I believe, meet the qualifications for approval that existed previously. I think the reason to do this is a scenario where you achieved cognition but not that's have a close call on function. And given the measurement issues with function in mild Alzheimer's, as I described in an earlier answer on the call, that is a possibility. We don't think the most probably will,  but it's a possibility. We will allow for that by being able to, A, measure function 2 ways. FAQ, is another instrument and more tailored instrument for early Alzheimer's and the IADL, which I described already. Additionally, as Jan mentioned, we're measuring caregiver activity and the red light and many matter other instruments we can job on. We think this will maximize the chance of both a submission and potential for approval. And that's why we made this move just to be clear on all of that. I think it's -- we already have shown data that intervening with disease-modifying agent in mild Alzheimer's disease does carry over into moderate phase that was published last year in the EXPEDITION extension data, and we can talk about that off-line if you'd like to. Finally, your first question was how does the statistics work? And I just want to highlight, we have not finalized our statistical analysis plan in the finer point of details, so I'll just talk in broad strokes here. Dual primaries, you need to split your .05 alpha in half and allocate it to the 2 primaries to achieve the statistical significance on both versus just one. On both way, there's a low wider mode on achieving ADAS-cog 14. Based on our previous finding, I'm not sure that's critical to achieve ADAS-cog 14, but it is a point to note. And then we can then divide the alpha among the key secondaries, which in this case will be the FAQ as well as the IADL estimates. So with very, there could be more of allocated ideal already FAQ based on our final design. So there is an incrementally positive impact on statistical calculations at the end of the day. Again, that's not the primary reason we're doing all this. It's because we really do believe commission matters and predict functional decline, and we have the study, as you point out, to achieve significance on both."

And the effects of [indiscernible] in those models have been more difficult, I think, to demonstrate in the same way. But I think, overall, we will have to look at the clinical data in the end. Sola that has a very favorable safety profile if you look overall, even then compared to some other anti-amyloid antibodies, which are in development, whilst the safety of the BACE inhibitors, particularly larger trials, have still to be proven. And recognizing that old-age Alzheimer's patients are fragile, and you need also very safe agents. So more to come."

As we look in Europe, which we do expect rollouts in launches beginning this summer and then through really the end of '18. That's the cycle for reimbursement assessment. So the full revenue picture won't be elucidated until after '18, really. But in Germany, we'll get an early read because of the way reimbursement works. We have a very strong competitive label in Europe, including first-line indication for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, all the same efficacy endpoints and maybe a few others that I mentioned from the U.S. question earlier, properly that's noted in label and consistently with long duration of effect. Switching is an important factor in this market, but perhaps not in the sense that someone achieves success and then switches to a brand that can give them better success. What we see is one of patients try and lapse treatment. And as Phil mentioned earlier, we estimate less than 1 in 10 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis is currently on a biologic, but there's quite a number that have tried one in the past and are no longer using it. So in this way, switching, meaning they were on something before now can reinitiate on this promising new therapy, Taltz. And actually, our label in Europe highlights that, that the drug is both durable and effective in patients independent of whether it's a first-line, biologic, a switch, a lapse biologic or someone refractory to multiple biologics. So that's an important pool of patients as we have early launched an uptick. And again, we are very optimistic for this product."

Joining me on today's call and some from remote locations are Derica Rice, our CFO; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, who is President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of the Investor Relations team. 
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Successful execution of our innovation-based strategy has put Lilly on a positive trajectory that became most evident in 2014 and 2015, particularly with regard to sustaining the flow of innovation. Building on that positive momentum, 2016 is off to a good start. 
Let me begin our call today by recapping progress we've made on our strategic objectives since our last earnings call in January. Slide 4 should be familiar to you, depicting the 4 strategic objectives for our post-patent exploration period that we first laid out in January of 2015.  
On our first strategic objective, grow revenue. In the first quarter, we grew revenue 8% on a constant currency or performance basis. Nearly all of this performance growth was driven by volume. And in total, our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, BASAGLAR and Portrazza drove 5 percentage points of this volume growth. Starting with today's call, we'll include in our earnings calls an update on the performance of new products for their first 3 years on the market. In addition, you'll see that we've included additional product information in our supplementary slides. Of course, we welcome your feedback on this approach.
Turning to our next strategic objective, expand margins. Our non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue was up slightly compared to the first quarter 2015 due to the baricitinib milestone payments paid to Incyte, which totaled $55 million in the quarter. Excluding these payments, our OpEx percent was flat. We are on track to achieve our full year guidance, which at the mid-point of our ranges implies an improvement of 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue, even including the baricitinib milestones. 
Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, I've highlighted a few examples of the continued success we're experiencing. Along with AstraZeneca, we announced that our BACE inhibitor advanced into the Phase III portion of the AMARANTH study in early Alzheimer's disease. 
Taltz, discovered here at Lilly, was approved in the U.S. for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and initial shipments left our warehouse earlier this month. And just yesterday, we received European approval. 
Also, olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody from our ImClone acquisition, has now been submitted to U.S. and European regulatory authorities for soft tissue sarcoma. During this call, we'll provide a more complete list of the pipeline progress we've achieved over the last 3 months. 
Finally on our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value. During the quarter, we returned over $800 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and ongoing share repurchase plan. On the business development front, we've completed a number of smaller deals, including the Aratana deal, to bolster our companion animal business, and we continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
In summary, I'm confident that we're on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives and assure you that their achievement remains a top priority of our entire management team. 
Now let's move on to review the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On the commercial front, in Europe, following European Commission approval in late January, we launched Cyramza for second-line non-small cell lung cancer and for second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. We also received European Commission approval for and earlier this month launched Portrazza for first-line EGFR-expressing squamous non-small cell lung cancer. 
As I just mentioned, earlier this month, we launched Taltz in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, following FDA approval in the first quarter. And also here in the U.S., we launched the Humulin Regular U-500 KwikPen. 
It was a busy 3 months on the regulatory front as well. In addition to the U.S. and European approvals of Taltz and the European approval of Portrazza, in Japan, we submitted baricitinib for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis. This represents an outstanding achievement as regulatory submissions in the U.S., Europe and Japan occurred within a span of less than 40 working days. This also demonstrates that our focus on development execution is paying off. 
As an update to the submission announcement we made with Incyte, here in the U.S., the FDA has now accepted our submission for baricitinib, and we look forward to regulatory action in early 2017. As I mentioned earlier in both the U.S. and Europe, we submitted olaratumab for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we submitted the once-daily combination tablet of empagliflozin and metformin XR to the FDA. And on the animal health front, we received U.S. approval for Imrestor, a nonantibiotic animal health product for reduction of the incidence of clinical mastitis in dairy cows. Imrestor is a protein and a first-of-its-kind therapy that helps support the natural function of a dairy cow's immune system during the critical time around calving when the risk for mastitis is heightened. 
On the clinical front, we announced a change to the EXPEDITION3 trial solanezumab in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, making the  ADAS Cog 14 cognitive scale the sole primary endpoint. Functional outcomes will be evaluated as key secondary endpoints.
Along with AstraZeneca, we announced that AMARANTH, a Phase II/III study of AZD3293, an oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme, or BACE inhibitor, currently in development as a potential treatment for early Alzheimer's disease, will move into the Phase III portion of this Phase II/III seamless trial. This movement into Phase III triggers a milestone payment from Lilly to AstraZeneca which will result in a second quarter pretax charge of $100 million to Lilly's GAAP and non-GAAP research and development expense. 
As mentioned at our December 8 investment community meeting, the transition of AMARANTH into Phase III will also trigger the start of a second Phase III study with AZD3293. That study called DAYBREAK will focus on patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and is scheduled to begin enrolling patients in the third quarter this year. Similar to the EXPEDITION3 trial of solanezumab, also in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, DAYBREAK will use a single cognitive primary endpoint, in this case, ADAS-Cog 13. Further, the AMARANTH trial in patients with early Alzheimer's disease will also be changed to use ADAS-Cog 13 as a single primary endpoint. So we're consistently moving to a single cognitive primary endpoint across our trials in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
And following the successful result of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we announced plans to conduct 2 outcome trials investigating Jardiance for the treatment of people with chronic heart failure. The trials are expected to begin within the next 12 months and are planned to enroll people with chronic heart failure, both with and without type 2 diabetes.
On the business development front, we modified our existing baricitinib agreement to provide Incyte with the right to develop ruxolitinib, or Jakafi, for graft-versus-host disease. We retain rights to develop baricitinib for this indication. As part of this deal, Lilly will receive a $35 million up front payment that will be recognized as other income in the second quarter, both in our GAAP and non-GAAP results.
On the animal health side of the business, yesterday, we announced that we licensed rights to Aratana's Galliprant, an FDA-approved therapeutic for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. This deal includes an up front payment of $45 million, plus additional milestone and royalty payments upon meeting certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. Galliprant will support the growth of our companion animal therapeutic segment, one of the key growth engines for our animal health business. 
In other news, the U.K. High Court decided the Alimta vitamin regimen patent would not presently be infringed by Actavis marketing pemetrexed trometamol in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain with instructions to dilute the product only with dextrose solution. We plan to appeal this decision for the U.K. Court of Appeal.
Finally, in the first quarter, we repurchased $300 million of stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. During the quarter, we also distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter."

I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our b",1397,"Thanks, John. Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first quarter GAAP results. 
Of note, you will see in our GAAP other income and expense, we have recognized pretax charge of $204 million, equivalent to $0.19 per share related to the significant deterioration of the Venezuelan economy and its impact on the bolivar. This charge represents the effect of revaluing our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities at a rate of 275.
Moving to non-GAAP measure on Slide 9, you can see the Q1 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q1 2015, reaching $4.865 billion. Foreign exchange rate continue to provide a top line headwind. Excluding FX, our Q1 revenue increased 8%, driven by higher volume from TRULICITY, Cyramza, Humalog, Jardiance and Trajenta among others as well as by the take-back of North American rights for Erbitux. The effective price was 1%. 
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.9 percentage points to 76.3%. This decrease was primarily driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in a benefit both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 40 basis points, going from 75.3% in last year's quarter to 74.9% this quarter, driven primarily by product mix and the timing of production.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 7% compared to Q1 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 1% while R&D increased 17%. The reduction in marketing, selling, administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower litigation expenses, partially offset by expenses to support new products.  The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs, including $55 million in milestone payments to Incyte, triggered by regulatory submissions for baricitinib in the U.S. and Europe. These milestone payments added over 5 percentage points to R&D expense growth and over 2 percentage points to total operating expense growth. Excluding these milestone payments, total operating expenses increased about 4.5%, which was slightly slower than revenue growth.
Other income and expense was income of $55 million this quarter, and this represents a reduction of $38 million compared to Q1 2015, primarily due to lower net gains on investments.
Our tax rate was 17.9%, a decrease of 5 percentage points compared with the same quarter last year. This decrease is due to a net discrete tax benefit of roughly $50 million this quarter and the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit that were enforced during this year's quarter, but it lapsed during last year's quarter. It was partially offset by a higher percentage of earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions this year compared to last year.
At the bottom line, net income decreased 4%, and earnings per share decreased 5%.
While I'll cover the FX effect on our income statement in a subsequent slide, I would highlight that when excluding the effect of FX, non-GAAP net income and EPS actually increased 5% this quarter. 
Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slide 23. 
Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on Q1 revenue growth. On Slide 11, in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 5% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. When compared to Q1 last year, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies was a headwind to revenue growth, as shown by the 3% negative effect from FX this quarter. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 8%, driven by volume growth of 7 percentage points with price growth of 1 percentage point.
By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 17%, driven by volume, and to a much lesser extent, price. TRULICITY, Humalog, Jardiance and Humulin all made substantial contributions to U.S. pharma volume growth. Having completed the take-back of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1, we also benefited from booking a full quarter's end sales of Erbitux.
The decline in EuCan revenue of 5% was entirely driven by the negative effect of FX, while in a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue increased 1%. This increase was driven by volume gains on many products, most notably, TRULICITY and Cyramza, but also including BASAGLAR, FORTEO, Jardiance, Humulin, Trajenta and Strattera that more than offset a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sales, resulting from loss of data package exclusivity. Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased 10% in constant-currency term.
In Japan, pharma revenue increased 16% in total, driven by high teens volume growth. You'll also see a slightly larger negative impact from price as the latest round of price revisions in Japan took effect on March 1. On a constant-currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 14%, and this performance growth was attributable to a number of products, led by Cyramza, but also including Strattera, BASAGLAR, Trajenta and ALIMTA, as well as by Cymbalta, following a restructuring of our agreement with Shionogi last April. 
Turning to Emerging Markets. We saw revenue decline 17%, driven primarily by the negative effect of foreign exchange. On a performance basis, Emerging Markets revenue decreased 7% due to the continued impact of generics, including Cialis in Brazil and Korea and ALIMTA in Australia and Korea, the impact of the Brazil federal Humulin tender and stocking patterns in Russia and China.
Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 14% or 9% on a constant-currency basis with the growth rate negatively affected by high customer buying in Q1 of last year. Adjusting for customer buying patterns, we see growth in our China pharma revenue. 
Turning to animal health. We completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year, so year-on-year revenue growth comparisons are now on an apples-to-apples basis. This quarter, Elanco Health -- Elanco Animal  Health revenue increased 1%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, it actually increased 5%. This performance increase was primarily driven by U.S. products, both food animal and companion animal, including contributions from recent launched products, Interceptor Plus and Osurnia.
As I mentioned a moment ago, excluding FX on worldwide revenue, our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter with nearly all of that growth 7% coming from higher volume. Our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, BASAGLAR and Portrazza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. Slide 12 shows these products drove over 5 percentage points of volume growth. The take-back of Erbitux contributed 1.7 percentage points of volume growth. While in total, Humalog, Animal Health, Trajenta, FORTEO and ALIMTA contributed over 2 percentage points of our volume growth. You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror, still was a negative drag of over 150 basis points on our volume growth this quarter.
To anticipate a couple of likely product-specific questions, on this slide, you can see that Humalog contributed nearly a full percentage point for our worldwide volume growth. You'll also see in our press release, however, that our U.S. sales declined 14% this quarter. This decline is not reflective of the underlying trends. Adjustments for estimated rebates and discounts, primarily related to the fourth quarter of last year, affected our reported results for Q1 this year.
We believe the underlying revenue trend for Humalog is similar to the first 9 months of 2015, representing mid-single-digit growth. 
And for ALIMTA, you can see that it contributed about 30 basis points to our worldwide volume growth this quarter. I'd  highlight that in the U.S., our year-on-year growth rate benefited by a few percentage points from customer buying patterns, while in Europe, our sales benefited from increased clinical trial demand. 
We continue to be exposed to generic entry in multiple countries in Europe during 2016 that may erode sales significantly from Q1 levels. 
Now let me turn the call over to Derica."

While Phil quantified the contribution to our worldwide volume growth coming from new products, I'd like to share some color behind the numbers. While it's too early to say much about Portrazza, I will provide a brief update on the other 4 n",1324,"Thanks, Phil. While Phil quantified the contribution to our worldwide volume growth coming from new products, I'd like to share some color behind the numbers. While it's too early to say much about Portrazza, I will provide a brief update on the other 4 new products: TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance and BASAGLAR.  During the Q&A session, Sue and Enrique will be happy to provide more details. 
As you can see on the graph on Slide 13, our new products generated $325 million in revenue this quarter, led by TRULICITY and Cyramza. This represents about 7% of our total worldwide revenue. 
After a limited access for TRULICITY in 2015, following its approval in late 2014, sales have accelerated this year. Both commercial and Part D access are now in excess of 70%. And TRULICITY's total prescription share of the GLP-1 class is now 17% and growing, making TRULICITY the second-most prescribed GLP-1 brand. During the quarter, the class continued to grow at over 30%, and we see continue upside from here. 
For Cyramza, this product continues to grow, driven largely by increasing sales in Japan and Europe as sales growth in the U.S. has slowed due in part to the competition from the immuno-oncology agents. Japan now makes up nearly 30% of our Cyramza's global sales. We had a strong launch in gastric cancer, and we look forward to regulatory action in Japan later this year on our submissions for non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer.  While in Europe, we just launched those 2 indications during the first quarter.
With Jardiance, we've seen a substantial increase in our new-to-brand share of market with both endocrinologists and primary care physicians. In total, our new-to-brand share approached 30% in Q1, nearly double what it was a year ago. The overall class continues to experience significant growth, with class total prescription volume up about 45% in the first quarter. We continue to see regulatory approval of EMPA-REG OUTCOME data as a catalyst for growth for both the class and for Jardiance. The other catalyst for growth is inclusion of these data in treatment guidelines. In general, we expect guideline updates to come after regulators implement label updates, and we are pleased with the first treatment guideline update issued in Canada during Q1.
BASAGLAR is early in its global launch cycle and is now marketed in a number of European countries, Japan and Canada. Early share of the total basal insulin market varies greatly by country. To provide an idea the differences in rates of adoption, BASAGLAR's share of market is 17% in Slovakia, 11% in Japan and 2% in Germany. We look forward to launching BASAGLAR in the U.S. in mid-December this year. 
Finally, our newest product, Portrazza, launched in the U.S. in December and in Europe earlier this month. 
Moving to Slide 14, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rate on our Q1 2016 results. As mentioned earlier, this quarter, FX was a top line headwind, reducing revenues in U.S. dollars by over 3 percentage points. Excluding FX, revenue grew 8%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 12% outpaced revenue growth due to the negative effect of product mix and to lower production volume. 
Excluding FX, non-GAAP operating expense growth also slightly outpaced revenue growth due to the baricitinib milestone payments. Excluding these payments, non-GAAP operating expenses grew more slowly than revenue. 
Excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 1%, while a lower tax rate led to a 5% increase in non-GAAP EPS.
Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 15 shows our pipeline as of April 19. Changes since our last earnings calls are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. 
In terms of advancement, you'll see that Taltz was approved by the U.S. FDA and by the European Commission for psoriasis. Olaratumab was submitted in the U.S. and Europe. The BACE inhibitor with AstraZeneca successfully passed its safety assessment and advanced into Phase III, and 2 earlier-staged molecules advanced, our NOTCH inhibitor for cancer moved into Phase II and a dyslipidemia molecule moved into Phase I.
Since our last update, we also terminated development of 3 Phase II molecules and a Phase I molecule for diabetic nephropathy. 
Slide 16 shows select new indications and line extensions. You'll see the advancement of the empagliflozin/metformin XR combination tablet into regulatory review as well as the initiation of Phase II work for baricitinib in both atopic dermatitis and lupus. 
Turning to Slide 17. Let's recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green checkmarks for the transition of the BACE inhibitor for early Alzheimer's disease from Phase II to Phase III; a number of regulatory submissions, including U.S. and European submissions of olaratumab, Japanese submission of baricitinib and U.S. submission of empa/met XR and regulatory approvals for Portrazza in Europe and Taltz in the U.S. and Europe.
We're off to a strong start this year, and we look forward to sustaining this momentum throughout the remainder of the year and into the years to come.
Now turning to our 2016 financial guidance. The first thing you may notice on Slide 18 is that there is a lot of yellow highlighting changes from our last call. For our non-GAAP guidance, what this really represents, however, is just 2 changes. First, we lowered our full year non-GAAP tax rate and raised our non-GAAP EPS range by $0.05 to reflect the discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter. Second, we've updated our line item guidance for revenue, gross margin percent, SG&A and R&D to reflect recent foreign exchange movement. At the bottom of the slide, you'll see the major foreign exchange rates used for our revised guidance. We've also updated our GAAP guidance for other income and EPS to reflect the Venezuela charge Phil mentioned earlier as well as charges related to the closure of a manufacturing facility and Novartis Animal Health integration costs.
It's important to point out that our outlook for the underlying fundamentals of our business in 2016 have not changed since our last update in late January. To illustrate this point, let's look at an updated version of a slide we showed you when we provided our initial 2016 guidance in early January. 
You may recall that the version of Slide 19 we showed in early January highlighted our expectation for non-GAAP EPS growth of roughly 15%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. As you can see, we continue to expect mid-teens non-GAAP EPS growth on the same basis. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect robust operational growth in non-GAAP EPS, driven by positive leverage as revenue growth exceeds operating expense growth. This reflects our commitment to reduce operating expenses as a percent of revenue and expand margins. 
In summary, we're off to a good start to the year. Excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 8% with growing contributions from our recently launched products, which this quarter, drove 5 percentage points of our growth. We're pleased to add Taltz to this group beginning in the second quarter. We have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Yet again, in Q1, we made significant progress advancing our pipeline. Among many others, key milestones included the approval and launch of Taltz for psoriasis, the submission of olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma and the transition of our BACE inhibitor for early Alzheimer's disease into Phase III testing. And as John mentioned when he kicked off the call, we continue to make steady progress against each of our strategic objectives: driving revenue growth, expanding margins, sustaining the flow of innovation and deploying capital to create value. Continued execution of this strategy should position us to make major contributions to medical progress and create value for shareholders. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session."

FDA and other regulators have been consistent over the last 4 or 5 years that they would like to see coprimaries in these studies, however I think Lilly's belief, and I don't think we're alone in the field, is that the field has moved and that both detecting changes and function in these early patients as well as maybe the utility of the scales we're using is more questionable than before. However, cognition is clearly something that can be detected easily. As you know, we've moved cognition to the key secondary endpoint -- or a function rather, so that we'll continue to measure this. And if we hit statistical significance on that as a key secondary, we feel confident that this is not very different in a scientific sense from dual primaries. And I think it does allow us some additional degrees of freedom and submission to look at 2 different ways to measure function in early Alzheimer's patients."

Thanks for your question. I think a bit of the irony to me is as we hear a lot of rhetoric about drug prices increasing sort of in the, I guess what you'd say the lay press, I don't think there's ever been a time when there's been a more competitive -- when this marketplace in the U.S. has ever been more competitive. And I think that means ultimately that medicines that provide clear differentiation and clear value propositions are going to fare better in the future here than medicines that can be easily commoditized, which really don't adequately differentiate themselves from lower-cost alternatives. Your question about is the 4% price, net price we realized in the U.S. in the first quarter sustainable. Well, I think that's difficult to say. I mean, obviously, there are different dynamics going on within different categories. For Lilly, I think, and for most companies,  I think diabetes tends to be one of the most price-competitive parts of the business. I think we've seen that and felt that with respect to net realized prices on our insulins, for example, over a rather prolonged period of time. I recently -- I think in The Wall Street Journal piece talked about Lilly's sort of net realized price, and clearly we get better pricing and commercial plans, by far, than we get from government programs, where there is largely based on the regulatory mandates a much greater discount realized. So I think rather than -- to answer your question, rather than to say there's going to be different pressure in different therapeutic areas, I think it's going to come down more to the products that are competing against one another. And I think products really do differentiate themselves. We believe that a number of the products we're launching really do differentiate themselves. And therefore, while uptake, as you know, tends to be somewhat slower today based on getting listed on the formularies because the way calendar often works, we're nonetheless remain very optimistic about the prospects for those new products."

There's a lot of combo studies ongoing, for example, with ALIMTA, and we have combination studies in Cyramza as well. So I think there's a lot of questions to the opposite we'll see over the coming months and years. I firmly believe that we will continue to have an important role for both ALIMTA and Cyramza and Portrazza in the non-mutated patient population. And what's going to be key going forward is really identifying those patients that benefit from particular agents and the role of combination therapies. Also I think of note is important as we're looking at our Cyramza sales, the majority of our Cyramza sales actually now are in the G.I. setting with both gastric and colorectal cancer. So I continue to see, although the lung space is going to continue to be increasingly competitive, we have plenty of opportunity to continue to grow in the other indications as well."

But other SGLT2s are presumably trying to preserve their positioning in the market. If I look at Slide 38, on Jardiance new-to-brand share of the market, it suddenly seems kind of flat from the start of 2016. I'm wondering if you can talk about the dynamics in 2016 in terms of formulary shifts and possible price competition as other companies like JNJ are trying to hold share here. I'm trying to understand why Slide 38 shows what it does. And then second question is on ALIMTA patent litigation in the U.S. Is year-end the likely time frame when we would have an appeals court decision? And also related to Europe, what is your guidance for 2016 assume about European generic entry in the markets that were covered by that earlier U.K. ruling?"

Well, we are pretty enthusiastic about our prospects with Jardiance overall, not just in the U.S., but outside of the U.S. Probably the most significant aspect to our overall growth for this important product is going to be the overall class growth. We are pretty pleased with the type of share growth that we have seen when it comes to new patient share and total prescriptions. And there are indeed some dynamics at the beginning of the year when it comes to switching and so forth, but our overall access is very good. It's 85% plus in commercial and over 65% when it comes to Part D access. Now the one thing that we have watch out for is, once again, when we look at the class growth. Even though total prescriptions are still growing above 30%, 46%, I believe, year-to-date, when we look at new patient growth, that is basically in single digits. Now we may recall the last year, we saw the class starting to slow with growth with some of the reports when it comes to the  U.K. and so forth. With the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data, we saw some rebound in overall class growth when it comes to, once again, new patients. So overall, I think we have to wait and see. Once again, I think what I have shared is that it is critical that we see both a new label and new treatment guidelines. And both of them -- each of them independently will represent important inflection points. I do want to provide a little bit of color on Jardiance outside of the U.S. because we are seeing some acceleration of the overall class growth outside of the U.S. We see our share, whether it's Germany at over 30%, Spain at 22%, Italy at over 40% and in the U.K. and Canada, over 10%, but basically a few months after launch. All of the trends are very positive, and we're actually very bullish when it comes to Jardiance overall."

We are seeing excellent sequential growth, $74 million in Q3, $113 million in Q4 and $144 million in Q1 of '16. Class growth is exceptional, higher than we've had expected. You may recall, before TRULICITY launch, we were in high single digits, hovering around 10%. So we did see TRULICITY as a catalyst for growth of the overall class, and that has actually exceeded our expectations. And Derica spoke to this about our share gains and so forth. We are now at 18% when we look at total prescription growth. But probably the one element that I do want to share is that the feedback that we see from patients and physicians from using the products, from doctors of the product, is truly exceptional. So unprecedented rates in terms of overall satisfaction and result of the product. Now so what does that mean when we look at oral GLP-1s? We like where TRULICITY stands. We do believe it's going to be a very important option long term for us regardless of whether oral GLP-1s come into the market or not. Now oral GLP-1s are going to have to show appropriate efficacy and tolerability. I think given the bioavailability of some of the options out there, you have to question what is going to be the relevance outside of the U.S., from a cost of products sold, how profitable is that going to be? Now having said all of that, we do like oral GLP-1s, but we are behind novel. This is an area of interest and one that we are investing to try to catch up."

We've been one of the fastest-growing, if not the fastest-growing, company in Japan now for a number of years actually. And these recent new product launches are keeping us on a strong trajectory there. We are very concerned about the threat of annual repricing. The industry has been quite active and engaging with policymakers in Japan. I myself have been engaged in that quite recently. Japan is seeing a more rapid uptake of generics. They're ahead of the sort of the time scale for generic adoption that was initially laid out by the government. We believe that, in combination with the current biennial price decreases, puts Japan on a trajectory to keep their drug costs essentially flat for the remainder of this decade and beyond. Now of course, there are macroeconomic considerations that the government's sort of building into that entire calculus there as they try to help the economy recover, certainly part of that economic recovery. A key part of all these platform has been to actually develop and grow the indigenous biopharmaceutical industry there. So part of our messaging has also included the fact that without an opportunity to gain the -- to realize full value from the products that we do launch there, I think the emphasis on the discovery and development of innovative, new medicines in Japan is going to suffer as well."

In terms of the BACE announcements today, which are that we're bringing coherence to the idea that early Alzheimer's studies, the primary endpoint should be cognition. We're using ADAS-Cog14  in the sola study and 13 in the 2 AZ BACE studies. That's just purely a function of 2 very similar instruments. And one we started within AZ BACE was different than sola, but we expect them to yield very, very similar outcomes. And as we said before in the sola announcement, we think that this is a much better way to detect changes that -- changes in cognition, preclude and predict changes in function. And then measuring function anyway in early Alzheimer's is a difficult prospect, both because patients are losing function typically at a very, very slow rate early and then accelerating as they go through the disease, but also because the instruments being used really are unproven in drug trials. As you know, Chris, we have done a lot of drug trials, both placebo controlled and active, failed and some with some positive results. You mentioned CDR Sum of Boxes. This is a composite index that looks at both function and cognition. It's quite a complicated instrument. Training and implementation [indiscernible] sites is one of our owners. [indiscernible] And although it does show coherence with disease progression, across the whole continuum, we have had less of that observation in our programs and find that ADAS-Cog and for function iADL and the FAQ and other measures of function probably are a bit better in early disease. Final comment is AMARANTH includes prodromal patients, so this is really prediagnosis Alzheimer's. The new study, DAYBREAK, will include mild, and of course, EXPEDITION3 is mild. We think the appropriate primary endpoint in all those settings is a cognitive endpoint with multiple secondaries and a measurement of function as well as biomarkers."

And so we're working on finalizing all of this.

So feel free to jump on that, Phil, if I'm getting that wrong. And then in terms of commercial impact, we do believe demonstrating impact on function as well as biomarkers is important. But I think the most important thing is to establish that solanezumab is a disease-modifying agent, meaning, unlike symptomatics, that if you remove the therapy, patients don't simply return to their previous state, but there's a permanent alteration and a trajectory of decline. And decline measured by whatever measure we want, whether that'd be function or cognition I think we established some important information around that with EXPEDITION extension data presented last summer. But obviously, we need to repeat that finding in EXPEDITION3 and really demonstrate that there's a building effect through time and that's in the open-label extensions as they come out of all the studies, we can again replicate that. So disease modification is a the key commercial handle, I think, to set up a new class for really changing the outcome for patients with Alzheimer's."

I guess, I'll start with sort of a constructive question and then transition to a more critical question. So with respect to changing the endpoint, could you just talk a little bit how making cognition the only primary endpoint makes it easier to achieve statistical significance and explain how the statistics are now different in that function, I believe, I guess, will be tested as a 0.05 statistical hurdle? Previously, as a co-primary endpoint, the statistical hurdle would have potentially been more challenging. So if you could just please explain how the statistics benefit, that would be helpful. And then in looking at and trying to understand the lack of confidence that you have in showing a functional benefit, it's a little bit perplexing because Aricept shows a functional benefit within 6 months in just a few hundred patients. Now granted it's a different type of drug and their test did include moderate patients, but since EXPEDITION3 has 2,100 patients, so it's dramatically larger than historical Alzheimer's trials, I'm just wondering how to think about a potential lack of functional benefit over 18 months, particularly since the mild patients will transition to being moderate patients over time. And I think Lilly's conclusion is that sola doesn't work in moderate patients. So just -- I guess, the question is specifically how should we think about a potential lack of functional benefit in a 2,100-patient trial if patients are progressing towards being moderate and the general view is that sola doesn't work in moderate patients?"

Let me address the second question first, Dave, because I don't think, based on your question, we see things the way you characterized them. We don't have a lack of confidence that solanezumab won't affect function. In fact, if we go back to the pool",712,"Yes. Let me address the second question first, Dave, because I don't think, based on your question, we see things the way you characterized them. We don't have a lack of confidence that solanezumab won't affect function. In fact, if we go back to the pool of mild disclosure back in 2011 -- sorry 2012, you will see that we had a 0.001 impact on all measures of cognition that we listed and a 0.057 on ADL, a 0.045 p-value on iADL. So it's based on how we select ADAS-Cog 14 in iADL as original endpoints. Our design both powers the study more significantly and excludes patients who lack amyloid, which we believe should give us a better signal-to-noise ratio for anti-amyloid therapy. So don't -- I would encourage investors not to be confused that this change has any bearing on our confidence. And again, to remind everyone, we have seen nothing as it relates to the blinded data on EXPEDITION3 in lungs [ph] until the final database is locked later this year. So why did we do this? I guess, there's 3 hypothetical scenarios at the outcome. On the extremes, you have a total failure to replicate the pool of mild data, meaning, there is no relevant effect of solanezumab. [indiscernible] of being truth out of EXPEDITION3, I don't think this matters and probably nothing would have. We don't believe that's the most probable case, but I guess, critics might highlight that. On the other hand, it's a scenario where we hit or replicate EXPEDITION1 and 2 pool of mild data at a strongly or maybe even with a better p-value than the pool of mild information previously published. In that case, this change doesn't really matter either because we will have the primary and hit the key secondaries. We'll go to the regulators with both of those data sets and, I believe, meet the qualifications for approval that existed previously. I think the reason to do this is a scenario where you achieved cognition, but not going to have a close call on function. And given the measurement issues with function in mild Alzheimer's, as I described in an earlier answer on the call, that is a possibility. We don't think the most probable is a possibility. And we want to allow for that by being able to, a, measure function 2 ways. FAQ is another instrument, a more tailored instrument for early Alzheimer's, and the iADL, which I've described already. Additionally, as Jan mentioned, we're measuring caregiver activity in the red light and many, many matter other instruments we can draw up on. We think this will maximize the chance of both the submission and potential for approval. And that's why we made this move just to be clear on all of that. I think it's -- we already have shown data that intervening with disease-modifying agent in mild Alzheimer's disease does carry over into moderate phase. That was published last year in the EXPEDITION extension data, and we can talk about that off-line, if you'd like to. Finally, your first question was, how do the statistics work? And I just want to highlight, we have not finalized our statistical analysis plan in the finer point of details, so I'll just talk in broad strokes here. If any have dual primaries, you need to split your 0.05 alpha in half and allocate it to the 2 primaries to achieve statistical significance on both versus just one. So in this way, there's a little wider moat on achieving ADAS-Cog14. Based on our previous finding, I'm not sure that's critical to achieve ADAS-Cog14, but it is a point to note. And then we can then divide the alpha that's left among the key secondaries, which, in this case, will be the FAQ as well as the iADL functional instruments. So in theory, there is -- there could be more alpha-allocated iADL or the FAQ based on our final design. So there is an incrementally positive impact on statistical calculations at the end of the day. Again, that's not the primary reason we're doing all of this because we really do believe cognition matters. It predicts functional decline. And we've powered the study, as you point out, to achieve significance on both."

Sola has a very favorable safety profile, if you look overall, even then compared to some other anti-amyloid antibodies which are in development, whilst the safety of the BACE inhibitors, particularly larger trials, have still to be proven and recognizing that old-age Alzheimer's patients are fragile, and you need also very safe agents. So more to come."

So as you pointed out, we are quite encouraged by the early adoption of the class. I didn't read it too carefully, but I noted the Novartis antibody had strong success o U.S. And I think, particularly in Germany, the early uptake -- as we look at Europe, which we do expect rollouts and launches beginning this summer and then through really the end of '18, that's the cycle for reimbursement assessment, so the full revenue picture won't be elucidated until after '18 really. But in Germany, we will get an early read because of the way the reimbursement works. We have a very strong and competitive label in Europe, including first-line indication for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, all the same efficacy endpoints and maybe a few others that I mentioned from the U.S. question earlier. The drug works rapidly. That's noted in the label, and it's consistently with long duration of effect. Switching is an important factor in this market, but perhaps not in the sense that someone achieves success and then switches to a brand that could give an even better success. What we see is a lot of patients try and lapse treatment. And as Phil mentioned earlier, we estimate less than 1 in 10 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is currently on a biologic. But there's quite a number that have tried one in the past and are no longer using it. So in this way, switching, meaning, they were on something before, now can reinitiate on this promising new therapy, Taltz. And actually, our label in Europe highlights that, that the drug is both durable and effective in patients independent of whether it's a first-line naive biologic, a switch, a lapsed biologic or somewhat refractory to multiple biologics. So that's an important pool of patients as we have early launched an update. And again, we're very optimistic for this product."

I'm John Lechleiter , Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me on today's call, and some from remote locations, are Derica Rice, our CFO; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, who is President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of the Investor Relations team. 
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Successful execution of our innovation-based strategy has put Lilly on a positive trajectory that became most evident in 2014 and 2015, particularly with regard to sustaining the flow of innovation. Building on that positive momentum, 2016 is off to a good start. 
Let me begin our call today by recapping progress we've made on our strategic objectives since our last earnings call in January. Slide 4 should be familiar to you, depicting the 4 strategic objectives for our post-patent exploration period that we first laid out in January of 2015. 
On our first strategic objective, grow revenue. In the first quarter, we grew revenue 8% on a constant currency or performance basis. Nearly all of this performance growth was driven by volume. And in total, our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, BASAGLAR and Portrazza drove 5 percentage points of this volume growth. Starting with today's call, we'll include in our earnings calls an update on the performance of new products for their first 3 years on the market. In addition, you'll see that we've included additional product information in our supplementary slides. Of course, we welcome your feedback on this approach.
Turning to our next strategic objective, expand margins. Our non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue was up slightly compared to the first quarter 2015 due to the baricitinib milestone payments paid to Incyte, which totaled $55 million in the quarter. Excluding these payments, our OpEx percent was flat. We are on track to achieve our full year guidance, which at the mid-point of our ranges implies an improvement of 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue, even including the baricitinib milestones. 
Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, I've highlighted a few examples of the continued success we're experiencing. Along with AstraZeneca, we announced that our BACE inhibitor advanced into the Phase III portion of the AMARANTH study in early Alzheimer's disease. 
Taltz, discovered here at Lilly, was approved in the U.S. for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and initial shipments left our warehouse earlier this month. And just yesterday, we received European approval. 
Also, olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody from our ImClone acquisition, has now been submitted to U.S. and European regulatory authorities for soft tissue sarcoma. During this call, we'll provide a more complete list of the pipeline progress we've achieved over the last 3 months. 
Finally on our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value. During the quarter, we returned over $800 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and ongoing share repurchase plan. On the business development front, we completed a number of smaller deals, including the Aratana deal, to bolster our companion animal business, and we continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
In summary, I'm confident that we're on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives and assure you that their achievement remains a top priority of our entire management team. 
Now let's move on to review the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On the commercial front, in Europe, following European Commission approval in late January, we launched Cyramza for second-line non-small cell lung cancer and for second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. We also received European Commission approval for and earlier this month launched Portrazza for first-line EGFR-expressing squamous non-small cell lung cancer. 
As I just mentioned, earlier this month, we launched Taltz in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, following FDA approval in the first quarter. And also here in the U.S., we launched the Humulin Regular U-500 KwikPen. 
It was a busy 3 months on the regulatory front as well. In addition to the U.S. and European approvals of Taltz and the European approval of Portrazza, in Japan, we submitted baricitinib for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis. This represents an outstanding achievement as regulatory submissions in the U.S., Europe and Japan occurred within a span of less than 40 working days. This also demonstrates that our focus on development execution is paying off. 
As an update to the submission announcement we made with Incyte, here in the U.S., the FDA has now accepted our submission for baricitinib, and we look forward to regulatory action in early 2017. As I mentioned earlier in both the U.S. and Europe, we submitted olaratumab for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we submitted the once-daily combination tablet of empagliflozin and metformin XR to the FDA. And on the animal health front, we received U.S. approval for Imrestor, a nonantibiotic animal health product for reduction of the incidence of clinical mastitis in dairy cows. Imrestor is a protein and a first-of-its-kind therapy that helps support the natural function of a dairy cow's immune system during the critical time around calving when the risk for mastitis is heightened. 
On the clinical front, we announced a change to the EXPEDITION3 trial solanezumab in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, making the ADAS-Cog 14 cognitive scale the sole primary endpoint. Functional outcomes will be evaluated as key secondary endpoints.
Along with AstraZeneca, we announced that AMARANTH, a Phase II/III study of AZD3293, an oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme, or BACE inhibitor, currently in development as a potential treatment for early Alzheimer's disease, will move into the Phase III portion of this Phase II/III seamless trial. This movement into Phase III triggers a milestone payment from Lilly to AstraZeneca which will result in a second quarter pretax charge of $100 million to Lilly's GAAP and non-GAAP research and development expense. 
As mentioned at our December 8 investment community meeting, the transition of AMARANTH into Phase III will also trigger the start of a second Phase III study with AZD3293. That study called DAYBREAK will focus on patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and is scheduled to begin enrolling patients in the third quarter this year. Similar to the EXPEDITION3 trial of solanezumab, also in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, DAYBREAK will use a single cognitive primary endpoint, in this case, ADAS-Cog 13. Further, the AMARANTH trial in patients with early Alzheimer's disease will also be changed to use ADAS-Cog 13 as a single primary endpoint. So we're consistently moving to a single cognitive primary endpoint across our trials in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
And following the successful result of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we announced plans to conduct 2 outcome trials investigating Jardiance for the treatment of people with chronic heart failure. The trials are expected to begin within the next 12 months and are planned to enroll people with chronic heart failure, both with and without type 2 diabetes.
On the business development front, we modified our existing baricitinib agreement to provide Incyte with the right to develop ruxolitinib, or Jakafi, for graft-versus-host disease. We retained rights to develop baricitinib for this indication. As part of this deal, Lilly will receive a $35 million upfront payment that will be recognized as other income in the second quarter, both in our GAAP and non-GAAP results.
On the animal health side of the business, yesterday, we announced that we licensed rights to Aratana's Galliprant, an FDA-approved therapeutic for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. This deal includes an upfront payment of $45 million, plus additional milestone and royalty payments upon meeting certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. Galliprant will support the growth of our companion animal therapeutic segment, one of the key growth engines for our animal health business. 
In other news, the U.K. High Court decided the ALIMTA vitamin regimen patent would not presently be infringed by Actavis marketing pemetrexed trometamol in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain with instructions to dilute the product only with dextrose solution. We plan to appeal this decision for the U.K. Court of Appeal.
Finally, in the first quarter, we repurchased $300 million of stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. During the quarter, we also distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter."
285467,319564321,963699,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, John. Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results.

Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first quarter GAAP results. 
Of note, you will see in our GAAP other income and expense, we have recognized a pretax charge of $204 million, equivalent to $0.19 per share related to the significant deterioration of the Venezuelan economy and its impact on the bolivar. This charge represents the effect of revaluing our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities at a rate of 275.
Moving to non-GAAP measures on Slide 9, you can see the Q1 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q1 2015, reaching $4.865 billion. Foreign exchange rates continue to provide a top line headwind. Excluding FX, our Q1 revenue increased 8%, driven by higher volume from TRULICITY, Cyramza, Humalog, Jardiance and Trajenta among others as well as by the take-back of North American rights for Erbitux. The effective price was 1%. 
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.9 percentage points to 76.3%. This decrease was primarily driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in a benefit both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 40 basis points, going from 75.3% in last year's quarter to 74.9% this quarter, driven primarily by product mix and the timing of production.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 7% compared to Q1 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 1% while R&D increased 17%. The reduction in marketing, selling, administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower litigation expenses, partially offset by expenses to support new products. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs, including $55 million in milestone payments to Incyte, triggered by regulatory submissions for baricitinib in the U.S. and Europe. These milestone payments added over 5 percentage points to R&D expense growth and over 2 percentage points to total operating expense growth. Excluding these milestone payments, total operating expenses increased about 4.5%, which was slightly slower than revenue growth.
Other income and expense was income of $55 million this quarter, and this represents a reduction of $38 million compared to Q1 2015, primarily due to lower net gains on investments.
Our tax rate was 17.9%, a decrease of 5 percentage points compared with the same quarter last year. This decrease is due to a net discrete tax benefit of roughly $50 million this quarter and the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit that were enforced during this year's quarter, but it lapsed during last year's quarter. It was partially offset by a higher percentage of earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions this year compared to last year.
At the bottom line, net income decreased 4%, and earnings per share decreased 5%.
While I'll cover the FX effect on our income statement in a subsequent slide, I would highlight that when excluding the effect of FX, non-GAAP net income and EPS actually increased 5% this quarter. 
Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slide 23. 
Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on Q1 revenue growth. On Slide 11, in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 5% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. When compared to Q1 last year, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies was a headwind to revenue growth, as shown by the 3% negative effect from FX this quarter. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 8%, driven by volume growth of 7 percentage points with price growth of 1 percentage point.
By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 17%, driven by volume, and to a much lesser extent, price. TRULICITY, Humalog, Jardiance and Humulin all made substantial contributions to U.S. pharma volume growth. Having completed the take-back of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1, we also benefited from booking a full quarter's end sales of Erbitux.
The decline in EuCan revenue of 5% was entirely driven by the negative effect of FX, while in a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue increased 1%. This increase was driven by volume gains on many products, most notably, TRULICITY and Cyramza, but also including BASAGLAR, FORTEO, Jardiance, Humulin, Trajenta and Strattera that more than offset a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sales, resulting from loss of data package exclusivity. Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased 10% in constant-currency term.
In Japan, pharma revenue increased 16% in total, driven by high teens volume growth. You'll also see a slightly larger negative impact from price as the latest round of price revisions in Japan took effect on March 1. On a constant-currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 14%, and this performance growth was attributable to a number of products, led by Cyramza, but also including Strattera, BASAGLAR, Trajenta and ALIMTA, as well as by Cymbalta, following a restructuring of our agreement with Shionogi last April. 
Turning to Emerging Markets. We saw revenue decline 17%, driven primarily by the negative effect of foreign exchange. On a performance basis, Emerging Markets revenue decreased 7% due to the continued impact of generics, including Cialis in Brazil and Korea and ALIMTA in Australia and Korea, the impact of the Brazil federal Humulin tender and stocking patterns in Russia and China.
Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 14% or 9% on a constant-currency basis with the growth rate negatively affected by high customer buying in Q1 of last year. Adjusting for customer buying patterns, we see growth in our China pharma revenue. 
Turning to animal health. We completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year, so year-on-year revenue growth comparisons are now on an apples-to-apples basis. This quarter, Elanco Health -- Elanco Animal Health revenue increased 1%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, it actually increased 5%. This performance increase was primarily driven by U.S. products, both food animal and companion animal, including contributions from recent launched products, Interceptor Plus and Osurnia.
As I mentioned a moment ago, excluding FX on worldwide revenue -- or our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter with nearly all of that growth 7% coming from higher volume. Our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, BASAGLAR and Portrazza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. Slide 12 shows that these products drove over 5 percentage points of volume growth. The take-back of Erbitux contributed 1.7 percentage points of volume growth. While in total, Humalog, Animal Health, Trajenta, FORTEO and ALIMTA contributed over 2 percentage points of our volume growth. You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror, still was a negative drag of over 150 basis points on our volume growth this quarter.
To anticipate a couple of likely product-specific questions, on this slide, you can see that Humalog contributed nearly a full percentage point to our worldwide volume growth. You'll also see in our press release, however, that our U.S. sales declined 14% this quarter. This decline is not reflective of the underlying trends. Adjustments for estimated rebates and discounts, primarily related to the fourth quarter of last year, affected our reported results for Q1 this year.
We believe the underlying revenue trend for Humalog is similar to the first 9 months of 2015, representing mid-single-digit growth. 
And for ALIMTA, you can see that it contributed about 30 basis points to our worldwide volume growth this quarter. I'd highlight that in the U.S., our year-on-year growth rate benefited by a few percentage points from customer buying patterns, while in Europe, our sales benefited from increased clinical trial demand. 
We continue to be exposed to generic entry in multiple countries in Europe during 2016 that may erode sales significantly from Q1 levels. 
Now let me turn the call over to Derica."

While Phil quantified the contribution to our worldwide volume growth coming from new products, I'd like to share some color behind the numbers. While it's too early to say much about Portrazza, I will provide a brief update on the other 4 n",1324,"Thanks, Phil. While Phil quantified the contribution to our worldwide volume growth coming from new products, I'd like to share some color behind the numbers. While it's too early to say much about Portrazza, I will provide a brief update on the other 4 new products: TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance and BASAGLAR. During the Q&A session, Sue and Enrique will be happy to provide more details. 
As you can see on the graph on Slide 13, our new products generated $325 million in revenue this quarter, led by TRULICITY and Cyramza. This represents about 7% of our total worldwide revenue. 
After a limited access for TRULICITY in 2015, following its approval in late 2014, sales have accelerated this year. Both commercial and Part D access are now in excess of 70%. And TRULICITY's total prescription share of the GLP-1 class is now 17% and growing, making TRULICITY the second-most prescribed GLP-1 brand. During the quarter, the class continued to grow at over 30%, and we see continued upside from here. 
For Cyramza, this product continues to grow, driven largely by increasing sales in Japan and Europe as sales growth in the U.S. has slowed due in part to the competition from the immuno-oncology agents. Japan now makes up nearly 30% of our Cyramza's global sales. We've had a strong launch in gastric cancer, and we look forward to regulatory action in Japan later this year on our submissions for non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. While in Europe, we just launched those 2 indications during the first quarter.
With Jardiance, we've seen a substantial increase in our new-to-brand share of market with both endocrinologists and primary care physicians. In total, our new-to-brand share approached 30% in Q1, nearly double what it was a year ago. The overall class continues to experience significant growth, with class total prescription volume up about 45% in the first quarter. We continue to see regulatory approval of EMPA-REG OUTCOME data as a catalyst for growth for both the class and for Jardiance. The other catalyst for growth is inclusion of these data in treatment guidelines. In general, we expect guideline updates to come after regulators implement label updates, and we are pleased with the first treatment guideline update issued in Canada during Q1.
BASAGLAR is early in its global launch cycle and is now marketed in a number of European countries, Japan and Canada. Early share of the total basal insulin market varies greatly by country. To provide an idea the differences in rates of adoption, BASAGLAR's share of market is 17% in Slovakia, 11% in Japan and 2% in Germany. We look forward to launching BASAGLAR in the U.S. in mid-December this year. 
Finally, our newest product, Portrazza, launched in the U.S. in December and in Europe earlier this month. 
Moving to Slide 14, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rate on our Q1 2016 results. As mentioned earlier, this quarter, FX was a top line headwind, reducing revenues in U.S. dollars by over 3 percentage points. Excluding FX, revenue grew 8%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 12% outpaced revenue growth due to the negative effect of product mix and to lower production volume. 
Excluding FX, non-GAAP operating expense growth also slightly outpaced revenue growth due to the baricitinib milestone payments. Excluding these payments, non-GAAP operating expenses grew more slowly than revenue. 
Excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 1%, while a lower tax rate led to a 5% increase in non-GAAP EPS.
Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 15 shows our pipeline as of April 19. Changes since our last earnings calls are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. 
In terms of advancement, you'll see that Taltz was approved by the U.S. FDA and by the European Commission for psoriasis. Olaratumab was submitted in the U.S. and Europe. The BACE inhibitor with AstraZeneca successfully passed its safety assessment and advanced into Phase III, and 2 earlier-stage molecules advanced, our NOTCH inhibitor for cancer moved into Phase II and a dyslipidemia molecule moved into Phase I.
Since our last update, we also terminated development of 3 Phase II molecules and a Phase I molecule for diabetic nephropathy. 
Slide 16 shows select new indications and line extensions. You'll see the advancement of the empagliflozin/metformin XR combination tablet into regulatory review as well as the initiation of Phase II work for baricitinib in both atopic dermatitis and lupus. 
Turning to Slide 17. Let's recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green checkmarks for the transition of the BACE inhibitor for early Alzheimer's disease from Phase II to Phase III; a number of regulatory submissions, including U.S. and European submissions of olaratumab, Japanese submission of baricitinib and U.S. submission of empa/met XR and regulatory approvals for Portrazza in Europe and Taltz in the U.S. and Europe.
We're off to a strong start this year, and we look forward to sustaining this momentum throughout the remainder of the year and into the years to come.
Now turning to our 2016 financial guidance. The first thing you may notice on Slide 18 is that there is a lot of yellow highlighting changes from our last call. For our non-GAAP guidance, what this really represents, however, is just 2 changes. First, we lowered our full year non-GAAP tax rate and raised our non-GAAP EPS range by $0.05 to reflect the discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter. Second, we've updated our line item guidance for revenue, gross margin percent, SG&A and R&D to reflect recent foreign exchange movement. At the bottom of the slide, you'll see the major foreign exchange rates used for our revised guidance. We've also updated our GAAP guidance for other income and EPS to reflect the Venezuela charge Phil mentioned earlier as well as charges related to the closure of a manufacturing facility and Novartis Animal Health integration costs.
It's important to point out that our outlook for the underlying fundamentals of our business in 2016 have not changed since our last update in late January. To illustrate this point, let's look at an updated version of a slide we showed you when we provided our initial 2016 guidance in early January. 
You may recall that the version of Slide 19 we showed in early January highlighted our expectation for non-GAAP EPS growth of roughly 15%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. As you can see, we continue to expect mid-teens non-GAAP EPS growth on this same basis. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect robust operational growth in non-GAAP EPS, driven by positive leverage as revenue growth exceeds operating expense growth. This reflects our commitment to reduce operating expenses as a percent of revenue and expand margins. 
In summary, we're off to a good start to the year. Excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 8% with growing contributions from our recently launched products, which this quarter, drove 5 percentage points of our growth. We're pleased to add Taltz to this group beginning in the second quarter. We have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Yet again, in Q1, we made significant progress advancing our pipeline. Among many others, key milestones included the approval and launch of Taltz for psoriasis, the submission of olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma and the transition of our BACE inhibitor for early Alzheimer's disease into Phase III testing. And as John mentioned when he kicked off the call, we continue to make steady progress against each of our strategic objectives: driving revenue growth, expanding margins, sustaining the flow of innovation and deploying capital to create value. Continued execution of this strategy should position us to make major contributions to medical progress and create value for shareholders. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session."

FDA and other regulators have been consistent over the last 4 or 5 years that they would like to see coprimaries in these studies, however I think Lilly's belief, and I don't think we're alone in the field, is that the field has moved and that both detecting changes and function in these early patients as well as maybe the utility of the scales we're using is more questionable than before. However, cognition is clearly something that can be detected easily. As you know, we've moved cognition to the key secondary endpoint -- or a function rather, so that we'll continue to measure this. And if we hit statistical significance on that as a key secondary, we feel confident that this is not very different in the scientific sense from dual primaries. And I think it does allow us some additional degrees of freedom and submission to look at 2 different ways to measure function in early Alzheimer's patients."

To date, you've been obviously very proactive in defending the industry and calling attention to the big difference between list and realized price. Don't know if politicians understand that yet, but I think it's important story to be told. Can you just talk about how -- is the 4% price that you took or were able to sustain in the first quarter, how sustainable is that? What do you see with respect to realized price going forward for the industry? And if you could comment on whether or not there has been a change in gross-to-net in various therapeutic categories. Specifically, I think we've seen some differences in diabetes. If you can comment on that. And then Sue, maybe if you could comment generally on just the impact of your oncology portfolio from PD-1 antibodies. We saw a bit of the impact this quarter, but generally, if PD-1 antibodies and monotherapy work in frontline lung, what sort of impact should we see across your portfolio?"

Thanks for your question. I think a bit of the irony to me is as we hear a lot of rhetoric about drug prices increasing sort of in the, I guess what you'd say the lay press, I don't think there's ever been a time when there's been a more competitive -- when this marketplace in the U.S. has ever been more competitive. And I think that means ultimately that medicines that provide clear differentiation and clear value propositions are going to fare better in the future here than medicines that can be easily commoditized, which really don't adequately differentiate themselves from lower-cost alternatives. Your question about is the 4% price, net price we realized in the U.S. in the first quarter sustainable. Well, I think that's difficult to say. I mean, obviously, there are different dynamics going on within different categories. For Lilly, I think, and for most companies, I think diabetes tends to be one of the most price-competitive parts of the business. I think we've seen that and felt that with respect to net realized prices on our insulins, for example, over a rather prolonged period of time. I recently -- I think in The Wall Street Journal piece talked about Lilly's sort of net realized price, and clearly we get better pricing and commercial plans, by far, than we get from government programs, where there is largely based on the regulatory mandates a much greater discount realized. So I think rather than -- to answer your question, rather than to say there's going to be different pressure in different therapeutic areas, I think it's going to come down more to the products that are competing against one another. And I think products really do differentiate themselves. We believe that a number of the products we're launching really do differentiate themselves. And therefore, while uptake, as you know, tends to be somewhat slower today based on getting listed on the formularies because the way calendar often works, we're nonetheless remain very optimistic about the prospects for those new products."

And I think it's hard to say from a first-line perspective what may or may not be the impact because there are a lot of questions that remain at this point in time. Will they be selected patients? There's a lot of combo studies ongoing, for example, with ALIMTA, and we have combination studies with Cyramza as well. So I think there's a lot of questions, to be honest, that we'll see over the coming months and years. I firmly believe that we will continue to have an important role for both ALIMTA and Cyramza and Portrazza in the non-mutated patient population. And what's going to be key going forward is really identifying those patients that benefit from particular agents and the role of combination therapies. Also I think of note, it's important that as we're looking at our Cyramza sales, the majority of our Cyramza sales actually now are in the G.I. setting with both gastric and colorectal cancer. So I continue to see, although the lung space is going to continue to be increasingly competitive, we have plenty of opportunity to continue to grow in the other indications as well."

Well, we are pretty enthusiastic about our prospects with Jardiance overall, not just in the U.S., but outside of the U.S. Probably the most significant aspect to our overall growth for this important product is going to be the overall class growth. We are pretty pleased with the type of share growth that we have seen when it comes to new patient share and total prescriptions. And there are indeed some dynamics at the beginning of the year when it comes to switching and so forth, but our overall access is very good. It's 85% plus in commercial and over 65% when it comes to Part D access. Now the one thing that we have watch out for is, once again, when we look at the class growth. Even though total prescriptions are still growing above 30%, 46%, I believe, year-to-date, when we look at new patient growth, that is basically in single digits. Now we may recall the last year, we saw the class starting to slow with growth with some of the reports when it comes to the U.K. and so forth. With the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data, we saw some rebound in overall class growth when it comes to, once again, new patients. So overall, I think we have to wait and see. Once again, I think what I have shared is that it is critical that we see both a new label and new treatment guidelines. And both of them -- each of them independently will represent important inflection points. I do want to provide a little bit of color on Jardiance outside of the U.S. because we are seeing some acceleration of the overall class growth outside of the U.S. We see our share, whether it's Germany at over 30%, Spain at 22%, Italy at over 40% and in the U.K. and Canada, over 10%, but basically a few months after launch. All of the trends are very positive, and we're actually very bullish when it comes to Jardiance overall."

We are seeing excellent sequential growth, $74 million in Q3, $113 million in Q4 and $144 million in Q1 of '16. Class growth is exceptional, higher than we've had expected. You may recall, before TRULICITY launched, we were in high single digits, hovering around 10%. So we did see TRULICITY as a catalyst for growth of the overall class, and that has actually exceeded our expectations. And Derica spoke to this about our share gains and so forth. We are now at 18% when we look at total prescription growth. But probably the one element that I do want to share is that the feedback that we see from patients and physicians, from using the products, from adoption of the product, is truly exceptional. So unprecedented rates in terms of overall satisfaction and result of the product. Now so what does that mean when we look at oral GLP-1s? We like where TRULICITY stands. We do believe it's going to be a very important option long term for us regardless of whether oral GLP-1s come into the market or not. Now oral GLP-1s are going to have to show appropriate efficacy and tolerability. I think given the bioavailability of some of the options out there, you have to question what is going to be the relevance outside of the U.S., from a cost of products sold, how profitable is that going to be? Now having said all of that, we do like oral GLP-1s, but we are behind Novo. It is an area of interest and one that we are investing to try to catch up."

In regards to the change in guidance, it really was just 2 things. One, we made some assumptions at the beginning of the year about the FX rate. Those that -- while it's a headwind, it's been a bit less of a headwind than we had anticipated. So it has a line item impact, but not a bottom line impact. What drove the EPS change is really the discrete tax benefit that we received in the first quarter. And we're essentially saying that should carry through for the year.

The drug works very fast. It lasts a long time. This data has been published most recently at AAD.

We've been one of the fastest-growing, if not the fastest-growing, company in Japan now for a number of years actually. And these recent new product launches are keeping us on a strong trajectory there. We are very concerned about the threat of annual repricing. The industry has been quite active and engaging with policymakers in Japan. I myself have been engaged in that quite recently. Japan is seeing a more rapid uptake of generics. They're ahead of the sort of the time scale for generic adoption that was initially laid out by the government. We believe that, in combination with the current biennial price decreases, puts Japan on a trajectory to keep their drug costs essentially flat for the remainder of this decade and beyond. Now of course, there are macroeconomic considerations that the government is sort of building into the entire calculus there as they try to help the economy recover, but certainly part of that economic recovery. A key part of Abe's platform has been to actually develop and grow the indigenous biopharmaceutical industry there. So part of our messaging has also included the fact that without an opportunity to gain the -- to realize full value from the products that we do launch there, I think the emphasis on the discovery and development of innovative, new medicines in Japan is going to suffer as well."

In terms of the BACE announcements today, which are that we're bringing coherence to the idea that early Alzheimer's studies, the primary endpoint should be cognition. We're using ADAS-Cog14 in the sola study and 13 in the 2 AZ BACE studies. That's just purely a function of 2 very similar instruments. And one we started within AZ BACE was different than sola, but we expect them to yield very, very similar outcomes. And as we said before in the sola announcement, we think that this is a much better way to detect changes that -- changes in cognition, preclude and predict changes in function. And then measuring function anyway in early Alzheimer's is a difficult prospect, both because patients are losing function typically at a very, very slow rate early and then accelerating as they go through the disease, but also because the instruments being used really are unproven in drug trials. As you know, Chris, we have done a lot of drug trials, both placebo controlled and active, failed and some with some positive results. You mentioned CDR Sum of Boxes. This is a composite index that looks at both function and cognition. It's quite a complicated instrument. Training and implementation at the sites is one of the more onerous ones. And although it does show coherence with disease progression, across the whole continuum, we have had less of that observation in our programs and find that ADAS-Cog and for function iADL and the FAQ and other measures of function probably are a bit better in early disease. Final comment is AMARANTH includes prodromal patients, so this is really prediagnosis Alzheimer's. The new study, DAYBREAK, will include mild, and of course, EXPEDITION3 is mild. We think the appropriate primary endpoint in all those settings is a cognitive endpoint with multiple secondaries and a measurement of function as well as biomarkers."

And then my second one, also on sola. I'm just curious, you talked a lot about the regulatory side and kind of the change in endpoints here. And how cognition may be the better way to look at this earlier group of patients. What about on the commercial side? Do you see any more challenge in terms of reimbursement for a product if it's only showing cognition benefit and maybe a very mild sort of impact on the functional side? And maybe you could comment on U.S. versus ex U.S. dynamics there in terms of acceptance of a product that's more driven by a cognition benefit and less on the functional side."

You have the time line correct from our previous communications in terms of what we expect, October and then sometime before Christmas, maybe just before -- a top line readout. I think it's probably premature to comment on the exact content of that, although as usual, we're trying to be as transparent with our investors as we can be without jeopardizing publication. I think we've also said it's difficult to predict right now what meeting we will be presenting that data because there isn't actually an obvious one shortly after that. And so we're working on finalizing all of this. And if we can, we'd like to be as transparent as we can with the top line results, including key secondary endpoints like function, and make sure we guard against jeopardizing publication, which hopefully will be shortly thereafter. So feel free to jump on that, Phil, if I'm getting that wrong. And then in terms of commercial impact, we do believe demonstrating impact on function as well as biomarkers is important. But I think the most important thing is to establish that solanezumab is a disease-modifying agent, meaning, unlike symptomatics, that if you remove the therapy, patients don't simply return to their previous state, but there's a permanent alteration and a trajectory of decline. And decline measured by whatever measure we want, whether that'd be function or cognition, I think we've established some important information around that with EXPEDITION extension data presented last summer. But obviously, we need to repeat that finding in EXPEDITION3 and really demonstrate that there's a building effect through time and that's in the open-label extensions as they come out of all the studies, we can again replicate that. So disease modification is the key commercial handle, I think, to set up a new class for really changing the outcome for patients with Alzheimer's."

So with respect to changing the endpoint, could you just talk a little bit how making cognition the only prima",261,"Yes. So my questions are also on sola. I guess, I'll start with sort of a constructive question and then transition to a more critical question. So with respect to changing the endpoint, could you just talk a little bit how making cognition the only primary endpoint makes it easier to achieve statistical significance and explain how the statistics are now different in that function, I believe, I guess, will be tested as a 0.05 statistical hurdle? Previously, as a co-primary endpoint, the statistical hurdle would have potentially been more challenging. So if you could just please explain how the statistics benefit, that would be helpful. And then in looking at and trying to understand the lack of confidence that you have in showing a functional benefit, it's a little bit perplexing because Aricept shows a functional benefit within 6 months in just a few hundred patients. Now granted it's a different type of drug and their test did include moderate patients, but since EXPEDITION3 has 2,100 patients, so it's dramatically larger than historical Alzheimer's trials, I'm just wondering how to think about a potential lack of functional benefit over 18 months, particularly since the mild patients will transition to being moderate patients over time. And I think Lilly's conclusion is that sola doesn't work in moderate patients. So just -- I guess, the question is specifically how should we think about a potential lack of functional benefit in a 2,100-patient trial if patients are progressing towards being moderate and the general view is that sola doesn't work in moderate patients?"

Let me address the second question first, Dave, because I don't think, based on your question, we see things the way you characterized them. We don't have a lack of confidence that solanezumab won't affect function. In fact, if we go back to the pool",722,"Yes. Let me address the second question first, Dave, because I don't think, based on your question, we see things the way you characterized them. We don't have a lack of confidence that solanezumab won't affect function. In fact, if we go back to the pool of mild disclosure back in 2011 -- sorry 2012, you will see that we had a 0.001 impact on all measures of cognition that we listed and a 0.057 on ADL, a 0.045 p-value on iADL. So it's based on how we selected ADAS-Cog 14 in iADL as the original endpoints. Our design both powers the study more significantly and excludes patients who lack amyloid, which we believe should give us a better signal-to-noise ratio for anti-amyloid therapy. So don't -- I would encourage investors not to be confused that this change has any bearing on our confidence. And again, to remind everyone, we have seen nothing as it relates to the blinded data on EXPEDITION3 -- and won't -- until the final database lock [ph] later this year. So why did we do this? I guess, there's 3 hypothetical scenarios at the outcome. On the extremes, you have a total failure to replicate the pool of mild data, meaning, there is no relevant effect of solanezumab. If that ends up being truth out of EXPEDITION3, I don't think this matters and probably nothing would have. We don't believe that's the most probable case, but I guess, critics might highlight that. On the other hand, is a scenario where we hit or replicate EXPEDITION1 and 2 pool of mild data at as strongly or maybe even with a better p-value than the pool of mild information previously published. In that case, this change doesn't really matter either because we will have hit the primary and hit the key secondaries. We'll go to the regulators with both of those data sets and, I believe, meet the qualifications for approval that existed previously. I think the reason to do this is a scenario where you achieved cognition, but not -- but then have a close call on function. And given the measurement issues with function in mild Alzheimer's, that I described in an earlier answer on the call, that is a possibility. We don't think the most probable -- it is a possibility. And we want to allow for that by being able to, a, measure function 2 ways. FAQ is another instrument, a more tailored instrument for early Alzheimer's, and the iADL, which I've described already. Additionally, as Jan mentioned, we're measuring caregiver activity in the RUD light and many, many other instruments we can draw upon. We think this will maximize the chance of both the submission and potential for approval. And that's why we made this move just to be clear on all of that. I think it's -- we already have shown data that intervening with disease-modifying agent in mild Alzheimer's disease does carry over into moderate phase. That was published last year in the EXPEDITION extension data, and we can talk about that off-line, if you'd like to. Finally, your first question was, how do the statistics work? And I just want to highlight, we have not finalized our statistical analysis plan in the finer point of detail, so I'll just talk in broad strokes here. But when you have dual primaries, you need to split your 0.05 alpha in half and allocate it to the 2 primaries to achieve statistical significance on both versus just one. So in this way, there's a little wider moat on achieving ADAS-Cog14. Based on our previous finding, I'm not sure that's critical to achieve ADAS-Cog14, but it is a point to note. And then we can then divide the alpha that's left among the key secondaries, which, in this case, will be the FAQ as well as the iADL functional instruments. So in theory, there is -- there could be more alpha-allocated to the iADL or the FAQ based on our final design. So there is an incrementally positive impact on statistical calculations at the end of the day. Again, that's not the primary reason we're doing all of this. It's because we really do believe cognition matters. It predicts functional decline. And we've powered the study, as you point out, to achieve significance on both."

As you know, solanezumab is an antibody that has a limited penetration to the brain, about 0.1%, and it binds free amyloid beta. BACE inhibitors, on the other hand, are oral agents that better penetrate the blood brain barrier and prevents then formation of amyloid beta from the amyloid precursor protein. If no real clinical comparisons have been made, then on these agents, but what actually happens with the amyloid content overall in the brain, realizing that the amyloid in the brain is probably in different forms and there -- yes, there is plaques which are very solid, but they're also then intermittent forms and free amyloid there. I think what we have seen in preclinical models is that BACE molecules can reduce the amyloid load then in the various transgenic mice models. And the effects of solanezumab in those models have been more difficult, I think, to demonstrate in the same way. But I think overall, we will have to look at the clinical data in the end. Sola has a very favorable safety profile, if you look overall, even then compared to some other anti-amyloid antibodies which are in development, whilst the safety of the BACE inhibitors, particularly larger trials, have still to be proven and recognizing that old-age Alzheimer's patients are fragile, and you need also very safe agents. So more to come."

But in Germany, we will get an early read because of the way the reimbursement works. We have a very strong and competitive label in Europe, including first-line indication for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, all the same efficacy endpoints and maybe a few others that I mentioned from the U.S. question earlier. The drug works rapidly. That's noted in the label, and it's consistently with long duration of effect. Switching is an important factor in this market, but perhaps not in the sense that someone achieves success and then switches to a brand that could give them even better success. What we see is a lot of patients try and lapse treatment. And as Phil mentioned earlier, we estimate less than 1 in 10 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is currently on a biologic. But there's quite a number that have tried one in the past and are no longer using it. So in this way, switching, meaning, they were on something before, now can reinitiate on this promising new therapy, Taltz. And actually, our label in Europe highlights that, that the drug is both durable and effective in patients independent of whether it's a first-line naive biologic, a switch, a lapsed biologic or somewhat refractory to multiple biologics. So that's an important pool of patients as we have early launch and uptake. And again, we're very optimistic for this product."

I'm John Lechleiter , Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me on today's call, and some from remote locations, are Derica Rice, our CFO; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, who is President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of the Investor Relations team. 
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Successful execution of our innovation-based strategy has put Lilly on a positive trajectory that became most evident in 2014 and 2015, particularly with regard to sustaining the flow of innovation. Building on that positive momentum, 2016 is off to a good start. 
Let me begin our call today by recapping progress we've made on our strategic objectives since our last earnings call in January. Slide 4 should be familiar to you, depicting the 4 strategic objectives for our post-patent exploration period that we first laid out in January of 2015. 
On our first strategic objective, grow revenue. In the first quarter, we grew revenue 8% on a constant currency or performance basis. Nearly all of this performance growth was driven by volume. And in total, our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, BASAGLAR and Portrazza drove 5 percentage points of this volume growth. Starting with today's call, we'll include in our earnings calls an update on the performance of new products for their first 3 years on the market. In addition, you'll see that we've included additional product information in our supplementary slides. Of course, we welcome your feedback on this approach.
Turning to our next strategic objective, expand margins. Our non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue was up slightly compared to the first quarter 2015 due to the baricitinib milestone payments paid to Incyte, which totaled $55 million in the quarter. Excluding these payments, our OpEx percent was flat. We are on track to achieve our full year guidance, which at the mid-point of our ranges implies an improvement of 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue, even including the baricitinib milestones. 
Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, I've highlighted a few examples of the continued success we're experiencing. Along with AstraZeneca, we announced that our BACE inhibitor advanced into the Phase III portion of the AMARANTH study in early Alzheimer's disease. 
Taltz, discovered here at Lilly, was approved in the U.S. for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and initial shipments left our warehouse earlier this month. And just yesterday, we received European approval. 
Also, olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody from our ImClone acquisition, has now been submitted to U.S. and European regulatory authorities for soft tissue sarcoma. During this call, we'll provide a more complete list of the pipeline progress we've achieved over the last 3 months. 
Finally on our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value. During the quarter, we returned over $800 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and ongoing share repurchase plan. On the business development front, we completed a number of smaller deals, including the Aratana deal, to bolster our companion animal business, and we continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
In summary, I'm confident that we're on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives and assure you that their achievement remains a top priority of our entire management team. 
Now let's move on to review the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On the commercial front, in Europe, following European Commission approval in late January, we launched Cyramza for second-line non-small cell lung cancer and for second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. We also received European Commission approval for and earlier this month launched Portrazza for first-line EGFR-expressing squamous non-small cell lung cancer. 
As I just mentioned, earlier this month, we launched Taltz in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, following FDA approval in the first quarter. And also here in the U.S., we launched the Humulin Regular U-500 KwikPen. 
It was a busy 3 months on the regulatory front as well. In addition to the U.S. and European approvals of Taltz and the European approval of Portrazza, in Japan, we submitted baricitinib for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis. This represents an outstanding achievement as regulatory submissions in the U.S., Europe and Japan occurred within a span of less than 40 working days. This also demonstrates that our focus on development execution is paying off. 
As an update to the submission announcement we made with Incyte, here in the U.S., the FDA has now accepted our submission for baricitinib, and we look forward to regulatory action in early 2017. As I mentioned earlier in both the U.S. and Europe, we submitted olaratumab for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we submitted the once-daily combination tablet of empagliflozin and metformin XR to the FDA. And on the animal health front, we received U.S. approval for Imrestor, a nonantibiotic animal health product for reduction of the incidence of clinical mastitis in dairy cows. Imrestor is a protein and a first-of-its-kind therapy that helps support the natural function of a dairy cow's immune system during the critical time around calving when the risk for mastitis is heightened. 
On the clinical front, we announced a change to the EXPEDITION3 trial solanezumab in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, making the ADAS-Cog 14 cognitive scale the sole primary endpoint. Functional outcomes will be evaluated as key secondary endpoints.
Along with AstraZeneca, we announced that AMARANTH, a Phase II/III study of AZD3293, an oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme, or BACE inhibitor, currently in development as a potential treatment for early Alzheimer's disease, will move into the Phase III portion of this Phase II/III seamless trial. This movement into Phase III triggers a milestone payment from Lilly to AstraZeneca which will result in a second quarter pretax charge of $100 million to Lilly's GAAP and non-GAAP research and development expense. 
As mentioned at our December 8 investment community meeting, the transition of AMARANTH into Phase III will also trigger the start of a second Phase III study with AZD3293. That study called DAYBREAK will focus on patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and is scheduled to begin enrolling patients in the third quarter this year. Similar to the EXPEDITION3 trial of solanezumab, also in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, DAYBREAK will use a single cognitive primary endpoint, in this case, ADAS-Cog 13. Further, the AMARANTH trial in patients with early Alzheimer's disease will also be changed to use ADAS-Cog 13 as a single primary endpoint. So we're consistently moving to a single cognitive primary endpoint across our trials in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
And following the successful result of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we announced plans to conduct 2 outcome trials investigating Jardiance for the treatment of people with chronic heart failure. The trials are expected to begin within the next 12 months and are planned to enroll people with chronic heart failure, both with and without type 2 diabetes.
On the business development front, we modified our existing baricitinib agreement to provide Incyte with the right to develop ruxolitinib, or Jakafi, for graft-versus-host disease. We retained rights to develop baricitinib for this indication. As part of this deal, Lilly will receive a $35 million upfront payment that will be recognized as other income in the second quarter, both in our GAAP and non-GAAP results.
On the animal health side of the business, yesterday, we announced that we licensed rights to Aratana's Galliprant, an FDA-approved therapeutic for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. This deal includes an upfront payment of $45 million, plus additional milestone and royalty payments upon meeting certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. Galliprant will support the growth of our companion animal therapeutic segment, one of the key growth engines for our animal health business. 
In other news, the U.K. High Court decided the ALIMTA vitamin regimen patent would not presently be infringed by Actavis marketing pemetrexed trometamol in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain with instructions to dilute the product only with dextrose solution. We plan to appeal this decision for the U.K. Court of Appeal.
Finally, in the first quarter, we repurchased $300 million of stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. During the quarter, we also distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter."
285467,319564321,963879,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, John. Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our b",1401,"Thanks, John. Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first quarter GAAP results. 
Of note, you will see in our GAAP other income and expense, we have recognized a pretax charge of $204 million, equivalent to $0.19 per share related to the significant deterioration of the Venezuelan economy and its impact on the bolivar. This charge represents the effect of revaluing our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities at a rate of 275.
Moving to non-GAAP measures on Slide 9, you can see the Q1 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q1 2015, reaching $4.865 billion. Foreign exchange rates continue to provide a top line headwind. Excluding FX, our Q1 revenue increased 8%, driven by higher volume from TRULICITY, Cyramza, Humalog, Jardiance and Trajenta among others as well as by the take-back of North American rights for Erbitux. The effective price was 1%. 
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.9 percentage points to 76.3%. This decrease was primarily driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in a benefit both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 40 basis points, going from 75.3% in last year's quarter to 74.9% this quarter, driven primarily by product mix and the timing of production.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 7% compared to Q1 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 1% while R&D increased 17%. The reduction in marketing, selling, administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower litigation expenses, partially offset by expenses to support new products. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs, including $55 million in milestone payments to Incyte, triggered by regulatory submissions for baricitinib in the U.S. and Europe. These milestone payments added over 5 percentage points to R&D expense growth and over 2 percentage points to total operating expense growth. Excluding these milestone payments, total operating expenses increased about 4.5%, which was slightly slower than revenue growth.
Other income and expense was income of $55 million this quarter, and this represents a reduction of $38 million compared to Q1 2015, primarily due to lower net gains on investments.
Our tax rate was 17.9%, a decrease of 5 percentage points compared with the same quarter last year. This decrease is due to a net discrete tax benefit of roughly $50 million this quarter and the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit that were enforced during this year's quarter, but it lapsed during last year's quarter. It was partially offset by a higher percentage of earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions this year compared to last year.
At the bottom line, net income decreased 4%, and earnings per share decreased 5%.
While I'll cover the FX effect on our income statement in a subsequent slide, I would highlight that when excluding the effect of FX, non-GAAP net income and EPS actually increased 5% this quarter. 
Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slide 23. 
Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on Q1 revenue growth. On Slide 11, in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 5% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. When compared to Q1 last year, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies was a headwind to revenue growth, as shown by the 3% negative effect from FX this quarter. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 8%, driven by volume growth of 7 percentage points with price growth of 1 percentage point.
By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 17%, driven by volume, and to a much lesser extent, price. TRULICITY, Humalog, Jardiance and Humulin all made substantial contributions to U.S. pharma volume growth. Having completed the take-back of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1, we also benefited from booking a full quarter's end sales of Erbitux.
The decline in EuCan revenue of 5% was entirely driven by the negative effect of FX, while in a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue increased 1%. This increase was driven by volume gains on many products, most notably, TRULICITY and Cyramza, but also including BASAGLAR, FORTEO, Jardiance, Humulin, Trajenta and Strattera that more than offset a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sales, resulting from loss of data package exclusivity. Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased 10% in constant-currency term.
In Japan, pharma revenue increased 16% in total, driven by high teens volume growth. You'll also see a slightly larger negative impact from price as the latest round of price revisions in Japan took effect on March 1. On a constant-currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 14%, and this performance growth was attributable to a number of products, led by Cyramza, but also including Strattera, BASAGLAR, Trajenta and ALIMTA, as well as by Cymbalta, following a restructuring of our agreement with Shionogi last April. 
Turning to Emerging Markets. We saw revenue decline 17%, driven primarily by the negative effect of foreign exchange. On a performance basis, Emerging Markets revenue decreased 7% due to the continued impact of generics, including Cialis in Brazil and Korea and ALIMTA in Australia and Korea, the impact of the Brazil federal Humulin tender and stocking patterns in Russia and China.
Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 14% or 9% on a constant-currency basis with the growth rate negatively affected by high customer buying in Q1 of last year. Adjusting for customer buying patterns, we see growth in our China pharma revenue. 
Turning to animal health. We completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year, so year-on-year revenue growth comparisons are now on an apples-to-apples basis. This quarter, Elanco Health -- Elanco Animal Health revenue increased 1%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, it actually increased 5%. This performance increase was primarily driven by U.S. products, both food animal and companion animal, including contributions from recent launched products, Interceptor Plus and Osurnia.
As I mentioned a moment ago, excluding FX on worldwide revenue -- or our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter with nearly all of that growth 7% coming from higher volume. Our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, BASAGLAR and Portrazza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. Slide 12 shows that these products drove over 5 percentage points of volume growth. The take-back of Erbitux contributed 1.7 percentage points of volume growth. While in total, Humalog, Animal Health, Trajenta, FORTEO and ALIMTA contributed over 2 percentage points of our volume growth. You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror, still was a negative drag of over 150 basis points on our volume growth this quarter.
To anticipate a couple of likely product-specific questions, on this slide, you can see that Humalog contributed nearly a full percentage point to our worldwide volume growth. You'll also see in our press release, however, that our U.S. sales declined 14% this quarter. This decline is not reflective of the underlying trends. Adjustments for estimated rebates and discounts, primarily related to the fourth quarter of last year, affected our reported results for Q1 this year.
We believe the underlying revenue trend for Humalog is similar to the first 9 months of 2015, representing mid-single-digit growth. 
And for ALIMTA, you can see that it contributed about 30 basis points to our worldwide volume growth this quarter. I'd highlight that in the U.S., our year-on-year growth rate benefited by a few percentage points from customer buying patterns, while in Europe, our sales benefited from increased clinical trial demand. 
We continue to be exposed to generic entry in multiple countries in Europe during 2016 that may erode sales significantly from Q1 levels. 
Now let me turn the call over to Derica."

While Phil quantified the contribution to our worldwide volume growth coming from new products, I'd like to share some color behind the numbers. While it's too early to say much about Portrazza, I will provide a brief update on the other 4 n",1324,"Thanks, Phil. While Phil quantified the contribution to our worldwide volume growth coming from new products, I'd like to share some color behind the numbers. While it's too early to say much about Portrazza, I will provide a brief update on the other 4 new products: TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance and BASAGLAR. During the Q&A session, Sue and Enrique will be happy to provide more details. 
As you can see on the graph on Slide 13, our new products generated $325 million in revenue this quarter, led by TRULICITY and Cyramza. This represents about 7% of our total worldwide revenue. 
After a limited access for TRULICITY in 2015, following its approval in late 2014, sales have accelerated this year. Both commercial and Part D access are now in excess of 70%. And TRULICITY's total prescription share of the GLP-1 class is now 17% and growing, making TRULICITY the second-most prescribed GLP-1 brand. During the quarter, the class continued to grow at over 30%, and we see continued upside from here. 
For Cyramza, this product continues to grow, driven largely by increasing sales in Japan and Europe as sales growth in the U.S. has slowed due in part to the competition from the immuno-oncology agents. Japan now makes up nearly 30% of our Cyramza's global sales. We've had a strong launch in gastric cancer, and we look forward to regulatory action in Japan later this year on our submissions for non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer. While in Europe, we just launched those 2 indications during the first quarter.
With Jardiance, we've seen a substantial increase in our new-to-brand share of market with both endocrinologists and primary care physicians. In total, our new-to-brand share approached 30% in Q1, nearly double what it was a year ago. The overall class continues to experience significant growth, with class total prescription volume up about 45% in the first quarter. We continue to see regulatory approval of EMPA-REG OUTCOME data as a catalyst for growth for both the class and for Jardiance. The other catalyst for growth is inclusion of these data in treatment guidelines. In general, we expect guideline updates to come after regulators implement label updates, and we are pleased with the first treatment guideline update issued in Canada during Q1.
BASAGLAR is early in its global launch cycle and is now marketed in a number of European countries, Japan and Canada. Early share of the total basal insulin market varies greatly by country. To provide an idea the differences in rates of adoption, BASAGLAR's share of market is 17% in Slovakia, 11% in Japan and 2% in Germany. We look forward to launching BASAGLAR in the U.S. in mid-December this year. 
Finally, our newest product, Portrazza, launched in the U.S. in December and in Europe earlier this month. 
Moving to Slide 14, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rate on our Q1 2016 results. As mentioned earlier, this quarter, FX was a top line headwind, reducing revenues in U.S. dollars by over 3 percentage points. Excluding FX, revenue grew 8%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 12% outpaced revenue growth due to the negative effect of product mix and to lower production volume. 
Excluding FX, non-GAAP operating expense growth also slightly outpaced revenue growth due to the baricitinib milestone payments. Excluding these payments, non-GAAP operating expenses grew more slowly than revenue. 
Excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 1%, while a lower tax rate led to a 5% increase in non-GAAP EPS.
Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 15 shows our pipeline as of April 19. Changes since our last earnings calls are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. 
In terms of advancement, you'll see that Taltz was approved by the U.S. FDA and by the European Commission for psoriasis. Olaratumab was submitted in the U.S. and Europe. The BACE inhibitor with AstraZeneca successfully passed its safety assessment and advanced into Phase III, and 2 earlier-stage molecules advanced, our NOTCH inhibitor for cancer moved into Phase II and a dyslipidemia molecule moved into Phase I.
Since our last update, we also terminated development of 3 Phase II molecules and a Phase I molecule for diabetic nephropathy. 
Slide 16 shows select new indications and line extensions. You'll see the advancement of the empagliflozin/metformin XR combination tablet into regulatory review as well as the initiation of Phase II work for baricitinib in both atopic dermatitis and lupus. 
Turning to Slide 17. Let's recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green checkmarks for the transition of the BACE inhibitor for early Alzheimer's disease from Phase II to Phase III; a number of regulatory submissions, including U.S. and European submissions of olaratumab, Japanese submission of baricitinib and U.S. submission of empa/met XR and regulatory approvals for Portrazza in Europe and Taltz in the U.S. and Europe.
We're off to a strong start this year, and we look forward to sustaining this momentum throughout the remainder of the year and into the years to come.
Now turning to our 2016 financial guidance. The first thing you may notice on Slide 18 is that there is a lot of yellow highlighting changes from our last call. For our non-GAAP guidance, what this really represents, however, is just 2 changes. First, we lowered our full year non-GAAP tax rate and raised our non-GAAP EPS range by $0.05 to reflect the discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter. Second, we've updated our line item guidance for revenue, gross margin percent, SG&A and R&D to reflect recent foreign exchange movement. At the bottom of the slide, you'll see the major foreign exchange rates used for our revised guidance. We've also updated our GAAP guidance for other income and EPS to reflect the Venezuela charge Phil mentioned earlier as well as charges related to the closure of a manufacturing facility and Novartis Animal Health integration costs.
It's important to point out that our outlook for the underlying fundamentals of our business in 2016 have not changed since our last update in late January. To illustrate this point, let's look at an updated version of a slide we showed you when we provided our initial 2016 guidance in early January. 
You may recall that the version of Slide 19 we showed in early January highlighted our expectation for non-GAAP EPS growth of roughly 15%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. As you can see, we continue to expect mid-teens non-GAAP EPS growth on this same basis. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect robust operational growth in non-GAAP EPS, driven by positive leverage as revenue growth exceeds operating expense growth. This reflects our commitment to reduce operating expenses as a percent of revenue and expand margins. 
In summary, we're off to a good start to the year. Excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 8% with growing contributions from our recently launched products, which this quarter, drove 5 percentage points of our growth. We're pleased to add Taltz to this group beginning in the second quarter. We have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Yet again, in Q1, we made significant progress advancing our pipeline. Among many others, key milestones included the approval and launch of Taltz for psoriasis, the submission of olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma and the transition of our BACE inhibitor for early Alzheimer's disease into Phase III testing. And as John mentioned when he kicked off the call, we continue to make steady progress against each of our strategic objectives: driving revenue growth, expanding margins, sustaining the flow of innovation and deploying capital to create value. Continued execution of this strategy should position us to make major contributions to medical progress and create value for shareholders. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session."

FDA and other regulators have been consistent over the last 4 or 5 years that they would like to see coprimaries in these studies, however I think Lilly's belief, and I don't think we're alone in the field, is that the field has moved and that both detecting changes and function in these early patients as well as maybe the utility of the scales we're using is more questionable than before. However, cognition is clearly something that can be detected easily. As you know, we've moved cognition to the key secondary endpoint -- or a function rather, so that we'll continue to measure this. And if we hit statistical significance on that as a key secondary, we feel confident that this is not very different in the scientific sense from dual primaries. And I think it does allow us some additional degrees of freedom and submission to look at 2 different ways to measure function in early Alzheimer's patients."

Thanks for your question. I think a bit of the irony to me is as we hear a lot of rhetoric about drug prices increasing sort of in the, I guess what you'd say the lay press, I don't think there's ever been a time when there's been a more competitive -- when this marketplace in the U.S. has ever been more competitive. And I think that means ultimately that medicines that provide clear differentiation and clear value propositions are going to fare better in the future here than medicines that can be easily commoditized, which really don't adequately differentiate themselves from lower-cost alternatives. Your question about is the 4% price, net price we realized in the U.S. in the first quarter sustainable. Well, I think that's difficult to say. I mean, obviously, there are different dynamics going on within different categories. For Lilly, I think, and for most companies, I think diabetes tends to be one of the most price-competitive parts of the business. I think we've seen that and felt that with respect to net realized prices on our insulins, for example, over a rather prolonged period of time. I recently -- I think in The Wall Street Journal piece talked about Lilly's sort of net realized price, and clearly we get better pricing and commercial plans, by far, than we get from government programs, where there is largely based on the regulatory mandates a much greater discount realized. So I think rather than -- to answer your question, rather than to say there's going to be different pressure in different therapeutic areas, I think it's going to come down more to the products that are competing against one another. And I think products really do differentiate themselves. We believe that a number of the products we're launching really do differentiate themselves. And therefore, while uptake, as you know, tends to be somewhat slower today based on getting listed on the formularies because the way calendar often works, we're nonetheless remain very optimistic about the prospects for those new products."

And I think it's hard to say from a first-line perspective what may or may not be the impact because there are a lot of questions that remain at this point in time. Will they be selected patients? There's a lot of combo studies ongoing, for example, with ALIMTA, and we have combination studies with Cyramza as well. So I think there's a lot of questions, to be honest, that we'll see over the coming months and years. I firmly believe that we will continue to have an important role for both ALIMTA and Cyramza and Portrazza in the non-mutated patient population. And what's going to be key going forward is really identifying those patients that benefit from particular agents and the role of combination therapies. Also I think of note, it's important that as we're looking at our Cyramza sales, the majority of our Cyramza sales actually now are in the G.I. setting with both gastric and colorectal cancer. So I continue to see, although the lung space is going to continue to be increasingly competitive, we have plenty of opportunity to continue to grow in the other indications as well."

But other SGLT2s are presumably trying to preserve their positioning in the market. If I look at Slide 38, on Jardiance new-to-brand share of the market, it suddenly seems kind of flat from the start of 2016. I'm wondering if you can talk about the dynamics in 2016 in terms of formulary shifts and possible price competition as other companies like J&J are trying to hold share here. I'm trying to understand why Slide 38 shows what it does. And then second question is on ALIMTA patent litigation in the U.S. Is year-end the likely time frame when we would have an appeals court decision? And also related to Europe, what is your guidance for 2016 assume about European generic entry in the markets that were covered by that earlier U.K. ruling?"

Well, we are pretty enthusiastic about our prospects with Jardiance overall, not just in the U.S., but outside of the U.S. Probably the most significant aspect to our overall growth for this important product is going to be the overall class growth. We are pretty pleased with the type of share growth that we have seen when it comes to new patient share and total prescriptions. And there are indeed some dynamics at the beginning of the year when it comes to switching and so forth, but our overall access is very good. It's 85% plus in commercial and over 65% when it comes to Part D access. Now the one thing that we have watch out for is, once again, when we look at the class growth. Even though total prescriptions are still growing above 30%, 46%, I believe, year-to-date, when we look at new patient growth, that is basically in single digits. Now we may recall the last year, we saw the class starting to slow with growth with some of the reports when it comes to the U.K. and so forth. With the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data, we saw some rebound in overall class growth when it comes to, once again, new patients. So overall, I think we have to wait and see. Once again, I think what I have shared is that it is critical that we see both a new label and new treatment guidelines. And both of them -- each of them independently will represent important inflection points. I do want to provide a little bit of color on Jardiance outside of the U.S. because we are seeing some acceleration of the overall class growth outside of the U.S. We see our share, whether it's Germany at over 30%, Spain at 22%, Italy at over 40% and in the U.K. and Canada, over 10%, but basically a few months after launch. All of the trends are very positive, and we're actually very bullish when it comes to Jardiance overall."

We are seeing excellent sequential growth, $74 million in Q3, $113 million in Q4 and $144 million in Q1 of '16. Class growth is exceptional, higher than we've had expected. You may recall, before TRULICITY launched, we were in high single digits, hovering around 10%. So we did see TRULICITY as a catalyst for growth of the overall class, and that has actually exceeded our expectations. And Derica spoke to this about our share gains and so forth. We are now at 18% when we look at total prescription growth. But probably the one element that I do want to share is that the feedback that we see from patients and physicians, from using the products, from adoption of the product, is truly exceptional. So unprecedented rates in terms of overall satisfaction and result of the product. Now so what does that mean when we look at oral GLP-1s? We like where TRULICITY stands. We do believe it's going to be a very important option long term for us regardless of whether oral GLP-1s come into the market or not. Now oral GLP-1s are going to have to show appropriate efficacy and tolerability. I think given the bioavailability of some of the options out there, you have to question what is going to be the relevance outside of the U.S., from a cost of products sold, how profitable is that going to be? Now having said all of that, we do like oral GLP-1s, but we are behind Novo. It is an area of interest and one that we are investing to try to catch up."

We've been one of the fastest-growing, if not the fastest-growing, company in Japan now for a number of years actually. And these recent new product launches are keeping us on a strong trajectory there. We are very concerned about the threat of annual repricing. The industry has been quite active and engaging with policymakers in Japan. I myself have been engaged in that quite recently. Japan is seeing a more rapid uptake of generics. They're ahead of the sort of the time scale for generic adoption that was initially laid out by the government. We believe that, in combination with the current biennial price decreases, puts Japan on a trajectory to keep their drug costs essentially flat for the remainder of this decade and beyond. Now of course, there are macroeconomic considerations that the government is sort of building into the entire calculus there as they try to help the economy recover, but certainly part of that economic recovery. A key part of Abe's platform has been to actually develop and grow the indigenous biopharmaceutical industry there. So part of our messaging has also included the fact that without an opportunity to gain the -- to realize full value from the products that we do launch there, I think the emphasis on the discovery and development of innovative, new medicines in Japan is going to suffer as well."

In terms of the BACE announcements today, which are that we're bringing coherence to the idea that early Alzheimer's studies, the primary endpoint should be cognition. We're using ADAS-Cog14 in the sola study and 13 in the 2 AZ BACE studies. That's just purely a function of 2 very similar instruments. And one we started within AZ BACE was different than sola, but we expect them to yield very, very similar outcomes. And as we said before in the sola announcement, we think that this is a much better way to detect changes that -- changes in cognition, preclude and predict changes in function. And then measuring function anyway in early Alzheimer's is a difficult prospect, both because patients are losing function typically at a very, very slow rate early and then accelerating as they go through the disease, but also because the instruments being used really are unproven in drug trials. As you know, Chris, we have done a lot of drug trials, both placebo controlled and active, failed and some with some positive results. You mentioned CDR Sum of Boxes. This is a composite index that looks at both function and cognition. It's quite a complicated instrument. Training and implementation at the sites is one of the more onerous ones. And although it does show coherence with disease progression, across the whole continuum, we have had less of that observation in our programs and find that ADAS-Cog and for function iADL and the FAQ and other measures of function probably are a bit better in early disease. Final comment is AMARANTH includes prodromal patients, so this is really prediagnosis Alzheimer's. The new study, DAYBREAK, will include mild, and of course, EXPEDITION3 is mild. We think the appropriate primary endpoint in all those settings is a cognitive endpoint with multiple secondaries and a measurement of function as well as biomarkers."

So feel free to jump on that, Phil, if I'm getting that wrong. And then in terms of commercial impact, we do believe demonstrating impact on function as well as biomarkers is important. But I think the most important thing is to establish that solanezumab is a disease-modifying agent, meaning, unlike symptomatics, that if you remove the therapy, patients don't simply return to their previous state, but there's a permanent alteration and a trajectory of decline. And decline measured by whatever measure we want, whether that'd be function or cognition, I think we've established some important information around that with EXPEDITION extension data presented last summer. But obviously, we need to repeat that finding in EXPEDITION3 and really demonstrate that there's a building effect through time and that's in the open-label extensions as they come out of all the studies, we can again replicate that. So disease modification is the key commercial handle, I think, to set up a new class for really changing the outcome for patients with Alzheimer's."

I guess, I'll start with sort of a constructive question and then transition to a more critical question. So with respect to changing the endpoint, could you just talk a little bit how making cognition the only primary endpoint makes it easier to achieve statistical significance and explain how the statistics are now different in that function, I believe, I guess, will be tested as a 0.05 statistical hurdle? Previously, as a co-primary endpoint, the statistical hurdle would have potentially been more challenging. So if you could just please explain how the statistics benefit, that would be helpful. And then in looking at and trying to understand the lack of confidence that you have in showing a functional benefit, it's a little bit perplexing because Aricept shows a functional benefit within 6 months in just a few hundred patients. Now granted it's a different type of drug and their test did include moderate patients, but since EXPEDITION3 has 2,100 patients, so it's dramatically larger than historical Alzheimer's trials, I'm just wondering how to think about a potential lack of functional benefit over 18 months, particularly since the mild patients will transition to being moderate patients over time. And I think Lilly's conclusion is that sola doesn't work in moderate patients. So just -- I guess, the question is specifically how should we think about a potential lack of functional benefit in a 2,100-patient trial if patients are progressing towards being moderate and the general view is that sola doesn't work in moderate patients?"

Let me address the second question first, Dave, because I don't think, based on your question, we see things the way you characterized them. We don't have a lack of confidence that solanezumab won't affect function. In fact, if we go back to the pool",722,"Yes. Let me address the second question first, Dave, because I don't think, based on your question, we see things the way you characterized them. We don't have a lack of confidence that solanezumab won't affect function. In fact, if we go back to the pool of mild disclosure back in 2011 -- sorry 2012, you will see that we had a 0.001 impact on all measures of cognition that we listed and a 0.057 on ADL, a 0.045 p-value on iADL. So it's based on how we selected ADAS-Cog 14 in iADL as the original endpoints. Our design both powers the study more significantly and excludes patients who lack amyloid, which we believe should give us a better signal-to-noise ratio for anti-amyloid therapy. So don't -- I would encourage investors not to be confused that this change has any bearing on our confidence. And again, to remind everyone, we have seen nothing as it relates to the blinded data on EXPEDITION3 -- and won't -- until the final database lock [ph] later this year. So why did we do this? I guess, there's 3 hypothetical scenarios at the outcome. On the extremes, you have a total failure to replicate the pool of mild data, meaning, there is no relevant effect of solanezumab. If that ends up being truth out of EXPEDITION3, I don't think this matters and probably nothing would have. We don't believe that's the most probable case, but I guess, critics might highlight that. On the other hand, is a scenario where we hit or replicate EXPEDITION1 and 2 pool of mild data at as strongly or maybe even with a better p-value than the pool of mild information previously published. In that case, this change doesn't really matter either because we will have hit the primary and hit the key secondaries. We'll go to the regulators with both of those data sets and, I believe, meet the qualifications for approval that existed previously. I think the reason to do this is a scenario where you achieved cognition, but not -- but then have a close call on function. And given the measurement issues with function in mild Alzheimer's, that I described in an earlier answer on the call, that is a possibility. We don't think the most probable -- it is a possibility. And we want to allow for that by being able to, a, measure function 2 ways. FAQ is another instrument, a more tailored instrument for early Alzheimer's, and the iADL, which I've described already. Additionally, as Jan mentioned, we're measuring caregiver activity in the RUD light and many, many other instruments we can draw upon. We think this will maximize the chance of both the submission and potential for approval. And that's why we made this move just to be clear on all of that. I think it's -- we already have shown data that intervening with disease-modifying agent in mild Alzheimer's disease does carry over into moderate phase. That was published last year in the EXPEDITION extension data, and we can talk about that off-line, if you'd like to. Finally, your first question was, how do the statistics work? And I just want to highlight, we have not finalized our statistical analysis plan in the finer point of detail, so I'll just talk in broad strokes here. But when you have dual primaries, you need to split your 0.05 alpha in half and allocate it to the 2 primaries to achieve statistical significance on both versus just one. So in this way, there's a little wider moat on achieving ADAS-Cog14. Based on our previous finding, I'm not sure that's critical to achieve ADAS-Cog14, but it is a point to note. And then we can then divide the alpha that's left among the key secondaries, which, in this case, will be the FAQ as well as the iADL functional instruments. So in theory, there is -- there could be more alpha-allocated to the iADL or the FAQ based on our final design. So there is an incrementally positive impact on statistical calculations at the end of the day. Again, that's not the primary reason we're doing all of this. It's because we really do believe cognition matters. It predicts functional decline. And we've powered the study, as you point out, to achieve significance on both."

As you know, solanezumab is an antibody that has a limited penetration to the brain, about 0.1%, and it binds free amyloid beta. BACE inhibitors, on the other hand, are oral agents that better penetrate the blood brain barrier and prevents then formation of amyloid beta from the amyloid precursor protein. If no real clinical comparisons have been made, then on these agents, but what actually happens with the amyloid content overall in the brain, realizing that the amyloid in the brain is probably in different forms and there -- yes, there is plaques which are very solid, but they're also then intermittent forms and free amyloid there. I think what we have seen in preclinical models is that BACE molecules can reduce the amyloid load then in the various transgenic mice models. And the effects of solanezumab in those models have been more difficult, I think, to demonstrate in the same way. But I think overall, we will have to look at the clinical data in the end. Sola has a very favorable safety profile, if you look overall, even then compared to some other anti-amyloid antibodies which are in development, whilst the safety of the BACE inhibitors, particularly larger trials, have still to be proven and recognizing that old-age Alzheimer's patients are fragile, and you need also very safe agents. So more to come."

So as you point out, we were quite encouraged by the early adoption of the class. I didn't read it too carefully, but I noted the Novartis antibody had strong success o U.S. And I think, particularly in Germany, the early uptake -- as we look at Europe, which we do expect rollouts and launches beginning this summer and then through really the end of '18, that's the cycle for reimbursement assessment, so the full revenue picture won't be elucidated until after '18 really. But in Germany, we will get an early read because of the way the reimbursement works. We have a very strong and competitive label in Europe, including first-line indication for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, all the same efficacy endpoints and maybe a few others that I mentioned from the U.S. question earlier. The drug works rapidly. That's noted in the label, and it's consistently with long duration of effect. Switching is an important factor in this market, but perhaps not in the sense that someone achieves success and then switches to a brand that could give them even better success. What we see is a lot of patients try and lapse treatment. And as Phil mentioned earlier, we estimate less than 1 in 10 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is currently on a biologic. But there's quite a number that have tried one in the past and are no longer using it. So in this way, switching, meaning, they were on something before, now can reinitiate on this promising new therapy, Taltz. And actually, our label in Europe highlights that, that the drug is both durable and effective in patients independent of whether it's a first-line naive biologic, a switch, a lapsed biologic or somewhat refractory to multiple biologics. So that's an important pool of patients as we have early launch and uptake. And again, we're very optimistic for this product."

During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The Information we provide our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Before we dive into this quarter's activities and financial results, I'd love to provide a few brief remarks at a more strategic level. 18 months ago on our guidance call on January 2015, as we emerged from the series of patent expirations we referred to as the YZ period, we described refinements to our innovation-based strategy as well as our key strategic objectives for the remainder of the decade.
Those 4 strategic objectives were: grow revenue; expand margin; sustain the flow of innovation; and deploy capital to create value.
I'd like to provide a bit more detail than we have in the past on our future expectations for each of these objectives, starting with the sustain the flow of innovation. At our meeting in Boston last December, we discussed in great detail both our animal health business and our comprehensive Alzheimer's disease R&D efforts. We followed that up at our meeting this past May where we took an in-depth look at our R&D efforts in diabetes, oncology, immunology and pain. Between these 2 meetings, we hope you've gained a greater appreciation for the significant future growth opportunities we see in each of our human pharma focus areas, as well as in Elanco Animal Health. 
As an innovation-based pharmaceutical company, our future growth prospect is determined by the flow of innovation from our pipeline. As we discussed in our R&D meeting in May, we believe we've made substantial progress building an R&D engine that can sustain a flow of innovation to support our growth aspirations. Over a 10-year period, starting in 2014, we believe we can launch 20 or more new medicine. These 20 launches span the 5 therapeutic areas we focused on: diabetes, oncology, neuro degeneration, immunology and pain. And the revenue growth from these new product launches will be reinforced by new indications and line extension, which on average, could number 2 per year.
So how do we see this translating into revenue growth through the balance of this decade? Having already launched 6 products in the past 2 years, with more launches possible in the next few years, we expect to generate robust revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, despite facing a number of significant patent expirations. To provide the floor for our expectations, we've analyzed a range of scenarios for clinical, regulatory and commercial success. Based on this analysis, we expect annual revenue growth over this period to average at least 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher volume, not price.  And we certainly see scenarios for clinical, regulatory and commercial success that would drive revenue growth significantly higher than its minimum expectation.
I would point out that our revenue growth expectations do assume increased price pressure in the U.S. but do not include any significant government action on Medicare Part D, for example, and also assume that we maintain ALIMTA patent exclusivity in the U.S. throughout the period. 
With regard to our margins, we remain on track to achieve our goal of reducing operating expenses, some of R&D and SG&A, to 50% of revenue or less in 2018. And when excluding foreign exchange, we expect to increase gross margin as a percent of revenue over to remainder of this decade. 
Finally, on deploying capital to create value, we will follow the priorities we've outlined for you since early 2015. First and foremost, we will fund the considerable opportunities provided by our existing products in our pipeline. Second, we will actively pursue opportunities to bolster our future growth prospects through business development. We should expect these efforts to be concentrated on our existing human pharma therapeutic areas and our animal health business. 
Finally, with the strength of our current business and pipeline, we plan to return to annual dividend increases for our shareholders beginning in December of this year and to return excess cash via share repurchase.
I hope this provide you with greater clarity on the progress we expect to make on our 4 strategic objectives through the end of this decade. 
Now let's move to this quarter's results. As I did last quarter, I'm going to use that same strategic objectives framework to summarize our progress. On our first strategic objective, grow revenue, we grew revenue 8% in the second quarter on a constant currency or performance basis. All of these performance growth was driven by volume. And in total, our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, Portrazza and Taltz, drove 6 percentage points of this volume growth. 
On our next strategic objective, expand margins, our non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue declined 90 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Excluding the $100 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca, our non-GAAP OpEx percent decreased nearly 3 percentage points. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance, which at the midpoint of our ranges, implies an improvement of 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue. 
Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, Taltz was approved in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. For the PSA indication, this marks the first time I can recall that a new indication was first approved in Japan. Kudos to our Japanese regulatory colleagues on this outstanding accomplishment. a monoclonal antibody from our ImClone acquisition, received priority review status here in the U.S. and an FDA Advisory Committee voted 12 to 11 that substantial evidence exists to establish that Jardiance reduces cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. During the call, we'll provide a more complete list of the pipeline progress we achieved over the last 3 months.
Lastly, on our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value, we completed a number of smaller deals to bolster both our human pharma and animal health businesses. We will continue to actively pursue additional external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects. 
And finally, during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend.
In summary, I'm confident that the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020, and I assure you that their achievement is a top priority for our entire management team. 
Now let's move on to a review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On a commercial front, earlier this month, we began initial launches of Taltz in Europe for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. And Elanco Animal Health launched Inteprity, a first-in-class animal-use only in-feed antibiotic approved for the prevention of necrotic enteritis, a significant and costly intestinal disease in poultry. Once again, it was a busy 3 months on the regulatory front.
In Japan, we received approval of Cyramza for 2 new indications, one in metastatic colorectal cancer and the other in non-small cell lung cancer. Also in Japan, as I just mentioned, we received approval for Taltz for both psoriasis and for psoriatic arthritis. 
Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received 2 FDA approvals for a once daily form of Jentadueto for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes and for a larger 80-unit We remain on track for a mid-December launch of 
The FDA determined that we met the requirements for pediatric exclusivity for Effient. Based on this decision by the FDA, Lilly has gained an additional 6 months of U.S. market exclusivity, with compound patent exclusivity now expiring in October 2017. 
In oncology, the FDA granted priority review for soft tissue sarcoma. As a result, we expect FDA action before the end of the year. And as I mentioned earlier, an FDA Advisory Committee voted 12 to 11 that substantial evidence exists to establish that Jardiance reduces cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Jardiance, as you know, is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly. 
On the clinical front, at ASCO, we presented results from the Phase II MONARCH 1 study of our CDK 4 and CDK 6 inhibitor in patients with hormone positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. The data showed single agent activity, as measured by objective response, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer patients for whom endocrine therapy was no longer a suitable treatment option. 
As Sue mentioned on our recent investor call to discuss this data, the interim Phase III read out for MONARCH 2 will occur in the near future. Given the close proximity of this read out to the final MONARCH 1 data, we expect to submit MONARCH 1 data to the FDA as early as later this quarter after the interim MONARCH 2 read out. 
Also at ASCO, along with Merck, we presented promising early-stage clinical data on the combination of with ALIMTA in frontline non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and of with Cyramza in the later lines of non-small cell lung cancer.
At ACR, along with we presented data with for in rheumatoid arthritis from the Phase III long-term extension study, RA beyond. Among other things, these data showed that was superior to placebo at inhibiting joint data -- at inhibiting joint damage. We continue to be pleased with the data generated on in RRA, and we look forward to regulatory action next year in the U.S., Europe and Japan.
At the American Diabetes Association, along with BI, we presented results from the Phase III Marlena trial demonstrating that Tradjenta, a DPP-4 inhibitor, reduced blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes who are at risk for kidney impairment with a renal safety profile similar to that seen in other trials. And from the outcome study, showing that Jardiance reduced the risk for new onset or worsening kidney disease by 39% versus placebo when added to standard of care in adults with type 2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease.
Also at ADA, we presented results from the AWARD 9 study showing that TRULICITY significantly reduced blood sugar and body weight as an add-on to compared glargine to placebo plus insulin glargine. 
In other news, Lilly and BI announced a collaboration to evaluate the safety and tolerability of in combination with BI 836845, Boehringer Ingelheim's insulin-like growth factor ligand neutralizing antibody in patients diagnosed with hormone receptor positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. And Elanco Animal Health announced a collaboration with EnBiotix to use EnBiotix technology to develop alternatives through traditional antibiotic therapies for animals.
We were pleased that the German Federal Supreme Court granted our appeal in the ALIMTA in patent case versus Actavis, vacating their prior decision denying infringement. This ruling supports our continuing belief that ALIMTA's regimen patent will be infringed by the entry of generic products, including alternative salt forms in Europe prior to June 2021. And the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted petition seeking inter partes review, or IPR, of our ALIMTA vitamin regimen patent. We expect final IPR written decision in mid-2017.
Finally, we did not repurchase any stock in the second quarter, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. During the quarter, however, we did distribute over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and returning excess cash to shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?"

Now let's look at our results for the second quarter. Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments today on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insight into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our second quarter GAAP results. 
Moving to non-GAAP measures on Slide 10, you can see the Q2 2016 revenue increased 9% compared to Q2 2015, reaching $5.4 billion.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 3.2 percentage points to 76%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in the benefit, both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year.
Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 50 basis points, going from 76.2% in last year's quarter to 75.7% this quarter, driven primarily by product mix.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 7% compared to Q2 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 1%, while R&D increased 14%.
The slight increase in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products, largely offset by lower spending on late life cycle products and lower litigation expenses. 
The increase in R&D expense was driven, primarily by higher late stage clinical development cost, including the $100 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca triggered by the transition to Phase III testing for the oral-based inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease, ACD 3293. This milestone payment added 8.5 percentage points to R&D expense growth and over 3.5 percentage points to total operating expense growth. 
Excluding this milestone payment, total OpEx increased just over 3%, which was substantially less than revenue growth. 
Other income and expense was income of $21 million this quarter, slightly less than the $29 million reported in last year's quarter. 
Our tax rate was 22.4%, an increase of 160 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to a net discreet tax benefit in last year's quarter of approximately $24 million, which lowered that quarter's tax rate by about 2 percentage points. In addition, this year's tax rate benefited from certain U.S. tax provision, including the R&D tax credit that are in force in '16, but had lapsed during last year's quarter. This was largely offset by the tax impact of an increased percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions this year compared to last year. 
At the bottom line, net income increased -- sorry, decreased 5%, and earnings per share decreased 4%. While will cover the effect of FX on our income statement in the subsequent slide, I would highlight that when excluding the effect of FX, non-GAAP EPS actually increased 4% this quarter. 
Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first half of the year, while Slide 12 provides a reconciliations between reported and non-GAAP EPS. And you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 25 and 26.
Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On Slide 13 in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 9% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. For the first quarter in quite a while, FX was not a headwind as a stronger yen offset weaker emerging markets currencies. As it did in Q1, on a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter, driven entirely by volume. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by volume. TRULICITY and Humalog were the main drivers of U.S. volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Cialis, Taltz, Jardiance, and TRADJENTA. 
Having completed the take back of North American rights for on October  1 of last year, we also benefited from booking and sales of The decline in revenue of 1% was driven by the negative effect of price, which was nearly offset by the positive effect of volume, and to a much lesser extent, FX. 
On a constant currency or performance basis, revenue decreased 2%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower price and volume for Cymbalta following patent expiration, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including TRULICITY, Cyramza, and Jardiance and higher sales of Humalog, TRADJENTA and Cialis. 
Excluding Cymbalta, sales increased 7% in constant currency terms. 
In Japan, the pharma revenue increased 21% in total, driven by mid-teens volume growth and an 11% benefit from a stronger yen, partially offset by a 7% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts. On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 10%. This performance growth was attributable to a number products, led by Cyramza, but also including Cymbalta, TRULICITY and TRADJENTA. 
Turning to emerging markets. We saw revenue decline 3%, driven by the negative effect of FX, which was partially offset by higher volume. On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue increased 5% due to volume growth from a number of products, most notably Humalog and TRULICITY, partially offset by continued sales erosion of off-patent brands, including ALIMTA, Cialis, and Cymbalta. 
Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China increased 15% or 23% on a constant currency basis. This quarter's growth rate did benefit from customer buying patterns in both last year's quarter and this quarter. We estimate the underlying demand for our products in China increase 5% in the second quarter.
Turning to animal health. We completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year, so year-on-year revenue growth comparisons are now on an apples-to-apples basis. This quarter, Elanco Animal Health revenue increased 2%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, Elanco revenue increased 4%. This performance increase was primarily driven by the uptake of new products, as well as by wholesaler buying patterns of U.S. companion animal product.
On Slide 14, you'll find the same price rate and volume analysis, but on a year-to-date basis. As I mentioned a moment ago, excluding FX from our worldwide revenue, our growth would have been 8% this quarter, within nearly all of that growth coming from higher volume. Our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz and were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. 
Slide 15 shows that these products drove over 6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. Humalog contributed nearly 2 percentage points of volume growth, while the take back of contributed nearly 1 percentage points of volume growth. 
You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and while largely in the rearview mirror, still provided a drag of roughly 1.7 percentage points on our volume growth. 
Finally, ALIMTA reduced our worldwide volume growth by nearly 1 percentage point this quarter. The major driver of the decline in worldwide ALIMTA volume was the U.S., where we've seen increasing competitive pressure from immuno-oncology agents, and to a lesser extent, from targeted agent. Notably, volume the EuCan was relatively flat this quarter, with the exception of the U.K. where we have begun to see generic competition. Now let me turn the call over to Derica."
285467,319564364,1012060,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil. As I did last quarter, I like to start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session both Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more details.

During the Q&A session both Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more details. 
As you can see on the graph on Slide 16, our new products generated $428 million in revenue this quarter, led by TRULICITY and Cyramza. This now represents about 8% of our total worldwide revenue.
And as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove 6 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter. Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan and Europe. And we look forward to continued growth in these markets, not only in gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications.
Sales in the U.S. declined slightly this quarter due to competition in non-small cell lung cancer, primarily from immuno-oncology agents. Sales outside of the U.S. now account for over half of Cyramza's global sales, with Japan making up nearly 1/3. 
TRULICITY continues to gain momentum globally. Here in the U.S., we're now capturing over 25% of new patient starts in the GLP-1 class, while in many OUS markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with when it launched. 
Of note, in Germany, TRULICITY is now the most prescribed GLP-1 brand for patients new to the class. 
In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the GLP-1 class, with the U.S. market growing 30%.
Another class that is showing rapid growth is the GLP-2 class where we see U.S. class growth in the 25% range. This is, however, below the class growth we'd expected to see. In the U.S. our therapy share with endocrinologists continues to increase, exceeding 35% in the most recent IMS data, as shown in our supplementary Slide 41. Outside the U.S., we've seen very strong uptake in Italy, with encouraging trends across all countries. 
In addition to the guideline update in Canada I mentioned last quarter, we've seen initial regulatory approvals of a CV indication for Jardiance in markets like Ecuador and Mexico, and we look forward to the FDA action later this year. 
We've now launched in a number of OUS countries. As I mentioned last quarter, in countries where local pricing authorization have produced a co-pay advantage, peer market performance been higher than our expectation. This includes markets like Japan, Poland and Slovakia.
In countries like Germany and Spain, where there isn't a co-pay advantage, we're running at an annualized share of the total basal edge of the market of 3% to 5%. 
In aggregate, we are pleased with our performance. Here in the U.S., as John mentioned earlier, we recently gained FDA approval of an 80-unit KwikPen and look forward to launching in mid-December. 
It's still early days for Portrazza, with the U.S. launch having occurred in December and the initial European launch is in April. In the U.S., we are encouraged that the vast majority of U.S. payers are now covering Portrazza, although we continue to see strong uptake of I/O agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is affecting Portrazza's uptake. Finally, our newest product, Taltz, launched in the U.S. in April and in Europe earlier this month. Early prescription data in the U.S. is encouraging. Given the recent approval in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis,we also look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall. 
Moving to Slide 17, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 8%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 12% outpaced revenue growth, due primarily to the negative effect of product mix.
Moving down the income statement, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating expenses grew slightly slower than revenue at 7%. Excluding the $100 million AVD 3293 milestone payment, non-GAAP operating expenses grew much more slowly than revenue at just 3.5%. 
Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 7%, while a higher tax rate and slightly lower other income led to a 4% increase in non-GAAP EPS. 
Moving on to our pipeline updates, Slide 18 shows our pipeline as of July 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. 
In our pipeline, we started Phase I testing for 4 molecules, including a inhibitor and a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody for cancer, a double for diabetes and a antibody for Alzheimer's disease. 
I would note that increasingly, even in areas outside of oncology, we are testing our molecules in patients in Phase I in addition to healthy volunteers. You'll also see that we terminated development of 2 Phase II molecules in noncore areas. 
In our pipeline, as shown on Slide 19, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received FDA approval of the once daily version of Jentadueto, as well as our first global approval for ixekizumab for psoriatic arthritis, which occurred in Japan, and we began Phase III testing for ixekizumab in Xbox.
You'll also see that we're showing for diabetic and for psoriasis as attrition, as we decided not to pursue these indications at this time. We will invest in additional indications for and have trials ongoing in atopic dermatitis and lupus. And you shouldn't be surprised to see more in the future. 
Turning to Slide 20, let's recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016.
Since our last call, we've added green checkmarks for the initiation of Phase III for ixekizumab and Xbox; the internal data read out at subsequent presentation at ASCO of detailed results from the Phase II MONARCH 1 trial of as a single agent treatment for advanced breast cancer; the presentation at ACR of data from the RA Beyond study of in RA; the presentation at ADA of the Marlena study of the approval of Taltz in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, the U.S. approval of once daily Jentadueto XR; and the favorable German Federal Supreme Court ALIMTA ruling. 
I also note that we now have a date, September 7, for the CAFC appeal hearing in our U.S. ALIMTA patent litigation. Given this timing, we could have a CAFC ruling before the end of the year. 
You'll also see that we've moved the ixekizumab head-to-head psoriasis trial versus through the potential Phase III data external disclosures section, as we now hope to present data from this trial at a scientific meeting this year. Also, 2 events we thought might occur in 2016 are now projected in 2017. The cluster headache read out for and the Phase III start for rapid insulin. 
Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on Slide 21, is a straightforward picture as you can possibly have. All GAAP and non-GAAP guidance line items, including EPS, remain unchanged for what we communicate in our Q1 earnings call in April. 
So in summary, 2016 is shaping up to be another strong year. Excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 8% this quarter, entirely driven by volume, with growing contributions from recently launched products, which this quarter, drove 6 of the 80 percentage points of our volume growth. We reduced OpEx as a percent of revenue compared to Q2 last year, and we remain on track for our full year reduction of 200 to 250 basis points. The strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy continued, with Taltz being approved in Japan, being granted priority review here in the U.S. and the FDA vote for Jardiance. We also completed early-stage deals in oncology to build-out possible combinations and in animal health, bolster our R&D efforts in finding alternatives to traditional antibiotics.
As John mentioned when he kicked off the call, our management team is committed to making steady progress against each of our strategic objectives in the coming years. Our success to date gives us increasing confidence in our ability to make contributions to medical progress, to meet or exceed our minimum midterm financial expectations and to create value for shareholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil?"

And, I guess, your question targets also then the different mechanisms we have across the industry today to influence component of Alzheimer's disease. And as you said, then binds monomeric free data, which has the intention then to prevent further of plaque but potentially, also then, have a sink affect. And in the expedition while --sorry, amyloid imaging in all patients, which means then we will also be able to follow actually if there is a change in the plaque deposits of in these patients after long term treatment. The other antibodies and are directed more towards the plaque in all summer patients and the difference here could be both related potentially then to the clinical effect, but also in particular, safety since has shown changes then in MRI suggesting brain edema as one of the components. And i think the early data on cognition for aducanumab clearly was a relatively small trial and needs to be confirmed in the longer and larger trial. The base inhibitors prevent formation of the and from the precursor protein EPP, having better brain penetration but also potentially then a different safety profile, which needs to be established in larger and longer trials. So I think it's hard to speculate actually about what's going to happen using these 3 agents, but I think what is clear is that it's very important to include only positive patients. It's also very important to start very early in the disease. It's also a key, in my view, to have local studies, which involve highly trained sites that can do these trials. Another aspect of the trial is also that we have imaging in a portion of patients. And as you know, is more related to the decline than on -- particularly the ADEA and here, we have another way potentially of showing them if there is disease modification. I think I leave today to talk about the cognition and functional endpoints and the potential outcomes there."

For as we described in the past, we've moved our primary endpoint to be cognition and then key secondary  endpoints, which will have control for type 1 error will be primarily the functional endpoints. I won't rehash why we did that, but I would just reinforce that our base planning scenario is that we achieved both significance on cognition and function, reminding everyone that the pooled data which we're trying to replicate and we've made improvements in the study in seeking to replicate past statistical significance on both function and cognition in that pooled subsector. So should we miss on that, look, I think we'll have to talk about that when we get there. Clinicians, in my experience, are interested in outcomes and they're interested in safety. And so Jan has covered a safety topic. We know is extremely well tolerated by patients. In fact, I can share that now that we have a majority of patients in EXPEDITION3 rolling off into the open label study, we're seeing a very similar effect from EXPEDITION1 and 2 and that 95% of patients are electing to continue on therapy, or in a blinded way, switch to therapy from their placebo. I think it's a very high number for that is a fragile population, reinforcing the tolerability of the medication. we'll have to wait until December to see the results and fully answer your question."

I think that Part D is a rare example of a government program that comes in, exceeding expectations at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars less than had been forecast at the beginning. The Congressional Budget Office has several times stated that if price controls are placed into Part D, the only way the government would save money in that event is to restrict access to drugs on the formulary.

As we said in our December 8th Investor Conference on Alzheimer's, we fully expect to get that study up and running this year and sort of rolling into the EXPEDITION3 rollout and have that under way. In terms of primary outcome, we've exposed that, which is going to be cognition as the primary endpoint, with key secondary endpoints of function just like EXPEDITION3. I think the general logic here is that the earlier you go in disease, the less meaningful functional changes are, and frankly, the more difficult they are to detect. So moving from only study like EXPEDITION3 and 2, the that's entirely logical. By the way, we've also made those changes in the BACE inhibitor programs in partnership with AZ. You second question, just to be clear, John, we've not announced a delay in the galcanezumab migraine program, but rather the cluster headache program, this was a kind of quasi-orphan speed play we announced in parallel with the migraine start. One of the studies, although enrolling well, is requires episodic cluster episodes to begin before we place patients on medication. We had to predict the rate at which patients would have episodic cluster headaches. I think we estimated too high. So we're waiting for people to have those episodes before we can begin treatment, and that's slowing down in that particular study. Although the chronic cluster study is on track timewise, so we'll have to make some decisions as we get closer to the end of the chronic cluster study about submission and labeling, et cetera, but the migraine study is on track, just to be clear."

When we -- when you look at our PRB slide, that's captured in our call materials, that is the true realized pricing effect that we're seeing rolling across our business. So you should expect on a go forward basis that it will still be on that same apples-to-apples. When you then think about the future patent expirations of Cialis and Strattera and brands like that, you will see it also parceled in the same manner. So when we again look at our business, and I think reflected in the results that you saw here in the second quarter, even in the midst of launching, we're focused on driving a volume-driven growth profile and the fact that we could achieve 8% volume growth this quarter and really relatively no price benefit, really speaks to our commentary around increased pricing pressures going forward."

That led to significant negative price impact the time we would ship that product people, and we would actually recognize the revenue later with no units against it, it would lead to a very large price increase. It really had nothing to do with price increases. So what has mentioned is for a while now, we've been treating our brand and an authorized generic total pot a so you no longer have those aberrations in unit price calculation, and it will be a true underlying price change, as Derica just mentioned.

But as I mentioned, with product through specialty pharmacy channels, it will take a while before we get really complete data there. So I just want to caution we can look at IMS a bit, but really, it's going to be when we see the actual script level data coming through to specialty pharmacy data flows that we'll have much more clarity. The feedback from physicians has been very positive. We're just hearing wonderful things about their experiences, with their patients in terms of their interactions with us. We think Taltz has a very attractive value proposition to our patients, to our physicians, to our payers, including our Taltz savings card, which I think is really for the thing for folks to know about is with this Taltz savings card that we've got out there, the patients will pay as little as $5 a month if they're commercially insured and are covered by their insurance. And if they're commercially insured and are not covered by their insurance and have filed that script, has that denied, and filed an appeal and had it denied, they will pay no more than $25 a month.

Now we did call out the fact that we don't -- does not contemplate major changes in government reimbursement policy. It does contemplate ALIMTA continuing to be packed and protected in the U.S. through the early '20s.

Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me today in the room are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Biomedicine; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of our Elanco Animal Health Business; and Ilissa Rassner, Christina Wright, Brad Robling, Chris Ogden, and Bill Johnson of Lilly's IR team. 
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The Information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Before we dive into this quarter's activities and financial results, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks at a more strategic level. 18 months ago, our guidance call in January 2015, as we emerged from the series of patent expirations we referred to as the YZ period, we described refinements to our innovation-based strategy as well as our key strategic objectives for the remainder of the decade.
Those 4 strategic objectives were: grow revenue; expand margin; sustain the flow of innovation; and deploy capital to create value.
I'd like to provide a bit more detail than we have in the past on our future expectations for each of these objectives, starting with the ""sustain the flow of innovation. "" At our meeting in Boston last December, we discussed in great detail both our animal health business and our comprehensive Alzheimer's disease R&D efforts. We followed that up at our meeting this past May, where we took an in-depth look at our R&D efforts in diabetes, oncology, immunology and pain. Between these 2 meetings, we hope you've gained a greater appreciation for the significant future growth opportunities we see in each of our human pharma focus areas as well as in Elanco Animal Health. 
As an innovation-based pharmaceutical company, our future growth prospects determined by the flow of innovation from our pipeline. As we discussed in our R&D meeting in May, we believe we've made substantial progress building an R&D engine that can sustain a flow of innovation to support our growth aspirations. Over a 10-year period, starting in 2014, we believe we can launch 20 or more new medicine. These 20 launches span the 5 therapeutic areas we focused on: diabetes, oncology, neuro degeneration, immunology and pain. And the revenue growth from these new product launches will be reinforced by new indications and line extension, which on average could number 2 per year.
So how do we see this translating into revenue growth for the balance of this decade? Having already launched 6 products in the past 2 years with more launches possible in the next few years, we expect to generate robust revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, despite facing a number of significant patent expirations. To provide a floor for our expectations, we've analyzed a range of scenarios for clinical, regulatory and commercial success. Based on this analysis, we expect annual revenue growth over this period to average at least 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher volume not price.  And we certainly see scenarios for clinical, regulatory and commercial success that would drive revenue growth significantly higher than its minimum expectation.
I would point out that our revenue growth expectations do assume increased price pressure in the U.S. but do not include any significant government action on Medicare Part D, for example. And also assume that we maintain ALIMTA patent exclusivity in the U.S. throughout the period. 
With regard to our margins, we remain on track to achieve our goal of reducing operating expenses, sum of R&D and SG&A to 50% of revenue or less in 2018. And when excluding foreign exchange, we expect to increase gross margin as a percent of revenue over the remainder of this decade. 
Finally, on deploying capital to create value, we will follow the priorities we've outlined for you since early 2015. First and foremost, we'll fund the considerable opportunities provided by our existing products in our pipeline. Second, we will actively pursue opportunities to bolster our future growth prospects through business development. You should expect these efforts to be concentrated on our existing human pharma therapeutic areas and our animal health business. 
Finally, with the strength of our current business and pipeline, we plan to return to annual dividend increases to our shareholders beginning in December of this year and to return excess cash via share repurchase.
I hope this provide you with greater clarity on the progress we expect to make on our 4 strategic objectives through the end of this decade. 
Now let's move to this quarter's results. As I did last quarter, I'm going to use that same strategic objectives framework to summarize our progress. On our first strategic objective, grow revenue, we grew revenue 8% in the second quarter on a constant currency or performance basis. All of this performance growth was driven by volume. And in total, our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Portrazza and Taltz drove 6 percentage points of this volume growth. 
On our next strategic objective, expand margins. Our non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue declined 90 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Excluding the $100 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca, our non-GAAP OpEx percent decreased nearly 3 percentage points. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance, which at the midpoint of our ranges implies an improvement of 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue. 
Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, Taltz was approved in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. For the PSA indication, this marks the first time I can recall that a new indication was first approved in Japan. Kudos to our Japanese regulatory colleagues on this outstanding accomplishment. Olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody from our ImClone acquisition received priority review status here in the U.S, and an FDA Advisory Committee voted 12 to 11 that substantial evidence exists to establish that Jardiance reduces cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. During the call, we'll provide a more complete list of the pipeline progress we achieved over the last 3 months.
Lastly, on our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value, we completed a number of smaller deals to bolster both our human pharma and animal health businesses. We will continue to actively pursue additional external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects. 
And finally, during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend.
In summary, I'm confident that the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020. And I assure you that their achievement is a top priority for our entire management team. 
Now let's move on to review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On a commercial front, earlier this month, we began initial launches of Taltz in Europe for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. And Elanco Animal Health launched Inteprity, a first-in-class animal-use only in-feed antibiotic approved for the prevention of necrotic enteritis, a significant and costly intestinal disease in poultry. Once again, it was a busy 3 months on the regulatory front.
In Japan, we received approval of Cyramza for 2 new indications, one in metastatic colorectal cancer and the other in non-small cell lung cancer. Also in Japan, as I just mentioned, we received approval for Taltz for both psoriasis and for psoriatic arthritis. 
Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received 2 FDA approvals for a once daily form of Jentadueto for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes and for a larger 80-unit Basaglar KwikPen. We remain on track for a mid-December launch of Basaglar.
The FDA determined that we met the requirements for pediatric exclusivity for Effient. Based on this decision by the FDA, Lilly has gained an additional 6 months of U.S. market exclusivity with compound patent exclusivity now expiring in October 2017. 
In oncology, the FDA granted priority review for olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma. As a result, we expect FDA action before the end of the year. And as I mentioned earlier, an FDA Advisory Committee voted 12 to 11 that substantial evidence exists to establish the Jardiance reduces cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Jardiance, as you know, is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly. 
On the clinical front, at ASCO, we presented results from the Phase II MONARCH 1 study of our abemaciclib, our CDK 4 and CDK 6 inhibitor in patients with hormone positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. The data showed single agent activity, as measured by objective response, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer patients for whom endocrine therapy was no longer a suitable treatment option. 
As Sue mentioned on our recent investor call to discuss this data, the interim Phase III read out for MONARCH 2 will occur in the near future. Given the close proximity of this read out to the final MONARCH 1 data, we expect to submit MONARCH 1 data to the FDA as early as later this quarter after the interim MONARCH 2 read out. 
Also at ASCO, along with Merck, we presented promising early-stage clinical data on the combination of with KEYTRUDA with ALIMTA in frontline non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and of KEYTRUDA with Cyramza in the later lines of non-small cell lung cancer.
At ACR, along with Incyte, we presented data for baricitinib and rheumatoid arthritis from the Phase III long-term extension study, RA Beyond. Among other things, these data show that baricitinib was superior to placebo at inhibiting joint data -- at inhibiting joint damage. We continue to be pleased with the data generated on baricitinib in RA, and we look forward the regulatory action next year in the U.S., Europe and Japan.
At the American Diabetes Association, along with BI, we presented results from the Phase III Marlena trial demonstrating that Trajenta, a DPP-4 inhibitor, reduced blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes who are at risk for kidney impairment with a renal safety profile similar to that seen in other trials. And from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, showing that Jardiance reduced the risk for new onset or worsening kidney disease by 39% versus placebo when added to standard of care in adults with type 2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease.
Also at ADA, we presented results from the AWARD-9 study showing that TRULICITY significantly reduced blood sugar and body weight as an add-on insulin glargine compared to placebo plus insulin glargine. 
In other news, Lilly and BI announced a collaboration to evaluate the safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in combination with BI 836845, Boehringer Ingelheim's insulin-like growth factor ligand neutralizing antibody in patients diagnosed with hormone receptor positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. And Elanco Animal Health announced a collaboration with EnBiotix to use EnBiotix technology to develop alternatives through traditional antibiotic therapies for animals.
We were pleased that the German Federal Supreme Court granted our appeal in the Alimta patent case versus Actavis vacating the prior decision denying infringement. This ruling supports our continuing belief that Alimta's vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by the entry of generic pemetrexed products, including alternative soft forms in Europe prior to June 2021. And the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted petitions seeking Inter Partes Review or IPR of our Alimta vitamin regimen patent. We expect final IPR written decision in mid-2017.
Finally, we did not repurchase any stock in the second quarter, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. During the quarter, however, we did distribute over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and returning excess cash to shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?"
285467,319564364,1012424,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, John. Slide 8 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. Now let's look at our results for the second quarter. Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments today on our non-GAAP adjusted m",1235,"Great. Thanks, John. Slide 8 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. 
Now let's look at our results for the second quarter. Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments today on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insight into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our second quarter GAAP results. 
Moving to non-GAAP measures on Slide 10, you can see that Q2 2016 revenue increased 9% compared to Q2 2015, reaching $5.4 billion.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 3.2 percentage points to 76%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in the benefit both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year.
Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 50 basis points going from 76.2% in last year's quarter to 75.7% this quarter, driven primarily by product mix.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 7% compared to Q2 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 1%, while R&D increased 14%.
The slight increase in marketing, selling, administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products, largely offset by lower spending on late life cycle products and lower litigation expenses. 
The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late stage clinical development cost, including the $100 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca triggered by the transition to Phase III testing for the oral-based inhibitor of Alzheimer's disease, AZD3293. This milestone payment added 8.5 percentage points to R&D expense growth and over 3.5 percentage points to total operating expense growth. 
Excluding this milestone payment, total OpEx increased just over 3%, which was substantially less than revenue growth. 
Other income and expense was income of $21 million this quarter, slightly less than the $29 million reported in last year's quarter. 
Our tax rate was 22.4%, an increase of 160 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to a net discrete tax benefit in last year's quarter of approximately $24 million, which lowered that quarter's tax rate by about 2 percentage points. In addition, this year's tax rate benefited from certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit that are in force in '16, but had lapsed during last year's quarter. This was largely offset by the tax impact of an increased percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions this year compared to last year. 
At the bottom line, net income increased -- sorry, decreased 5%, and earnings per share decreased 4%. While Derica will cover the effect of FX on our income statement in a subsequent slide, I would highlight that when excluding the effect of FX, non-GAAP EPS actually increased 4% this quarter. 
Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first half of the year, while Slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. And you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 25 and 26.
Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On Slide 13 in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 9% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. For the first quarter in quite a while, FX was not a headwind as a stronger yen offset weaker emerging markets currencies. As it did in Q1, on a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter, driven entirely by volume. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by volume. TRULICITY and Humalog were the main drivers of U.S. volume growth with meaningful contributions also coming from Cialis, Taltz, Jardiance, HUMULIN and Trajenta. 
Having completed the take back of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1 of last year, we also benefited from booking and sales of Erbitux. The decline in EuCan revenue of 1% was driven by the negative effect of price, which was nearly offset by the positive effect of volume, and to a much lesser extent, FX. 
On a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 2%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower price and volume for Cymbalta following patent expiration, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including TRULICITY, Cyramza, Basaglar and Jardiance and higher sales of Humalog, Trajenta and Cialis. 
Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased to 7% in constant currency terms. 
In Japan, the pharma revenue increased 21% in total, driven by mid-teens volume growth and an 11% benefit from a stronger yen, partially offset by a 7% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts. On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 10%. This performance growth was attributable to a number of products led by Cyramza, but also including Cymbalta, Strattera, Basaglar, TRULICITY and Trajenta. 
Turning to emerging markets. We saw revenue decline of 3%, driven by the negative effect of FX, which was partially offset by higher volume. On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue increased 5% due to volume growth from a number of products, most notably Humalog and TRULICITY, partially offset by continued sales erosion of off-patent brands, including Alimta, Cialis, Zyprexa and Cymbalta. 
Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China increased 15% or 23% on a constant currency basis. This quarter's growth rate did benefit from customer buying patterns in both last year's quarter and this quarter. We estimate that underlying demand for our products in China increased 5% in the second quarter.
Turning to Animal Health. We completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year, so year-on-year revenue growth comparisons are now on an apples-to-apples basis. This quarter, Elanco Animal Health revenue increased 2%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, Elanco revenue increased 4%. This performance increase was primarily driven by the uptake of new products, as well as by wholesaler buying patterns of U.S. companion animal product.
On Slide 14, you'll find the same price rate and volume analysis, but on a year-to-date basis. As I mentioned a moment ago, excluding FX from our worldwide revenue, our growth would have been 8% this quarter, with nearly all of that growth coming from higher volume. Our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar and Portrazza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. 
Slide 15 shows that these products drove over 6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. Humalog contributed nearly 2 percentage points of volume growth, while the take back of Erbitux contributed nearly 1 percentage point of volume growth. 
You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror still provided a drag of roughly 1.7 percentage points on our volume growth. 
Finally, Alimta reduced our worldwide volume growth by nearly 1 percentage point this quarter. The major driver of the decline in worldwide Alimta volume was the U.S., where we've seen increasing competitive pressure from a immuno-oncology agents, and to a lesser extent, from targeted agents. Notably, Alimta volume across the EuCan was relatively flat this quarter with the exception of the U.K., where we have begun to see generic competition. 
Now let me turn the call over to Derica."
285467,319564364,1012424,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil. As I did last quarter, I like to start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session both Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more details. As you can see on the graph on Slide 16, our new products generated $428",1397,"Thanks, Phil. As I did last quarter, I like to start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session both Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more details. 
As you can see on the graph on Slide 16, our new products generated $428 million in revenue this quarter led by TRULICITY and Cyramza. This now represents about 8% of our total worldwide revenue.
And as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove 6 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter. Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan and Europe. And we look forward to continue growth in these markets, not only in gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications.
Sales in the U.S. declined slightly this quarter due to competition in non-small cell lung cancer, primarily from immuno-oncology agents. Sales outside of the U.S. now account for over half of Cyramza's global sales with Japan making up nearly 1/3. 
TRULICITY continues to gain momentum globally. Here in the U.S., we're now capturing over 25% of new patient starts in the GLP-1 class, while in many OUS markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with Victoza, when it launched. 
Of note, in Germany, TRULICITY is now the most prescribed GLP-1 brand for patients new to the class. 
In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the GLP-1 class, with the U.S. market growing 30%.
Another class that is showing rapid growth is the SGLT-2 class, where we see U.S. class growth in the 25% range. This is, however, below the class growth we had expected to see. In the U.S., our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists continues to increase exceeding 35% in the most recent IMS data, as shown in our supplementary Slide 41. Outside the U.S., we've seen very strong uptake in Italy with encouraging trends across all countries. 
In addition to the guideline update in Canada, I mentioned last quarter, we've seen initial regulatory approvals of a CV indication for Jardiance in markets like Ecuador and Mexico, and we look forward to the FDA action later this year. 
We've now launched A-Basaglar in a number of OUS countries. As I mentioned last quarter, in countries where local pricing authorization have produced a co-pay advantage, peer market performance has been higher than our expectation. This includes markets like Japan, Poland and Slovakia.
In countries like Germany and Spain, where there isn't a co-pay advantage, we're running on an annualized share of the total basal insulin market of 3% to 5%. 
In aggregate, we are pleased with our performance. Here in the U.S., as John mentioned earlier, we recently gained FDA approval of an 80-unit KwikPen and look forward to launching Basaglar in mid-December. 
It's still early days for Portrazza, with the U.S. launch having occurred in December, and the initial European launch is in April. In the U.S., we are encouraged that the vast majority of U.S. payers are now covering Portrazza, although we continue to see strong uptake of I/O agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is affecting Portrazza's uptake. Finally, our newest product, Taltz, launched in the U.S. in April, and in Europe earlier this month. Early prescription data in the U.S. is encouraging. Given the recent approval in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, we also look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall. 
Moving to Slide 17, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 8%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 12% outpaced revenue growth, due primarily to the negative effect of product mix.
Moving down the income statement, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating expenses grew slightly slower than revenue at 7%. Excluding the $100 million AZD3293 milestone payment, non-GAAP operating expenses grew much more slowly than revenue at just 3.5%. 
Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 7%, while a higher tax rate and slightly lower other income led to a 4% increase in non-GAAP EPS. 
Moving onto our pipeline updates, Slide 18 shows our pipeline as of July 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. 
In our NME pipeline, we started Phase I testing for 4 molecules, including a CHK1 inhibitor and a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody for cancer, a double incretin mimetic for diabetes and a tau antibody for Alzheimer's disease. 
I would note that increasingly, even in areas outside of oncology, we are testing our molecules in patients in Phase I in addition to healthy volunteers. You'll also see that we terminated development of 2 Phase II molecules in noncore areas. 
In our NILEX pipeline, as shown on Slide 19, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received FDA approval of the once daily version of Jentadueto, as well as our first global approval for ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis, which occurred in Japan, and we began Phase III testing for ixekizumab in sPGA
You'll also see that we're showing baricitinib for diabetic nephropathy and for psoriasis [indiscernible], as we decided not to pursue these indications at this time. We will invest in additional indications for baricitinib, and have trials ongoing in atopic dermatitis and lupus. And you shouldn't be surprised to see more in the future. 
Turning to Slide 20, let's recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016.
Since our last call, we've added green checkmarks for the initiation of Phase III for ixekizumab and sPGA; the internal data read out as subsequent presentation at ASCO of detailed results from the Phase II MONARCH 1 trial of bemaciclib as a single agent treatment for advanced breast cancer; the presentation at ACR of data from the RA Beyond study baricitinib in RA; the presentation at ADA of the Marlena study of linagliptin; the approval of Taltz in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, the U.S. approval of once daily Jentadueto XR; and the favorable German Federal Supreme Court Alimta ruling. 
I'd also note that we now have a date, September 7 for the CAFC appeal hearing in our U.S. Alimta patent litigation. Given this timing, we could have a CAFC ruling before the end of the year. 
You'll also see that we've moved the ixekizumab head-to-head psoriasis trial versus [indiscernible] through the potential Phase III data external disclosures section, as we now hope to present data from this trial at a scientific meeting this year. Also, 2 events we thought might occur in 2016 are now projected in 2017. The cluster headache read out for and galcanezumab and the Phase III start for our ultra rapid insulin. 
Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on Slide 21, is as straightforward a picture as you could possibly have. All GAAP and non-GAAP guidance line items, including EPS, remain unchanged from what we communicated on our Q1 earnings call in April. 
So in summary, 2016 is shaping up to be another strong year. Excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 8% this quarter, entirely driven by volume, with growing contributions from recently launched products, which this quarter drove 6 of 8 percentage points of our volume growth. We reduced OpEx as a percent of revenue compared to Q2 last year, and we remain on track for our full year reduction of 200 to 250 basis points. The strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy continued with Taltz being approved in Japan, olaratumab being granted priority review here in the U.S., and the FDA adcom vote for Jardiance.

And in animal health, to bolster our R&D efforts and finding alternatives to traditional antibiotics.
As John mentioned, when he kicked off the call, our management team is committed to making steady progress against each of our strategic objectives in the coming years. Our success to-date gives us increasing confidence in our ability to make contributions to medical progress, to meet or exceed our minimum mid-term financial expectations, and to create value for shareholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil?"

Clearly, Sola is targeting [indiscernible] forms of A-beta, along with its peripheral sync mechanism clearly differentiates it from bids aducanumab. Now the theory being that Solo can almost potentially act like a base inhibitor by preventing the accumulation of plaque versus simply clearing it from the brain. So my question is, if in the event that Solo does not hit its functional endpoint in EXPEDITION3 but does get FDA approval, can you comment on how it could compete with aducanumab and base inhibitors in the marketplace? And just a totally unrelated question after that, just if you could kindly comment on the disparity between cardiologists and endocrinologists voting ways in the Jardiance adcom, and what that could potentially mean for the label change in treatment guidelines?"

And, I guess, your question targets also then the different mechanist we have across the industry today to influence on the amyloid component of Alzheimer's disease. And as you said, solanezumab then binds monomeric free data amyloid data, which has the intention then to prevent further buildup for plaque, but potentially, also then, have a peripheral sync affect. And in the Expedition trial, if there is now tau or sorry, amyloid imaging in all patients, which means then we will also be able to follow actually if there is a change in the plaque deposits of amyloid in these patients after long-term solanezumab treatment. The other antibodies than aducanumab are directed more towards the plaque of -- in Alzheimer's patients and the difference here could be both related potentially then to the clinical effect, but also in particular, safety since aducanumab has shown changes then in MRI suggesting brain edema as one of the components. And I think the early data on cognition et cetera for aducanumab clearly was a relatively small trial and needs to be confirmed in the longer and larger trial. The base inhibitors prevent formation of the amyloid and from the precursor protein APP, having better brain penetration but also potentially then a different safety profile, which needs to be established in larger and longer trials. So I think it's hard to speculate actually about what's going to happen using these 3 agents, but I think what is clear is that it is very important to include only positive patients. It's also very important to start very early in the disease. It's also a key, in my view, to have local studies, which involve some highly trained sites that can do these trials. Another aspect of the sola trial is also that we have tau imaging in proportion of patients. And as you know, tau is more related to the decline than on -- particularly the ADAS-Cog, and here we have another way potentially of showing them if there is disease modification. I think, I'll leave it to Dave to talk about the cognition and functional endpoints and the potential outcomes there."

So as we described in the past, we've moved our primary endpoint to be cognition and then key secondary  endpoints, which will have control for type 1 error will be primarily the functional endpoints. I won't rehash why we did that, but I would just reinforce that our base planning scenario is that we achieved both significance on cognition and function, reminding everyone that the pooled mild data, which we're trying to replicate, and we've made improvements in the study, and seeking to replicate past statistical significance on both function and cognition in that pooled mild subset. So should we miss on that, look, I think we'll have to talk about that when we get there. Clinicians, in my experience, are interested in outcomes and they're interested in safety. And so Jan has covered the safety topic. We know solanezumab is extremely well tolerated by patients. In fact, I can share that now that we have a majority of patients in EXPEDITION3 rolling off into the open label study. We're seeing a very similar effect from EXPEDITION1 and 2 and that 95% of patients are electing to continue on therapy or in a blinded way switch to therapy from their placebo. I think it's a very high number for what is a fragile and elderly population reinforcing the tolerability of the medication. We'll have to wait till December to see the results and fully answer your question."

The Congressional Budget Office has several times stated that if price controls are placed into Part D, the only way the government would save money in that event is to restrict access to drugs on the formulary. Today, most seniors have access through the private plans, to the whole formulary, and that's why senior satisfaction rates are so high.

So for the sola prodromal study, we're anticipating enrolling patients sort of soon. As we said in our December 8 Investor Conference on Alzheimer's, we fully expect to get that study up and running this year and sort of rolling into the EXPEDITION3 rollout and have that under way. In terms of primary outcome, we've exposed that, which is going to be cognition as the primary endpoint with key secondary endpoints of function just like EXPEDITION3. I think the general logic here is that the earlier you go in disease, the less meaningful functional changes are and frankly, the more difficult they are to detect. So moving from a mild-only study like EXPEDITION3 and 2, the prodromal, that's entirely logical. By the way, we've also made those changes in the BACE inhibitor programs in partnership with AZ. Your second question, just to be clear, John, we've not announced a delay in the galcanezumab migraine program but rather the cluster headache program. This was a kind of quasi-orphan speed play we announced in parallel with the migraine start. One of the studies, although enrolling well, is -- requires episodic cluster episodes to begin before we place patients on medication. We had to predict the rate at which patients would have episodic cluster headaches. I think we estimated too high. So we're waiting for people to have those episodes before we can begin treatment, and that's slowing down that particular study, although the chronic cluster study is on track time-wise.

When we -- when you look at our PRB slide, that's captured in our call materials, that is the true realized pricing effect that we're seeing rolling across our business. So you should expect on a go-forward basis that it will still be on that same apples-to-apples. When you then think about the future patent expirations of Cialis and Strattera and brands like that, you will see it also parceled in the same manner. So when we, again, look at our business, and I think that's pretty much reflected in the results that you saw here in the second quarter, even in the midst of launching, we're focused on driving a volume-driven growth profile. And the fact that we could achieve 8% volume growth this quarter and really relatively no price benefit, really speaks to our commentary around increased pricing pressures going forward."

That led to significant negative price impact at the time we would ship that product. When we'd actually recognize the revenue later with no units against it, it would lead to a very large price increase. It really had nothing to do with price increases. So what Derica has mentioned is for a while now, we've been treating our brand and an authorized generic as totally separate products so you no longer have those aberrations in unit price calculation, and it will be a true underlying price change, as Derica just mentioned. Hopefully, that helped skew some context where you might have seen in the past and what you will see -- have seen recently and will see going forward."

As you mentioned, it's still very early, especially with the specialty biologic like this in terms of the data flows and information that we would get. But thus far, we're very pleased with the initial performance of Taltz. If you look, for instance, at the IMS New to Brand NPA, just dermatology specialty focused data, we're bouncing around right at the Enbrel New to Brand level. We're closing in very closely on the COSENTYX New to Brand among derms there. Revenue in the second quarter totaled $19 million. A portion of that was wholesale stocking in there. But as I mentioned, with specialty products filling through specialty pharmacy channels, it will take a while before we get really complete data there. So I just want to caution that with IMS -- we can look at IMS a bit, but really, it's going to be when we see the actual script level data coming through the specialty pharmacy data flows that we'll have much more clarity. The feedback from physicians has been very positive. We're just hearing wonderful things anecdotally about their experiences with their patients in terms of their interactions with us. We think Taltz has a very attractive value proposition to our patients, to our physicians, to our payers, including our Taltz savings card, which I think is really important thing for folks to know about is with this Taltz savings card that we've got out there, the patients will pay as little as $5 a month if they're commercially insured and covered by their insurance. And if they're commercially insured and are not covered by their insurance and have filed the script, had that denied and filed an appeal and had it denied, they will pay no more than $25 a month. This really removes a prescribing burden and hurdle for the physician, for the patient and the doctor's office in getting people initiated on the medicine. So right now, everything seems to be positive from the experience but in a wait-and-see mode. Thank you."

All of these warnings or strengthened warnings come. We solve that counterbalance where today we cannot -- we're unable to promote our CV data until we basically get our label updated.

When we look at the class in general, the class is growing year-to-date over 30%, and one can say that seems like a very good growth.

We're excited about the galcanezumab program, which is the new name for CGRP antibody. Putting aside the cluster, which, again, has possibility to get to market earlier, although we have, as was mentioned earlier, a slowdown in the episodic cluster study. As it relates to migraine, we remain excited about the profile. It is very competitive, as you mentioned. There's at least 3 players kind of neck and neck from our read, execution and enrollment, and getting the studies complete is important. You'll see in ClinicalTrials.gov we've actually closed the submission-gating study, the critical pass study, which was the long-term safety study already. So that puts us on a good path to remain on track. Ultimately, I think the product profile will need to achieve the maximum effect possible via this mechanism with the minimally intrusive administration for patients. This will be a product used by healthy people in primary care offices and everyday neurologists. Simple injection and dosing protocols coupled with a very strong effect will win. That sounds kind of boiler plate, but I think we're testing a couple different dosing setups, others are testing different ones. But we'll just have to see who can produce the best numbers with the minimum doses. And I think that's what we'll be looking for as we read out the data sometime late next year."

So there's still some -- I guess some big unknowns up ahead, coupled with the sure patent losses that we're going to experience with products like Cialis and Strattera, for example. So while there's still a lot of moving parts, I think similar to sort of the guidance we provided back in late 2009, we were entering this patent expiration period, we want to provide some floor, some minimum set of expectations for investors recognizing that there are scenarios that could take that above that floor. Now we did call out the fact that we don't -- does not contemplate major changes in government reimbursement policy. It does contemplate ALIMTA continuing to be patent protected in the U.S. through the early '20s.

We recently have changed the design of our copy card so it's less generous than it used to be, but that takes a little bit of time to basically wash out. So we should expect an improving picture when it comes to that. In terms of Trulicity, we do have an interim later this year. It's -- clearly, we've all seen the LEADER data. Probably the best way to think about the interim for Trulicity, but if we were to expect a similar -- were to observe a similar hazard ratio versus what LEADER showed, we will not stop the trial. So given that we have -- we're going to have a significantly less number of events that basically Novo had at the conclusion of their own trial.

Going forward, it's really going to be dependent on the nature of the molecules and which ones are launching at what time.

Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me today in the room are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lund",2069,"Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me today in the room are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Biomedicine; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of our Elanco Animal Health Business; and Ilissa Rassner, Christina Wright, Brad Robling, Chris Ogden, and Bill Johnson of Lilly's IR team. 
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The Information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Before we dive into this quarter's activities and financial results, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks at a more strategic level. 18 months ago, on our guidance call in January 2015, as we emerged from the series of patent expirations we referred to as the YZ period, we described refinements to our innovation-based strategy as well as our key strategic objectives for the remainder of the decade.
Those 4 strategic objectives were: grow revenue; expand margin; sustain the flow of innovation; and deploy capital to create value.
I'd like to provide a bit more detail than we have in the past on our future expectations for each of these objectives, starting with the ""sustain the flow of innovation. At our meeting in Boston last December, we discussed in great detail both our animal health business and our comprehensive Alzheimer's disease R&D efforts. We followed that up at our meeting this past May, where we took an in-depth look at our R&D efforts in diabetes, oncology, immunology and pain. Between these 2 meetings, we hope you've gained a greater appreciation for the significant future growth opportunities we see in each of our human pharma focus areas as well as in Elanco Animal Health. 
As an innovation-based pharmaceutical company, our future growth prospects determined by the flow of innovation from our pipeline. As we discussed in our R&D meeting in May, we believe we've made substantial progress building an R&D engine that can sustain a flow of innovation to support our growth aspirations. Over a 10-year period, starting in 2014, we believe we can launch 20 or more new medicine. These 20 launches span the 5 therapeutic areas we focused on: diabetes, oncology, neuro degeneration, immunology and pain. And the revenue growth from these new product launches will be reinforced by new indications and line extension, which on average could number 2 per year.
So how do we see this translating into revenue growth for the balance of this decade? Having already launched 6 products in the past 2 years with more launches possible in the next few years, we expect to generate robust revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, despite facing a number of significant patent expirations. To provide a floor for our expectations, we've analyzed a range of scenarios for clinical, regulatory and commercial success. Based on this analysis, we expect annual revenue growth over this period to average at least 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher volume not price.  And we certainly see scenarios for clinical, regulatory and commercial success that would drive revenue growth significantly higher than its minimum expectation.
I would point out that our revenue growth expectations do assume increased price pressure in the U.S. but do not include any significant government action on Medicare Part D, for example. And also assume that we maintain ALIMTA patent exclusivity in the U.S. throughout the period. 
With regard to our margins, we remain on track to achieve our goal of reducing operating expenses, sum of R&D and SG&A to 50% of revenue or less in 2018. And when excluding foreign exchange, we expect to increase gross margin as a percent of revenue over the remainder of this decade. 
Finally, on deploying capital to create value, we will follow the priorities we've outlined for you since early 2015. First and foremost, we'll fund the considerable opportunities provided by our existing products in our pipeline. Second, we will actively pursue opportunities to bolster our future growth prospects through business development. You should expect these efforts to be concentrated on our existing human pharma therapeutic areas and our animal health business. 
Finally, with the strength of our current business and pipeline, we plan to return to annual dividend increases to our shareholders beginning in December of this year and to return excess cash via share repurchase.
I hope this provide you with greater clarity on the progress we expect to make on our 4 strategic objectives through the end of this decade. 
Now let's move to this quarter's results. As I did last quarter, I'm going to use that same strategic objectives framework to summarize our progress. On our first strategic objective, grow revenue, we grew revenue 8% in the second quarter on a constant currency or performance basis. All of this performance growth was driven by volume. And in total, our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Portrazza and Taltz drove 6 percentage points of this volume growth. 
On our next strategic objective, expand margins. Our non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue declined 90 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Excluding the $100 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca, our non-GAAP OpEx percent decreased nearly 3 percentage points. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance, which at the midpoint of our ranges implies an improvement of 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue. 
Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, Taltz was approved in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. For the PSA indication, this marks the first time I can recall that a new indication was first approved in Japan. Kudos to our Japanese regulatory colleagues on this outstanding accomplishment. Olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody from our ImClone acquisition received priority review status here in the U.S, and an FDA Advisory Committee voted 12 to 11 that substantial evidence exists to establish that Jardiance reduces cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. During the call, we'll provide a more complete list of the pipeline progress we achieved over the last 3 months.
Lastly, on our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value, we completed a number of smaller deals to bolster both our human pharma and animal health businesses. We will continue to actively pursue additional external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects. 
And finally, during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend.
In summary, I'm confident that the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020. And I assure you that their achievement is a top priority for our entire management team. 
Now let's move on to review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On a commercial front, earlier this month, we began initial launches of Taltz in Europe for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. And Elanco Animal Health launched Inteprity, a first-in-class animal-use only in-feed antibiotic approved for the prevention of necrotic enteritis, a significant and costly intestinal disease in poultry. Once again, it was a busy 3 months on the regulatory front.
In Japan, we received approval of Cyramza for 2 new indications, one in metastatic colorectal cancer and the other in non-small cell lung cancer. Also in Japan, as I just mentioned, we received approval for Taltz for both psoriasis and for psoriatic arthritis. 
Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received 2 FDA approvals for a once daily form of Jentadueto for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes and for a larger 80-unit Basaglar KwikPen. We remain on track for a mid-December launch of Basaglar.
The FDA determined that we met the requirements for pediatric exclusivity for Effient. Based on this decision by the FDA, Lilly has gained an additional 6 months of U.S. market exclusivity with compound patent exclusivity now expiring in October 2017. 
In oncology, the FDA granted priority review for olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma. As a result, we expect FDA action before the end of the year. And as I mentioned earlier, an FDA Advisory Committee voted 12 to 11 that substantial evidence exists to establish the Jardiance reduces cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Jardiance, as you know, is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly. 
On the clinical front, at ASCO, we presented results from the Phase II MONARCH 1 study of our abemaciclib, our CDK 4 and CDK 6 inhibitor in patients with hormone positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. The data showed single agent activity, as measured by objective response, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer patients for whom endocrine therapy was no longer a suitable treatment option. 
As Sue mentioned on our recent investor call to discuss this data, the interim Phase III read out for MONARCH 2 will occur in the near future. Given the close proximity of this read out to the final MONARCH 1 data, we expect to submit MONARCH 1 data to the FDA as early as later this quarter after the interim MONARCH 2 read out. 
Also at ASCO, along with Merck, we presented promising early-stage clinical data on the combination of with KEYTRUDA with ALIMTA in frontline non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and of KEYTRUDA with Cyramza in the later lines of non-small cell lung cancer.
At ACR, along with Incyte, we presented data for baricitinib and rheumatoid arthritis from the Phase III long-term extension study, RA Beyond. Among other things, these data show that baricitinib was superior to placebo at inhibiting joint data -- at inhibiting joint damage. We continue to be pleased with the data generated on baricitinib in RA, and we look forward for regulatory action next year in the U.S., Europe and Japan.
At the American Diabetes Association, along with BI, we presented results from the Phase III Marlena trial demonstrating that Trajenta, a DPP-4 inhibitor, reduced blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes who are at risk for kidney impairment with a renal safety profile similar to that seen in other trials. And from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, showing that Jardiance reduced the risk for new onset or worsening kidney disease by 39% versus placebo when added to standard of care in adults with type 2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease.
Also at ADA, we presented results from the AWARD-9 study showing that TRULICITY significantly reduced blood sugar and body weight as an add-on insulin glargine compared to placebo plus insulin glargine. 
In other news, Lilly and BI announced a collaboration to evaluate the safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in combination with BI 836845, Boehringer Ingelheim's insulin-like growth factor ligand neutralizing antibody in patients diagnosed with hormone receptor positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. And Elanco Animal Health announced a collaboration with EnBiotix to use EnBiotix technology to develop alternatives through traditional antibiotic therapies for animals.
We were pleased that the German Federal Supreme Court granted our appeal in the Alimta patent case versus Actavis vacating the prior decision denying infringement. This ruling supports our continuing belief that Alimta's vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by the entry of generic pemetrexed products, including alternative soft forms in Europe prior to June 2021. And the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted petitions seeking Inter Partes Review or IPR of our Alimta vitamin regimen patent. We expect final IPR written decision in mid-2017.
Finally, we did not repurchase any stock in the second quarter, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. During the quarter, however, we did distribute over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and returning excess cash to shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?"
285467,319564364,1012788,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, John. Slide 8 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. Now let's look at our results for the second quarter. Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments today on our non-GAAP adjusted m",1235,"Great. Thanks, John. Slide 8 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. 
Now let's look at our results for the second quarter. Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments today on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insight into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our second quarter GAAP results. 
Moving to non-GAAP measures on Slide 10, you can see that Q2 2016 revenue increased 9% compared to Q2 2015, reaching $5.4 billion.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 3.2 percentage points to 76%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in the benefit both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year.
Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 50 basis points going from 76.2% in last year's quarter to 75.7% this quarter, driven primarily by product mix.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 7% compared to Q2 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 1%, while R&D increased 14%.
The slight increase in marketing, selling, administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products, largely offset by lower spending on late life cycle products and lower litigation expenses. 
The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late stage clinical development cost, including the $100 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca triggered by the transition to Phase III testing for the oral-based inhibitor of Alzheimer's disease, AZD3293. This milestone payment added 8.5 percentage points to R&D expense growth and over 3.5 percentage points to total operating expense growth. 
Excluding this milestone payment, total OpEx increased just over 3%, which was substantially less than revenue growth. 
Other income and expense was income of $21 million this quarter, slightly less than the $29 million reported in last year's quarter. 
Our tax rate was 22.4%, an increase of 160 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to a net discrete tax benefit in last year's quarter of approximately $24 million, which lowered that quarter's tax rate by about 2 percentage points. In addition, this year's tax rate benefited from certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit that are in force in '16, but had lapsed during last year's quarter. This was largely offset by the tax impact of an increased percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions this year compared to last year. 
At the bottom line, net income increased -- sorry, decreased 5%, and earnings per share decreased 4%. While Derica will cover the effect of FX on our income statement in a subsequent slide, I would highlight that when excluding the effect of FX, non-GAAP EPS actually increased 4% this quarter. 
Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first half of the year, while Slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. And you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 25 and 26.
Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On Slide 13 in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 9% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. For the first quarter in quite a while, FX was not a headwind as a stronger yen offset weaker emerging markets currencies. As it did in Q1, on a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter, driven entirely by volume. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by volume. TRULICITY and Humalog were the main drivers of U.S. volume growth with meaningful contributions also coming from Cialis, Taltz, Jardiance, HUMULIN and Trajenta. 
Having completed the take back of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1 of last year, we also benefited from booking and sales of Erbitux. The decline in EuCan revenue of 1% was driven by the negative effect of price, which was nearly offset by the positive effect of volume, and to a much lesser extent, FX. 
On a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 2%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower price and volume for Cymbalta following patent expiration, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including TRULICITY, Cyramza, Basaglar and Jardiance and higher sales of Humalog, Trajenta and Cialis. 
Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased to 7% in constant currency terms. 
In Japan, the pharma revenue increased 21% in total, driven by mid-teens volume growth and an 11% benefit from a stronger yen, partially offset by a 7% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts. On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 10%. This performance growth was attributable to a number of products led by Cyramza, but also including Cymbalta, Strattera, Basaglar, TRULICITY and Trajenta. 
Turning to emerging markets. We saw revenue decline of 3%, driven by the negative effect of FX, which was partially offset by higher volume. On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue increased 5% due to volume growth from a number of products, most notably Humalog and TRULICITY, partially offset by continued sales erosion of off-patent brands, including Alimta, Cialis, Zyprexa and Cymbalta. 
Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China increased 15% or 23% on a constant currency basis. This quarter's growth rate did benefit from customer buying patterns in both last year's quarter and this quarter. We estimate that underlying demand for our products in China increased 5% in the second quarter.
Turning to Animal Health. We completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year, so year-on-year revenue growth comparisons are now on an apples-to-apples basis. This quarter, Elanco Animal Health revenue increased 2%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, Elanco revenue increased 4%. This performance increase was primarily driven by the uptake of new products, as well as by wholesaler buying patterns of U.S. companion animal product.
On Slide 14, you'll find the same price rate and volume analysis, but on a year-to-date basis. As I mentioned a moment ago, excluding FX from our worldwide revenue, our growth would have been 8% this quarter, with nearly all of that growth coming from higher volume. Our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar and Portrazza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. 
Slide 15 shows that these products drove over 6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. Humalog contributed nearly 2 percentage points of volume growth, while the take back of Erbitux contributed nearly 1 percentage point of volume growth. 
You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror still provided a drag of roughly 1.7 percentage points on our volume growth. 
Finally, Alimta reduced our worldwide volume growth by nearly 1 percentage point this quarter. The major driver of the decline in worldwide Alimta volume was the U.S., where we've seen increasing competitive pressure from a immuno-oncology agents, and to a lesser extent, from targeted agents. Notably, Alimta volume across the EuCan was relatively flat this quarter with the exception of the U.K., where we have begun to see generic competition. 
Now let me turn the call over to Derica."
285467,319564364,1012788,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil. As I did last quarter, I like to start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session both Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more details. As you can see on the graph on Slide 16, our new products generated $428",1399,"Thanks, Phil. As I did last quarter, I like to start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session both Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more details. 
As you can see on the graph on Slide 16, our new products generated $428 million in revenue this quarter led by TRULICITY and Cyramza. This now represents about 8% of our total worldwide revenue.
And as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove 6 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter. Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan and Europe. And we look forward to continue growth in these markets, not only in gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications.
Sales in the U.S. declined slightly this quarter due to competition in non-small cell lung cancer, primarily from immuno-oncology agents. Sales outside of the U.S. now account for over half of Cyramza's global sales with Japan making up nearly 1/3. 
TRULICITY continues to gain momentum globally. Here in the U.S., we're now capturing over 25% of new patient starts in the GLP-1 class, while in many OUS markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with Victoza, when it launched. 
Of note, in Germany, TRULICITY is now the most prescribed GLP-1 brand for patients new to the class. 
In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the GLP-1 class, with the U.S. market growing 30%.
Another class that is showing rapid growth is the SGLT-2 class, where we see U.S. class growth in the 25% range. This is, however, below the class growth we had expected to see. In the U.S., our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists continues to increase exceeding 35% in the most recent IMS data, as shown in our supplementary Slide 41. Outside the U.S., we've seen very strong uptake in Italy with encouraging trends across all countries. 
In addition to the guideline update in Canada, I mentioned last quarter, we've seen initial regulatory approvals of a CV indication for Jardiance in markets like Ecuador and Mexico, and we look forward to the FDA action later this year. 
We've now launched A-Basaglar in a number of OUS countries. As I mentioned last quarter, in countries where local pricing authorization have produced a co-pay advantage, peer market performance has been higher than our expectation. This includes markets like Japan, Poland and Slovakia.
In countries like Germany and Spain, where there isn't a co-pay advantage, we're running on an annualized share of the total basal insulin market of 3% to 5%. 
In aggregate, we are pleased with our performance. Here in the U.S., as John mentioned earlier, we recently gained FDA approval of an 80-unit KwikPen and look forward to launching Basaglar in mid-December. 
It's still early days for Portrazza, with the U.S. launch having occurred in December, and the initial European launch is in April. In the U.S., we are encouraged that the vast majority of U.S. payers are now covering Portrazza, although we continue to see strong uptake of I/O agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is affecting Portrazza's uptake. Finally, our newest product, Taltz, launched in the U.S. in April, and in Europe earlier this month. Early prescription data in the U.S. is encouraging. Given the recent approval in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, we also look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall. 
Moving to Slide 17, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 8%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 12% outpaced revenue growth, due primarily to the negative effect of product mix.
Moving down the income statement, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating expenses grew slightly slower than revenue at 7%. Excluding the $100 million AZD3293 milestone payment, non-GAAP operating expenses grew much more slowly than revenue at just 3.5%. 
Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 7%, while a higher tax rate and slightly lower other income led to a 4% increase in non-GAAP EPS. 
Moving onto our pipeline updates, Slide 18 shows our pipeline as of July 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. 
In our NME pipeline, we started Phase I testing for 4 molecules, including a CHK1 inhibitor and a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody for cancer, a double incretin mimetic for diabetes and a tau antibody for Alzheimer's disease. 
I would note that increasingly, even in areas outside of oncology, we are testing our molecules in patients in Phase I in addition to healthy volunteers. You'll also see that we terminated development of 2 Phase II molecules in noncore areas. 
In our NILEX pipeline, as shown on Slide 19, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received FDA approval of the once daily version of Jentadueto, as well as our first global approval for ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis, which occurred in Japan, and we began Phase III testing for ixekizumab in sPGA
You'll also see that we're showing baricitinib for diabetic nephropathy and for psoriasis as attrition, as we decided not to pursue these indications at this time. We will invest in additional indications for baricitinib, and have trials ongoing in atopic dermatitis and lupus. And you shouldn't be surprised to see more in the future. 
Turning to Slide 20, let's recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016.
Since our last call, we've added green checkmarks for the initiation of Phase III for ixekizumab and sPGA; the internal data read out as subsequent presentation at ASCO of detailed results from the Phase II MONARCH 1 trial of bemaciclib as a single agent treatment for advanced breast cancer; the presentation at ACR of data from the RA Beyond study baricitinib in RA; the presentation at ADA of the Marlena study of linagliptin; the approval of Taltz in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, the U.S. approval of once daily Jentadueto XR; and the favorable German Federal Supreme Court Alimta ruling. 
I'd also note that we now have a date, September 7 for the CAFC appeal hearing in our U.S. Alimta patent litigation. Given this timing, we could have a CAFC ruling before the end of the year. 
You'll also see that we've moved the ixekizumab head-to-head psoriasis trial versus [indiscernible] through the potential Phase III data external disclosures section, as we now hope to present data from this trial at a scientific meeting this year. Also, 2 events we thought might occur in 2016 are now projected in 2017. The cluster headache read out for and galcanezumab and the Phase III start for our ultra rapid insulin. 
Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on Slide 21, is as straightforward a picture as you could possibly have. All GAAP and non-GAAP guidance line items, including EPS, remain unchanged from what we communicated on our Q1 earnings call in April. 
So in summary, 2016 is shaping up to be another strong year. Excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 8% this quarter, entirely driven by volume, with growing contributions from recently launched products, which this quarter drove 6 of 8 percentage points of our volume growth. We reduced OpEx as a percent of revenue compared to Q2 last year, and we remain on track for our full year reduction of 200 to 250 basis points. The strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy continued with Taltz being approved in Japan, olaratumab being granted priority review here in the U.S., and the FDA adcom vote for Jardiance. We also completed early-stage deals in oncology to build-out possible ABILIFY fib combinations. And in animal health, to bolster our R&D efforts and finding alternatives to traditional antibiotics.
As John mentioned, when he kicked off the call, our management team is committed to making steady progress against each of our strategic objectives in the coming years. Our success to-date gives us increasing confidence in our ability to make contributions to medical progress, to meet or exceed our minimum mid-term financial expectations, and to create value for shareholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil?"

And just a totally unrelated question after that, just if you could kindly comment on the disparity between cardiologists and endocrinologists voting ways in the Jardiance adcom, and what that could potentially mean for the label change in treatment guidelines?"

And, I guess, your question targets also then the different mechanist we have across the industry today to influence on the amyloid component of Alzheimer's disease.

And, I guess, your question targets also then the different mechanist we have across the industry today to influence on the amyloid component of Alzheimer's disease. And as you said, solanezumab then binds monomeric free amyloid data, which has the intention then to prevent further buildup for plaque, but potentially, also then, have a peripheral sync affect. And in the Expedition trial, if there is now tau or sorry, amyloid imaging in all patients, which means then we will also be able to follow actually if there is a change in the plaque deposits of amyloid in these patients after long-term solanezumab treatment. The other antibodies than aducanumab are directed more towards the plaque of -- in Alzheimer's patients and the difference here could be both related potentially then to the clinical effect, but also in particular, safety since aducanumab has shown changes then in MRI suggesting brain edema as one of the components. And I think the early data on cognition et cetera for aducanumab clearly was a relatively small trial and needs to be confirmed in the longer and larger trial. The base inhibitors prevent formation of the amyloid and from the precursor protein APP, having better brain penetration but also potentially then a different safety profile, which needs to be established in larger and longer trials. So I think it's hard to speculate actually about what's going to happen using these 3 agents, but I think what is clear is that it is very important to include only positive patients. It's also very important to start very early in the disease. It's also a key, in my view, to have local studies, which involve some highly trained sites that can do these trials. Another aspect of the sola trial is also that we have tau imaging in proportion of patients. And as you know, tau is more related to the decline than on -- particularly the ADAS-Cog, and here we have another way potentially of showing them if there is disease modification. I think, I'll leave it to Dave to talk about the cognition and functional endpoints and the potential outcomes there."

So as we described in the past, we've moved our primary endpoint to be cognition and then key secondary  endpoints, which will have control for type 1 error will be primarily the functional endpoints. I won't rehash why we did that, but I would just reinforce that our base planning scenario is that we achieved both significance on cognition and function, reminding everyone that the pooled mild data, which we're trying to replicate, and we've made improvements in the study, and seeking to replicate past statistical significance on both function and cognition in that pooled mild subset. So should we miss on that, look, I think we'll have to talk about that when we get there. Clinicians, in my experience, are interested in outcomes and they're interested in safety. And so Jan has covered the safety topic. We know solanezumab is extremely well tolerated by patients. In fact, I can share that now that we have a majority of patients in EXPEDITION3 rolling off into the open label study. We're seeing a very similar effect from EXPEDITION1 and 2 and that 95% of patients are electing to continue on therapy or in a blinded way switch to therapy from their placebo. I think it's a very high number for what is a fragile and elderly population reinforcing the tolerability of the medication. We'll have to wait till December to see the results and fully answer your question."

The Congressional Budget Office has several times stated that if price controls are placed into Part D, the only way the government would save money in that event is to restrict access to drugs on the formulary. Today, most seniors have access through the private plans, to the whole formulary, and that's why senior satisfaction rates are so high.

So for the sola prodromal study, we're anticipating enrolling patients sort of soon. As we said in our December 8 Investor Conference on Alzheimer's, we fully expect to get that study up and running this year and sort of rolling into the EXPEDITION3 rollout and have that under way. In terms of primary outcome, we've exposed that, which is going to be cognition as the primary endpoint with key secondary endpoints of function just like EXPEDITION3. I think the general logic here is that the earlier you go into Zs, the less meaningful functional changes are and frankly, the more difficult they are to detect. So moving from a mild-only study like EXPEDITION3 and 2, the prodromal, that's entirely logical. By the way, we've also made those changes in the BACE inhibitor programs in partnership with AZ. Your second question, just to be clear, John, we've not announced a delay in the galcanezumab migraine program but rather the cluster headache program. This was a kind of quasi-orphan speed play we announced in parallel with the migraine start. One of the studies, although enrolling well, is -- requires episodic cluster episodes to begin before we place patients on medication. We had to predict the rate at which patients would have episodic cluster headaches. I think we estimated too high. So we're waiting for people to have those episodes before we can begin treatment, and that's slowing down that particular study, although the chronic cluster study is on track time-wise. So we'll have to make some decisions as we get closer to the end of the chronic cluster study about submission and labeling, et cetera.

Just any color there would be great. Second question is on 2017, just pricing and kind of coverage outlooks. Any major shifts in coverage we should be thinking about as we think out towards next year? And maybe specifically on diabetes, anything we should be keeping in mind there in terms of either coverage or pricing as you've been talking to payers about the 2017 season?"

We've experienced that in our diabetes business, and we know that we're looking to go into some highly competitive spaces in terms of some of our new product launches. So our focus has been on driving volume-driven revenue growth.

And maybe you could tie in how the pending patent expirations of Cialis and Forteo will thus play into that greater price pressure this decade than you're currently experiencing."

When we -- when you look at our PRB slide, that's captured in our call materials, that is the true realized pricing effect that we're seeing rolling across our business. So you should expect on a go-forward basis that it will still be on that same apples-to-apples. When you then think about the future patent expirations of Cialis and Strattera and brands like that, you will see it also parceled in the same manner. So when we, again, look at our business, and I think that's pretty much reflected in the results that you saw here in the second quarter, even in the midst of launching, we're focused on driving a volume-driven growth profile. And the fact that we could achieve 8% volume growth this quarter and really relatively no price benefit, really speaks to our commentary around increased pricing pressures going forward."

That led to significant negative price impact at the time we would ship that product. When we'd actually recognize the revenue later with no units against it, it would lead to a very large price increase. It really had nothing to do with price increases. So what Derica has mentioned is for a while now, we've been treating our brand and an authorized generic as totally separate products so you no longer have those aberrations in your net price calculation, and it will be a true underlying price change, as Derica just mentioned. Hopefully, that helps give you some context where you might have seen in the past and what you will see -- have seen recently and will see going forward."

Is this some of the safety concerns we're seeing kind of across the class? Or anything else that's maybe keeping that growth a little bit below where you're expecting?

As you mentioned, it's still very early, especially with the specialty biologic like this in terms of the data flows and information that we would get. But thus far, we're very pleased with the initial performance of Taltz. If you look, for instance, at the IMS New to Brand NPA, just dermatology specialty focused data, we're bouncing around right at the Enbrel New to Brand level. We're closing in very closely on the COSENTYX New to Brand among derms there. Revenue in the second quarter totaled $19 million. A portion of that was wholesale stocking in there. But as I mentioned, with specialty products filling through specialty pharmacy channels, it will take a while before we get really complete data there. So I just want to caution that with IMS -- we can look at IMS a bit, but really, it's going to be when we see the actual script level data coming through the specialty pharmacy data flows that we'll have much more clarity. The feedback from physicians has been very positive. We're just hearing wonderful things anecdotally about their experiences with their patients in terms of their interactions with us. We think Taltz has a very attractive value proposition to our patients, to our physicians, to our payers, including our Taltz savings card, which I think is really important thing for folks to know about is with this Taltz savings card that we've got out there, the patients will pay as little as $5 a month if they're commercially insured and covered by their insurance. If they're commercially insured and are not covered by their insurance and have filed the script, had that denied and filed an appeal and had it denied, they will pay no more than $25 a month. This really removes a prescribing burden and hurdle for the physician, for the patient and the doctor's office in getting people initiated on the medicine. So right now, everything seems to be positive from the experience but in a wait-and-see mode. Thank you."

One, when it comes to bone fractures specific to canagliflozin, and then a strengthened warning on acute kidney injury that covers both Dapa and canagliflozin. All of these warnings or strengthened warnings come. We solve that counterbalance where today we cannot -- we're unable to promote our CV data until we basically get our label updated. So we continue to feel that the benefit risk profile of the class is very strong but that of Jardiance, in particular, given that we -- our data basically speaks for itself when it comes to some of these safety assessments and then also the benefit that -- when it comes to CV. When we look at the class in general, the class is growing year-to-date over 30%, and one can say that seems like a very good growth. But when we look a little more closely at the new patient starts and the growth of that, we basically see that completely flattening. And for that reason, we are a bit concerned.

We're excited about the galcanezumab program, which is the new name for CGRP antibody. Putting aside the cluster, which, again, has possibility to get to market earlier, although we have, as was mentioned earlier, a slowdown in the episodic cluster study. As it relates to migraine, we remain excited about the profile. It is very competitive, as you mentioned. There's at least 3 players kind of neck and neck from our read, execution and enrollment, and getting the studies complete is important. You'll see in ClinicalTrials.gov we've actually closed the submission-gating study, the critical pass study, which was the long-term safety study already. So that puts us on a good path to remain on track. Ultimately, I think the product profile will need to achieve the maximum effect possible via this mechanism with the minimally intrusive administration for patients. This will be a product used by healthy people in primary care offices and everyday neurologists. Simple injection and dosing protocols coupled with a very strong effect will win. That sounds kind of boiler plate, but I think we're testing a couple different dosing setups, others are testing different ones. But we'll just have to see who can produce the best numbers with the minimum doses. And I think that's what we'll be looking for as we read out the data sometime late next year."

I think, Alex, the long-term guidance contemplates, obviously, a number of scenarios we have, products like baricitinib that are under regulatory review; abemaciclib, which is headed that way; products that are still in the pipeline; the sola readout later this year. So there's still some -- I guess some big unknowns up ahead, coupled with the sure patent losses that we're going to experience with products like Cialis and Strattera, for example. So while there's still a lot of moving parts, I think similar to sort of the guidance we provided back in late 2009, we were entering this patent expiration period, we want to provide some floor, some minimum set of expectations for investors recognizing that there are scenarios that could take that above that floor. Now we did call out the fact that we don't -- this does not contemplate major changes in government reimbursement policy. It does contemplate ALIMTA continuing to be patent protected in the U.S. through the early '20s. So with those caveats, I think that -- we feel very comfortable providing that as a framework for investors thinking about Lilly in the next 5 years with all these potential scenarios, a number of which could provide upside above this number and then coupled with the guidance we've given about not only our operating -- our OpEx to sales, but this morning, reaffirming our belief that we could also improve our gross margin as a percentage of sales over this period as well."

One of them, we had some growth scenario adjustments during the period that were from prior periods. And one -- and second, we also saw much higher utilization on our co-pay cards. We recently have changed the design of our co-pay card so it's less generous than it used to be, but that takes a little bit of time to basically wash out. So we should expect an improving picture when it comes to that. In terms of Trulicity, we do have an interim later this year. It's -- clearly, we've all seen the LEADER data. Probably the best way to think about the interim for Trulicity, but if we were to expect a similar -- were to observe a similar hazard ratio versus what LEADER showed, we will not stop the trial. So given that we have -- we're going to have a significantly less number of events that basically Novo had at the conclusion of their own trial. Now we are confident on the profile of the product, and now we just really need to wait for the interim. But we'll either stop or we will -- if we stop, we would know.

And that's where you've seen the kind of the decline in our gross margin rate over this YZ period. Going forward, it's really going to be dependent on the nature of the molecules and which ones are launching at what time. So if you look at products like Jardiance, we booked our portion of the income, so it actually has a boost to our gross margin as a percent relative to our base.

The Information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Before we dive into this quarter's activities and financial results, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks at a more strategic level. 18 months ago, on our guidance call in January 2015, as we emerged from the series of patent expirations we referred to as the YZ period, we described refinements to our innovation-based strategy as well as our key strategic objectives for the remainder of the decade.
Those 4 strategic objectives were: grow revenue; expand margin; sustain the flow of innovation; and deploy capital to create value.
I'd like to provide a bit more detail than we have in the past on our future expectations for each of these objectives, starting with the ""sustain the flow of innovation. At our meeting in Boston last December, we discussed in great detail both our animal health business and our comprehensive Alzheimer's disease R&D efforts. We followed that up at our meeting this past May, where we took an in-depth look at our R&D efforts in diabetes, oncology, immunology and pain. Between these 2 meetings, we hope you've gained a greater appreciation for the significant future growth opportunities we see in each of our human pharma focus areas as well as in Elanco Animal Health. 
As an innovation-based pharmaceutical company, our future growth prospects determined by the flow of innovation from our pipeline. As we discussed in our R&D meeting in May, we believe we've made substantial progress building an R&D engine that can sustain a flow of innovation to support our growth aspirations. Over a 10-year period, starting in 2014, we believe we can launch 20 or more new medicine. These 20 launches span the 5 therapeutic areas we focused on: diabetes, oncology, neuro degeneration, immunology and pain. And the revenue growth from these new product launches will be reinforced by new indications and line extension, which on average could number 2 per year.
So how do we see this translating into revenue growth for the balance of this decade? Having already launched 6 products in the past 2 years with more launches possible in the next few years, we expect to generate robust revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, despite facing a number of significant patent expirations. To provide a floor for our expectations, we've analyzed a range of scenarios for clinical, regulatory and commercial success. Based on this analysis, we expect annual revenue growth over this period to average at least 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher volume not price.  And we certainly see scenarios for clinical, regulatory and commercial success that would drive revenue growth significantly higher than its minimum expectation.
I would point out that our revenue growth expectations do assume increased price pressure in the U.S. but do not include any significant government action on Medicare Part D, for example. And also assume that we maintain ALIMTA patent exclusivity in the U.S. throughout the period. 
With regard to our margins, we remain on track to achieve our goal of reducing operating expenses, sum of R&D and SG&A to 50% of revenue or less in 2018. And when excluding foreign exchange, we expect to increase gross margin as a percent of revenue over the remainder of this decade. 
Finally, on deploying capital to create value, we will follow the priorities we've outlined for you since early 2015. First and foremost, we'll fund the considerable opportunities provided by our existing products in our pipeline. Second, we will actively pursue opportunities to bolster our future growth prospects through business development. You should expect these efforts to be concentrated on our existing human pharma therapeutic areas and our animal health business. 
Finally, with the strength of our current business and pipeline, we plan to return to annual dividend increases to our shareholders beginning in December of this year and to return excess cash via share repurchase.
I hope this provide you with greater clarity on the progress we expect to make on our 4 strategic objectives through the end of this decade. 
Now let's move to this quarter's results. As I did last quarter, I'm going to use that same strategic objectives framework to summarize our progress. On our first strategic objective, grow revenue, we grew revenue 8% in the second quarter on a constant currency or performance basis. All of this performance growth was driven by volume. And in total, our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Portrazza and Taltz drove 6 percentage points of this volume growth. 
On our next strategic objective, expand margins. Our non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue declined 90 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Excluding the $100 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca, our non-GAAP OpEx percent decreased nearly 3 percentage points. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance, which at the midpoint of our ranges implies an improvement of 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue. 
Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, Taltz was approved in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. For the PSA indication, this marks the first time I can recall that a new indication was first approved in Japan. Kudos to our Japanese regulatory colleagues on this outstanding accomplishment. Olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody from our ImClone acquisition received priority review status here in the U.S, and an FDA Advisory Committee voted 12 to 11 that substantial evidence exists to establish that Jardiance reduces cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. During the call, we'll provide a more complete list of the pipeline progress we achieved over the last 3 months.
Lastly, on our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value, we completed a number of smaller deals to bolster both our human pharma and animal health businesses. We will continue to actively pursue additional external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects. 
And finally, during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend.
In summary, I'm confident that the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020. And I assure you that their achievement is a top priority for our entire management team. 
Now let's move on to review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On a commercial front, earlier this month, we began initial launches of Taltz in Europe for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. And Elanco Animal Health launched Inteprity, a first-in-class animal-use only in-feed antibiotic approved for the prevention of necrotic enteritis, a significant and costly intestinal disease in poultry. Once again, it was a busy 3 months on the regulatory front.
In Japan, we received approval of Cyramza for 2 new indications, one in metastatic colorectal cancer and the other in non-small cell lung cancer. Also in Japan, as I just mentioned, we received approval for Taltz for both psoriasis and for psoriatic arthritis. 
Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received 2 FDA approvals for a once daily form of Jentadueto for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes and for a larger 80-unit Basaglar KwikPen. We remain on track for a mid-December launch of Basaglar.
The FDA determined that we met the requirements for pediatric exclusivity for Effient. Based on this decision by the FDA, Lilly has gained an additional 6 months of U.S. market exclusivity with compound patent exclusivity now expiring in October 2017. 
In oncology, the FDA granted priority review for olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma. As a result, we expect FDA action before the end of the year. And as I mentioned earlier, an FDA Advisory Committee voted 12 to 11 that substantial evidence exists to establish the Jardiance reduces cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Jardiance, as you know, is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly. 
On the clinical front, at ASCO, we presented results from the Phase II MONARCH 1 study of our abemaciclib, our CDK 4 and CDK 6 inhibitor in patients with hormone positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. The data showed single agent activity, as measured by objective response, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer patients for whom endocrine therapy was no longer a suitable treatment option. 
As Sue mentioned on our recent investor call to discuss this data, the interim Phase III read out for MONARCH 2 will occur in the near future. Given the close proximity of this read out to the final MONARCH 1 data, we expect to submit MONARCH 1 data to the FDA as early as later this quarter after the interim MONARCH 2 read out. 
Also at ASCO, along with Merck, we presented promising early-stage clinical data on the combination of with KEYTRUDA with ALIMTA in frontline non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and of KEYTRUDA with Cyramza in the later lines of non-small cell lung cancer.
At ACR, along with Incyte, we presented data for baricitinib and rheumatoid arthritis from the Phase III long-term extension study, RA Beyond. Among other things, these data show that baricitinib was superior to placebo at inhibiting joint data -- at inhibiting joint damage. We continue to be pleased with the data generated on baricitinib in RA, and we look forward for regulatory action next year in the U.S., Europe and Japan.
At the American Diabetes Association, along with BI, we presented results from the Phase III Marlena trial demonstrating that Trajenta, a DPP-4 inhibitor, reduced blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes who are at risk for kidney impairment with a renal safety profile similar to that seen in other trials. And from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, showing that Jardiance reduced the risk for new onset or worsening kidney disease by 39% versus placebo when added to standard of care in adults with type 2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease.
Also at ADA, we presented results from the AWARD-9 study showing that TRULICITY significantly reduced blood sugar and body weight as an add-on insulin glargine compared to placebo plus insulin glargine. 
In other news, Lilly and BI announced a collaboration to evaluate the safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in combination with BI 836845, Boehringer Ingelheim's insulin-like growth factor ligand neutralizing antibody in patients diagnosed with hormone receptor positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. And Elanco Animal Health announced a collaboration with EnBiotix to use EnBiotix technology to develop alternatives through traditional antibiotic therapies for animals.
We were pleased that the German Federal Supreme Court granted our appeal in the Alimta patent case versus Actavis vacating the prior decision denying infringement. This ruling supports our continuing belief that Alimta's vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by the entry of generic pemetrexed products, including alternative soft forms in Europe prior to June 2021. And the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted petitions seeking Inter Partes Review or IPR of our Alimta vitamin regimen patent. We expect final IPR written decision in mid-2017.
Finally, we did not repurchase any stock in the second quarter, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. During the quarter, however, we did distribute over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and returning excess cash to shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?"
285467,319564364,1013052,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, John. Slide 8 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. Now let's look at our results for the second quarter. Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments today on our non-GAAP adjusted m",1235,"Great. Thanks, John. Slide 8 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. 
Now let's look at our results for the second quarter. Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments today on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insight into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our second quarter GAAP results. 
Moving to non-GAAP measures on Slide 10, you can see that Q2 2016 revenue increased 9% compared to Q2 2015, reaching $5.4 billion.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 3.2 percentage points to 76%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in the benefit both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year.
Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 50 basis points going from 76.2% in last year's quarter to 75.7% this quarter, driven primarily by product mix.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 7% compared to Q2 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 1%, while R&D increased 14%.
The slight increase in marketing, selling, administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products, largely offset by lower spending on late life cycle products and lower litigation expenses. 
The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late stage clinical development cost, including the $100 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca triggered by the transition to Phase III testing for the oral-based inhibitor of Alzheimer's disease, AZD3293. This milestone payment added 8.5 percentage points to R&D expense growth and over 3.5 percentage points to total operating expense growth. 
Excluding this milestone payment, total OpEx increased just over 3%, which was substantially less than revenue growth. 
Other income and expense was income of $21 million this quarter, slightly less than the $29 million reported in last year's quarter. 
Our tax rate was 22.4%, an increase of 160 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to a net discrete tax benefit in last year's quarter of approximately $24 million, which lowered that quarter's tax rate by about 2 percentage points. In addition, this year's tax rate benefited from certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit that are in force in '16, but had lapsed during last year's quarter. This was largely offset by the tax impact of an increased percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions this year compared to last year. 
At the bottom line, net income increased -- sorry, decreased 5%, and earnings per share decreased 4%. While Derica will cover the effect of FX on our income statement in a subsequent slide, I would highlight that when excluding the effect of FX, non-GAAP EPS actually increased 4% this quarter. 
Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first half of the year, while Slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. And you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 25 and 26.
Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On Slide 13 in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 9% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. For the first quarter in quite a while, FX was not a headwind as a stronger yen offset weaker emerging markets currencies. As it did in Q1, on a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter, driven entirely by volume. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by volume. TRULICITY and Humalog were the main drivers of U.S. volume growth with meaningful contributions also coming from Cialis, Taltz, Jardiance, HUMULIN and Trajenta. 
Having completed the take back of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1 of last year, we also benefited from booking and sales of Erbitux. The decline in EuCan revenue of 1% was driven by the negative effect of price, which was nearly offset by the positive effect of volume, and to a much lesser extent, FX. 
On a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 2%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower price and volume for Cymbalta following patent expiration, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including TRULICITY, Cyramza, Basaglar and Jardiance and higher sales of Humalog, Trajenta and Cialis. 
Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased to 7% in constant currency terms. 
In Japan, the pharma revenue increased 21% in total, driven by mid-teens volume growth and an 11% benefit from a stronger yen, partially offset by a 7% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts. On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 10%. This performance growth was attributable to a number of products led by Cyramza, but also including Cymbalta, Strattera, Basaglar, TRULICITY and Trajenta. 
Turning to emerging markets. We saw revenue decline of 3%, driven by the negative effect of FX, which was partially offset by higher volume. On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue increased 5% due to volume growth from a number of products, most notably Humalog and TRULICITY, partially offset by continued sales erosion of off-patent brands, including Alimta, Cialis, Zyprexa and Cymbalta. 
Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China increased 15% or 23% on a constant currency basis. This quarter's growth rate did benefit from customer buying patterns in both last year's quarter and this quarter. We estimate that underlying demand for our products in China increased 5% in the second quarter.
Turning to Animal Health. We completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year, so year-on-year revenue growth comparisons are now on an apples-to-apples basis. This quarter, Elanco Animal Health revenue increased 2%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, Elanco revenue increased 4%. This performance increase was primarily driven by the uptake of new products, as well as by wholesaler buying patterns of U.S. companion animal product.
On Slide 14, you'll find the same price rate and volume analysis, but on a year-to-date basis. As I mentioned a moment ago, excluding FX from our worldwide revenue, our growth would have been 8% this quarter, with nearly all of that growth coming from higher volume. Our new products, TRULICITY, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar and Portrazza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. 
Slide 15 shows that these products drove over 6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. Humalog contributed nearly 2 percentage points of volume growth, while the take back of Erbitux contributed nearly 1 percentage point of volume growth. 
You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror still provided a drag of roughly 1.7 percentage points on our volume growth. 
Finally, Alimta reduced our worldwide volume growth by nearly 1 percentage point this quarter. The major driver of the decline in worldwide Alimta volume was the U.S., where we've seen increasing competitive pressure from a immuno-oncology agents, and to a lesser extent, from targeted agents. Notably, Alimta volume across the EuCan was relatively flat this quarter with the exception of the U.K., where we have begun to see generic competition. 
Now let me turn the call over to Derica."
285467,319564364,1013052,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil. As I did last quarter, I like to start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session both Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more details. As you can see on the graph on Slide 16, our new products generated $428",1399,"Thanks, Phil. As I did last quarter, I like to start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session both Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more details. 
As you can see on the graph on Slide 16, our new products generated $428 million in revenue this quarter led by TRULICITY and Cyramza. This now represents about 8% of our total worldwide revenue.
And as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove 6 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter. Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan and Europe. And we look forward to continue growth in these markets, not only in gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications.
Sales in the U.S. declined slightly this quarter due to competition in non-small cell lung cancer, primarily from immuno-oncology agents. Sales outside of the U.S. now account for over half of Cyramza's global sales with Japan making up nearly 1/3. 
TRULICITY continues to gain momentum globally. Here in the U.S., we're now capturing over 25% of new patient starts in the GLP-1 class, while in many OUS markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with Victoza, when it launched. 
Of note, in Germany, TRULICITY is now the most prescribed GLP-1 brand for patients new to the class. 
In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the GLP-1 class, with the U.S. market growing 30%.
Another class that is showing rapid growth is the SGLT-2 class, where we see U.S. class growth in the 25% range. This is, however, below the class growth we had expected to see. In the U.S., our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists continues to increase exceeding 35% in the most recent IMS data, as shown in our supplementary Slide 41. Outside the U.S., we've seen very strong uptake in Italy with encouraging trends across all countries. 
In addition to the guideline update in Canada, I mentioned last quarter, we've seen initial regulatory approvals of a CV indication for Jardiance in markets like Ecuador and Mexico, and we look forward to the FDA action later this year. 
We've now launched A-Basaglar in a number of OUS countries. As I mentioned last quarter, in countries where local pricing authorization have produced a co-pay advantage, peer market performance has been higher than our expectation. This includes markets like Japan, Poland and Slovakia.
In countries like Germany and Spain, where there isn't a co-pay advantage, we're running on an annualized share of the total basal insulin market of 3% to 5%. 
In aggregate, we are pleased with our performance. Here in the U.S., as John mentioned earlier, we recently gained FDA approval of an 80-unit KwikPen and look forward to launching Basaglar in mid-December. 
It's still early days for Portrazza, with the U.S. launch having occurred in December, and the initial European launch is in April. In the U.S., we are encouraged that the vast majority of U.S. payers are now covering Portrazza, although we continue to see strong uptake of I/O agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is affecting Portrazza's uptake. Finally, our newest product, Taltz, launched in the U.S. in April, and in Europe earlier this month. Early prescription data in the U.S. is encouraging. Given the recent approval in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, we also look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall. 
Moving to Slide 17, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 8%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 12% outpaced revenue growth, due primarily to the negative effect of product mix.
Moving down the income statement, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating expenses grew slightly slower than revenue at 7%. Excluding the $100 million AZD3293 milestone payment, non-GAAP operating expenses grew much more slowly than revenue at just 3.5%. 
Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 7%, while a higher tax rate and slightly lower other income led to a 4% increase in non-GAAP EPS. 
Moving onto our pipeline updates, Slide 18 shows our pipeline as of July 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. 
In our NME pipeline, we started Phase I testing for 4 molecules, including a CHK1 inhibitor and a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody for cancer, a double incretin mimetic for diabetes and a tau antibody for Alzheimer's disease. 
I would note that increasingly, even in areas outside of oncology, we are testing our molecules in patients in Phase I in addition to healthy volunteers. You'll also see that we terminated development of 2 Phase II molecules in noncore areas. 
In our NILEX pipeline, as shown on Slide 19, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received FDA approval of the once daily version of Jentadueto, as well as our first global approval for ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis, which occurred in Japan, and we began Phase III testing for ixekizumab in sPGA
You'll also see that we're showing baricitinib for diabetic nephropathy and for psoriasis as attrition, as we decided not to pursue these indications at this time. We will invest in additional indications for baricitinib, and have trials ongoing in atopic dermatitis and lupus. And you shouldn't be surprised to see more in the future. 
Turning to Slide 20, let's recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016.
Since our last call, we've added green checkmarks for the initiation of Phase III for ixekizumab and sPGA; the internal data read out as subsequent presentation at ASCO of detailed results from the Phase II MONARCH 1 trial of bemaciclib as a single agent treatment for advanced breast cancer; the presentation at ACR of data from the RA Beyond study baricitinib in RA; the presentation at ADA of the Marlena study of linagliptin; the approval of Taltz in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, the U.S. approval of once daily Jentadueto XR; and the favorable German Federal Supreme Court Alimta ruling. 
I'd also note that we now have a date, September 7 for the CAFC appeal hearing in our U.S. Alimta patent litigation. Given this timing, we could have a CAFC ruling before the end of the year. 
You'll also see that we've moved the ixekizumab head-to-head psoriasis trial versus [indiscernible] through the potential Phase III data external disclosures section, as we now hope to present data from this trial at a scientific meeting this year. Also, 2 events we thought might occur in 2016 are now projected in 2017. The cluster headache read out for and galcanezumab and the Phase III start for our ultra rapid insulin. 
Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on Slide 21, is as straightforward a picture as you could possibly have. All GAAP and non-GAAP guidance line items, including EPS, remain unchanged from what we communicated on our Q1 earnings call in April. 
So in summary, 2016 is shaping up to be another strong year. Excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 8% this quarter, entirely driven by volume, with growing contributions from recently launched products, which this quarter drove 6 of 8 percentage points of our volume growth. We reduced OpEx as a percent of revenue compared to Q2 last year, and we remain on track for our full year reduction of 200 to 250 basis points. The strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy continued with Taltz being approved in Japan, olaratumab being granted priority review here in the U.S., and the FDA adcom vote for Jardiance. We also completed early-stage deals in oncology to build-out possible ABILIFY fib combinations. And in animal health, to bolster our R&D efforts and finding alternatives to traditional antibiotics.
As John mentioned, when he kicked off the call, our management team is committed to making steady progress against each of our strategic objectives in the coming years. Our success to-date gives us increasing confidence in our ability to make contributions to medical progress, to meet or exceed our minimum mid-term financial expectations, and to create value for shareholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil?"

The other antibodies than aducanumab are directed more towards the plaque of -- in Alzheimer's patients and the difference here could be both related potentially then to the clinical effect, but also in particular, safety since aducanumab has shown changes then in MRI suggesting brain edema as one of the components. And I think the early data on cognition et cetera for aducanumab clearly was a relatively small trial and needs to be confirmed in the longer and larger trial. The base inhibitors prevent formation of the amyloid and from the precursor protein APP, having better brain penetration but also potentially then a different safety profile, which needs to be established in larger and longer trials. So I think it's hard to speculate actually about what's going to happen using these 3 agents, but I think what is clear is that it is very important to include only positive patients. It's also very important to start very early in the disease. It's also a key, in my view, to have local studies, which involve some highly trained sites that can do these trials. Another aspect of the sola trial is also that we have tau imaging in proportion of patients. And as you know, tau is more related to the decline than on -- particularly the ADAS-Cog, and here we have another way potentially of showing them if there is disease modification. I think, I'll leave it to Dave to talk about the cognition and functional endpoints and the potential outcomes there."

So as we described in the past, we've moved our primary endpoint to be cognition and then key secondary  endpoints, which will have control for type 1 error will be primarily the functional endpoints. I won't rehash why we did that, but I would just reinforce that our base planning scenario is that we achieved both significance on cognition and function, reminding everyone that the pooled mild data, which we're trying to replicate, and we've made improvements in the study, and seeking to replicate past statistical significance on both function and cognition in that pooled mild subset. So should we miss on that, look, I think we'll have to talk about that when we get there. Clinicians, in my experience, are interested in outcomes and they're interested in safety. And so Jan has covered the safety topic. We know solanezumab is extremely well tolerated by patients. In fact, I can share that now that we have a majority of patients in EXPEDITION3 rolling off into the open label study. We're seeing a very similar effect from EXPEDITION1 and 2 and that 95% of patients are electing to continue on therapy or in a blinded way switch to therapy from their placebo. I think it's a very high number for what is a fragile and elderly population reinforcing the tolerability of the medication. We'll have to wait till December to see the results and fully answer your question."

The Congressional Budget Office has several times stated that if price controls are placed into Part D, the only way the government would save money in that event is to restrict access to drugs on the formulary.

As we said in our December 8 Investor Conference on Alzheimer's, we fully expect to get that study up and running this year and sort of rolling into the EXPEDITION3 rollout and have that under way. In terms of primary outcome, we've exposed that, which is going to be cognition as the primary endpoint with key secondary endpoints of function just like EXPEDITION3. I think the general logic here is that the earlier you go into Zs, the less meaningful functional changes are and frankly, the more difficult they are to detect. So moving from a mild-only study like EXPEDITION3 and 2, the prodromal, that's entirely logical. By the way, we've also made those changes in the BACE inhibitor programs in partnership with AZ. Your second question, just to be clear, John, we've not announced a delay in the galcanezumab migraine program but rather the cluster headache program. This was a kind of quasi-orphan speed play we announced in parallel with the migraine start. One of the studies, although enrolling well, is -- requires episodic cluster episodes to begin before we place patients on medication. We had to predict the rate at which patients would have episodic cluster headaches. I think we estimated too high. So we're waiting for people to have those episodes before we can begin treatment, and that's slowing down that particular study, although the chronic cluster study is on track time-wise. So we'll have to make some decisions as we get closer to the end of the chronic cluster study about submission and labeling, et cetera.

So that's really the thesis behind our comments as it relates to increased pricing pressures."

And then second, regarding the increased U.S. price pressure that you expect later this decade than you're currently experiencing, Derica, could you just remind us how you report U.S. pricing trends year-over-year with respect to factoring in drugs going generic? As I understand it, when a drug goes generic, even though Lilly doesn't reduce the list price of the drug, there is a negative impact on the calculation of net pricing that you report. And maybe you could tie in how the pending patent expirations of Cialis and Forteo will thus play into that greater price pressure this decade than you're currently experiencing."

When we -- when you look at our PRB slide, that's captured in our call materials, that is the true realized pricing effect that we're seeing rolling across our business. So you should expect on a go-forward basis that it will still be on that same apples-to-apples. When you then think about the future patent expirations of Cialis and Strattera and brands like that, you will see it also parceled in the same manner. So when we, again, look at our business, and I think that's pretty much reflected in the results that you saw here in the second quarter, even in the midst of launching, we're focused on driving a volume-driven growth profile. And the fact that we could achieve 8% volume growth this quarter and really relatively no price benefit, really speaks to our commentary around increased pricing pressures going forward."

That led to significant negative price impact at the time we would ship that product. When we'd actually recognize the revenue later with no units against it, it would lead to a very large price increase. It really had nothing to do with price increases. So what Derica has mentioned is for a while now, we've been treating our brand and an authorized generic as totally separate products so you no longer have those aberrations in your net price calculation, and it will be a true underlying price change, as Derica just mentioned. Hopefully, that helps give you some context where you might have seen in the past and what you will see -- have seen recently and will see going forward."

You mentioned that the year-over-year growth for that class is a little less than what you had expected. Can you just comment on that in terms of what -- why you think that is? Is this some of the safety concerns we're seeing kind of across the class? Or anything else that's maybe keeping that growth a little bit below where you're expecting?

I know it's still relatively early days, but if you could just give a little more color on what your -- the feedback your getting from physicians on that product specifically relative to COSENTYX.

As you mentioned, it's still very early, especially with the specialty biologic like this in terms of the data flows and information that we would get. But thus far, we're very pleased with the initial performance of Taltz. If you look, for instance, at the IMS New to Brand NPA, just dermatology specialty focused data, we're bouncing around right at the Enbrel New to Brand level. We're closing in very closely on the COSENTYX New to Brand among derms there. Revenue in the second quarter totaled $19 million. A portion of that was wholesale stocking in there. But as I mentioned, with specialty products filling through specialty pharmacy channels, it will take a while before we get really complete data there. So I just want to caution that with IMS -- we can look at IMS a bit, but really, it's going to be when we see the actual script level data coming through the specialty pharmacy data flows that we'll have much more clarity. The feedback from physicians has been very positive. We're just hearing wonderful things anecdotally about their experiences with their patients in terms of their interactions with us. We think Taltz has a very attractive value proposition to our patients, to our physicians, to our payers, including our Taltz savings card, which I think is really important thing for folks to know about is with this Taltz savings card that we've got out there, the patients will pay as little as $5 a month if they're commercially insured and covered by their insurance. If they're commercially insured and are not covered by their insurance and have filed the script, had that denied and filed an appeal and had it denied, they will pay no more than $25 a month. This really removes a prescribing burden and hurdle for the physician, for the patient and the doctor's office in getting people initiated on the medicine. So right now, everything seems to be positive from the experience but in a wait-and-see mode. Thank you."

One, when it comes to bone fractures specific to canagliflozin, and then a strengthened warning on acute kidney injury that covers both Dapa and canagliflozin. All of these warnings or strengthened warnings come. We solve that counterbalance where today we cannot -- we're unable to promote our CV data until we basically get our label updated. So we continue to feel that the benefit risk profile of the class is very strong but that of Jardiance, in particular, given that we -- our data basically speaks for itself when it comes to some of these safety assessments and then also the benefit that -- when it comes to CV. When we look at the class in general, the class is growing year-to-date over 30%, and one can say that seems like a very good growth. But when we look a little more closely at the new patient starts and the growth of that, we basically see that completely flattening. And for that reason, we are a bit concerned.

We're excited about the galcanezumab program, which is the new name for CGRP antibody. Putting aside the cluster, which, again, has possibility to get to market earlier, although we have, as was mentioned earlier, a slowdown in the episodic cluster study. As it relates to migraine, we remain excited about the profile. It is very competitive, as you mentioned. There's at least 3 players kind of neck and neck from our read, execution and enrollment, and getting the studies complete is important. You'll see in ClinicalTrials.gov we've actually closed the submission-gating study, the critical pass study, which was the long-term safety study already. So that puts us on a good path to remain on track. Ultimately, I think the product profile will need to achieve the maximum effect possible via this mechanism with the minimally intrusive administration for patients. This will be a product used by healthy people in primary care offices and everyday neurologists. Simple injection and dosing protocols coupled with a very strong effect will win. That sounds kind of boiler plate, but I think we're testing a couple different dosing setups, others are testing different ones. But we'll just have to see who can produce the best numbers with the minimum doses. And I think that's what we'll be looking for as we read out the data sometime late next year."

So there's still some -- I guess some big unknowns up ahead, coupled with the sure patent losses that we're going to experience with products like Cialis and Strattera, for example. So while there's still a lot of moving parts, I think similar to sort of the guidance we provided back in late 2009, we were entering this patent expiration period, we want to provide some floor, some minimum set of expectations for investors recognizing that there are scenarios that could take that above that floor. Now we did call out the fact that we don't -- this does not contemplate major changes in government reimbursement policy. It does contemplate ALIMTA continuing to be patent protected in the U.S. through the early '20s. So with those caveats, I think that -- we feel very comfortable providing that as a framework for investors thinking about Lilly in the next 5 years with all these potential scenarios, a number of which could provide upside above this number and then coupled with the guidance we've given about not only our operating -- our OpEx to sales, but this morning, reaffirming our belief that we could also improve our gross margin as a percentage of sales over this period as well."

We recently have changed the design of our co-pay card so it's less generous than it used to be, but that takes a little bit of time to basically wash out. So we should expect an improving picture when it comes to that. In terms of Trulicity, we do have an interim later this year. It's -- clearly, we've all seen the LEADER data. Probably the best way to think about the interim for Trulicity, but if we were to expect a similar -- were to observe a similar hazard ratio versus what LEADER showed, we will not stop the trial. So given that we have -- we're going to have a significantly less number of events that basically Novo had at the conclusion of their own trial.

And that's where you've seen the kind of the decline in our gross margin rate over this YZ period. Going forward, it's really going to be dependent on the nature of the molecules and which ones are launching at what time. So if you look at products like Jardiance, we booked our portion of the income, so it actually has a boost to our gross margin as a percent relative to our base.

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me here in Indianapolis -- excuse me, on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratory; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Biomedicine; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Kristina Wright, Brad Robling, Chris Ogden *** and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team.
During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3  and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.
The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start, as usual, with a summary of our progress since the second quarter earnings call in late July, and I'll use our strategic objectives framework for this discussion.
Our first strategic objective, grow revenue. Q3 revenue increased 4% on a constant currency or performance basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. Consistent with previous quarters this year, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Portrazza and Taltz accounted for nearly all of that growth.
On our strategic objective, expand margins, our non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue declined 20 basis points compared to the third quarter 2015. We expect continued progress in the fourth quarter as our full year guidance at the midpoint of our ranges implies an improvement of about 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue for the year.
Under the heading of Sustaining the Flow of Innovation, olaratumab was approved in the U.S. last week for soft tissue sarcoma and will be sold under the trade name Lartruvo.
Europe CHMP provided positive opinions, recommending approval of olaratumab to soft tissue sarcoma and of Glyxambi for type 2 diabetes. And along with AstraZeneca, we received fast-track designation from the U.S. FDA for AZD3293, the oral-based inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease.
On our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value, we announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim's U.S. Animal Health vaccines business, filling a key strategic need in our companion animal portfolio. In both human pharma and animal health, we will continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
Finally, during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our dividend.
In summary, the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020.
Now let's move on to a review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call.
We continue to make progress on the regulatory front. As I just mentioned here in the U.S., the FDA approved Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with soft tissue sarcoma with a histologic subtype for which an anthracycline-containing regiment is appropriate and which is not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery. This is the first FDA approved front-line therapy for soft tissue sarcoma in 4 decades. It also marks the third product from our ImClone acquisition to receive regulatory approval. This is an accelerated approval based on data from our Phase II trial. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory study. The Phase III announced study is fully enrolled and is currently expected to complete in late 2018.
In Europe, we received a pair of recommendations for approval from the CHMP. The first recommendation was for granting a conditional marketing authorization for Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery and who have not been previously treated with doxorubicin.
Similar to the U.S., Lartruvo was reviewed under the EMA's accelerated assessment program. As part of the conditional marketing authorization, we will need to provide results from our ongoing Phase III study. Until availability of the full data, the CHMP will review the benefits and risks of Lartruvo annually to determine whether the conditional marketing authorization can be maintained.
The second recommendation was for Glyxambi, a single tablet combining Jardiance, our SGLT-2 inhibitor, and Trajenta, a DPP-4 inhibitor. The specific recommendation was for use in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control when metformin and/or sulphonylurea and one of the individual components of Glyxambi do not provide adequate glycemic control or when a patient is already being treated with the free combination of Jardiance and Trajenta. Glyxambi, Jardiance and Trajenta are products of the Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly diabetes alliance.
Finally, along with AstraZeneca, we received fast-track designation from the FDA for AZD3293, an oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme, or BACE inhibitor, being studied in Phase III trials for Alzheimer's disease.
On the clinical front, we announced that following a preplanned interim analysis for MONARCH 2, an independent data monitoring committee provided the recommendation to continue the study without modification as the interim efficacy criteria were not met. The MONARCH 2 trial compares abemaciclib with fulvestrant versus placebo -- versus placebo with fulvestrant in women with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The trial will continue to completion in the first half of 2017.
At the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting, early data in lung cancer were presented on the combinations of Keytruda with Alimta and of Keytruda with Cyramza. KEYNOTE-021, a randomized Phase II study, included cohort G, studying Keytruda added to Alimta plus carboplatin versus Alimta plus carboplatin in first line nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer patients regardless of PD-L1 expression level. The combination of Keytruda and Alimta carbo nearly doubled the response rate compared to Alimta carbo alone. There's been considerable focus within the investment community on the durability of responses. In this study, we were very pleased that patients on the Keytruda-Alimta-carbo arm experienced progression-free survival of 13 months. While the overall survival data were not yet mature, roughly 75% of patients on both arms were still alive at 1 year. This is at the top end of results we've seen for any combination trial in a broad population of first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients, and we look forward to the presentation of additional data from this trial at future medical conferences.
Updated data were also presented from the KEYNOTE-098 study, evaluating Keytruda with Cyramza in second to fourth line non-small cell lung cancer. Here, too, we observed promising clinical activity, including durable responses. 80% of patients experienced a decrease in target lesions, spanning the spectrum of PD-L1 status, while the objective response rate was 30%, with responses seen in both nonsquamous and squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. In addition, the disease control rate was 85%, and median progression-free survival was not yet reached.
The data from both KEYNOTE-021G and KEYNOTE-098 provide proof points for how we intend to deploy our diverse oncology portfolio across the 3 platforms of cell signaling, tumor microenvironment and immuno-oncology to pursue a rational and differentiated combination strategy across our diverse oncology portfolio in order to improve outcomes for patients.
Shifting to immunology. I'm pleased to report that we achieved a primary endpoint in the SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who had been treated with one or more conventional DMARDs as well as had an inadequate response to 1 or 2 TNF inhibitors or intolerance to a TNF inhibitor.
The results of SPIRIT-P2 further build on the existing benefit risk profile of Taltz, obtained from a very large clinical program. With this second positive psoriatic arthritis study, we plan to submit ixekizumab for psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. in the first half of next year followed by submissions in Europe and other geographies, and we plan to present the data at a medical meeting in 2017. Keep in mind that psoriatic arthritis has already been approved in Japan.
At the EADV meeting in Vienna, we also presented initial data on our head-to-head study called IXORA-S of Taltz versus Stelara in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The primary endpoint of this study was met as Taltz demonstrated superiority to Stelara on the PASI 90 score at 12 weeks. These data reinforce the strong clinical profile of Taltz, and we look forward to preventing -- to presenting additional data from this study next year.
As expected, earlier this month, we achieved last patient visit in the EXPEDITION3 trial, solanezumab, in patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. As a result, we plan to issue a top line press release before the end of the year.
In other news. We announced the retirement of yours truly as President and Chief Executive Officer effective December 31 of this year. I will continue on Lilly's Board of Directors until the end of May, serving as nonexecutive Chairman. Dave Ricks, currently President of Lilly Biomedicine, will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer and join the board on January 1. Dave will become Chairman of the Board on June 1.
We announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim that Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies vaccines portfolio as well as a fully integrated manufacturing and R&D site and a number of pipeline assets for approximately $885 million, including the estimated cost of acquired inventory. This innovative platform of companion animal vaccines has high brand awareness and an established loyal customer base. The addition of these assets advances our strategy of offering a balanced portfolio to both prevent and treat disease. This acquisition is subject to FTC approval and closing of the BI-Sanofi asset swap. We expect to close the deal early next year.
The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled against Lilly and its partner, Acrux, in a patent case for the testosterone treatment, Axiron, ruling that Axiron's formulation and axilla application patents are invalid and the applicator patent, although valid, would not be infringed by generic competitors.
We have appealed the ruling. The formulation patent expires in February 2017, while the axilla application and applicator patents expire in 2027. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined that the method-of-use patents for Effient are invalid. Lilly, Daiichi Sankyo and Ube strongly disagree with the PTO's ruling regarding validity of the Effient method-of-use patent and have appealed the ruling.
Separately, next steps are being discussed with the District Court in ongoing litigation on both the method-of-use patents and the compound patent. As a reminder, the method-of-use patents expire in 2023, while the compound patent expires in April of 2017, and we are entitled to pediatric exclusivity until October of 2017.
Finally, we distributed over $500 million to shareholders by our dividend. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. As we announced on our second quarter earnings call, we do expect to provide annual increases in our dividend, and we'll continue to balance share repurchase with external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil."

Thank you, John.
Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results.
I'll focus my comments this morning on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter GAAP results.
Looking at the non-GAAP measures on Slide 9, you can see that Q3 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q3 2015, reaching $5.2 billion.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.4 percentage points to 76.4%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in a benefit to both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit of this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year.
Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 30 basis points, going from 75.2% in last year's quarter to 75.5% this quarter.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 4% compared to Q3 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, while R&D increased 8%. The slight increase in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products, largely offset by lower spending on late life cycle products. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs.
Other income and expense was income of $27 million this quarter compared to the $87 million reported in last year's quarter.
Our tax rate was 22%. This is a decrease of 290 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This decrease was primarily due to certain U.S. tax provisions, including R&tD tax credit that are in force in 2016, but it lapsed during last year's third quarter. 
At the bottom line, net income decreased 2% and earnings per share decreased 1%. 
Slide 10 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first 9 months of the year, while Slide 11 contains  a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details of these adjustments on Slides 24 and 25.
Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume and revenue growth. On Slide 12 in the yellow highlighted raw at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 5% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, driven entirely by volumes. 
By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased to 17%, driven primarily by volume. Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth with meaningful contributions also coming from Humalog and Taltz. 
Having completed the take back of North American rights for ERBITUX on October 1 last year, we also benefited from booking M sales of ERBITUX this quarter. 
As in our press release issued earlier this morning, we've experienced less product returns than anticipated for Cymbalta posed as patent expirations, leading to a reduction in the returns reserved this quarter of approximately $145 million. Excluding this item, our U.S. Pharma revenue grew 10% this quarter with an 11% increase due to higher volume and a 1% decline due to lower realized prices. 
The decline in EuCan revenue of 8% was driven by the negative effect of price, and to a lesser extent, lower volumes and unfavorable FX movements. On a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 6%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower volume and price for Zymbalta and ALIMTA following patent expirations, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including Trulicity, Basaglar, and Jardiance as well as higher sales of Humalog, TRADJENTA and Cialis. 
In Japan, pharma revenue increased 15% in total, driven by an 18% benefit from a stronger yen, and to a lesser extent, increased volume, partially offset by a 6% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts. 
On a constant-currency basis, Japan pharma revenue decreased 3%. This performance decline was attributable to the entry of generic alliance team this past June. Excluding Zyprexa, Japan pharma revenue in Q3 grew 6% on a constant-currency basis, led by with additional contributions from Cymbalta, Strattera, Trulicity, Basaglar and Jardiance. 
Turning to emerging markets. We saw revenue declined 8%, primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange. 
On a performance basis, our emerging markets revenue decreased 3% due to lower volumes for all patent brands, including Cialis, Zyprexa, ALIMTA and Cymbalta, partially offset by higher volumes for , Trulicity, TRADJENTA and Cyramza. 
Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 7% due to foreign exchange, while revenue was flat on a constant-currency basis. Changes in order timing from our distributors negatively affected growth this quarter while positively affecting growth last quarter. We estimate that growth in underlying demand for our products in China this quarter was about 5%.
Turning to animal health. This quarter, worldwide revenue decreased 9%, both in total and on a constant-currency basis, including a 14% decline in companion animal and a 6% in food animal. 
Animal health revenue was significantly impacted by distributor inventory destocking in the quarter following a change over to SAP at the end of Q2. This inventory impact represented the majority of the decline in companion animal revenue in Q3 and has contributed to the volatility in our animal health results. 
In food animal, economic weakness in Latin America, combined with market access pressures in the U.S., contributed to lower revenue in the quarter. Note that on a year-to-date basis, which includes the SAP inventory impact in both Q2 and Q3, animal health revenue is flat.
On Slide 13, you'll find the same price rate and volume analysis, but on a year-to-date basis. As I mentioned earlier, excluding foreign exchange, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter with nearly all of that growth coming from higher volume. In total, our new products, Trulicity,, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar and Portrazza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. 
Slide 14 showed that these products drove 6.6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. and contributed nearly 2 percentage points to our volume growth, while Humalog contributed nearly 1 percentage point. 
You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror, still provide a drag of roughly 2 percentage points on our volume growth. 
Specifically on Humalog, you will see that U.S. sales this quarter are down 14% as higher volume was more than offset by lower realized prices. This quarter's net realized price was negatively affected by changes and estimates for rebates and discounts. 
Normalizing for changes in estimates for rebates and discounts in both Q3 2016 and Q3 2015, the underlying U.S. sales trend for the quarter for Humalog was basically flat. Now let me turn the call over to Derica."

As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on new product launches. 
During the Q&A session, Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more detail.
As you can see on the graph on Slide 15, our new products generated over $500 million in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This [indiscernible] about 10% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 8% last quarter. 
And as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove over 6.5 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter. We continue to be pleased with the uptake of Trulicity. Here in the U.S., we're capturing nearly 30% of new patient starts in the GLP-1 class. In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the class itself with the U.S. GLP-1 market growing nearly 30%. 
As I mentioned last quarter, in many OUS markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with the early uptake of .
Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan. OUS markets now account for nearly 60% of our worldwide Cyramza sales, and we look forward to continue growth in these markets not in only gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications.
U.S. Cyramza sales declined this quarter, largely as a result of competitive pressure from immuno-oncology therapies and non-small cell lung cancer, while our share of marketing and gastric cancer has been relatively stable.
Moving to Jardiance. While less than we expected, the SGLT2  class in the U.S. is growing over 20%, and our new to therapy with endocrinologist is now over 35%. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we expect FDA action in the outcome submission in early December and continue to see an update of the Jardiance label to reflect the compelling CB data for infrared outcome as the catalyst for the growing of the class and of Jardiance.
Taltz, which launched in the U.S. in April, is off to an excellent start. We're seeing strong growth of IL-17 class of psoriasis and are pleased that our New to Brand share market with dermatologists, a proxy for use in psoriasis, is already over 10%. While it's still early in our OUS launches, feedback has been positive and we look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
The rollout of 8 Basaglar in OUS country continues, and we are preparing for our U.S. launch in mid-December. 
Finally, we continue to see strong uptake of I/O agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is clearly affecting use of Portrazza. 
Moving to Slide 16. You'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rate on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 4%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 4% was in line with revenue growth, while non-GAAP operating expenses grew just slightly faster than revenue at 5%. 
Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 2% and non-GAAP EPS increased 1%.
Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 17 shows our pipeline as of October 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrow showing progression in red arrow showing movement out of the portfolio.
In our pipeline, you'll see the green arrow denoting FDA approval of in soft tissue sarcoma. We began Phase II testing of 2 molecules, the low-dose BACE inhibitor that we discussed at our Alzheimer's disease meeting last December and the BTK inhibitor in immunology we licensed with OMNI. 
We also started Phase I testing for a small molecule cancer compound, and we terminated development of 2 Phase I oncology assets and of , a monoclonal antibody for osteoporosis.
In our pipeline, as shown on Slide 18, we began a Phase III study of solanezumab and Alzheimer's disease. Currently, we plan to recruit nearly 2,500 amyloid-positive patients for this study. The blinded treatment period will be 24 months, and we anticipate trial completion in mid-2021. 
On solanezumab, John mentioned earlier that we are on track to issue the top line press release for EXPEDITION3 before the end of the year. I'd also note that we have a small number of investor interactions with management scheduled this quarter, and all of these interactions will occur before management sees the EXPEDITION3 study results.
If we hit the most aggressive time line for moving from last patient visit to database lock, we may be able to present the EXPEDITION3 data at the Meeting in December. However, it is also quite possible that we will not present the data at a medical meeting until next year. Should we present the EXPEDITION3 data at , the presentation will be made available via a live webcast open to the investment community. So live participation will not be required to access the information in realtime.
Turning to Slide 19. Let's recap the recent progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green check marks for the initiation of Phase III study of solanezumab and Alzheimer's disease. The internal data read out that John mentioned earlier of the Phase III SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis, the presentation at EADV of data from the XRS study evaluating ixekizumab head-to-head against and psoriasis and the U.S. approval of soft tissue sarcoma. 
Also, way that we thought that might occur in 2016, which is now expected in 2017 action on Cialis pediatric exclusivity, while another is expected in 2018, the of or headache readout for . The cost of headache readout for solanezumab. 
Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on Slide 20. At the high level, our expectations are largely unchanged. You'll see that our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is unchanged. While we've made small adjustments to our GAAP earnings per share guidance range as well as to our right-out-of-guidance for revenue, SG&A expenses, other income and capital expenditures. 
In summary, our Q3 financial performance places us on track to achieve our full year guidance. 
In the quarter, we posted revenue growth of 4% on a constant-currency basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. We made progress in the pipeline with the FDA approval of Lartruvo, recommendations for approval of Olaratumab and in Europe and granting an FDA fast-track status for our base inhibitor AZD3293. We continue to have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. And as we transition to the leadership next year, our management team will remain focused on executing our strategy to create value for all stakeholders including the shareholders.
We also remain firmly committed to achieving the mid-term financial goals we articulated on our earnings call in July, which included: driving a minimum of 5% compounded annual revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, even without solanezumab; reducing OpEx as a percentage of revenue to 50% or less in 2018; increasing our gross margin as a percent of revenue in 2020 compared to 2015; launching 20 or more new products in the decade from 2014 through 2023; and providing annual dividend increases to our shareholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate a Q&A. So we've got nearly an hour for the Q&A session. I would like to get to as many of the callers on the line as possible.

Or is there other alternative to get no mention of that in the indication section, but the infrared trial mentioned in the label somewhere. If you can talk about those 2 possible scenarios.  And what they mean in terms of consensus expectations? Secondly, just curious to know what's happening with pricing in diabetes. Because it does seem to be getting worse. You talked about rebates and discounts with Humalog and it also seems that we're seeing some kind of discounting in a SGLT-2 just based on Canis recent performance and their weakness too to discounting. So if you could talk about that as well."

So when it comes to the Jardiance review by the FDA, we did get this 3 months extension on the action date and the action date is now December  4 of this year. It's difficult to say always what drives that, but the FDA considers some additional information and assess the -- we have provided basically major amendments and they basically have the right to do so. I would highlight that this is not the only major amendment that has happened in the diabetes area. There've been a number of 3 months extensions, but I don't think it will be appropriate for the color this in any way, positive or negative. When it comes to the indication and the label, as you know, we have basically requested a separate distinct indication for Jardiance, given the data from the outcome. Something along the lines of reducing the incidence of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. We believe that the data wants this type of indication. Clearly, there are a number of different potential outcomes when it comes to the label that we would get there it's -- the FDA's reviewing the label and it's probably not appropriate for me to comment more at this stage, given that the action date is getting very near. I will continue to highlight that I believe we have the strength of the to be able to have a new indication. Clearly, whether we have -- in particular, in the U.S., having an indication does make an important difference so we are seeking that. Of course, we -- if the clinical data is included in the body of the label, yes, we could still make a claim, but the strength of the claim is not the same. So we view this as important for us and for Jardiance and for Lilly and BI. But let me answer your question on pricing in diabetes. First, when it comes to -- as was stated as part of the remarks by Phil, when we normalize for changes in the estimates of rebates and discounts for both Q3 and Q4, we basically see, in the case of Humalog, that our normalized sales would have been minus 1% instead of minus 14%. Now minus 1% still implies a pretty important impact. It implies lower prices because we grew volume 10% with Humalog in the U.S. So that's basically minus 11% when it comes to price. What are we seeing? Well, we're seeing 2 things: increased rebates across the board, but in particular, when it comes to Part D, a lift from how Lilly views this business; and we basically see a significant more of business flowing through less profitable books of business, less profitable channels. Medicare, Medicaid, charge backs. So as we look of this books of business, there's been an acceleration of those books of business at the expense of commercial and cash. So those impacts are pretty significant. Now you have seen that in the case of Humalog, we have quite a bit of volatility. We expect for this volatility, unfortunately, to continue, given that we make estimates at the end of each quarter on those rebates and discounts. But we find out what those -- where the product flow through, which books of business afterwards, and in some quarters, many quarters afterwards. So the last point that I would like because it's probably important as you look at your different models and as we think about the Humalog and what is the ongoing growth trend for this product, as we look at the normalization that I referred to, 1/3 of that normalization refers to Q3 of 2016, 2/3 is really related to Q3 of 2015."

And the way we've set up the prodromal program, which has just begun, is there's a recruitment start with a special cohort that we can also evaluate more information on. We're doing this for a couple of reasons. The one of the reasons is the ability to stop the trial should EXPEDITION3 be negative. So it gated the investment in that way. As I said, we're not counting on that as the most probable scenario, but we're prepared for that contingency. We're excited about baricitinib 2. The profile from Phase III program for a very large studies is extremely positive. That is under review with the FDA, and we're anticipating a lot sometime in 2017. You're identifying a key issue and that class already is crowded. It is heavily managed by payers. Lilly has a strategy on baricitinib to really focus on the differentiation over the product versus the standards-of-care of methotrexate. And , we want to position the product in really the pre-biologic setting, and that may take some time to achieve as you're pointing out. However, I would say there are all kinds of payers and those that are more clinically focused and focused on improving outcomes for pretty significant condition, lifelong condition, for young people, RA, we think we can make early headway in those settings. Others, which may be more sensitive to rebate flow, et cetera, obviously, there's going to be more difficult, but I think Lilly's prepared to be patient and build out the product through time, reminding everyone that the current IT's very long and we have a long time to fulfill full value for baricitinib."

So there are other presentation that I have a list in front of me, but we can provide that in follow up. The second question is really what would change, going forward, if is positive? And I think here, we've given a lot of guidance without sola, but certainly, we would anticipate a rapid submission and introduction to the major markets in the normal kind of go-to-market commercialization effort that would come with that, which is typically expense followed by revenue. I would also say this will present 2 new opportunities for Lilly, I think, unique ones within the field of neuroscience and Alzheimer's. One would be to look at acceleration and sort of full funding for other Alzheimer's , particularly those with a database mechanisms. Certainly, with the lead that in sola, we would want to fast follow with other innovations we have coming. We are doing that, but we can always look at speed and voracity of that effort. And then finally, looking at combination and sequences of therapies that could be combined with solanezumab to further arrest the disease, that only make sense if solar works, and we have the sort of queued up certainly not in our funding and expense base today.  So there are many we'll have to prioritize amongst those.

What we found is that the more people become aware of what's at stake here and what's the likely outcomes of Proposition 61, the less -- the more they are prone to vote against it and vote it down. So we have a pretty big campaign under way in California right now to increase that level of awareness and, hopefully, to continue to shift voters toward a position of being against it for a whole variety of reasons. It's difficult to say the larger -- we're going to see some price release after the election. I think in terms of where drug pricing sort of fits in what I call the rhetoric, that you're always going to get in a campaign season, particularly one as polarizes as this one. so I think there may be some acute relief. I think the bigger question is if Hillary Clinton wins, what does she have in mind for health care. If Donald Trump wins,  what's the direction going to be? It's pretty clear whether you say you want to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Something needs to be done if we're going to render a sort of health insurance availability for everybody in this country sustainable on an ongoing basis. So I think that's going to be the bigger focus for the industry and sort of what happens in those probably critical first 2 years of the first term, which we know what happened in 2008 and 2009. I think that's what the industry has to be prepared for. At the same time, I think that, frankly, if we're successful with sola, the outcome of sola and there's hope for Alzheimer's, keep in mind that the top 10 causes of death in this country, I think I heard the other day that Alzheimer's is the only one where we continue to see increases in the rate of mortality. So I think if the  industry can demonstrate once again like we did with HIV, like we did with hepatitis C and so many other diseases that we can make an impact on something that increasingly everybody is fearful of and concerned about, I think that changes the dynamic too. We don't know what that outcome is going to be, but it's going to be a very interesting mix come January 1. And I'm sure Dave Ricks is ready to jump all over it."

I think it's important to remind everyone that given that the number of event that we have an interim is significantly lower than what we also had with leaders. So the hustle ratio for us to be significant will have to be quite impressive. We will see what the data says once we have the readouts."

Bottom line, our animal health quarterly results have been more volatile this year, as you know. Inventory de-stocking was a significant event in Q3, and it contributed to the revenue decline this quarter. We don't see these results as the trend. Just as we enjoyed the benefits, as you recall, of the distributor purchases in Q2 ahead of our SAP cutover in the U.S., inventories were depleted in Q3, which caused the majority of the decline in our companion animal business. So I would know if the SAP transition has gone very smoothly. On the companion animal side, our business is up 3% year-to-date, which really normalizes for the Q2 and the Q3 inventory impact. And what's driving this is 1 successful launches of some new innovation as well as, we believe, our improved competitiveness with the combination of Novartis and Elanco. On the food animal side, food animal is down 1% year-to-date. And really, outside the U.S., we've experienced weakness in Latin America. And really, this region represented the entire decline for our OUS food animal in Q3. And then in the U.S., we faced some market access challenges this quarter, in particular, and product and our U.S. swine business. Poor customers pursuing China export markets removed. They'll do that on and off. They'll come on and off the product, depending on meeting the export markets or not. So that, in summary -- and then as John noted, 2 weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of BIs companion animal vaccine business subject to the closing again of the BI Sanofi asset swap. We see this as a tremendous complement to our companion animal business in the U.S."

Some forms of the conditions are episodic. So while we recruited well the number of people in the program, we're waiting for the cluster events to start, which can demonstrate the value of the product. So that's part and parcel with any new pushing into new therapy area like this where studies haven't even been done before with medicines on a large-scale. But we're excited about that part of the program. Again, it'll be first with that indication, to our knowledge, gives us some, I think, credit with neurologist for tackling a tough condition and potentially some value support as we go-to-market.

I'll remind everyone that [indiscernible] 17 can be used without methotrexate, and you get sort of the stool, skin and joint benefit that's at least as good on a joint. We're encouraged by what we see so far in our estimates. Our own estimates actually have gone up since we started the program because treatment rates for PSA appeared to be quite a bit higher in psoriasis when it comes to using biologics. Just to give everyone a bit of a frame on that, when you look at products that are indicated only for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, take, for instance, they actually have a little bit more volume coming out of non-derms than derms right now. And I think that indicates that although the incidence rate is lower for PSA, rheumatologists are more comparable with Biologics than treating PSA at a higher rate. As far as, I would say, an even more an undeveloped opportunity, in particular, Lilly's program will feature the potential to be indicated in nonradiographic. So there's an absence of x-ray proof in the condition. This is a recognized indication in Europe, but not yet by the FDA. Should we achieve that, I think that presents a very significant market expansion opportunity for where the biologic basis of the condition is known to be quite similar to PSA and psoriasis. So there's a lot of promise being held out for the class in . We see some early data from in that regard we're using even high doses. So I think we are optimistic on all those indications as being meaningful part of the ultimate success story of Taltz."

And as we look at class growth, we have shared and we have been concerned with the overall growth that we're seeing in the issue of the 2 class in the U.S. The class, as we look at the last 4 weeks relative to the same 4 weeks of last year, is only growing about 20%. That's significant below our expectations. We are hopeful that the inclusion of the outcome on the label would be a catalyst for the overall growth, and we feel confident that we can get the right language that we'll be able to make a huge value for proposition for this product in the eyes of our customers. As we look at the SGLT2 class growth, it's a little bit different outside of the U.S. In Europe, the class is expected to double. Same case in Japan, more than double in Japan in 2016. Yes, from a slower base, but -- from a smaller base, but the growth dynamics, I think, are very encouraging. We are doing fairly well when it comes to share. We are -- we now have a 30% share in the U.S. Our overall share in Germany is nearly 40% and above 4% [ph] in Italy and basically growing in Spain, U.K., Canada. So I feel very good about the position that we have within the class itself. Now on the pricing question and rebates, I did comment on some of the co-pay cards and some of the impact of those. I also mentioned that the impact of the co-pay cards is going to lessen over time because there's a duration of these co-pay cards. So while we have implemented some of those changes, we have enough patients on these co-pay cards already and some of them are also on the market. So we expect this to be a long-term phenomenon. We will see this decreasing over time."

I think, overall, at a high level as we noted last December in our Investor Conference, we are going through a transition period. What I would note is yes, the SAP cutover is complete and that volatility is completed. So we do see less volatility going forward. I think we're keeping our eyes on a few things that are absolutely critical for animal health business. One, our animal competitiveness, as I've said, we feel very good about that. Some of our growth engines like our vaccine business and expansion of that. And then we noted 7 big products that were critical for innovation, which, you know, drives animal health just like pharma. We put 5 of those 7 products into the market and there'll be foundational to our growth going forward. And then on the margin side, we continue to stay focused on the margins where we're moving to that low- to mid- 20s, and we see that happening in 2016. So overall, Elanco or animal health business is well positioned in the top Tier 2 to remain competitive in this competitive consolidating industry."

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me here in Indianapolis -- excuse me, on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratory; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Biomedicine; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Kristina Wright, Brad Robling, Chris Ogden and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team.
During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.
The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start, as usual, with a summary of our progress since the second quarter earnings call in late July, and I'll use our strategic objectives framework for this discussion.
Our first strategic objective, grow revenue. Q3 revenue increased 4% on a constant currency or performance basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. Consistent with previous quarters this year, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Portrazza and Taltz accounted for nearly all of that growth.
On our strategic objective, expand margins, our non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue declined 20 basis points compared to the third quarter 2015. We expect continued progress in the fourth quarter as our full year guidance at the midpoint of our ranges implies an improvement of about 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue for the year.
Under the heading of Sustaining the Flow of Innovation, olaratumab was approved in the U.S. last week for soft tissue sarcoma and will be sold under the trade name Lartruvo.
Europe CHMP provided positive opinions, recommending approval of olaratumab to soft tissue sarcoma and of Glyxambi for type 2 diabetes. And along with AstraZeneca, we received fast-track designation from the U.S. FDA for AZD3293, the oral-based inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease.
On our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value, we announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim's U.S. Animal Health vaccines business, filling a key strategic need in our companion animal portfolio. In both human pharma and animal health, we will continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
Finally, during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our dividend.
In summary, the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020.
Now let's move on to a review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call.
We continue to make progress on the regulatory front. As I just mentioned here in the U.S., the FDA approved Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with soft tissue sarcoma with a histologic subtype for which an anthracycline-containing regiment is appropriate and which is not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery. This is the first FDA approved front-line therapy for soft tissue sarcoma in 4 decades. It also marks the third product from our ImClone acquisition to receive regulatory approval. This is an accelerated approval based on data from our Phase II trial. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory study. The Phase III announced study is fully enrolled and is currently expected to complete in late 2018.
In Europe, we received a pair of recommendations for approval from the CHMP. The first recommendation was for granting a conditional marketing authorization for Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery and who have not been previously treated with doxorubicin.
Similar to the U.S., Lartruvo was reviewed under the EMA's accelerated assessment program. As part of the conditional marketing authorization, we will need to provide results from our ongoing Phase III study. Until availability of the full data, the CHMP will review the benefits and risks of Lartruvo annually to determine whether the conditional marketing authorization can be maintained.
The second recommendation was for Glyxambi, a single tablet combining Jardiance, our SGLT-2 inhibitor, and Trajenta, a DPP-4 inhibitor. The specific recommendation was for use in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control when metformin and/or sulphonylurea and one of the individual components of Glyxambi do not provide adequate glycemic control or when a patient is already being treated with the free combination of Jardiance and Trajenta. Glyxambi, Jardiance and Trajenta are products of the Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly diabetes alliance.
Finally, along with AstraZeneca, we received fast-track designation from the FDA for AZD3293, an oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme, or BACE inhibitor, being studied in Phase III trials for Alzheimer's disease.
On the clinical front, we announced that following a preplanned interim analysis for MONARCH 2, an independent data monitoring committee provided the recommendation to continue the study without modification as the interim efficacy criteria were not met. The MONARCH 2 trial compares abemaciclib with fulvestrant versus placebo -- versus placebo with fulvestrant in women with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The trial will continue to completion in the first half of 2017.
At the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting, early data in lung cancer were presented on the combinations of Keytruda with Alimta and of Keytruda with Cyramza. KEYNOTE-021, a randomized Phase II study, included cohort G, studying Keytruda added to Alimta plus carboplatin versus Alimta plus carboplatin in first line non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer patients regardless of PD-L1 expression level. The combination of Keytruda and Alimta carbo nearly doubled the response rate compared to Alimta carbo alone. There's been considerable focus within the investment community on the durability of responses. In this study, we were very pleased that patients on the Keytruda-Alimta-carbo arm experienced progression-free survival of 13 months. While the overall survival data were not yet mature, roughly 75% of patients on both arms were still alive at 1 year. This is at the top end of results we've seen for any combination trial in a broad population of first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients, and we look forward to the presentation of additional data from this trial at future medical conferences.
Updated data were also presented from the KEYNOTE-098 study, evaluating Keytruda with Cyramza in second to fourth line non-small cell lung cancer. Here, too, we observed promising clinical activity, including durable responses. 80% of patients experienced a decrease in target lesions, spanning the spectrum of PD-L1 status, while the objective response rate was 30%, with responses seen in both non-squamous and squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. In addition, the disease control rate was 85%, and median progression-free survival was not yet reached.
The data from both KEYNOTE-021G and KEYNOTE-098 provide proof points for how we intend to deploy our diverse oncology portfolio across the 3 platforms of cell signaling, tumor microenvironment and immuno-oncology to pursue a rational and differentiated combination strategy across our diverse oncology portfolio in order to improve outcomes for patients.
Shifting to immunology. I'm pleased to report that we achieved a primary endpoint in the SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who had been treated with one or more conventional DMARDs as well as had an inadequate response to 1 or 2 TNF inhibitors or intolerance to a TNF inhibitor.
The results of SPIRIT-P2 further build on the existing benefit risk profile of Taltz, obtained from a very large clinical program. With this second positive psoriatic arthritis study, we plan to submit ixekizumab for psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. in the first half of next year followed by submissions in Europe and other geographies, and we plan to present the data at a medical meeting in 2017. Keep in mind that psoriatic arthritis has already been approved in Japan.
At the EADV meeting in Vienna, we also presented initial data on our head-to-head study called IXORA-S of Taltz versus Stelara in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The primary endpoint of this study was met as Taltz demonstrated superiority to Stelara on the PASI 90 score at 12 weeks. These data reinforce the strong clinical profile of Taltz, and we look forward to preventing -- to presenting additional data from this study next year.
As expected, earlier this month, we achieved last patient visit in the EXPEDITION3 trial, solanezumab, in patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. As a result, we plan to issue a top line press release before the end of the year.
In other news. We announced the retirement of yours truly as President and Chief Executive Officer effective December 31 of this year. I will continue on Lilly's Board of Directors until the end of May, serving as nonexecutive Chairman. Dave Ricks, currently President of Lilly Biomedicine, will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer and join the board on January 1. Dave will become Chairman of the Board on June 1.
We announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim that Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies vaccines portfolio as well as a fully integrated manufacturing and R&D site and a number of pipeline assets for approximately $885 million, including the estimated cost of acquired inventory. This innovative platform of companion animal vaccines has high brand awareness and an established loyal customer base. The addition of these assets advances our strategy of offering a balanced portfolio to both prevent and treat disease. This acquisition is subject to FTC approval and closing of the BI-Sanofi asset swap. We expect to close the deal early next year.
The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled against Lilly and its partner, Acrux, in a patent case for the testosterone treatment, Axiron, ruling that Axiron's formulation and axilla application patents are invalid and the applicator patent, although valid, would not be infringed by generic competitors.
We have appealed the ruling. The formulation patent expires in February 2017, while the axilla application and applicator patents expire in 2027. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined that the method-of-use patents for Effient are invalid. Lilly, Daiichi Sankyo and Ube strongly disagree with the PTO's ruling regarding validity of the Effient method-of-use patent and have appealed the ruling.
Separately, next steps are being discussed with the District Court in ongoing litigation on both the method-of-use patents and the compound patent. As a reminder, the method-of-use patents expire in 2023, while the compound patent expires in April of 2017, and we are entitled to pediatric exclusivity until October of 2017.
Finally, we distributed over $500 million to shareholders by our dividend. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. As we announced on our second quarter earnings call, we do expect to provide annual increases in our dividend, and we'll continue to balance share repurchase with external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil."

Thank you, John.
Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results.
I'll focus my comments this morning on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter GAAP results.
Looking at the non-GAAP measures on Slide 9, you can see that Q3 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q3 2015, reaching $5.2 billion.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.4 percentage points to 76.4%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in a benefit to both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit of this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year.
Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 30 basis points, going from 75.2% in last year's quarter to 75.5% this quarter.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 4% compared to Q3 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, while R&D increased 8%. The slight increase in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products, largely offset by lower spending on late life cycle products. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs.
Other income and expense was income of $27 million this quarter compared to the $87 million reported in last year's quarter.
Our tax rate was 22%. This is a decrease of 290 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This decrease was primarily due to certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit that are in force in 2016, but it lapsed during last year's third quarter.
At the bottom line, net income decreased 2%, and earnings per share decreased 1%.
Slide 10 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first 9 months of the year, while Slide 11 contains a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 24 and 25.
Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On Slide 12 in the yellow-highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 5% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, driven entirely by volumes.
By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 17%, driven primarily by volume. Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Humalog and Taltz.
Having completed the take back of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1 last year, we also benefited from booking and sales of Erbitux this quarter.
As cited in our press release issued earlier this morning, we have experienced less product returns than anticipated for Cymbalta post its patent expirations, leading to a reduction in the returns reserved this quarter of approximately $145 million. Excluding this item, our U.S. Pharma revenue grew 10% this quarter, with an 11% increase due to higher volume and a 1% decline due to lower realized prices.
The decline in EuCan revenue of 8% was driven by the negative effect of price, and to a lesser extent, lower volumes and unfavorable FX movements. On a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 6%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower volume and price for Cymbalta and Alimta following patent expirations, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including Trulicity, Basaglar, Cyramza and Jardiance as well as higher sales of Humalog, Trajenta and Cialis.
In Japan, pharma revenue increased 15% in total, driven by an 18% benefit from a stronger yen, and to a lesser extent, increased volume, partially offset by a 6% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts.
On a constant-currency basis, Japan pharma revenue decreased 3%. This performance decline was attributable to the entry of generic olanzapine this past June. Excluding Zyprexa, Japan pharma revenue in Q3 grew 6% on a constant-currency basis, led by Cyramza, with additional contributions from Cymbalta, Strattera, Trulicity, Basaglar and Jardiance.
Turning to emerging markets. We saw revenue decline 8%, primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange.
On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue decreased 3% due to lower volumes for all patent brands, including Cialis, Zyprexa, Alimta and Cymbalta, partially offset by higher volumes for Humulin, Trulicity, Trajenta and Cyramza.
Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 7% due to foreign exchange, while revenue was flat on a constant-currency basis. Changes in order timing from our distributors negatively affected growth this quarter while positively affecting growth last quarter. We estimate the growth in underlying demand for our products in China this quarter was about 5%.
Turning to animal health. This quarter, worldwide revenue decreased 9%, both in total and on a constant-currency basis, including a 14% decline in companion animal and a 6% in food animal.
Animal health revenue was significantly impacted by distributor inventory de-stocking in the quarter, following a change over to SAP at the end of Q2. This inventory impact represented the majority of the decline in companion animal revenue in Q3 and has contributed to the volatility in our animal health results.
In food animal, economic weakness in Latin America, combined with market access pressures in the U.S., contributed to lower revenue in the quarter. Note that on a year-to-date basis, which includes the SAP inventory impact in both Q2 and Q3, animal health revenue is flat.
On Slide 13, you'll find the same price rate and volume analysis but on a year-to-date basis. As I mentioned earlier, excluding foreign exchange, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, with nearly all of that growth coming from higher volume. In total, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar and Portrazza, were the engine of our worldwide volume growth.
Slide 14 shows that these products drove 6.6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. The take back of Erbitux contributed nearly 2 percentage points to our volume growth, while Humalog contributed nearly 1 percentage point.
You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror, still provided a drag of roughly 2 percentage points on our volume growth.
Specifically on Humalog, you will see that the U.S. sales this quarter are down 14% as higher volume was more than offset by lower realized prices. This quarter's net realized price was negatively affected by changes and estimates for rebates and discounts.
Normalizing for changes in estimates for rebates and discounts in both Q3 2016 and Q3 2015, the underlying U.S. sales trend for the quarter for Humalog was basically flat.
Now let me turn the call over to Derica."

During the Q&A session, Sue, Enrique and Dave could provide more detail.As you can see on the graph on Slide 15, our new products generated over $500 million",1219,"Thanks, Phil.
As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on new product launches. During the Q&A session, Sue, Enrique and Dave could provide more detail.
As you can see on the graph on Slide 15, our new products generated over $500 million in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This represents about 10% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 8% last quarter. And as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove over 6.5 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter.
We continue to be pleased with the uptake of Trulicity. Here in the U.S., we're capturing nearly 30% of new patient starts in the GLP-1 class. In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the class itself, with the U.S. GLP-1 market growing nearly 30%.
As I mentioned last quarter, in many OUS markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with the early uptake of Victoza.
Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan. OUS markets now account for nearly 60% of our worldwide Cyramza sales, and we look forward to continue growth in these markets, not in only gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications.
U.S. Cyramza sales declined this quarter, largely as a result of competitive pressure from immuno-oncology therapies and non-small cell lung cancer, while our share of market in gastric cancer has been relatively stable.
Moving to Jardiance. While less than we expected, the SGLT-2 class in the U.S. is growing over 20%, and our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists is now over 35%. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we expect FDA action on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME submission in early December and continue to see an update of the Jardiance label to reflect the compelling CB data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME as a catalyst for the growing of the class and of Jardiance.
Taltz, which launched in the U.S. in April, is off to an excellent start. We're seeing strong growth of the IL-17 class of psoriasis and are pleased that our New to Brand share of market with dermatologists, a proxy for use in psoriasis, is already over 10%. While it's still early in our OUS launches, feedback has been positive, and we look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
The rollout of Abasaglar in OUS countries continues, and we are preparing for our U.S. launch in mid-December.
Finally, we continue to see strong uptake of I/O agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is clearly affecting use of Portrazza.
Moving to Slide 16. You'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 4%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 4% was in line with revenue growth, while non-GAAP operating expenses grew just slightly faster than revenue at 5%.
Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 2% and non-GAAP EPS increased 1%.
Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 17 shows our pipeline as of October 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrow showing progression and red arrow showing movement out of the portfolio.
In our NME pipeline, you'll see the green arrow denoting FDA approval of Lartruvo in soft tissue sarcoma. We began Phase II testing of 2 molecules, the low-dose BACE inhibitor that we discussed at our Alzheimer's disease meeting last December and the BTK inhibitor in immunology we licensed with Hanmi.
We also started Phase I testing for a small molecule cancer compound, and we terminated development of 2 Phase I oncology assets and of blosozumab, a sclerostin monoclonal antibody for osteoporosis.
In our NILEX pipeline, as shown on Slide 18, we began a Phase III study of solanezumab and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Currently, we plan to recruit nearly 2,500 amyloid-positive patients for this study. The blinded treatment period will be 24 months, and we anticipate trial completion in mid-2021.
On solanezumab, John mentioned earlier that we are on track to issue the top line press release for EXPEDITION3 before the end of the year. I'd also note that we have a small number of investor interactions with management scheduled this quarter, and all of these interactions will occur before management sees the EXPEDITION3 study results.
If we hit the most aggressive time line from moving from last patient visit to database lock, we may be able to present the EXPEDITION3 data at the CTAD meeting in December. However, it is also quite possible that we will not present the data at a medical meeting until next year. Should we present the EXPEDITION3 data at CTAD, the presentation will be made available via a live webcast open to the investment community. So live participation will not be required to access the information in realtime.
Turning to Slide 19. Let's recap the recent progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green check marks for: the initiation of Phase III study of solanezumab and prodromal Alzheimer's disease; the internal data read out that John mentioned earlier of the Phase III SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis; the presentation at EADV of data from the IXORA-S study evaluating ixekizumab head-to-head against Stelara and psoriasis; and the U.S. approval of Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma.
Also, one event we thought that might occur in 2016, which is now expected in 2017, action on Cialis pediatric exclusivity, while another is expected in 2018. The cluster headache readout for -- the cluster headache readout for galcanezumab.
Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on Slide 20. At a high level, our expectations are largely unchanged. You'll see that our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is unchanged. While we've made small adjustments to our GAAP earnings per share guidance range as well as to our line-out-of-guidance for revenue, SG&A expenses, other income and capital expenditures.
In summary, our Q3 financial performance places us on track to achieve our full year guidance. In the quarter, we posted revenue growth of 4% on a constant-currency basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. We made progress in the pipeline with the FDA approval of Lartruvo, recommendations for approval of Olaratumab and Glyxambi in Europe and granting of FDA fast-track status for our BACE inhibitor AZD3293. We continue to have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. And as we transition to the leadership next year, our management team will remain focused on executing our strategy to create value for all stakeholders, including the shareholders.
We also remain firmly committed to achieving the mid-term financial goals we articulated on our earnings call in July, which included: driving a minimum of 5% compounded annual revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, even without solanezumab; reducing OpEx as a percent of revenue to 50% or less in 2018; increasing our gross margin as a percent of revenue in 2020 compared to 2015; launching 20 or more new products in the decade from 2014 through 2023; and providing annual dividend increases to our shareholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session."

Or is the other alternative to get no mention of that in the indication section, but the EMPA-REG trial mentioned in the label somewhere. If you can talk about those 2 possible scenarios and what they mean in terms of consensus expectations. Secondly, just curious to know what's happening with pricing in diabetes because it does seem to be getting worse. You talked about rebates and discounts with Humalog, but we're -- it also seems that we're seeing some price discounting in SGLT-2s just based on INVOKANA's recent performance and their weakness due to discounting. So if you could talk about that as well."

So when it comes to the Jardiance review by the FDA, we did get this 3 months extension on the action date. The new action date is now December 4 of this year. It's difficult to say always what drives that, but the FDA considers some additional information, announcements that we had provided basically major amendments, and they basically have the right to do so. I would highlight that this is not the only major amendment that has happened in the diabetes area. There've been a number of 3 months extensions, but I don't think it will be appropriate to color this in any way, positive or negative. When it comes to the indication and the label, as you know, we have basically requested a separate distinct indication for Jardiance, given the data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME. Something along the lines of reducing the incidence of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. We believe that the data warrants this type of indication. Clearly, there are a number of different potential outcomes when it comes to the label that we would get. It's -- the FDA's in the -- reviewing the label, and it's probably not appropriate for me to comment more at this stage, given that the action date is getting very near. I will continue to highlight that I believe that we have the strength of the evidence to be able to have a new indication. Clearly, whether we have -- in particular, in the U.S., having an indication does make an important difference, so we are seeking that. Of course, we -- if the clinical data is included in the body of the label, yes, we could still make a claim, but the strength of the claim is not the same. So we view this as important for us and for Jardiance and for Lilly and BI. Let me answer your question on pricing in diabetes. First, when it comes to -- as it was stated as part of the remarks by Phil, when we normalize for changes in the estimates of rebates and discounts for both Q3 and Q4, we basically see, in the case of Humalog, that our normalized sales would have been minus 1% instead of minus 14%. Now minus 1% still implies a pretty important impact. It implies lower prices because we grew volume 10% with Humalog in the U.S. So that's basically minus 11% when it comes to price. What are we seeing? Well, we are seeing 2 things: increased rebates across the board, but in particular, when it comes to Part D, a lift from how Lilly views this business; and we basically see a significant, more business flowing through less profitable books of business, less profitable channels. Medicare, Medicaid, charge backs. So as we look at those books of business, there's been an acceleration of those books of business at the expense of commercial and cash. So those impacts are pretty significant. Now you have seen that in the case of Humalog, we had quite a bit of volatility. We expect for this volatility, unfortunately, to continue, given that we make estimates at the end of each quarter on those rebates and discounts. But we find out what those -- where the product flow through, which books of business afterwards, and in some cases, many quarters afterwards. So the last point that I would make because it's probably important, as you look at your different models and as we think about the Humalog and what is the ongoing growth trend for this product, as we look at the normalization that I referred to, 1/3 of that normalization refers to Q3 of 2016, 2/3 is really related to Q3 of 2015."

I know there's a fair amount of excitement around the upcoming launch and the profile. It does look promising, but I can't help but think that it's going to get meaningfully sidelined by pairs in the U.S., given how crowded this market is.

We continue to characterize this as a high-risk, high-reward program. The scenario you paint is what we think is the least probable, but it certainly could happen. In this scenario, sola would really not separate at all from placebo. I think we would be reevaluating all of the sola programs, frankly, Tim. And the way we've set up the prodromal program, which has just begun, is there's a recruitment start with a special cohort that we can also evaluate more information on. We're doing this for a couple of reasons. But one of the reasons is the ability to stop the trial should EXPEDITION3 be negative. So we've gated the investment in that way. As I said, we're not counting on that as the most probable scenario, but we prepared for that contingency. We're excited about baricitinib, too. The profile from the Phase III program, 4 very large studies is extremely positive. That drug is under review with the FDA, and we're anticipating a lot sometime in 2017. You're identifying a key issue in that class already is crowded. It is heavily managed by payers. Lilly has a strategy on baricitinib to really focus on the differentiation over the product versus the standards-of-care of methotrexate. And Humira, we want to position the product in really the pre-biologic setting, and that may take some time to achieve as you're pointing out. However, I would say there are all kinds of payers, and those that are more clinically focused and focused on improving outcomes for pretty significant condition, lifelong condition, for young people, RA, we think we can make early headway in those settings. Others, which may be more sensitive to rebate flow, et cetera, obviously, that's going to be more difficult, but I think Lilly's prepared to be patient and build out the product through time, reminding everyone that the current IP is very long, and we have a long time to fulfill full value for baricitinib.

It wasn't a full quarter.  Also vis-√†-vis, COSENTYX which enjoys 3 indications, like, only have the one in psoriasis, as was mentioned in the call text earlier. We do plan submissions now for PSA in the U.S. shortly. And we have an AxSpA program ongoing. So net-net, I think we're happy with where we are. Global rollouts are beginning in the second half of the year, as well, in Europe and Japan, which are also significant opportunities. We've got a lifecycle coming.

In regards to our operating expense spending in the third quarter, there was really nothing unusual or lack of transparency in terms of what we're doing behind-the-scenes.

And if you look at our total operating expenses for the quarter, our biggest growth was in that realm in terms of R&D, and it really is progressing -- continue to progress our pipeline and to pursue the opportunities that we have embedded there that we believe still keeps us on track to achieving that potential of 20 launches in a 10-year span. So whether you call it opportunistic, we see it more in a sustained fashion that this is what we've been geared up to do."

So from that perspective, this is important and this is important because also it really fully completes the diabetes portfolio that we can offer our customers. We now have a complete portfolio of full range of insulins, a GLP-1 with Trulicity and then great oral products. I would -- as we look at our performance in the U.S. market and in other major markets, we're actually growing market share with every single product.

From a differentiation perspective, they renew head to head, but if we look at bemaciclib it is -- we've seen single agent activity now in the MONARCH 1 trial and also it is still the near MONARACH data that was presented at ESMO, we saw single agent activity there. We see 14x more potency to CDK 4 and then CDK 6 for the bemaciclib. We continue to be able to dose these continuously and across the blood brain barrier, if I can say that.

So there are other presentation that I have a list in front of me, but we can provide that into follow-up. The second question is really what will change going forward, if solo is positive? And I think here, we've given long-term guidance without sola. But certainly, we would anticipate a rapid submission and introduction to the major markets in the normal kind of go-to-market commercialization effort that would come with that, which is typically expense followed by revenue. I would also say this will present 2 new opportunities for Lilly, I think, unique ones within the field of neuroscience and Alzheimer's. One would be to look at acceleration and sort of full funding for other Alzheimer's products, particularly those with A beta-based mechanisms. Certainly, with the lead like that of sola, we would want to fast follow with other innovations we have coming. We are doing that, but we can always look at speed and voracity of that effort. And then finally, looking at combinations and sequences of therapies that could be combined with solanezumab to further arrest the disease, that only make sense if sola works. And we have the sort of queued up but certainly not in our funding and expense base today.  So there are many we'll have to prioritize amongst those. And, I think, of course, the -- qualitatively, the way sola works will have some bearing on how much of that additional investment we would trigger."

It's not only bad legislation, it's bad for your health, and we're trying to oppress that on the voters. What we found is that the more people become aware of what's at stake here, and what's the likely outcomes of Proposition 61, the less they're -- the more they are prone to vote against it and vote it down. So we have a pretty big campaign underway in California, right now, to increase that level of awareness and, hopefully, to continue to shift voters toward a position of being against it for a whole variety of reasons. It's difficult to say the larger -- we're going to see some price release after the election. I think in terms of where drug pricing sort of fits in what I call the rhetoric, that you're always going to get in a campaign season, particularly one as polarized as this one. So I think there may be some acute relief. I think the bigger question is if Hillary Clinton wins, what does she have in mind for health care. If Donald Trump wins,  what's the direction going to be? It's pretty clear whether you say you want to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Something needs to be done if we're going to render a -- sort of a health insurance availability for everybody in this country sustainable on an ongoing basis. So I think that's going to be the bigger focus for the industry and sort of what happens in those probably critical first 2 years of the first term, which we know what happened in 2008, 2009. And I think that's what the industry has to be prepared for. At the same time, I think that, frankly, if we're successful in -- with sola, the outcome of sola and there's hope for Alzheimer's, keep in mind the top 10 causes of death in this country, I think I heard the other day Alzheimer's is the only one where we continue to see increases in the rate of mortality. So I think if the  industry can demonstrate once again like we did with HIV AIDS, like we did with Hepatitis C and so many other diseases that we can make an impact on something that increasingly everybody is fearful of and concerned about, I think that changes the dynamic too. We don't know what that outcome is going to be, but it's going to be a very interesting mix from January 1. And I'm sure Dave Ricks is ready to jump all over it."

Bottom line, our animal health quarterly results have been more volatile this year, as you know. Inventory destocking was a significant event in Q3, and it contributed to the revenue decline this quarter. We don't see these results as a trend. Just as we enjoyed the benefits, as you recall, of the distributor purchases in Q2 ahead of our SAP cutover in the U.S., inventories were depleted in Q3, which caused the majority of the decline in our companion animal business. So I would note, the SAP transition has gone very smoothly. On the companion animal side, our business is up 3% year-to-date, which really normalizes for the Q2 and the Q3 inventory impact. And what's driving this is one, successful launches of some new innovation as well as, we believe, our improved competitiveness with the combination of Novartis and Elanco. On the food animal side, food animal is down 1% year-to-date. And really, outside the U.S., we've experienced weakness in Latin America. And really, this region represented the entire decline for our OUS food animal in Q3. And then in the U.S., we faced some market access challenges this quarter, in particular, Paylean, a product in our U.S. swine business. Poor customers pursuing the China export markets removed Paylean. They'll do that on and off. They'll come on and off the product, depending on meeting the export markets or not. So that, that in summary. And then as John noted, 2 weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of BI's companion animal vaccine business subject to the closing again of the BI Sanofi asset swap. We see this as a tremendous complement to our companion animal business in the U.S."

What I here estimate is as we look forward to the future indications, what's -- how do we think about the size of this market. I would say on PSA, which would be the next one for us based on differentiation we think we have versus standards-of-care, like Humira, reminding everyone that  IL-17s can be used without methotrexate, and you get sort of the stool, skin and joint benefit that's at least as good on a joint. We're encouraged by what we see so far in our estimates. Our own estimates actually have gone up since we started the program because treatment rates for PSA appeared to be quite a bit higher in psoriasis when it comes to using biologics. Just to give everyone a bit of frame on that, when you look at products that are indicated only for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, take [indiscernible], for instance, they actually have a little bit more volume coming out of nonderms than derms right now. And I think that indicates that although the incidence rate is lower for PSA, rheumatologists are more comfortable with Biologics. They're treating PSA at a higher rate. AxSpA is, I would say, even more an undeveloped opportunity, in particular, Lilly's program will feature the potential to be indicated in non-radiographic AxSpA. So there is an absence of x-ray proof of the condition. This is a recognized indication in Europe, but not yet by the FDA. Should we achieve that, I think that presents a very significant market expansion opportunity for AxSpA where the biologic basis of the condition is known to be quite similar to PSA and psoriasis. So there's a lot of promise being held out for the class in AxSpA. We see some early data from CONSENTYX in that regard. We're using even high doses. So I think we are optimistic on all those indications as being meaningful part of the ultimate success story of Taltz."

One is, it will create an incentive to actually price higher because you want to get the starting point above where it is today, given the 23% from the beginning plus the accelerated rebate based on price increases. I think it offers perverse effect actually on pharma pricing.

So we -- whether it's on the Part D side or on the commercial side as of 2017, I think we basically have a situation where Humalog will be exclusive in a certain number of formularies and are competitor in some others. Clearly, there could be switches back and forth that will deteriorate prices even further, but we have not seen that because there's a very high disruption cost at the patient level to be able to switch 100% of the business now for more incremental gains. So it's difficult to say what the pricing dynamics would be, but prices, net prices, when it comes to Humalog are pretty low already."

Of course, we will measure function in mild-Alzheimer's. But I would point out that for the mild study, we started with AZ, with called DAYBREAK with a prodromal mild combination study on our BACE inhibitor with AZ as well as our own prodromal program.

And if we look at class growth, we have shared and we have been concerned with the overall growth that we're seeing in the issue of the 2 class in the U.S. The classes we look at the last 4 weeks relative to the same 4 weeks of last year, is only growing about 20%. That's significantly below our expectations. We are hopeful that the inclusion of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data on the label will be a catalyst for the overall growth. And we feel confident if we can get the right language then we'll be able to make a huge value for proposition for this product in the eyes of our customers. As we look at SGLT-2 class growth, it is a little bit different outside of the U.S. In Europe, the class is expected to double. Same case in Japan, more than double in Japan in 2016. Yes, from a slower base, but -- from a smaller base, but the growth dynamics, I think, are very encouraging. We are doing fairly well when it comes to share. We are -- we now have a 30% New to Brand share in the U.S. Our overall share in Germany is nearly 40% and above 40% in Italy, and basically growing in Spain, U.K., Canada. So I feel very good about the position that we have within the class itself. Now on the pricing question and rebates, I did comment on some of the co-pay cards and some of the impact of those. I also mentioned that the impact of the co-pay cards is going to lessen over time because there's a duration of these co-pay cards. So while we have implemented some of those changes, we have enough patients on these co-pay cards already and some of them are also on the market. So we expect this to be a long-term phenomenon. We will see this decreasing over time."

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me here in Indianapolis -- excuse me, on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratory; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Biomedicine; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Kristina Wright, Brad Robling, Chris Ogden and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team.
During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.
The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start, as usual, with a summary of our progress since the second quarter earnings call in late July, and I'll use our strategic objectives framework for this discussion.
Our first strategic objective: Grow revenue. Q3 revenue increased 4% on a constant currency or performance basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. Consistent with previous quarters this year, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Portrazza and Taltz accounted for nearly all of that growth.
On our strategic objective, expand margins, our non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue declined 20 basis points compared to the third quarter 2015. We expect continued progress in the fourth quarter as our full year guidance at the midpoint of our ranges implies an improvement of about 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue for the year.
Under the heading of Sustaining the Flow of Innovation, olaratumab was approved in the U.S. last week for soft tissue sarcoma and will be sold under the trade name Lartruvo.
Europe CHMP provided positive opinions, recommending approval of olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma and of Glyxambi for type 2 diabetes. And, along with AstraZeneca, we received fast-track designation from the U.S. FDA for AZD3293, the oral-based inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease.
On our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value, we announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim's U.S. Animal Health vaccines business, filling a key strategic need in our companion animal portfolio. In both human pharma and animal health, we will continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
Finally, during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our dividend.
In summary, the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020.
Now let's move on to a review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call.
We continue to make progress on the regulatory front. As I just mentioned here in the U.S., the FDA approved Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with soft tissue sarcoma with a histologic subtype for which an anthracycline-containing regiment is appropriate and which is not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery. This is the first FDA approved front-line therapy for soft tissue sarcoma in 4 decades. It also marks the third product from our ImClone acquisition to receive regulatory approval. This is an accelerated approval based on data from our Phase II trial. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory study. The Phase III announced study is fully enrolled and is currently expected to complete in late 2018.
In Europe, we received a pair of recommendations for approval from the CHMP. The first recommendation was for granting a conditional marketing authorization for Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery and who have not been previously treated with doxorubicin.
Similar to the U.S., Lartruvo was reviewed under the EMA's accelerated assessment program. As part of the conditional marketing authorization, we will need to provide results from our ongoing Phase III study. Until availability of the full data, the CHMP will review the benefits and risks of Lartruvo annually to determine whether the conditional marketing authorization can be maintained.
The second recommendation was for Glyxambi, a single tablet combining Jardiance, our SGLT-2 inhibitor, and Trajenta, a DPP-4 inhibitor. The specific recommendation was for use in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control when metformin and/or sulphonylurea and one of the individual components of Glyxambi do not provide adequate glycemic control, or when a patient is already being treated with the free combination of Jardiance and Trajenta. Glyxambi, Jardiance and Trajenta are products of the Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly diabetes alliance.
Finally, along with AstraZeneca, we received fast-track designation from the FDA for AZD3293, an oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme, or BACE inhibitor, being studied in Phase III trials for Alzheimer's disease.
On the clinical front, we announced that following a preplanned interim analysis for MONARCH 2, an independent data monitoring committee provided the recommendation to continue the study without modification as the interim efficacy criteria were not met. The MONARCH 2 trial compares abemaciclib with fulvestrant versus placebo -- versus placebo with fulvestrant in women with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The trial will continue to completion in the first half of 2017.
At the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting, early data in lung cancer were presented on the combinations of Keytruda with Alimta and of Keytruda with Cyramza. KEYNOTE-021, a randomized Phase II study, included cohort G, studying Keytruda added to Alimta plus carboplatin versus Alimta plus carboplatin in first line non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer patients regardless of PD-L1 expression level. The combination of Keytruda and Alimta carbo nearly doubled the response rate compared to Alimta carbo alone. There's been considerable focus within the investment community on the durability of responses. In this study, we were very pleased that patients on the Keytruda-Alimta-carbo arm experienced progression-free survival of 13 months. While the overall survival data were not yet mature, roughly 75% of patients on both arms were still alive at 1 year. This is at the top end of results we've seen for any combination trial in a broad population of first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients, and we look forward to the presentation of additional data from this trial at future medical conferences.
Updated data were also presented from the KEYNOTE-098 study, evaluating Keytruda with Cyramza in second to fourth line non-small cell lung cancer. Here too we observed promising clinical activity, including durable responses. 80% of patients experienced a decrease in target lesions, spanning the spectrum of PD-L1 status, while the objective response rate was 30%, with responses seen in both non-squamous and squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. In addition, the disease control rate was 85%, and median progression-free survival was not yet reached.
The data from both KEYNOTE-021G and KEYNOTE-098 provide proof points for how we intend to deploy our diverse oncology portfolio across the 3 platforms of cell signaling, tumor microenvironment and immuno-oncology to pursue a rational and differentiated combination strategy across our diverse oncology portfolio in order to improve outcomes for patients.
Shifting to immunology. I'm pleased to report that we achieved a primary endpoint in the SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who had been treated with one or more conventional DMARDs as well as had an inadequate response to 1 or 2 TNF inhibitors or intolerance to a TNF inhibitor.
The results of SPIRIT-P2 further build on the existing benefit risk profile of Taltz, obtained from a very large clinical program. With this second positive psoriatic arthritis study, we plan to submit ixekizumab for psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. in the first half of next year followed by submissions in Europe and other geographies, and we plan to present the data at a medical meeting in 2017. Keep in mind that psoriatic arthritis has already been approved in Japan.
At the EADV meeting in Vienna, we also presented initial data on our head-to-head study called IXORA-S of Taltz versus Stelara in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The primary endpoint of this study was met as Taltz demonstrated superiority to Stelara on the PASI 90 score at 12 weeks. These data reinforce the strong clinical profile of Taltz, and we look forward to preventing -- to presenting additional data from this study next year.
As expected, earlier this month we achieved last patient visit in the EXPEDITION3 trial, solanezumab, in patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. As a result, we plan to issue a top line press release before the end of the year.
In other news, we announced the retirement of yours truly as President and Chief Executive Officer effective December 31 of this year. I will continue on Lilly's Board of Directors until the end of May, serving as nonexecutive Chairman. Dave Ricks, currently President of Lilly Biomedicine, will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer and join the board on January 1. Dave will become Chairman of the Board on June 1.
We announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim, Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies vaccines portfolio as well as a fully integrated manufacturing and R&D site and a number of pipeline assets for approximately $885 million, including the estimated cost of acquired inventory. This innovative platform of companion animal vaccines has high brand awareness and an established loyal customer base. The addition of these assets advances our strategy of offering a balanced portfolio to both prevent and treat disease. This acquisition is subject to FTC approval and closing of the BI-Sanofi asset swap. We expect to close the deal early next year.
The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled against Lilly and its partner, Acrux, in a patent case for the testosterone treatment, Axiron, ruling that Axiron's formulation and axilla application patents are invalid, and the applicator patent, although valid, would not be infringed by generic competitors.
We have appealed the ruling. The formulation patent expires in February 2017, while the axilla application and applicator patents expire in 2027. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined that the method-of-use patents for Effient are invalid. Lilly, Daiichi Sankyo and Ube strongly disagree with the PTO's ruling regarding validity of the Effient method-of-use patent and have appealed the ruling.
Separately, next steps are being discussed with the District Court in ongoing litigation on both the method-of-use patents and the compound patent. As a reminder, the method-of-use patents expire in 2023, while the compound patent expires in April of 2017, and we are entitled to pediatric exclusivity until October of 2017.
Finally, we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. As we announced on our second quarter earnings call, we do expect to provide annual increases in our dividend, and we'll continue to balance share repurchase with external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil."

Thank you, John.
Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results.
I'll focus my comments this morning on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter GAAP results.
Looking at the non-GAAP measures on Slide 9, you can see that Q3 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q3 2015, reaching $5.2 billion.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.4 percentage points to 76.4%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in a benefit to both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit of this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year.
Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 30 basis points, going from 75.2% in last year's quarter to 75.5% this quarter.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 4% compared to Q3 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, while R&D increased 8%. The slight increase in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products, largely offset by lower spending on late life cycle products. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs.
Other income and expense was income of $27 million this quarter compared to the $87 million reported in last year's quarter.
Our tax rate was 22%. This is a decrease of 290 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This decrease was primarily due to certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit that are in force in 2016, but had lapsed during last year's third quarter.
At the bottom line, net income decreased 2%, and earnings per share decreased 1%.
Slide 10 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first 9 months of the year, while Slide 11 contains a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 24 and 25.
Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On Slide 12 in the yellow-highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 5% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, driven entirely by volumes.
By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 17%, driven primarily by volume. Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Humalog and Taltz.
Having completed the take back of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1 last year, we also benefited from booking end sales of Erbitux this quarter.
As cited in our press release issued earlier this morning, we have experienced less product returns than anticipated for Cymbalta post its patent expiration, leading to a reduction in the returns reserved this quarter of approximately $145 million. Excluding this item, our U.S. Pharma revenue grew 10% this quarter, with an 11% increase due to higher volume and a 1% decline due to lower realized prices.
The decline in EuCan revenue of 8% was driven by the negative effect of price, and to a lesser extent, lower volumes and unfavorable FX movements. On a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 6%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower volume and price for Cymbalta and Alimta following patent expirations, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including Trulicity, Basaglar, Cyramza and Jardiance as well as higher sales of Humalog, Trajenta and Cialis.
In Japan, pharma revenue increased 15% in total, driven by an 18% benefit from a stronger yen, and, to a lesser extent, increased volume, partially offset by a 6% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts.
On a constant-currency basis, Japan pharma revenue decreased 3%. This performance decline was attributable to the entry of generic olanzapine this past June. Excluding Zyprexa, Japan pharma revenue in Q3 grew 6% on a constant-currency basis, led by Cyramza, with additional contributions from Cymbalta, Strattera, Trulicity, Basaglar and Jardiance.
Turning to emerging markets. We saw revenue decline 8%, primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange.
On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue decreased 3% due to lower volumes for off-patent brands, including Cialis, Zyprexa, Alimta and Cymbalta, partially offset by higher volumes for Humulin, Trulicity, Trajenta and Cyramza.
Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 7% due to foreign exchange, while revenue was flat on a constant-currency basis. Changes in order timing from our distributors negatively affected growth this quarter while positively affecting growth last quarter. We estimate the growth in underlying demand for our products in China this quarter was about 5%.
Turning to animal health. This quarter, worldwide revenue decreased 9%, both in total and on a constant-currency basis, including a 14% decline in companion animal and a 6% in food animal.
Animal health revenue was significantly impacted by distributor inventory de-stocking in the quarter, following a change over to SAP at the end of Q2. This inventory impact represented the majority of the decline in companion animal revenue in Q3 and has contributed to the volatility in our animal health results.
In food animal, economic weakness in Latin America, combined with market access pressures in the U.S., contributed to lower revenue in the quarter. Note that on a year-to-date basis, which includes the SAP inventory impact in both Q2 and Q3, animal health revenue is flat.
On Slide 13, you'll find the same price rate and volume analysis but on a year-to-date basis. As I mentioned earlier, excluding foreign exchange, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, with nearly all of that growth coming from higher volume. In total, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar and Portrazza, were the engine of our worldwide volume growth.
Slide 14 shows that these products drove 6.6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. The take back of Erbitux contributed nearly 2 percentage points to our volume growth, while Humalog contributed nearly 1 percentage point.
You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror, still provided a drag of roughly 2 percentage points on our volume growth.
Specifically on Humalog, you will see that the U.S. sales this quarter are down 14% as higher volume was more than offset by lower realized prices. This quarter's net realized price was negatively affected by changes in estimates for rebates and discounts.
Normalizing for changes in estimates for rebates and discounts in both Q3 2016 and Q3 2015, the underlying U.S. sales trend for the quarter for Humalog was basically flat.
Now let me turn the call over to Derica."
285467,319564408,1060806,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil.As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session sue, Enrique and Dave could provide more detail.As you can see on the graph on Slide 15, our new products generated over $500 milli",1221,"Thanks, Phil.
As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session sue, Enrique and Dave could provide more detail.
As you can see on the graph on Slide 15, our new products generated over $500 million in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This represents about 10% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 8% last quarter. And, as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove over 6.5 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter.
We continue to be pleased with the uptake of Trulicity. Here in the U.S., we're capturing nearly 30% of new patient starts in the GLP-1 class. In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the class itself, with the U.S. GLP-1 market growing nearly 30%.
As I mentioned last quarter, in many OUS markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with the early uptake of Victoza.
Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan. OUS markets now account for nearly 60% of our worldwide Cyramza sales, and we look forward to continue growth in these markets, not only in gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications.
U.S. Cyramza sales declined this quarter, largely as a result of competitive pressure from immuno-oncology therapies and non-small cell lung cancer, while our share of market in gastric cancer has been relatively stable.
Moving to Jardiance. While less than we expected, the SGLT-2 class in the U.S. is growing over 20%, and our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists is now over 35%. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we expect FDA action on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME submission in early December and continue to see an update of the Jardiance label to reflect the compelling CB data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME as a catalyst for the growing of the class and of Jardiance.
Taltz, which launched in the U.S. in April, is off to an excellent start. We're seeing strong growth of the IL-17 class of psoriasis and are pleased that our New to Brand share of market with dermatologists, a proxy for use in psoriasis, is already over 10%. While it's still early in our OUS launches, feedback has been positive, and we look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
The rollout of Abasaglar in OUS countries continues, and we are preparing for our U.S. launch in mid-December.
Finally, we continue to see strong uptake of I/O agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is clearly affecting use of Portrazza.
Moving to Slide 16. You'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 4%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 4% was in line with revenue growth, while non-GAAP operating expenses grew just slightly faster than revenue at 5%.
Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 2% and non-GAAP EPS increased 1%.
Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 17 shows our pipeline as of October 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrow showing progression and red arrow showing movement out of the portfolio.
In our NME pipeline, you'll see the green arrow denoting FDA approval of Lartruvo in soft tissue sarcoma. We began Phase II testing of 2 molecules, the low-dose BACE inhibitor that we discussed at our Alzheimer's disease meeting last December and the BTK inhibitor in immunology we licensed with Hanmi.
We also started Phase I testing for a small molecule cancer compound, and we terminated development of 2 Phase I oncology assets and of blosozumab, a sclerostin monoclonal antibody for osteoporosis.
In our NILEX pipeline, as shown on Slide 18, we began a Phase III study of solanezumab and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Currently, we plan to recruit nearly 2,500 amyloid-positive patients for this study. The blind-to-treatment period will be 24 months, and we anticipate trial completion in mid-2021.
On solanezumab, John mentioned earlier that we are on track to issue the top line press release for EXPEDITION3 before the end of the year. I'd also note that we have a small number of investor interactions with management scheduled this quarter, and all of these interactions will occur before management sees the EXPEDITION3 study results.
If we hit the most aggressive time line from moving from last patient visit to database lock, we may be able to present the EXPEDITION3 data at the CTAD meeting in December. However, it is also quite possible that we will not present the data at a medical meeting until next year. Should we present the EXPEDITION3 data at CTAD, the presentation will be made available via a live webcast open to the investment community. So live participation will not be required to access the information in realtime.
Turning to Slide 19. Let's recap the recent progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green check marks for: the initiation of the Phase III study of solanezumab and prodromal Alzheimer's disease; the internal data read out that John mentioned earlier of the Phase III SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis; the presentation at EADV of data from the IXORA-S study evaluating ixekizumab head-to-head against Stelara and psoriasis; and the U.S. approval of Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma.
Also, one event we thought that might occur in 2016, which is now expected in 2017, action on Cialis pediatric exclusivity, while another is expected in 2018, the cluster headache readout for -- the cluster headache readout for galcanezumab.
Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on Slide 20. At a high level, our expectations are largely unchanged. You'll see that our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is unchanged. While we've made small adjustments to our GAAP earnings per share guidance range, as well as to our line item guidance for revenue, SG&A expenses, other income and capital expenditures.
In summary, our Q3 financial performance places us on track to achieve our full year guidance. In the quarter, we posted revenue growth of 4% on a constant-currency basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. We made progress on the pipeline with the FDA approval of Lartruvo, recommendations for approval of Olaratumab and Glyxambi in Europe and granting of FDA fast-track status for our BACE inhibitor AZD3293. We continue to have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy, and, as we transition to the leadership next year, our management team will remain focused on executing our strategy to create value for all stakeholders, including shareholders.
We also remain firmly committed to achieving the mid-term financial goals we articulated on our earnings call in July, which included: driving a minimum of 5% compounded annual revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, even without solanezumab; reducing OpEx as a percent of revenue to 50% or less in 2018; increasing our gross margin as a percent of revenue in 2020 compared to 2015; launching 20 or more new products in the decade from 2014 through 2023; and providing annual dividend increases to our shareholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session."

Or is the other alternative to get no mention of that in the indication section, but the EMPA-REG trial mentioned in the label somewhere. If you can talk about those 2 possible scenarios and what they mean in terms of consensus expectations. Secondly, just curious to know what's happening with pricing in diabetes because it does seem to be getting worse. You talked about rebates and discounts with Humalog, but we're -- it also seems that we're seeing some price discounting in SGLT-2s just based on INVOKANA's recent performance and their weakness due to discounting. So if you could talk about that as well."

So when it comes to the Jardiance review by the FDA, we did get this 3 months extension on the action date. The new action date is now December 4 of this year. It's difficult to say always what drives that, but the FDA considers some additional information, announcements that we had provided basically major amendments, and they basically have the right to do so. I would highlight that this is not the only major amendment that has happened in the diabetes area. There've been a number of 3 months extensions, but I don't think it would be appropriate to color this in any way, positive or negative. When it comes to the indication and the label, as you know, we have basically requested a separate distinct indication for Jardiance given the data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME. Something along the lines of reducing the incidence of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. We believe that the data warrants this type of indication. Clearly, there are a number of different potential outcomes when it comes to the label that we would get. It's -- the FDA's in the -- reviewing the label, and it's probably not appropriate for me to comment more at this stage, given that the action date is getting very near. I will continue to highlight that I believe that we have the strength of the evidence to be able to have a new indication. Clearly, whether we have -- in particular, in the U.S., having an indication does make an important difference, so we are seeking that. Of course, we -- if the clinical data is included in the body of the label, yes, we could still make a claim, but the strength of the claim is not the same. So we view this as important for us and for Jardiance and for Lilly and BI. Let me answer your question on pricing in diabetes. First, when it comes to -- as it was stated as part of the remarks by Phil, when we normalize for changes in the estimates of rebates and discounts for both Q3 and Q4, we basically see, in the case of Humalog, that our normalized sales would have been minus 1% instead of minus 14%. Now minus 1% still implies a pretty important impact. It implies lower prices because we grew volume 10% with Humalog in the U.S. So that's basically minus 11% when it comes to price. What are we seeing? Well, we are seeing 2 things: increased rebates across the board, but in particular, when it comes to Part D, a lift from how Lilly views this business; and we basically see a significant more business flowing through less profitable books of business, less profitable channels. Medicare, Medicaid, charge backs. So as we look at those books of business, there's been an acceleration of those books of business at the expense of commercial and cash. So those impacts are pretty significant. Now you have seen that in the case of Humalog, we had quite a bit of volatility. We expect for this volatility, unfortunately, to continue, given that we make estimates at the end of each quarter on those rebates and discounts. But we find out what those -- where the product flow through, which books of business, afterwards, and in some cases, many quarters afterwards. So the last point that I would make because it's probably important, as you look at your different models and as we think about the Humalog and what is the ongoing growth trend for this product, as we look at the normalization that I referred to, 1/3 of that normalization refers to Q3 of 2016, 2/3 is really related to Q3 of 2015."

I know there's a fair amount of excitement around the upcoming launch and the profile. It does look promising, but I can't help but think that it's going to get meaningfully sidelined by payers in the U.S., given how crowded this market is.

We continue to characterize it as a high-risk, high-reward program. The scenario you paint is what we think is the least probable, but it certainly could happen. In this scenario, sola would really not separate at all from placebo. I think we would be reevaluating all of the sola programs, frankly, Tim. And the way we've set up the prodromal program, which has just begun, is there's a recruitment start with a special cohort that we can also evaluate more information on. We're doing this for a couple of reasons, but one of the reasons is the ability to stop the trial should EXPEDITION3 be negative. So we've gated the investment in that way. As I said, we're not counting on that as the most probable scenario, but we've prepared for that contingency. We're excited about baricitinib, too. The profile from the Phase III program, 4 very large studies is extremely positive. That drug is under review with the FDA, and we're anticipating a launch sometime in 2017. You're identifying a key issue in that class already is crowded. It is heavily managed by payers. Lilly has a strategy on baricitinib to really focus on the differentiation over the product versus the standards-of-care of methotrexate. And Humira, we want to position the product in really the pre-biologic setting, and that may take some time to achieve as you're pointing out. However, I would say there are all kinds of payers, and those that are more clinically focused and focused on improving outcomes for pretty significant condition, lifelong condition, for young people, RA, we think we can make early headway in those settings. Others, which may be more sensitive to rebate flow, et cetera, obviously, that's going to be more difficult, but I think Lilly's prepared to be patient and build out the product through time, reminding everyone that the current IP is very long, and we have a long time to fulfill full value for baricitinib.

So we're happy with the initial adoption and the breadth of trial and usage, which are other key indicators for us. At this point in the launch cycle, I'm not sure net sales should be the absolute marker we'd be looking at although, of course, we're looking forward to growing that quarter-on-quarter going forward, and you did see growth from Q2, which was reminding everyone of us just a few weeks of shipments in Q2. It wasn't a full quarter.  Also vis-√†-vis, COSENTYX which enjoys 3 indications, we could only have the one in psoriasis, as was mentioned in the call text earlier. We do plan submissions now for PSA in the U.S. shortly. And we have an AxSpA program ongoing. So net-net, I think we're happy with where we are. Global rollouts are beginning in the second half of the year, as well, in Europe and Japan, which are also significant opportunities. We've got a life cycle coming. And where we are head-to-head against the incumbents of TNF, Stelara and even COSENTYX within the class, which is the U.S. derm market. I think early performance indicators are quite strong."

I'm sure you have a pretty good sense of demand and what price you're willing to part with the product? So whatever you could help us understand heading into that, that would be very helpful."

It's not a large meeting, but it's one of our top experts who do clinical researcher around the globe in Alzheimer's all come.  As a result, we are consistently at that meeting with posters, other presentations. As you know, Lilly has done a lot of work, whether it be in diagnosis work with our PET scanning business, we have some data reading out in that area as well as other supported data looking at disease modification, et cetera, in different populations. So there are other presentations. I don't have a list in front of me, but we can provide that in follow-up. The second question is really what will change going forward, if sola is positive? And I think here, we've given long-term guidance without sola. But certainly, we would anticipate a rapid submission and introduction to the major markets, and the normal kind of go-to-market commercialization effort that would come with that, which is typically expense followed by revenue. I would also say this will present 2 new opportunities for Lilly, I think, unique ones within the field of neuroscience and Alzheimer's. One would be to look at acceleration and sort of full funding for other Alzheimer's products, particularly those with A beta-based mechanisms. Certainly, with a lead like that in sola we would want to fast follow with other innovations we have coming. We are doing that, but we can always look at speed and voracity of that effort. And then finally, looking at combinations and sequences of therapies that could be combined with solanezumab to further arrest the disease, that only make sense if sola works. And we have the sort of queued up but certainly not in our funding and expense base today.  So there are many, we'll have to prioritize amongst those. And, I think, of course, the -- qualitatively, the way sola works will have some bearing on how much of that additional investment we would trigger."

It's not only bad legislation, it's bad for your health, and we're trying to impress that on the voters. What we found is that the more people become aware of what's at stake here, and what's the likely outcomes of Proposition 61, the less they're -- the more they are prone to vote against it and vote it down. So we have a pretty big campaign underway in California, right now, to increase that level of awareness and, hopefully, to continue to shift voters toward a position of being against it for a whole variety of reasons. It's difficult to say on the larger -- are we going to see some price release after the election? I think in terms of where drug pricing sort of fits in what I call the rhetoric, that you're always going to get in a campaign season, particularly one that's as polarized as this one. So I think there may be some acute relief. I think the bigger question is if Hillary Clinton wins, what does she have in mind for health care? If Donald Trump wins, what's the direction going to be? It's pretty clear whether you say you want to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, something needs to be done if we're going to render a -- sort of a health insurance availability for everybody in this country sustainable on an ongoing basis. So I think that's going to be the bigger focus for the industry and sort of what happens in those probably critical first 2 years of the first term, which we know what happened in 2008, 2009. And I think that's what the industry has to be prepared for. At the same time, I think that, frankly, if we're successful in -- with sola, the outcome of sola and there's hope for Alzheimer's, keep in mind of the top 10 causes of death in this country, I think I heard the other day Alzheimer's is the only one where we continue to see increases in the rate of mortality. So I think if the industry can demonstrate once again like we did with HIV AIDS, like we did with Hepatitis C and so many other diseases that we can make an impact on something that increasingly everybody is fearful of and concerned about, I think that changes the dynamic too. We don't know what that outcome is going to be, but it's going to be a very interesting mix come January 1. And I'm sure Dave Ricks is ready to jump all over it."

Bottom line, our animal health quarterly results have been more volatile this year, as you know. Inventory destocking was a significant event in Q3, and it contributed to the revenue decline this quarter. We don't see these results as a trend. Just as we enjoyed the benefits, as you recall, of the distributor purchases in Q2 ahead of our SAP cutover in the U.S., inventories were depleted in Q3, which caused the majority of the decline in our companion animal business. So I would note, the SAP transition has gone very smoothly. On the companion animal side, our business is up 3% year-to-date, which really normalizes for the Q2 and the Q3 inventory impact. And what's driving this is one, successful launches of some new innovation as well as, we believe, our improved competitiveness with the combination of Novartis and Elanco. On the food animal side, food animal is down 1% year-to-date, and really, outside the U.S., we've experienced weakness in Latin America. And really, this region represented the entire decline for our OUS food animal in Q3. And then in the U.S., we faced some market access challenges this quarter, in particular, Paylean, a product in our U.S. swine business. Poor customers pursuing the China export markets removed Paylean. They'll do that on and off. They'll come on and off the product, depending on needing the export markets or not. So that in summary. And then as John noted, 2 weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of BI's companion animal vaccine business subject to the closing again of the BI Sanofi asset swap. We see this as a tremendous complement to our companion animal business in the U.S."

What I hear you asking about is as we look forward to the future indications, what's -- how do we think about the size of this market. I would say on PSA, which would be the next one for us based on differentiation we think we have versus standards-of-care, like Humira, reminding everyone that IL-17s can be used without methotrexate, and you get sort of this dual skin and joint benefit that's at least as good on a joint. We're encouraged by what we see so far in our estimates. Our own estimates actually have gone up since we started the program, because treatment rates for PSA appear to be quite a bit higher in psoriasis when it comes to using biologics. Just to give everyone a bit of frame on that, when you look at products that are indicated only for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, take COSENTYX, for instance, they actually have a little bit more volume coming out of nonderms than derms right now. And I think that indicates that although the incidence rate is lower for PSA, rheumatologists are more comfortable with Biologics. They're treating PSA at a higher rate. AxSpA is, I would say, even more of an undeveloped opportunity. In particular, Lilly's program will feature the potential to be indicated in non-radiographic AxSpA. So there is an absence of x-ray proof of the condition. This is a recognized indication in Europe, but not yet by the FDA. Should we achieve that, I think that presents a very significant market expansion opportunity for AxSpA where the biologic basis of the condition is known to be quite similar to PSA and psoriasis. So there's a lot of promise being held out for the class in AxSpA. We see some early data from CONSENTYX in that regard. We're using even high doses. So I think we are optimistic on all those indications as being meaningful part of the ultimate success story of Taltz."

I think if the low-income subsidy patients in the duals were moved out, and that's been bandied around for quite awhile and talked about, the order of magnitude of the impact it would have on the industry is akin to the overall impact of the Affordable Care Act. So we're talking something around $110 billion, $120 billion over, I think, a 10-year period. So it's a significant hit and it's, again, as I said earlier, it's not just bad policy, it's bad medicine. These folks are not going to enjoy near the kind of care and access to modern therapy that they're able to benefit from as the -- under the Part D coverage. So you can bet we're going to fight any such proposal tooth and nail."

One is, it will create an incentive to actually price higher because you want to get the starting point above where it is today, given the 23% from the beginning plus the accelerated rebate based on price increases. I think it will have a perverse effect, actually, on pharma pricing. And then the second is I think it will take away an incentive long-term to develop medicines for dual LIS beneficiaries, which is probably the last thing anyone in Congress would be wanting. But that will be the net effect of that change if it occurred. We're optimistic that we can fight that."

So we -- whether it's on the Part D side or on the commercial side as of 2017, I think we basically have a situation where Humalog will be exclusive in a certain number of formularies and our competitor in some others. Clearly, there could be switches back and forth that will deteriorate prices even further, but we have not seen that because there's a very high disruption cost at the patient level to be able to switch 100% of the business now for more incremental gains. So it's difficult to say what the pricing dynamics would be, but prices, net prices, when it comes to Humalog, are pretty low already."

We're now, of course, past last patient visit waiting for the data later this fall. And we'll just have to take a look at the date when it reads out here in through the end of the year. And again, maintain that -- we think in mild-Alzheimer's, certainly in prodromal and absolutely in pre-Alzheimer's conditions, measuring cognitive changes is a much more sensitive and much more appropriate a way to measure disease impact and disease modification. Of course, we will measure function in mild-Alzheimer's. But I would point out that for the mild study, we started with AZ, with called DAYBREAK with a prodromal mild combination study on our BACE inhibitor with AZ as well as our own prodromal program we've just began with sola. All of those use cognition as the primary endpoint. This is a bet we're making across the portfolio, and we think is well-founded based on the expert advice we have and the way science has evolved."

And if we look at class growth, we have shared and we have been concerned with the overall growth that we're seeing in the SGLT-2 class in the U.S. The classes we look at the last 4 weeks relative to the same 4 weeks of last year, is only growing about 20%. That's significantly below our expectations. We are hopeful that the inclusion of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data on the label will be a catalyst for the overall growth, and we feel confident if we can get the right language then we'll be able to make a huge value proposition for this product in the eyes of our customers. As we look at SGLT-2 class growth, it is a little bit different outside of the U.S. In Europe, the class is expected to double. Same case in Japan, more than double in Japan in 2016. Yes, from a slower base, but -- from a smaller base, but the growth dynamics, I think, are very encouraging. We are doing fairly well when it comes to share. We are -- we now have a 30% new-to-brand share in the U.S. Our overall share in Germany is nearly 40% and above 40% in Italy, and basically growing in Spain, U.K., Canada. So I feel very good about the position that we have within the class itself. Now on the pricing question and rebates, I did comment on some of the co-pay cards and some of the impact of those. I also mentioned that the impact of the co-pay cards is going to lessen over time because there's a duration of these co-pay cards. So while we have implemented some of those changes, we have a number of patients on these co-pay cards already and some of them are also on the market. So we expect this to be a long-term phenomenon, and we will see this decreasing over time."

I think, overall, at a high level as we noted last December in our Investor Conference, we are going through a transition period. What I would note is yes, the SAP cutover is complete and that volatility is completed. So we do see less volatility going forward. I think we're keeping our eyes on a few things that are absolutely critical for animal health business. One, our companion animal competitiveness, as I've shared, we feel very good about that. Some of our growth engines like our vaccine business and expansion of that. And then we noted 7 big products that were critical for innovation, which you know drives animal health just like pharma. We've put 5 of those 7 products into the market, and they'll be foundational to our growth going forward. And then on the margin side, we continue to stay focused on the margins where we're moving to that low- to mid-20s, and we see that happening in 2016.

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me here in Indianapolis -- excuse me, on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratory; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Biomedicine; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Kristina Wright, Brad Robling, Chris Ogden and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team.
During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.
The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start, as usual, with a summary of our progress since the second quarter earnings call in late July, and I'll use our strategic objectives framework for this discussion.
Our first strategic objective: Grow revenue. Q3 revenue increased 4% on a constant currency or performance basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. Consistent with previous quarters this year, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Portrazza and Taltz accounted for nearly all of that growth.
On our strategic objective, expand margins, our non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue declined 20 basis points compared to the third quarter 2015. We expect continued progress in the fourth quarter as our full year guidance at the midpoint of our ranges implies an improvement of about 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue for the year.
Under the heading of Sustaining the Flow of Innovation, olaratumab was approved in the U.S. last week for soft tissue sarcoma and will be sold under the trade name Lartruvo.
Europe CHMP provided positive opinions, recommending approval of olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma and of Glyxambi for type 2 diabetes. And, along with AstraZeneca, we received fast-track designation from the U.S. FDA for AZD3293, the oral-based inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease.
On our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value, we announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim's U.S. Animal Health vaccines business, filling a key strategic need in our companion animal portfolio. In both human pharma and animal health, we will continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
Finally, during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our dividend.
In summary, the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020.
Now let's move on to a review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call.
We continue to make progress on the regulatory front. As I just mentioned here in the U.S., the FDA approved Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with soft tissue sarcoma with a histologic subtype for which an anthracycline-containing regiment is appropriate and which is not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery. This is the first FDA approved front-line therapy for soft tissue sarcoma in 4 decades. It also marks the third product from our ImClone acquisition to receive regulatory approval. This is an accelerated approval based on data from our Phase II trial. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory study. The Phase III announced study is fully enrolled and is currently expected to complete in late 2018.
In Europe, we received a pair of recommendations for approval from the CHMP. The first recommendation was for granting a conditional marketing authorization for Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery and who have not been previously treated with doxorubicin.
Similar to the U.S., Lartruvo was reviewed under the EMA's accelerated assessment program. As part of the conditional marketing authorization, we will need to provide results from our ongoing Phase III study. Until availability of the full data, the CHMP will review the benefits and risks of Lartruvo annually to determine whether the conditional marketing authorization can be maintained.
The second recommendation was for Glyxambi, a single tablet combining Jardiance, our SGLT-2 inhibitor, and Trajenta, a DPP-4 inhibitor. The specific recommendation was for use in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control when metformin and/or sulphonylurea and one of the individual components of Glyxambi do not provide adequate glycemic control, or when a patient is already being treated with the free combination of Jardiance and Trajenta. Glyxambi, Jardiance and Trajenta are products of the Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly diabetes alliance.
Finally, along with AstraZeneca, we received fast-track designation from the FDA for AZD3293, an oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme, or BACE inhibitor, being studied in Phase III trials for Alzheimer's disease.
On the clinical front, we announced that following a preplanned interim analysis for MONARCH 2, an independent data monitoring committee provided the recommendation to continue the study without modification as the interim efficacy criteria were not met. The MONARCH 2 trial compares abemaciclib with fulvestrant versus placebo -- versus placebo with fulvestrant in women with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The trial will continue to completion in the first half of 2017.
At the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting, early data in lung cancer were presented on the combinations of Keytruda with Alimta and of Keytruda with Cyramza. KEYNOTE-021, a randomized Phase II study, included cohort G, studying Keytruda added to Alimta plus carboplatin versus Alimta plus carboplatin in first line non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer patients regardless of PD-L1 expression level. The combination of Keytruda and Alimta carbo nearly doubled the response rate compared to Alimta carbo alone. There's been considerable focus within the investment community on the durability of responses. In this study, we were very pleased that patients on the Keytruda-Alimta-carbo arm experienced progression-free survival of 13 months. While the overall survival data were not yet mature, roughly 75% of patients on both arms were still alive at 1 year. This is at the top end of results we've seen for any combination trial in a broad population of first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients, and we look forward to the presentation of additional data from this trial at future medical conferences.
Updated data were also presented from the KEYNOTE-098 study, evaluating Keytruda with Cyramza in second to fourth line non-small cell lung cancer. Here too we observed promising clinical activity, including durable responses. 80% of patients experienced a decrease in target lesions, spanning the spectrum of PD-L1 status, while the objective response rate was 30%, with responses seen in both non-squamous and squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. In addition, the disease control rate was 85%, and median progression-free survival was not yet reached.
The data from both KEYNOTE-021G and KEYNOTE-098 provide proof points for how we intend to deploy our diverse oncology portfolio across the 3 platforms of cell signaling, tumor microenvironment and immuno-oncology to pursue a rational and differentiated combination strategy across our diverse oncology portfolio in order to improve outcomes for patients.
Shifting to immunology. I'm pleased to report that we achieved a primary endpoint in the SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who had been treated with one or more conventional DMARDs as well as had an inadequate response to 1 or 2 TNF inhibitors or intolerance to a TNF inhibitor.
The results of SPIRIT-P2 further build on the existing benefit risk profile of Taltz, obtained from a very large clinical program. With this second positive psoriatic arthritis study, we plan to submit ixekizumab for psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. in the first half of next year followed by submissions in Europe and other geographies, and we plan to present the data at a medical meeting in 2017. Keep in mind that psoriatic arthritis has already been approved in Japan.
At the EADV meeting in Vienna, we also presented initial data on our head-to-head study called IXORA-S of Taltz versus Stelara in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The primary endpoint of this study was met as Taltz demonstrated superiority to Stelara on the PASI 90 score at 12 weeks. These data reinforce the strong clinical profile of Taltz, and we look forward to preventing -- to presenting additional data from this study next year.
As expected, earlier this month we achieved last patient visit in the EXPEDITION3 trial, solanezumab, in patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. As a result, we plan to issue a top line press release before the end of the year.
In other news, we announced the retirement of yours truly as President and Chief Executive Officer effective December 31 of this year. I will continue on Lilly's Board of Directors until the end of May, serving as nonexecutive Chairman. Dave Ricks, currently President of Lilly Biomedicine, will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer and join the board on January 1. Dave will become Chairman of the Board on June 1.
We announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim, Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies vaccines portfolio as well as a fully integrated manufacturing and R&D site and a number of pipeline assets for approximately $885 million, including the estimated cost of acquired inventory. This innovative platform of companion animal vaccines has high brand awareness and an established loyal customer base. The addition of these assets advances our strategy of offering a balanced portfolio to both prevent and treat disease. This acquisition is subject to FTC approval and closing of the BI-Sanofi asset swap. We expect to close the deal early next year.
The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled against Lilly and its partner, Acrux, in a patent case for the testosterone treatment, Axiron, ruling that Axiron's formulation and axilla application patents are invalid, and the applicator patent, although valid, would not be infringed by generic competitors.
We have appealed the ruling. The formulation patent expires in February 2017, while the axilla application and applicator patents expire in 2027. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined that the method-of-use patents for Effient are invalid. Lilly, Daiichi Sankyo and Ube strongly disagree with the PTO's ruling regarding validity of the Effient method-of-use patent and have appealed the ruling.
Separately, next steps are being discussed with the District Court in ongoing litigation on both the method-of-use patents and the compound patent. As a reminder, the method-of-use patents expire in 2023, while the compound patent expires in April of 2017, and we are entitled to pediatric exclusivity until October of 2017.
Finally, we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. As we announced on our second quarter earnings call, we do expect to provide annual increases in our dividend, and we'll continue to balance share repurchase with external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil."

Thank you, John.
Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results.
I'll focus my comments this morning on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter GAAP results.
Looking at the non-GAAP measures on Slide 9, you can see that Q3 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q3 2015, reaching $5.2 billion.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.4 percentage points to 76.4%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in a benefit to both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit of this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year.
Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 30 basis points, going from 75.2% in last year's quarter to 75.5% this quarter.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 4% compared to Q3 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, while R&D increased 8%. The slight increase in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products, largely offset by lower spending on late life cycle products. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs.
Other income and expense was income of $27 million this quarter compared to the $87 million reported in last year's quarter.
Our tax rate was 22%. This is a decrease of 290 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This decrease was primarily due to certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit that are in force in 2016, but had lapsed during last year's third quarter.
At the bottom line, net income decreased 2%, and earnings per share decreased 1%.
Slide 10 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first 9 months of the year, while Slide 11 contains a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 24 and 25.
Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On Slide 12 in the yellow-highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 5% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, driven entirely by volumes.
By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 17%, driven primarily by volume. Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Humalog and Taltz.
Having completed the take back of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1 last year, we also benefited from booking end sales of Erbitux this quarter.
As cited in our press release issued earlier this morning, we have experienced less product returns than anticipated for Cymbalta post its patent expiration, leading to a reduction in the returns reserved this quarter of approximately $145 million. Excluding this item, our U.S. Pharma revenue grew 10% this quarter, with an 11% increase due to higher volume and a 1% decline due to lower realized prices.
The decline in EuCan revenue of 8% was driven by the negative effect of price, and to a lesser extent, lower volumes and unfavorable FX movements. On a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 6%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower volume and price for Cymbalta and Alimta following patent expirations, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including Trulicity, Basaglar, Cyramza and Jardiance as well as higher sales of Humalog, Trajenta and Cialis.
In Japan, pharma revenue increased 15% in total, driven by an 18% benefit from a stronger yen, and, to a lesser extent, increased volume, partially offset by a 6% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts.
On a constant-currency basis, Japan pharma revenue decreased 3%. This performance decline was attributable to the entry of generic olanzapine this past June. Excluding Zyprexa, Japan pharma revenue in Q3 grew 6% on a constant-currency basis, led by Cyramza, with additional contributions from Cymbalta, Strattera, Trulicity, Basaglar and Jardiance.
Turning to emerging markets. We saw revenue decline 8%, primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange.
On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue decreased 3% due to lower volumes for off-patent brands, including Cialis, Zyprexa, Alimta and Cymbalta, partially offset by higher volumes for Humulin, Trulicity, Trajenta and Cyramza.
Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 7% due to foreign exchange, while revenue was flat on a constant-currency basis. Changes in order timing from our distributors negatively affected growth this quarter while positively affecting growth last quarter. We estimate the growth in underlying demand for our products in China this quarter was about 5%.
Turning to animal health. This quarter, worldwide revenue decreased 9%, both in total and on a constant-currency basis, including a 14% decline in companion animal and a 6% in food animal.
Animal health revenue was significantly impacted by distributor inventory de-stocking in the quarter, following a change over to SAP at the end of Q2. This inventory impact represented the majority of the decline in companion animal revenue in Q3 and has contributed to the volatility in our animal health results.
In food animal, economic weakness in Latin America, combined with market access pressures in the U.S., contributed to lower revenue in the quarter. Note that on a year-to-date basis, which includes the SAP inventory impact in both Q2 and Q3, animal health revenue is flat.
On Slide 13, you'll find the same price rate and volume analysis but on a year-to-date basis. As I mentioned earlier, excluding foreign exchange, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, with nearly all of that growth coming from higher volume. In total, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar and Portrazza, were the engine of our worldwide volume growth.
Slide 14 shows that these products drove 6.6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. The take back of Erbitux contributed nearly 2 percentage points to our volume growth, while Humalog contributed nearly 1 percentage point.
You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror, still provided a drag of roughly 2 percentage points on our volume growth.
Specifically on Humalog, you will see that the U.S. sales this quarter are down 14% as higher volume was more than offset by lower realized prices. This quarter's net realized price was negatively affected by changes in estimates for rebates and discounts.
Normalizing for changes in estimates for rebates and discounts in both Q3 2016 and Q3 2015, the underlying U.S. sales trend for the quarter for Humalog was basically flat.
Now let me turn the call over to Derica."
285467,319564408,1061186,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil.As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session sue, Enrique and Dave could provide more detail.As you can see on the graph on Slide 15, our new products generated over $500 milli",1221,"Thanks, Phil.
As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session sue, Enrique and Dave could provide more detail.
As you can see on the graph on Slide 15, our new products generated over $500 million in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This represents about 10% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 8% last quarter. And, as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove over 6.5 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter.
We continue to be pleased with the uptake of Trulicity. Here in the U.S., we're capturing nearly 30% of new patient starts in the GLP-1 class. In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the class itself, with the U.S. GLP-1 market growing nearly 30%.
As I mentioned last quarter, in many OUS markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with the early uptake of Victoza.
Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan. OUS markets now account for nearly 60% of our worldwide Cyramza sales, and we look forward to continue growth in these markets, not only in gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications.
U.S. Cyramza sales declined this quarter, largely as a result of competitive pressure from immuno-oncology therapies and non-small cell lung cancer, while our share of market in gastric cancer has been relatively stable.
Moving to Jardiance. While less than we expected, the SGLT-2 class in the U.S. is growing over 20%, and our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists is now over 35%. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we expect FDA action on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME submission in early December and continue to see an update of the Jardiance label to reflect the compelling CB data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME as a catalyst for the growing of the class and of Jardiance.
Taltz, which launched in the U.S. in April, is off to an excellent start. We're seeing strong growth of the IL-17 class of psoriasis and are pleased that our New to Brand share of market with dermatologists, a proxy for use in psoriasis, is already over 10%. While it's still early in our OUS launches, feedback has been positive, and we look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
The rollout of Abasaglar in OUS countries continues, and we are preparing for our U.S. launch in mid-December.
Finally, we continue to see strong uptake of I/O agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is clearly affecting use of Portrazza.
Moving to Slide 16. You'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 4%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 4% was in line with revenue growth, while non-GAAP operating expenses grew just slightly faster than revenue at 5%.
Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 2% and non-GAAP EPS increased 1%.
Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 17 shows our pipeline as of October 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrow showing progression and red arrow showing movement out of the portfolio.
In our NME pipeline, you'll see the green arrow denoting FDA approval of Lartruvo in soft tissue sarcoma. We began Phase II testing of 2 molecules, the low-dose BACE inhibitor that we discussed at our Alzheimer's disease meeting last December and the BTK inhibitor in immunology we licensed with Hanmi.
We also started Phase I testing for a small molecule cancer compound, and we terminated development of 2 Phase I oncology assets and of blosozumab, a sclerostin monoclonal antibody for osteoporosis.
In our NILEX pipeline, as shown on Slide 18, we began a Phase III study of solanezumab and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Currently, we plan to recruit nearly 2,500 amyloid-positive patients for this study. The blind-to-treatment period will be 24 months, and we anticipate trial completion in mid-2021.
On solanezumab, John mentioned earlier that we are on track to issue the top line press release for EXPEDITION3 before the end of the year. I'd also note that we have a small number of investor interactions with management scheduled this quarter, and all of these interactions will occur before management sees the EXPEDITION3 study results.
If we hit the most aggressive time line from moving from last patient visit to database lock, we may be able to present the EXPEDITION3 data at the CTAD meeting in December. However, it is also quite possible that we will not present the data at a medical meeting until next year. Should we present the EXPEDITION3 data at CTAD, the presentation will be made available via a live webcast open to the investment community. So live participation will not be required to access the information in realtime.
Turning to Slide 19. Let's recap the recent progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green check marks for: the initiation of the Phase III study of solanezumab and prodromal Alzheimer's disease; the internal data read out that John mentioned earlier of the Phase III SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis; the presentation at EADV of data from the IXORA-S study evaluating ixekizumab head-to-head against Stelara and psoriasis; and the U.S. approval of Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma.
Also, one event we thought that might occur in 2016, which is now expected in 2017, action on Cialis pediatric exclusivity, while another is expected in 2018, the cluster headache readout for -- the cluster headache readout for galcanezumab.
Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on Slide 20. At a high level, our expectations are largely unchanged. You'll see that our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is unchanged. While we've made small adjustments to our GAAP earnings per share guidance range, as well as to our line item guidance for revenue, SG&A expenses, other income and capital expenditures.
In summary, our Q3 financial performance places us on track to achieve our full year guidance. In the quarter, we posted revenue growth of 4% on a constant-currency basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. We made progress on the pipeline with the FDA approval of Lartruvo, recommendations for approval of Olaratumab and Glyxambi in Europe and granting of FDA fast-track status for our BACE inhibitor AZD3293. We continue to have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy, and, as we transition to the leadership next year, our management team will remain focused on executing our strategy to create value for all stakeholders, including shareholders.
We also remain firmly committed to achieving the mid-term financial goals we articulated on our earnings call in July, which included: driving a minimum of 5% compounded annual revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, even without solanezumab; reducing OpEx as a percent of revenue to 50% or less in 2018; increasing our gross margin as a percent of revenue in 2020 compared to 2015; launching 20 or more new products in the decade from 2014 through 2023; and providing annual dividend increases to our shareholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session."

If you can talk about those 2 possible scenarios and what they mean in terms of consensus expectations. Secondly, just curious to know what's happening with pricing in diabetes because it does seem to be getting worse.

It's difficult to say always what drives that, but the FDA considers some additional",626,"Very good. So when it comes to the Jardiance review by the FDA, we did get this 3 months extension on the action date. The new action date is now December 4 of this year. It's difficult to say always what drives that, but the FDA considers some additional information, announcements that we had provided basically major amendments, and they basically have the right to do so. I would highlight that this is not the only major amendment that has happened in the diabetes area. There've been a number of 3 months extensions, but I don't think it would be appropriate to color this in any way, positive or negative. When it comes to the indication and the label, as you know, we have basically requested a separate distinct indication for Jardiance given the data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME. Something along the lines of reducing the incidence of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. We believe that the data warrants this type of indication. Clearly, there are a number of different potential outcomes when it comes to the label that we would get. It's -- the FDA's in the -- reviewing the label, and it's probably not appropriate for me to comment more at this stage, given that the action date is getting very near. I will continue to highlight that I believe that we have the strength of the evidence to be able to have a new indication. Clearly, whether we have -- in particular, in the U.S., having an indication does make an important difference, so we are seeking that. Of course, we -- if the clinical data is included in the body of the label, yes, we could still make a claim, but the strength of the claim is not the same. So we view this as important for us and for Jardiance and for Lilly and BI. Let me answer your question on pricing in diabetes. First, when it comes to -- as it was stated as part of the remarks by Phil, when we normalize for changes in the estimates of rebates and discounts for both Q3 and Q4, we basically see, in the case of Humalog, that our normalized sales would have been minus 1% instead of minus 14%. Now minus 1% still implies a pretty important impact. It implies lower prices because we grew volume 10% with Humalog in the U.S. So that's basically minus 11% when it comes to price. What are we seeing? Well, we are seeing 2 things: increased rebates across the board, but in particular, when it comes to Part D, a lift from how Lilly views this business; and we basically see a significant more business flowing through less profitable books of business, less profitable channels. Medicare, Medicaid, charge backs. So as we look at those books of business, there's been an acceleration of those books of business at the expense of commercial and cash. So those impacts are pretty significant. Now you have seen that in the case of Humalog, we had quite a bit of volatility. We expect for this volatility, unfortunately, to continue, given that we make estimates at the end of each quarter on those rebates and discounts. But we find out what those -- where the product flow through, which books of business, afterwards, and in some cases, many quarters afterwards. So the last point that I would make because it's probably important, as you look at your different models and as we think about the Humalog and what is the ongoing growth trend for this product, as we look at the normalization that I referred to, 1/3 of that normalization refers to Q3 of 2016, 2/3 is really related to Q3 of 2015."

I know there's a fair amount of excitement around the upcoming launch and the profile. It does look promising, but I can't help but think that it's going to get meaningfully sidelined by payers in the U.S., given how crowded this market is. And if that happens, I know it would be a very slow launch curve like we've seen with a lot of other products. I'm wondering if you can comment on this assessment."

We continue to characterize it as a high-risk, high-reward program. The scenario you paint is what we think is the least probable, but it certainly could happen. In this scenario, sola would really not separate at all from placebo. I think we would be reevaluating all of the sola programs, frankly, Tim. And the way we've set up the prodromal program, which has just begun, is there's a recruitment start with a special cohort that we can also evaluate more information on. We're doing this for a couple of reasons, but one of the reasons is the ability to stop the trial should EXPEDITION3 be negative. So we've gated the investment in that way. As I said, we're not counting on that as the most probable scenario, but we've prepared for that contingency. We're excited about baricitinib, too. The profile from the Phase III program, 4 very large studies is extremely positive. That drug is under review with the FDA, and we're anticipating a launch sometime in 2017. You're identifying a key issue in that class already is crowded. It is heavily managed by payers. Lilly has a strategy on baricitinib to really focus on the differentiation over the product versus the standards-of-care of methotrexate. And Humira, we want to position the product in really the pre-biologic setting, and that may take some time to achieve as you're pointing out. However, I would say there are all kinds of payers, and those that are more clinically focused and focused on improving outcomes for pretty significant condition, lifelong condition, for young people, RA, we think we can make early headway in those settings. Others, which may be more sensitive to rebate flow, et cetera, obviously, that's going to be more difficult, but I think Lilly's prepared to be patient and build out the product through time, reminding everyone that the current IP is very long, and we have a long time to fulfill full value for baricitinib. Thanks for the questions."

So we're happy with the initial adoption and the breadth of trial and usage, which are other key indicators for us. At this point in the launch cycle, I'm not sure net sales should be the absolute marker we'd be looking at although, of course, we're looking forward to growing that quarter-on-quarter going forward, and you did see growth from Q2, which was reminding everyone of us just a few weeks of shipments in Q2. It wasn't a full quarter.  Also vis-√†-vis, COSENTYX which enjoys 3 indications, we could only have the one in psoriasis, as was mentioned in the call text earlier. We do plan submissions now for PSA in the U.S. shortly. And we have an AxSpA program ongoing. So net-net, I think we're happy with where we are. Global rollouts are beginning in the second half of the year, as well, in Europe and Japan, which are also significant opportunities. We've got a life cycle coming. And where we are head-to-head against the incumbents of TNF, Stelara and even COSENTYX within the class, which is the U.S. derm market. I think early performance indicators are quite strong."

So there are other presentations. I don't have a list in front of me, but we can provide that in follow-up. The second question is really what will change going forward, if sola is positive? And I think here, we've given long-term guidance without sola. But certainly, we would anticipate a rapid submission and introduction to the major markets, and the normal kind of go-to-market commercialization effort that would come with that, which is typically expense followed by revenue. I would also say this will present 2 new opportunities for Lilly, I think, unique ones within the field of neuroscience and Alzheimer's. One would be to look at acceleration and sort of full funding for other Alzheimer's products, particularly those with A beta-based mechanisms. Certainly, with a lead like that in sola we would want to fast follow with other innovations we have coming. We are doing that, but we can always look at speed and voracity of that effort. And then finally, looking at combinations and sequences of therapies that could be combined with solanezumab to further arrest the disease, that only make sense if sola works. And we have the sort of queued up but certainly not in our funding and expense base today.  So there are many, we'll have to prioritize amongst those.

Prop 61, we're fighting that tooth-and-nail in California. It's not only bad legislation, it's bad for your health, and we're trying to impress that on the voters. What we found is that the more people become aware of what's at stake he",438,"Yes. Thanks, John. Prop 61, we're fighting that tooth-and-nail in California. It's not only bad legislation, it's bad for your health, and we're trying to impress that on the voters. What we found is that the more people become aware of what's at stake here, and what's the likely outcomes of Proposition 61, the less they're -- the more they are prone to vote against it and vote it down. So we have a pretty big campaign underway in California, right now, to increase that level of awareness and, hopefully, to continue to shift voters toward a position of being against it for a whole variety of reasons. It's difficult to say on the larger -- are we going to see some price release after the election? I think in terms of where drug pricing sort of fits in what I call the rhetoric, that you're always going to get in a campaign season, particularly one that's as polarized as this one. So I think there may be some acute relief. I think the bigger question is if Hillary Clinton wins, what does she have in mind for health care? If Donald Trump wins, what's the direction going to be? It's pretty clear whether you say you want to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, something needs to be done if we're going to render a -- sort of a health insurance availability for everybody in this country sustainable on an ongoing basis. So I think that's going to be the bigger focus for the industry and sort of what happens in those probably critical first 2 years of the first term, which we know what happened in 2008, 2009. And I think that's what the industry has to be prepared for. At the same time, I think that, frankly, if we're successful in -- with sola, the outcome of sola and there's hope for Alzheimer's, keep in mind of the top 10 causes of death in this country, I think I heard the other day Alzheimer's is the only one where we continue to see increases in the rate of mortality. So I think if the industry can demonstrate once again like we did with HIV AIDS, like we did with Hepatitis C and so many other diseases that we can make an impact on something that increasingly everybody is fearful of and concerned about, I think that changes the dynamic too. We don't know what that outcome is going to be, but it's going to be a very interesting mix come January 1. And I'm sure Dave Ricks is ready to jump all over it."

Bottom line, our animal health quarterly results have been more volatile this year, as you know. Inventory destocking was a significant event in Q3, and it contributed to the revenue decline this quarter. We don't see these results as a trend. Just as we enjoyed the benefits, as you recall, of the distributor purchases in Q2 ahead of our SAP cutover in the U.S., inventories were depleted in Q3, which caused the majority of the decline in our companion animal business. So I would note, the SAP transition has gone very smoothly. On the companion animal side, our business is up 3% year-to-date, which really normalizes for the Q2 and the Q3 inventory impact. And what's driving this is one, successful launches of some new innovation as well as, we believe, our improved competitiveness with the combination of Novartis and Elanco. On the food animal side, food animal is down 1% year-to-date, and really, outside the U.S., we've experienced weakness in Latin America. And really, this region represented the entire decline for our OUS food animal in Q3. And then in the U.S., we faced some market access challenges this quarter, in particular, Paylean, a product in our U.S. swine business. Poor customers pursuing the China export markets removed Paylean. They'll do that on and off. They'll come on and off the product, depending on needing the export markets or not. So that in summary. And then as John noted, 2 weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of BI's companion animal vaccine business subject to the closing again of the BI Sanofi asset swap. We see this as a tremendous complement to our companion animal business in the U.S."

So while we've recruited well the number of people in the program, we're waiting for the cluster events to start, which can demonstrate the value of the product. So that goes part and parcel with any new -- pushing into a new therapy area like this where studies haven't even been done before with medicines on a large-scale. But we're excited about that part of the program. Again, it'll be first with that indication, to our knowledge. Gives us some, I think, credit with neurologists for tackling a tough condition and potentially some value support as we go-to-market.  Also, I'd say that migraine program is on track.

What I hear you asking about is as we look forward to the future indications, what's -- how do we think about the size of this market. I would say on PSA, which would be the next one for us based on differentiation we think we have versus standards-of-care, like Humira, reminding everyone that IL-17s can be used without methotrexate, and you get sort of this dual skin and joint benefit that's at least as good on a joint. We're encouraged by what we see so far in our estimates. Our own estimates actually have gone up since we started the program, because treatment rates for PSA appear to be quite a bit higher in psoriasis when it comes to using biologics. Just to give everyone a bit of frame on that, when you look at products that are indicated only for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, take COSENTYX, for instance, they actually have a little bit more volume coming out of nonderms than derms right now. And I think that indicates that although the incidence rate is lower for PSA, rheumatologists are more comfortable with Biologics. They're treating PSA at a higher rate. AxSpA is, I would say, even more of an undeveloped opportunity. In particular, Lilly's program will feature the potential to be indicated in non-radiographic AxSpA. So there is an absence of x-ray proof of the condition. This is a recognized indication in Europe, but not yet by the FDA. Should we achieve that, I think that presents a very significant market expansion opportunity for AxSpA where the biologic basis of the condition is known to be quite similar to PSA and psoriasis. So there's a lot of promise being held out for the class in AxSpA. We see some early data from CONSENTYX in that regard. We're using even high doses. So I think we are optimistic on all those indications as being meaningful part of the ultimate success story of Taltz."

So I've commented on some of the dynamics of the quarter and some of the mix changes as we look at the increases in Medicare, Medicaid chargebacks as a percentage of the overall business. Clearly, we expect those and some of those dynamics to continue.  For the most part, now as we look at the different formularies, Dave, all of the large formularies have gone exclusive. So we -- whether it's on the Part D side or on the commercial side as of 2017, I think we basically have a situation where Humalog will be exclusive in a certain number of formularies and our competitor in some others. Clearly, there could be switches back and forth that will deteriorate prices even further, but we have not seen that because there's a very high disruption cost at the patient level to be able to switch 100% of the business now for more incremental gains. So it's difficult to say what the pricing dynamics would be, but prices, net prices, when it comes to Humalog, are pretty low already."

We're now, of course, past last patient visit waiting for the data later this fall. And we'll just have to take a look at the date when it reads out here in through the end of the year. And again, maintain that -- we think in mild-Alzheimer's, certainly in prodromal and absolutely in pre-Alzheimer's conditions, measuring cognitive changes is a much more sensitive and much more appropriate a way to measure disease impact and disease modification. Of course, we will measure function in mild-Alzheimer's. But I would point out that for the mild study, we started with AZ, with called DAYBREAK with a prodromal mild combination study on our BACE inhibitor with AZ as well as our own prodromal program we've just began with sola. All of those use cognition as the primary endpoint. This is a bet we're making across the portfolio, and we think is well-founded based on the expert advice we have and the way science has evolved."

And if we look at class growth, we have shared and we have been concerned with the overall growth that we're seeing in the SGLT-2 class in the U.S. The classes we look at the last 4 weeks relative to the same 4 weeks of last year, is only growing about 20%. That's significantly below our expectations. We are hopeful that the inclusion of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data on the label will be a catalyst for the overall growth, and we feel confident if we can get the right language then we'll be able to make a huge value proposition for this product in the eyes of our customers. As we look at SGLT-2 class growth, it is a little bit different outside of the U.S. In Europe, the class is expected to double. Same case in Japan, more than double in Japan in 2016. Yes, from a slower base, but -- from a smaller base, but the growth dynamics, I think, are very encouraging. We are doing fairly well when it comes to share. We are -- we now have a 30% new-to-brand share in the U.S. Our overall share in Germany is nearly 40% and above 40% in Italy, and basically growing in Spain, U.K., Canada. So I feel very good about the position that we have within the class itself. Now on the pricing question and rebates, I did comment on some of the co-pay cards and some of the impact of those. I also mentioned that the impact of the co-pay cards is going to lessen over time because there's a duration of these co-pay cards. So while we have implemented some of those changes, we have a number of patients on these co-pay cards already and some of them are also on the market. So we expect this to be a long-term phenomenon, and we will see this decreasing over time."

I think, overall, at a high level as we noted last December in our Investor Conference, we are going through a transition period. What I would note is yes, the SAP cutover is complete and that volatility is completed. So we do see less volatility going forward. I think we're keeping our eyes on a few things that are absolutely critical for animal health business. One, our companion animal competitiveness, as I've shared, we feel very good about that. Some of our growth engines like our vaccine business and expansion of that. And then we noted 7 big products that were critical for innovation, which you know drives animal health just like pharma. We've put 5 of those 7 products into the market, and they'll be foundational to our growth going forward. And then on the margin side, we continue to stay focused on the margins where we're moving to that low- to mid-20s, and we see that happening in 2016.

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me here in Indianapolis -- excuse me, on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratory; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Biomedicine; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Kristina Wright, Brad Robling, Chris Ogden and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team.
During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.
The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start, as usual, with a summary of our progress since the second quarter earnings call in late July, and I'll use our strategic objectives framework for this discussion.
Our first strategic objective: Grow revenue. Q3 revenue increased 4% on a constant currency or performance basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. Consistent with previous quarters this year, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Portrazza and Taltz accounted for nearly all of that growth.
On our strategic objective, expand margins, our non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue declined 20 basis points compared to the third quarter 2015. We expect continued progress in the fourth quarter as our full year guidance at the midpoint of our ranges implies an improvement of about 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue for the year.
Under the heading of Sustaining the Flow of Innovation, olaratumab was approved in the U.S. last week for soft tissue sarcoma and will be sold under the trade name Lartruvo.
Europe CHMP provided positive opinions, recommending approval of olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma and of Glyxambi for type 2 diabetes. And, along with AstraZeneca, we received fast-track designation from the U.S. FDA for AZD3293, the oral-based inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease.
On our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value, we announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim's U.S. Animal Health vaccines business, filling a key strategic need in our companion animal portfolio. In both human pharma and animal health, we will continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
Finally, during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our dividend.
In summary, the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020.
Now let's move on to a review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call.
We continue to make progress on the regulatory front. As I just mentioned here in the U.S., the FDA approved Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with soft tissue sarcoma with a histologic subtype for which an anthracycline-containing regimen is appropriate and which is not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery. This is the first FDA approved front-line therapy for soft tissue sarcoma in 4 decades. It also marks the third product from our ImClone acquisition to receive regulatory approval. This is an accelerated approval based on data from our Phase II trial. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory study. The Phase III announced study is fully enrolled and is currently expected to complete in late 2018.
In Europe, we received a pair of recommendations for approval from the CHMP. The first recommendation was for granting a conditional marketing authorization for Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery and who have not been previously treated with doxorubicin.
Similar to the U.S., Lartruvo was reviewed under the EMA's accelerated assessment program. As part of the conditional marketing authorization, we will need to provide results from our ongoing Phase III study. Until availability of the full data, the CHMP will review the benefits and risks of Lartruvo annually to determine whether the conditional marketing authorization can be maintained.
The second recommendation was for Glyxambi, a single tablet combining Jardiance, our SGLT-2 inhibitor, and Trajenta, a DPP-4 inhibitor. The specific recommendation was for use in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control when metformin and/or sulphonylurea and one of the individual components of Glyxambi do not provide adequate glycemic control, or when a patient is already being treated with the free combination of Jardiance and Trajenta. Glyxambi, Jardiance and Trajenta are products of the Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly diabetes alliance.
Finally, along with AstraZeneca, we received fast-track designation from the FDA for AZD3293, an oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme, or BACE inhibitor, being studied in Phase III trials for Alzheimer's disease.
On the clinical front, we announced that following a preplanned interim analysis for MONARCH 2, an independent data monitoring committee provided the recommendation to continue the study without modification as the interim efficacy criteria were not met. The MONARCH 2 trial compares abemaciclib with fulvestrant versus placebo -- versus placebo with fulvestrant in women with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The trial will continue to completion in the first half of 2017.
At the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting, early data in lung cancer were presented on the combinations of Keytruda with Alimta and of Keytruda with Cyramza. KEYNOTE-021, a randomized Phase II study, included cohort G, studying Keytruda added to Alimta plus carboplatin versus Alimta plus carboplatin in first line non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer patients regardless of PD-L1 expression level. The combination of Keytruda and Alimta carbo nearly doubled the response rate compared to Alimta carbo alone. There's been considerable focus within the investment community on the durability of responses. In this study, we were very pleased that patients on the Keytruda-Alimta-carbo arm experienced progression-free survival of 13 months. While the overall survival data were not yet mature, roughly 75% of patients on both arms were still alive at 1 year. This is at the top end of results we've seen for any combination trial in a broad population of first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients, and we look forward to the presentation of additional data from this trial at future medical conferences.
Updated data were also presented from the KEYNOTE-098 study, evaluating Keytruda with Cyramza in second to fourth line non-small cell lung cancer. Here too we observed promising clinical activity, including durable responses. 80% of patients experienced a decrease in target lesions, spanning the spectrum of PD-L1 status, while the objective response rate was 30%, with responses seen in both non-squamous and squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. In addition, the disease control rate was 85%, and median progression-free survival was not yet reached.
The data from both KEYNOTE-021G and KEYNOTE-098 provide proof points for how we intend to deploy our diverse oncology portfolio across the 3 platforms of cell signaling, tumor microenvironment and immuno-oncology to pursue a rational and differentiated combination strategy across our diverse oncology portfolio in order to improve outcomes for patients.
Shifting to immunology. I'm pleased to report that we achieved a primary endpoint in the SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who had been treated with one or more conventional DMARDs as well as had an inadequate response to 1 or 2 TNF inhibitors or intolerance to a TNF inhibitor.
The results of SPIRIT-P2 further build on the existing benefit risk profile of Taltz, obtained from a very large clinical program. With this second positive psoriatic arthritis study, we plan to submit ixekizumab for psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. in the first half of next year followed by submissions in Europe and other geographies, and we plan to present the data at a medical meeting in 2017. Keep in mind that psoriatic arthritis has already been approved in Japan.
At the EADV meeting in Vienna, we also presented initial data on our head-to-head study called IXORA-S of Taltz versus Stelara in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The primary endpoint of this study was met as Taltz demonstrated superiority to Stelara on the PASI 90 score at 12 weeks. These data reinforce the strong clinical profile of Taltz, and we look forward to preventing -- to presenting additional data from this study next year.
As expected, earlier this month we achieved last patient visit in the EXPEDITION3 trial, solanezumab, in patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. As a result, we plan to issue a top line press release before the end of the year.
In other news, we announced the retirement of yours truly as President and Chief Executive Officer effective December 31 of this year. I will continue on Lilly's Board of Directors until the end of May, serving as nonexecutive Chairman. Dave Ricks, currently President of Lilly Biomedicine, will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer and join the board on January 1. Dave will become Chairman of the Board on June 1.
We announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim, Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies vaccines portfolio as well as a fully integrated manufacturing and R&D site and a number of pipeline assets for approximately $885 million, including the estimated cost of acquired inventory. This innovative platform of companion animal vaccines has high brand awareness and an established loyal customer base. The addition of these assets advances our strategy of offering a balanced portfolio to both prevent and treat disease. This acquisition is subject to FTC approval and closing of the BI-Sanofi asset swap. We expect to close the deal early next year.
The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled against Lilly and its partner, Acrux, in a patent case for the testosterone treatment, Axiron, ruling that Axiron's formulation and axilla application patents are invalid, and the applicator patent, although valid, would not be infringed by generic competitors.
We have appealed the ruling. The formulation patent expires in February 2017, while the axilla application and applicator patents expire in 2027. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined that the method-of-use patents for Effient are invalid. Lilly, Daiichi Sankyo and Ube strongly disagree with the PTO's ruling regarding validity of the Effient method-of-use patent and have appealed the ruling.
Separately, next steps are being discussed with the District Court in ongoing litigation on both the method-of-use patents and the compound patent. As a reminder, the method-of-use patents expire in 2023, while the compound patent expires in April of 2017, and we are entitled to pediatric exclusivity until October of 2017.
Finally, we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. As we announced on our second quarter earnings call, we do expect to provide annual increases in our dividend, and we'll continue to balance share repurchase with external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil."

Thank you, John.
Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results.
I'll focus my comments this morning on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter GAAP results.
Looking at the non-GAAP measures on Slide 9, you can see that Q3 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q3 2015, reaching $5.2 billion.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.4 percentage points to 76.4%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in a benefit to both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit of this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year.
Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 30 basis points, going from 75.2% in last year's quarter to 75.5% this quarter.
Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 4% compared to Q3 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, while R&D increased 8%. The slight increase in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products, largely offset by lower spending on late life cycle products. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs.
Other income and expense was income of $27 million this quarter compared to the $87 million reported in last year's quarter.
Our tax rate was 22%. This is a decrease of 290 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This decrease was primarily due to certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit that are in force in 2016, but had lapsed during last year's third quarter.
At the bottom line, net income decreased 2%, and earnings per share decreased 1%.
Slide 10 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first 9 months of the year, while Slide 11 contains a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 24 and 25.
Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On Slide 12 in the yellow-highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 5% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, driven entirely by volumes.
By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 17%, driven primarily by volume. Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Humalog and Taltz.
Having completed the take back of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1 last year, we also benefited from booking end sales of Erbitux this quarter.
As cited in our press release issued earlier this morning, we have experienced less product returns than anticipated for Cymbalta post its patent expiration, leading to a reduction in the returns reserved this quarter of approximately $145 million. Excluding this item, our U.S. Pharma revenue grew 10% this quarter, with an 11% increase due to higher volume and a 1% decline due to lower realized prices.
The decline in EuCan revenue of 8% was driven by the negative effect of price, and to a lesser extent, lower volumes and unfavorable FX movements. On a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 6%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower volume and price for Cymbalta and Alimta following patent expirations, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including Trulicity, Basaglar, Cyramza and Jardiance as well as higher sales of Humalog, Trajenta and Cialis.
In Japan, pharma revenue increased 15% in total, driven by an 18% benefit from a stronger yen, and, to a lesser extent, increased volume, partially offset by a 6% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts.
On a constant-currency basis, Japan pharma revenue decreased 3%. This performance decline was attributable to the entry of generic olanzapine this past June. Excluding Zyprexa, Japan pharma revenue in Q3 grew 6% on a constant-currency basis, led by Cyramza, with additional contributions from Cymbalta, Strattera, Trulicity, Basaglar and Jardiance.
Turning to emerging markets. We saw revenue decline 8%, primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange.
On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue decreased 3% due to lower volumes for off-patent brands, including Cialis, Zyprexa, Alimta and Cymbalta, partially offset by higher volumes for Humulin, Trulicity, Trajenta and Cyramza.
Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 7% due to foreign exchange, while revenue was flat on a constant-currency basis. Changes in order timing from our distributors negatively affected growth this quarter while positively affecting growth last quarter. We estimate the growth in underlying demand for our products in China this quarter was about 5%.
Turning to animal health. This quarter, worldwide revenue decreased 9%, both in total and on a constant-currency basis, including a 14% decline in companion animal and a 6% in food animal.
Animal health revenue was significantly impacted by distributor inventory de-stocking in the quarter, following a change over to SAP at the end of Q2. This inventory impact represented the majority of the decline in companion animal revenue in Q3 and has contributed to the volatility in our animal health results.
In food animal, economic weakness in Latin America, combined with market access pressures in the U.S., contributed to lower revenue in the quarter. Note that on a year-to-date basis, which includes the SAP inventory impact in both Q2 and Q3, animal health revenue is flat.
On Slide 13, you'll find the same price rate and volume analysis but on a year-to-date basis. As I mentioned earlier, excluding foreign exchange, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, with nearly all of that growth coming from higher volume. In total, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar and Portrazza, were the engine of our worldwide volume growth.
Slide 14 shows that these products drove 6.6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. The take back of Erbitux contributed nearly 2 percentage points to our volume growth, while Humalog contributed nearly 1 percentage point.
You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror, still provided a drag of roughly 2 percentage points on our volume growth.
Specifically on Humalog, you will see that the U.S. sales this quarter are down 14% as higher volume was more than offset by lower realized prices. This quarter's net realized price was negatively affected by changes in estimates for rebates and discounts.
Normalizing for changes in estimates for rebates and discounts in both Q3 2016 and Q3 2015, the underlying U.S. sales trend for the quarter for Humalog was basically flat.
Now let me turn the call over to Derica."
285467,319564408,1061187,"Eli Lilly and Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil.As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session sue, Enrique and Dave could provide more detail.As you can see on the graph on Slide 15, our new products generated over $500 milli",1221,"Thanks, Phil.
As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session sue, Enrique and Dave could provide more detail.
As you can see on the graph on Slide 15, our new products generated over $500 million in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This represents about 10% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 8% last quarter. And, as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove over 6.5 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter.
We continue to be pleased with the uptake of Trulicity. Here in the U.S., we're capturing nearly 30% of new patient starts in the GLP-1 class. In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the class itself, with the U.S. GLP-1 market growing nearly 30%.
As I mentioned last quarter, in many OUS markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with the early uptake of Victoza.
Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan. OUS markets now account for nearly 60% of our worldwide Cyramza sales, and we look forward to continue growth in these markets, not only in gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications.
U.S. Cyramza sales declined this quarter, largely as a result of competitive pressure from immuno-oncology therapies and non-small cell lung cancer, while our share of market in gastric cancer has been relatively stable.
Moving to Jardiance. While less than we expected, the SGLT-2 class in the U.S. is growing over 20%, and our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists is now over 35%. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we expect FDA action on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME submission in early December and continue to see an update of the Jardiance label to reflect the compelling CB data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME as a catalyst for the growing of the class and of Jardiance.
Taltz, which launched in the U.S. in April, is off to an excellent start. We're seeing strong growth of the IL-17 class of psoriasis and are pleased that our New to Brand share of market with dermatologists, a proxy for use in psoriasis, is already over 10%. While it's still early in our OUS launches, feedback has been positive, and we look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
The rollout of Abasaglar in OUS countries continues, and we are preparing for our U.S. launch in mid-December.
Finally, we continue to see strong uptake of I/O agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is clearly affecting use of Portrazza.
Moving to Slide 16. You'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 4%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 4% was in line with revenue growth, while non-GAAP operating expenses grew just slightly faster than revenue at 5%.
Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 2% and non-GAAP EPS increased 1%.
Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 17 shows our pipeline as of October 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrow showing progression and red arrow showing movement out of the portfolio.
In our NME pipeline, you'll see the green arrow denoting FDA approval of Lartruvo in soft tissue sarcoma. We began Phase II testing of 2 molecules, the low-dose BACE inhibitor that we discussed at our Alzheimer's disease meeting last December and the BTK inhibitor in immunology we licensed with Hanmi.
We also started Phase I testing for a small molecule cancer compound, and we terminated development of 2 Phase I oncology assets and of blosozumab, a sclerostin monoclonal antibody for osteoporosis.
In our NILEX pipeline, as shown on Slide 18, we began a Phase III study of solanezumab and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Currently, we plan to recruit nearly 2,500 amyloid-positive patients for this study. The blind-to-treatment period will be 24 months, and we anticipate trial completion in mid-2021.
On solanezumab, John mentioned earlier that we are on track to issue the top line press release for EXPEDITION3 before the end of the year. I'd also note that we have a small number of investor interactions with management scheduled this quarter, and all of these interactions will occur before management sees the EXPEDITION3 study results.
If we hit the most aggressive time line from moving from last patient visit to database lock, we may be able to present the EXPEDITION3 data at the CTAD meeting in December. However, it is also quite possible that we will not present the data at a medical meeting until next year. Should we present the EXPEDITION3 data at CTAD, the presentation will be made available via a live webcast open to the investment community. So live participation will not be required to access the information in realtime.
Turning to Slide 19. Let's recap the recent progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green check marks for: the initiation of the Phase III study of solanezumab and prodromal Alzheimer's disease; the internal data read out that John mentioned earlier of the Phase III SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis; the presentation at EADV of data from the IXORA-S study evaluating ixekizumab head-to-head against Stelara and psoriasis; and the U.S. approval of Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma.
Also, one event we thought that might occur in 2016, which is now expected in 2017, action on Cialis pediatric exclusivity, while another is expected in 2018, the cluster headache readout for -- the cluster headache readout for galcanezumab.
Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on Slide 20. At a high level, our expectations are largely unchanged. You'll see that our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is unchanged. While we've made small adjustments to our GAAP earnings per share guidance range, as well as to our line item guidance for revenue, SG&A expenses, other income and capital expenditures.
In summary, our Q3 financial performance places us on track to achieve our full year guidance. In the quarter, we posted revenue growth of 4% on a constant-currency basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. We made progress on the pipeline with the FDA approval of Lartruvo, recommendations for approval of Olaratumab and Glyxambi in Europe and granting of FDA fast-track status for our BACE inhibitor AZD3293. We continue to have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy, and, as we transition to the leadership next year, our management team will remain focused on executing our strategy to create value for all stakeholders, including shareholders.
We also remain firmly committed to achieving the mid-term financial goals we articulated on our earnings call in July, which included: driving a minimum of 5% compounded annual revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, even without solanezumab; reducing OpEx as a percent of revenue to 50% or less in 2018; increasing our gross margin as a percent of revenue in 2020 compared to 2015; launching 20 or more new products in the decade from 2014 through 2023; and providing annual dividend increases to our shareholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session."

Or is the other alternative to get no mention of that in the indication section, but the EMPA-REG trial mentioned in the label somewhere. If you can talk about those 2 possible scenarios and what they mean in terms of consensus expectations. Secondly, just curious to know what's happening with pricing in diabetes because it does seem to be getting worse. You talked about rebates and discounts with Humalog, but we're -- it also seems that we're seeing some price discounting in SGLT-2s just based on INVOKANA's recent performance and their weakness due to discounting. So if you could talk about that as well."

So when it comes to the Jardiance review by the FDA, we did get this 3 months extension on the action date. The new action date is now December 4 of this year. It's difficult to say always what drives that, but the FDA considers some additional information, announcements that we had provided basically major amendments, and they basically have the right to do so. I would highlight that this is not the only major amendment that has happened in the diabetes area. There've been a number of 3 months extensions, but I don't think it would be appropriate to color this in any way, positive or negative. When it comes to the indication and the label, as you know, we have basically requested a separate distinct indication for Jardiance given the data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME. Something along the lines of reducing the incidence of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. We believe that the data warrants this type of indication. Clearly, there are a number of different potential outcomes when it comes to the label that we would get. It's -- the FDA's in the -- reviewing the label, and it's probably not appropriate for me to comment more at this stage, given that the action date is getting very near. I will continue to highlight that I believe that we have the strength of the evidence to be able to have a new indication. Clearly, whether we have -- in particular, in the U.S., having an indication does make an important difference, so we are seeking that. Of course, we -- if the clinical data is included in the body of the label, yes, we could still make a claim, but the strength of the claim is not the same. So we view this as important for us and for Jardiance and for Lilly and BI. Let me answer your question on pricing in diabetes. First, when it comes to -- as it was stated as part of the remarks by Phil, when we normalize for changes in the estimates of rebates and discounts for both Q3 and Q4, we basically see, in the case of Humalog, that our normalized sales would have been minus 1% instead of minus 14%. Now minus 1% still implies a pretty important impact. It implies lower prices because we grew volume 10% with Humalog in the U.S. So that's basically minus 11% when it comes to price. What are we seeing? Well, we are seeing 2 things: increased rebates across the board, but in particular, when it comes to Part D, a lift from how Lilly views this business; and we basically see a significant more business flowing through less profitable books of business, less profitable channels. Medicare, Medicaid, charge backs. So as we look at those books of business, there's been an acceleration of those books of business at the expense of commercial and cash. So those impacts are pretty significant. Now you have seen that in the case of Humalog, we had quite a bit of volatility. We expect for this volatility, unfortunately, to continue, given that we make estimates at the end of each quarter on those rebates and discounts. But we find out what those -- where the product flow through, which books of business, afterwards, and in some cases, many quarters afterwards. So the last point that I would make because it's probably important, as you look at your different models and as we think about the Humalog and what is the ongoing growth trend for this product, as we look at the normalization that I referred to, 1/3 of that normalization refers to Q3 of 2016, 2/3 is really related to Q3 of 2015."

I know there's a fair amount of excitement around the upcoming launch and the profile. It does look promising, but I can't help but think that it's going to get meaningfully sidelined by payers in the U.S., given how crowded this market is. And if that happens, I know it would be a very slow launch curve like we've seen with a lot of other products. I'm wondering if you can comment on this assessment."

We continue to characterize it as a high-risk, high-reward program. The scenario you paint is what we think is the least probable, but it certainly could happen. In this scenario, sola would really not separate at all from placebo. I think we would be reevaluating all of the sola programs, frankly, Tim. And the way we've set up the prodromal program, which has just begun, is there's a recruitment start with a special cohort that we can also evaluate more information on. We're doing this for a couple of reasons, but one of the reasons is the ability to stop the trial should EXPEDITION3 be negative. So we've gated the investment in that way. As I said, we're not counting on that as the most probable scenario, but we've prepared for that contingency. We're excited about baricitinib, too. The profile from the Phase III program, 4 very large studies is extremely positive. That drug is under review with the FDA, and we're anticipating a launch sometime in 2017. You're identifying a key issue in that class already is crowded. It is heavily managed by payers. Lilly has a strategy on baricitinib to really focus on the differentiation over the product versus the standards-of-care of methotrexate. And Humira, we want to position the product in really the pre-biologic setting, and that may take some time to achieve as you're pointing out. However, I would say there are all kinds of payers, and those that are more clinically focused and focused on improving outcomes for pretty significant condition, lifelong condition, for young people, RA, we think we can make early headway in those settings. Others, which may be more sensitive to rebate flow, et cetera, obviously, that's going to be more difficult, but I think Lilly's prepared to be patient and build out the product through time, reminding everyone that the current IP is very long, and we have a long time to fulfill full value for baricitinib.

At this point in the launch cycle, I'm not sure net sales should be the absolute marker we'd be looking at although, of course, we're looking forward to growing that quarter-on-quarter going forward, and you did see growth from Q2, which was reminding everyone of us just a few weeks of shipments in Q2. It wasn't a full quarter.  Also vis-√†-vis, COSENTYX which enjoys 3 indications, we could only have the one in psoriasis, as was mentioned in the call text earlier. We do plan submissions now for PSA in the U.S. shortly. And we have an AxSpA program ongoing. So net-net, I think we're happy with where we are. Global rollouts are beginning in the second half of the year, as well, in Europe and Japan, which are also significant opportunities. We've got a life cycle coming. And where we are head-to-head against the incumbents of TNF, Stelara and even COSENTYX within the class, which is the U.S. derm market. I think early performance indicators are quite strong."

In regards to our operating expense and spending in the third quarter, there was really nothing unusual or lack of transparency in terms of what we're doing behind-the-scenes. It really is driven by the new product launches and our support of that. You've probably seen some of our new DTC ads that we've launched in the quarter as well, that's driving the spend as well as our launch prep. We talked about the recent approval of Lartruvo, and we've been anticipating that for some time. In addition, you also see that we continue to invest in our pipeline. And if you look at our total operating expenses for the quarter, our biggest growth was in that realm in terms of R&D, and it really is progressing -- continues to progress our pipeline and to pursue the opportunities that we have embedded there that we believe still keeps us on track to achieving that potential of 20 launches in a 10-year span. So whether you call it opportunistic, we see it more in a sustained fashion that this is what we've been geared up to do."

From a differentiation perspective, there were no head to heads, but if we look at bemaciclib it is -- we've seen single agent activity now in the MONARCH 1 trial and also we saw the near MONARACH data that was presented at ESMO, we saw single agent activity there. We see 14x more potency to CDK 4 than CDK 6 for the bemaciclib. We continue to be able to dose these continuously and it crosses the blood brain barrier, if I can say that.

It's not a large meeting, but it's one of our top experts who do clinical researcher around the globe in Alzheimer's all come.  As a result, we are consistently at that meeting with posters, other presentations. As you know, Lilly has done a lot of work, whether it be in diagnosis work with our PET scanning business, we have some data reading out in that area as well as other supported data looking at disease modification, et cetera, in different populations. So there are other presentations. I don't have a list in front of me, but we can provide that in follow-up. The second question is really what will change going forward, if sola is positive? And I think here, we've given long-term guidance without sola. But certainly, we would anticipate a rapid submission and introduction to the major markets, and the normal kind of go-to-market commercialization effort that would come with that, which is typically expense followed by revenue. I would also say this will present 2 new opportunities for Lilly, I think, unique ones within the field of neuroscience and Alzheimer's. One would be to look at acceleration and sort of full funding for other Alzheimer's products, particularly those with A beta-based mechanisms. Certainly, with a lead like that in sola we would want to fast follow with other innovations we have coming. We are doing that, but we can always look at speed and voracity of that effort. And then finally, looking at combinations and sequences of therapies that could be combined with solanezumab to further arrest the disease, that only make sense if sola works. And we have the sort of queued up but certainly not in our funding and expense base today.  So there are many, we'll have to prioritize amongst those. And, I think, of course, the -- qualitatively, the way sola works will have some bearing on how much of that additional investment we would trigger."

What we found is that the more people become aware of what's at stake here, and what's the likely outcomes of Proposition 61, the less they're -- the more they are prone to vote against it and vote it down. So we have a pretty big campaign underway in California, right now, to increase that level of awareness and, hopefully, to continue to shift voters toward a position of being against it for a whole variety of reasons. It's difficult to say on the larger -- are we going to see some price release after the election? I think in terms of where drug pricing sort of fits in what I call the rhetoric, that you're always going to get in a campaign season, particularly one that's as polarized as this one. So I think there may be some acute relief. I think the bigger question is if Hillary Clinton wins, what does she have in mind for health care? If Donald Trump wins, what's the direction going to be? It's pretty clear whether you say you want to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, something needs to be done if we're going to render a -- sort of a health insurance availability for everybody in this country sustainable on an ongoing basis. So I think that's going to be the bigger focus for the industry and sort of what happens in those probably critical first 2 years of the first term, which we know what happened in 2008, 2009. And I think that's what the industry has to be prepared for. At the same time, I think that, frankly, if we're successful in -- with sola, the outcome of sola and there's hope for Alzheimer's, keep in mind of the top 10 causes of death in this country, I think I heard the other day Alzheimer's is the only one where we continue to see increases in the rate of mortality. So I think if the industry can demonstrate once again like we did with HIV AIDS, like we did with Hepatitis C and so many other diseases that we can make an impact on something that increasingly everybody is fearful of and concerned about, I think that changes the dynamic too. We don't know what that outcome is going to be, but it's going to be a very interesting mix come January 1. And I'm sure Dave Ricks is ready to jump all over it."

We believe that Glyxambi will have a very significant benefit once this happens, but investing today in a really big way in Glyxambi really doesn't make sense. Whether it's access or promotional investment. Glyxambi has today fairly low access. We are in the 20s, when we look at commercial access, and it's even lower than that in Part D. We need to retake that once we get the new label for Jardiance."

Bottom line, our animal health quarterly results have been more volatile this year, as you know. Inventory destocking was a significant event in Q3, and it contributed to the revenue decline this quarter. We don't see these results as a trend. Just as we enjoyed the benefits, as you recall, of the distributor purchases in Q2 ahead of our SAP cutover in the U.S., inventories were depleted in Q3, which caused the majority of the decline in our companion animal business. So I would note, the SAP transition has gone very smoothly. On the companion animal side, our business is up 3% year-to-date, which really normalizes for the Q2 and the Q3 inventory impact. And what's driving this is one, successful launches of some new innovation as well as, we believe, our improved competitiveness with the combination of Novartis and Elanco. On the food animal side, food animal is down 1% year-to-date, and really, outside the U.S., we've experienced weakness in Latin America. And really, this region represented the entire decline for our OUS food animal in Q3. And then in the U.S., we faced some market access challenges this quarter, in particular, Paylean, a product in our U.S. swine business. Poor customers pursuing the China export markets removed Paylean. They'll do that on and off. They'll come on and off the product, depending on needing the export markets or not. So that in summary. And then as John noted, 2 weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of BI's companion animal vaccine business subject to the closing again of the BI Sanofi asset swap. We see this as a tremendous complement to our companion animal business in the U.S."

We have pushed back the time line into next year based on enrollment. And really to clarify that, it's actually the ability to have subjects that have cluster headaches. Some forms of the condition are episodic. So while we've recruited well the number of people in the program, we're waiting for the cluster events to start, which can demonstrate the value of the product. So that goes part and parcel with any new -- pushing into a new therapy area like this where studies haven't even been done before with medicines on a large-scale. But we're excited about that part of the program. Again, it'll be first with that indication, to our knowledge. Gives us some, I think, credit with neurologists for tackling a tough condition and potentially some value support as we go-to-market.  Also, I'd say that migraine program is on track. We've communicated previously that the mid-'17 readout with potentially a submission by the end of '17. So we're feeling good about galcanezumab overall."

What I hear you asking about is as we look forward to the future indications, what's -- how do we think about the size of this market. I would say on PSA, which would be the next one for us based on differentiation we think we have versus standards-of-care, like Humira, reminding everyone that IL-17s can be used without methotrexate, and you get sort of this dual skin and joint benefit that's at least as good on a joint. We're encouraged by what we see so far in our estimates. Our own estimates actually have gone up since we started the program, because treatment rates for PSA appear to be quite a bit higher in psoriasis when it comes to using biologics. Just to give everyone a bit of frame on that, when you look at products that are indicated only for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, take COSENTYX, for instance, they actually have a little bit more volume coming out of nonderms than derms right now. And I think that indicates that although the incidence rate is lower for PSA, rheumatologists are more comfortable with Biologics. They're treating PSA at a higher rate. AxSpA is, I would say, even more of an undeveloped opportunity. In particular, Lilly's program will feature the potential to be indicated in non-radiographic AxSpA. So there is an absence of x-ray proof of the condition. This is a recognized indication in Europe, but not yet by the FDA. Should we achieve that, I think that presents a very significant market expansion opportunity for AxSpA where the biologic basis of the condition is known to be quite similar to PSA and psoriasis. So there's a lot of promise being held out for the class in AxSpA. We see some early data from CONSENTYX in that regard. We're using even high doses. So I think we are optimistic on all those indications as being meaningful part of the ultimate success story of Taltz."

As we look at SGLT-2 class growth, it is a little bit different outside of the U.S. In Europe, the class is expected to double. Same case in Japan, more than double in Japan in 2016. Yes, from a slower base, but -- from a smaller base, but the growth dynamics, I think, are very encouraging. We are doing fairly well when it comes to share. We are -- we now have a 30% new-to-brand share in the U.S. Our overall share in Germany is nearly 40% and above 40% in Italy, and basically growing in Spain, U.K., Canada. So I feel very good about the position that we have within the class itself. Now on the pricing question and rebates, I did comment on some of the co-pay cards and some of the impact of those. I also mentioned that the impact of the co-pay cards is going to lessen over time because there's a duration of these co-pay cards. So while we have implemented some of those changes, we have a number of patients on these co-pay cards already and some of them are also on the market. So we expect this to be a long-term phenomenon, and we will see this decreasing over time."

I think, overall, at a high level as we noted last December in our Investor Conference, we are going through a transition period. What I would note is yes, the SAP cutover is complete and that volatility is completed. So we do see less volatility going forward. I think we're keeping our eyes on a few things that are absolutely critical for animal health business. One, our companion animal competitiveness, as I've shared, we feel very good about that. Some of our growth engines like our vaccine business and expansion of that. And then we noted 7 big products that were critical for innovation, which you know drives animal health just like pharma. We've put 5 of those 7 products into the market, and they'll be foundational to our growth going forward. And then on the margin side, we continue to stay focused on the margins where we're moving to that low- to mid-20s, and we see that happening in 2016. So overall, Elanco, our animal health business, is well positioned in the top tier to remain competitive in this competitive consolidating industry."

And then second, should we expect the formularies are going to exercise pressure in this segment as well, given there'll be 3 drugs with very similar profiles in the way that pulled the signal off the formulary that CDS has in CML as well as other molecular drugs such as Xtandi.

This is Brad Robling's last earnings call, and we thank him for his support of our investors and wish him all the best in his new business development assignment. Thanks, Brad.
And finally, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank John for his steady leadership during one of the most difficult periods of our company's 140-year history. Spurred on by John's vision and his commitment to innovation, Lilly is today in the midst of one of our most productive periods of new product launches, and we've achieved great progress building an R&D engine that has the potential to launch 20 new products in the -- in 10 years beginning in 2014. 
John, many analysts and portfolio managers I've met with in recent weeks have expressed their sincere appreciation for your contributions to the company and to the sector. You've earned their praise, and we all owe you a debt of gratitude. And we wish you all the best in the next chapter of your life.
