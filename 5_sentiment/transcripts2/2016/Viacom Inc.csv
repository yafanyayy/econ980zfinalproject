Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's First Quarter Results. First, I want to thank my colleague, mentor and friend, Sumner, who's listening on the phone for his vision, his guidance and his inspiration,",3204,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's First Quarter Results. First, I want to thank my colleague, mentor and friend, Sumner, who's listening on the phone for his vision, his guidance and his inspiration, all of which will continue to energize us with Sumner as our Chairman Emeritus. I'm honored to be the new Executive Chairman of Viacom, and I will do my utmost to continue to drive Viacom's operations forward and restore our stock to its proper evaluation, but more on that later in my remarks. 
Now let's take a quick look at the numbers. In the first quarter, revenues declined 6% to $3.15 billion. Adjusted operating income was $839 million, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $470 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 9% to $1.18 per diluted share. 
2015 was a challenging year for Viacom as it was from many in the industry. However, it was a watershed year in which we took many important steps to position Viacom for the future. We reorganized and refocused our organization, increasing both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment production pipelines. We also stepped up our investment in data measurement and marketing expertise and fueled our growth in the most attractive overseas markets. And we did all of this while delivering record earnings per share in 2015 and the highest Media Networks revenue in our history. 
As we turn the corner into 2016, the hard work and investment is bearing fruit. Let me give you a few of the highlights. We have dynamic new leadership in our business units and several of our major networks, including MTV and VH1. Viacom's creative culture is stronger than ever. Our focus on original programming and rapid deployment is paying off. Existing hits such as Lip Sync Battle, PAW Patrol, Love and Hip-hop; and exciting new programming like Game Shakers, Younger Teachers and I love Kellie Pickler are continuing to attract valuable and devoted audiences. In fact, Viacom had 7 of the top 20 cable series in the quarter. Most major networks have seen year-over-year range improvements, and that ratings strength is driving advertising improvement. There will be more to come as the change is under way at Comedy Central and MTV kick in and the ad market continues to strengthen. An enhanced distribution ecosystem is coming together with strong upside for content providers. We are experimenting and reaping the benefits of increased consumer choice. Our international business is a strong performer with great upside but remains underappreciated. We are expanding distribution, creating differentiated and popular content, building on Channel 5's substantial successes, launching a high-margin Paramount Channel to even more territories and building our success in India's high-growth market. And Paramount is into its rebuilding process with the movie pipeline improving and TV operations off to a strong start. Already, we've seen solid critical response in box office performance from the first quarter releases, and there is much more to come throughout the year. 
Turning to the Media Networks results. Revenues declined 3% to $2.75 billion in the quarter, including a 1% adverse impact of foreign exchange. Before we move on to discuss our advertising results in detail, I'd like to spend a moment to discuss the wide-ranging and innovative agreement with Snapchat that we announced this morning. The deal is important for a number of reasons, not the least of which is added as indicative of the flexible and innovative approach we are taking to grow our digital and mobile expertise rapidly and at a global scale. As part of the deal, we'll bring 2 new high-profile channels to Snapchat Discover, a Comedy Central international channel and an MTV channel in the U.S. These, on top of our other successful Discovery channels, make is one of the largest publishers on Snapchat Discovery. Importantly, Viacom will also become the external ad sales representative for Snapchat's advertising inventory, giving us the chance to offer even more value to our clients. In addition, validating the continuing cultural influence of our programming, Snapchat will increase the number of live stories it publishes tied to Viacom temple events, such as the VMAs, the EMAs, be BET Awards and others. Snapchat's immersive and extremely popular video platform aligns perfectly with our leadership in both premium long- and short-form storytelling with these same audiences. This deal between Viacom and Snapchat is a major step forward in the evolution of the marketplace, made possible by our shared focus on young audiences and Viacom's content expertise, proprietary targeting, custom marketing solutions, industry-leading sales force and our global strength. It's a great partnership for both companies and is indicative of more innovation to come. 
Looking back on the quarter. Domestic ad sales declined 4% in the quarter, a substantial sequential improvement from the prior quarter. Continued ratings games based on the content investment we made over the last few years across our channel groups are driving this positive momentum. Most of our networks are performing well and are making meaningful contributions as audience levels build. Excluding the performance of Comedy Central and MTV, our domestic television ad sales growth was solidly positive. Once ratings of MTV and Comedy Central turn around and that work is well underway, the rebound will be even more clear. And the rebound will be fueled by Viacom's continuing leadership and delivery of the most progressive and innovative solutions in the marketplace. We recently announced an update to our proprietary Echo platform, which measures the effectiveness of custom-created social marketing campaigns. We'll go to the upfront with expanded offerings in Vantage, and clients are already embracing the new Velocity content network, harnessing Velocity's creative and production resources to create data-driven, branded content programs distributed across social platforms for advertising partners. 
Domestic affiliate revenues are substantially flat in the quarter with positive organic growth, offset by the timing of content available to certain digital distributors. Absent that impact, domestic affiliate revenues grew in the low mid-single digits. With the majority of our description agreements locked into long-term deals, we had no large renewals in the quarter. However, we continue to work closely with these partners to develop new avenues for viewers to enjoy Viacom programming. To date, our authenticated sites and apps reached 75% of the subscriber universe, and in the quarter, we launched robust Apple TV apps for Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Comedy Central and MTV and apps on Roku for MTV and Nick Jr. Viacom is currently in negotiations to extend our distribution agreement with the DISH, with whom we have a long and productive relationship. We have entered into a short-term extension with them as we hammer out the details of our long-term renewal. There may be short-term hiccups along the way, but we firmly believe that we will ultimately reach an agreement that will be productive for both sides. 
It has been a strong quarter for many of our individual networks, each of which has become more flexible, more aggressive and more entrepreneurial. There's greater sharing of strategies and best practices across the house, which enhances our ability to make the most of the unprecedented amount of high-quality original programming we are rolling  out. 
Original programming is key to reducing viewer fatigue, provides greater opportunities for advertiser integration, brings value in secondary markets and reinforces our network's cultural impact at the virtual and the real world watercooler. There's no better example of this than Nickelodeon, our biggest brand. In the first quarter, Nick's ratings improved over the prior year, and in the current quarter, we are looking at greater gains. Nickelodeon is the 2-11 leader in total day ratings and has been its nearest competitor for 26 weeks straight in this demo. In fact, nick's lead over the competition continued to widen the corner with Nickelodeon's 30% ahead of Disney and 78% ahead of Cartoon Network. We had the #1 and #2 kids series in the quarter. Nick's newest preschool hit, Blaze and the Monster Machines, ranked #1 across TV with kids 2-5, posting gains of 47% from a year ago. PAW Patrol continued strength in second place. This year, Nick Animation celebrates its 25th anniversary, and its creative culture has never been more vibrant. In the quarter, Nick owned the top 3 animated shows on TV with kids 2-11. Alvin, SpongeBob SquarePants and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. A new season of the Turtles kicked off last month, and we'll have new episodes from SpongeBob, The Fairly Odd Parents, Alvin, Harpy Beats, Sandra and Craig, Cricket, Rabbits and Miraculous throughout the quarter. And next month, Lake Shelton will be hosting the Kids Choice Awards, Nickelodeon's most important temple. 
VH1 is another turnaround story that we're extremely excited about. Under new leadership, the network has reversed earlier ratings declines, and that positive momentum is accelerating faster than any other Viacom brand. VH1's first quarter primetime ratings in the 18-49 demo were up 5% in the quarter. Range are up by stunning 40%. VH1 is now the #1 primetime cable network on Mondays among adults 18-49 and the top 10 cable network overall in that demo. Driven by 11 Hip-Hop and Black Crew franchises, VH1 had 4 of the top 20 original cable series in the first quarter, and the network is expanding on this success, increasing its output of original programming through additional night per week. 
TV Land C3 ratings were also up in the quarter as smart acquisitions drove sequential higher viewership each month. As we move to the current quarter, TV Land's high-quality original programming is already hitting with a season 2 premiere of Younger, driving 78% higher ratings than the season 1 series premier. In addition, Teachers, the critically acclaimed new comedy, has gotten off to a solid start. As we move through the quarter, the network will debut the single comedy Lopez, starring George Lopez; and the final season of the Soul Men, featuring Cedric the Entertainer and Nash. 
BET also benefited from the steady investment of distinctive content. It continues to build momentum and exhibits strong ratings growth. The network has reversed significant challenges in 2015, culminating in double-digit ratings growth in the first quarter. BET is now the #16 ad-supported cable network amongst adults 18-49, up from number 20 a year ago. And it's the only network among the top 20 to post double-digit ratings gains over last year. BET remains the #1 cable TV network among African-Americans. 
We're proud of what the BET team has done and how quickly they're reaping the rewards of the targeted investments in programming we've made. The best is yet to come at BET, and we're looking forward to continued growth as the network continues its evolution. 
Viacom had a solid first quarter with premieres of Ink Master drawing higher ratings and the Bar Rescue franchise showing continued strength and growth. Spike hit its second season of Lip Sync Battle with its first holiday special, which delivered almost 2 million viewers and was the #1 entertainment show in cable with all viewers 18-49 as well as women 18-49. Joseph Gordon Levitt's performance of Rhythm Nation has become a pop-culture sensation now with 10 million views on YouTube and growing. 
Moving to the current quarter. The official season 2 premiere of Lip Sync Battle shattered ratings and digital records for the network. The one-hour special drew 4.7 million viewers, making it the most-watched original series episode in Spike history. The season 2 debut is the #1 ranked show in all of television in the time slot with adults 18-49 and adults 18-34 as well as women 18-49 and women 18-34. The season 2 premiere has been viewed over 55 million times on various digital platforms. To date, Lip Sync Battle content overall secured 0.5 billion views across all platforms. Lip Sync Battle is without a doubt a global phenomenon. The U.S. version of the program can now be seen in 120 countries and territories worldwide. The format is also under license in 130 [ph] territories, most recently debuting in China where 30 million people viewed the program online in its first weekend. In addition, we have already launched the format on Channel 5 in the U.K. with great success where it's averaging a 22% share among viewers 16-34. 
Comedy Central remains a force with men 18-34 with 4 of the top 25 cable entertainment series in the quarter. South Park showed continued strength and ranked #2 in that demo, and the Daily Show of Trevor Noah was the most-watched late-night talk show for this valuable audience as well as with adults 18-24. The story of the Daily Show is strong, with 3 consecutive months of growth with total viewers and video consumption, including a robust 3 million full episodes starting each week across digital platforms. Trevor Noah has proven to be a star, and it will continue to build on the strong start especially with valuable young audiences across multiple platforms. Historically, The Daily Show sees double-digit increases in the presidential election year, so we believe even better results are ahead. 
And soft spot from schedule and ongoing consumption shifts to under-measured platforms resulted in gentle challenging ratings overall, but I have great confidence Comedy Central will overcome these issues. The recent renewals of Insight and Broad City are continuing evidence that the network is on solid creative footing and remains the first choice for today's hottest comedy talent. We're already seeing a rebound. Ratings in the second half of the quarter began to improve led by a new season of Workaholics and the series premiere of Idiot Sitter. In addition, tonight, Comedy Central will kick off a new season of Touch Point Oh and premiere Not Safe with Nikki Glaser, a new very naughty and very funny series from a popular comedian. 
Despite several bright spots, MTV experienced a difficult first quarter overall. Scripted originals still ranked at the top of their time periods, but ratings were lower than expected. As MTV moved into the second quarter, 2 of the network's best-performing franchises, Teen Mom and Teen Wolf, returned to strong [indiscernible] ratings in the premiere of the epic fantasy series, the Shannara Chronicles drew 7.5 million viewers across all telecast. MTV's development process didn't adapt quickly enough to the shifting preferences of its audiences. We're fixing that by accelerating its development pipeline and returning its best series in faster cycles. The network's new management is deep in a turnaround plan and has already greenlit several new series with 4 slated for fiscal 2016. I have complete confidence that MTV is headed in the right direction. 
Outside the U.S., our footprint continues to grow, with launches of TeenNick in Italy, BET in France and Comedy Central in the Czech Republic and Norway. In addition, Viacom International Media Networks will be launching the Paramount Channel in Italy at the end of the month. Paramount Channel continues to be a good, strategic business for us. It's already profitable and allows us to further monetize its own content at minimal incremental cost. As you know, India has been an area of great focus and thoughtful investment for Viacom. It is the world's leading growth market and a country where we are growing our revenues and growing our share. In the mass entertainment category, COLORS is now established itself as the top ranked urban channel in India. MTV is #1 in the youth of genre, Nickelodeon is #1 with kids and VH1 is the #1 English entertainment network. Our India channels are quickly building large, dedicated audiences and there are very exciting opportunities to come. 
Paramount closed the first quarter with the 2 December releases that have exceeded expectations. Daddy's Home, starting Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, has already earned more than $210 million at the global box office. And the five-time Academy Award Nominee, The Big Short, continues to win accolades, including the top honors at the Producers Guild Awards. It's a good start to an important year for Paramount, one where we will once again make full use of our exceptional infrastructure and talent. Coming up this weekend, Paramount will be releasing the highly-anticipated Zoolander 2, which has been generating great buzz for months. Later in the quarter, we'll have Whiskey Tango Foxtrot featuring Tina Fey and producer JJ Abrams' 10 Cloverfield Lane. Looking through the end of 2016, Paramount will be releasing Star Trek Beyond also from producer JJ Abrams, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows from producer Michael Bay and the reimagining of the classic Benhur. And next fiscal year, Paramount's full slate will include all-new Jack Reacher starting Tom Cruise, Paramount Animation's Monster Trust and an epic thriller directed by Robert Zumeckis and starring Brad Pitt. 
Paramount Television's quarter also started out strong with the live production of Grease on FOX. The telecast is a hit with critics and audiences and delivered more than 14 million live viewers in the U.S. Paramount is a very valuable and significantly undervalued part of Viacom. Its library of hit films generate significant recurring income year-after-year. It has been from a historical standpoint in a brief income slump due in part to a recent low number of theatrical releases, which reduces the positive waterfall impact of prior year film releases. This will change now that we are back on track to release approximately 15 high-quality releases a year, including numerous temples. At the same time, what is now a low-cost startup television production operation, we'll ramp up the profitability over the next few years. Once we get through this rebuilding process and related investment, we expect Paramount to pump out significant operating income and free cash flow in the years to come. At the same time, its content will provide the fuel for EPIX in the U.S., a growing number of Paramount channels outside of the U.S. and will serve as an important source of television content for Media Networks, including Nickelodeon, Spike and MTV. 
In conclusion, I want to address the speculation about Viacom and our future. Our outlook and the facts has been distorted and obscured by the naysayers, self-interested critics and publicity seekers. We will not be distracted or deterred as we build for the bright future ahead of us. As Executive Chairman and CEO, I will continue to work tirelessly to secure that future and will leave no stone unturned either tactically or strategically. Sumner and I have more than a 30-year history side-by-side building his media empire. He and the board of Viacom believing in my abilities and my character have entrusted me with weighty responsibilities, none of which are inconsistent or incompatible. My singular objective is to protect and build value for all of Viacom shareholders and in doing so, for all the beneficiaries of Sumner's trust that not only include the his daughter but also those of her brother. And finally, let me be absolutely clear, I could not be more focused on getting Viacom stock price back to the much higher level enjoyed under my leadership just a short time ago. No one should doubt my resolve or the resolve of our entire management team in making that happen. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website. Now let's take a look at our segment results.",611,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website. 
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared to the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 3%, and international revenues declined 4%. Excluding the 7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, the international revenues were up 3%, reflecting growth in advertising and affiliate revenues. 
Page 9 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance. In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined to 3% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 4%, and international revenues were down 2%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had an 8 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 6%, driven by growth in Europe. In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were down 1%. Domestic revenues were substantially flat in the quarter, while international revenues declined 6%. Domestic affiliate revenues were unfavorably impacted by the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements. 
Foreign exchange had a 9 percentage point unfavorable impact on international affiliate revenue growth. Ancillary revenues were down 19%, driven by lower consumer products revenue, reflecting comparisons to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles merchandise sale in the December quarter of last year as well as the decline in television syndication revenue. Expenses decreased 3% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expenses were down 3%, while distribution and other expenses decreased 4%. SG&A expense decreased 2% in the quarter. The decreases in programming and SG&A cost were principally due to the savings from our strategic realignment last year. 
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 4% for the quarter, and the adjusted operating income margin was 41%. The decline in operating income was driven by the revenue decline of 3%, partially offset either 3% decline in expenses. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 15% in the quarter principally due to decreases in theatrical and home entertainment revenues, partially offset by an increase in license fees. Foreign exchange had a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact on Filmed Entertainment revenue growth. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. 
Theatrical revenues declined 44%. The decline in revenues was due to lower carryover revenues given the difficult comparison to the strong performance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the December quarter of last year as well as lower revenues from our current quarterly leases. Out of our more significant releases, The Big Short and Daddy's Home, were both released in December of this year compared to Interstellar, which was released earlier in last year's December quarter. Home Entertainment revenues declined 24%, reflecting lower carryover revenues due to comparisons to Transformers: Age of Extinction in the December quarter of last year. 
Revenue from license fees increased 25%, primarily driven of licensing of certain titles in subscription video-on-demand and television. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $146 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $60 million last year. The decrease in operating results reflects the timing and mix of current quarterly leases as well as lower contributions in prior-period releases. 
Now moving beyond the segment results. The other items line reflect a gain of $2 million versus an $18 million loss in the December quarter of last year. Last year's loss was principally due to foreign exchange. 
In terms of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting a 50 basis point increase as compared to prior year. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2016 fiscal year that haven't already been discussed. For the quarter, we had cash used of $152 million, which compares to $57 million of free cash flow",616,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2016 fiscal year that haven't already been discussed. For the quarter, we had cash used of $152 million, which compares to $57 million of free cash flow in the December quarter of last year. Page 5 of the web presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year is principally due to higher working capital utilizations and lower operating income. Working capital was negatively impacted by the timing of film receivables from home entertainment and television. 
Moving on to our debt. That remains principally fixed rate, with an average gross at the end of the quarter of 4.6%. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion [ph] of total debt and $327 million cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.2x. We have $368 million remaining outstanding of our 6.25% senior notes, which mature on April 30. We plan on paying these notes off. 
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenues, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. For the fiscal year 2016, we expect growth in affiliate revenues to be in the low mid-single-digit range. For the full year, we expect that Media Networks' programming expense growth rate will be in the mid-single digits. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic-international profitability mix. 
At Paramount, we are excited about the upcoming slate, including our summer temples, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. For fiscal 2016, we expect profits to be weighted to the back half of the year as the studio benefit from their summer releases. Looking ahead of the studio's production and development pipeline. Paramount has just wrapped production on Jack Reacher 2. This month, the studio is commencing production on 4 major films: Scarlet will star in Ghost in the Shell, which is in partnership with DreamWorks. Baywatch, starring Dwayne Johnson and Zach Efron, the newest chapter in Vin Diesel's action franchise XXX 3: The Return of Vander Cage in the romantic thriller set in World War II, which is directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. In the spring, the studio goes production on the Academy award-winning filmmaker, Alexander Payne's next movie called Downsizing starring Matt Damon. 
In summary, while last year we experienced broad ratings weaknesses, we took organizational and creative steps to address those challenges. The progress we began to see at the end of fiscal 2015 is continuing. In the December quarter, 6 of our top 10 network saw growth in ratings. In March quarter-to-date, we are seeing ratings growth for our overall portfolio of Media Networks. At Paramount, they have started the fiscal year with several successes at the box office, and we look forward to the summer temple releases. In terms of our international Media Networks, we are benefiting from our investment over the past several years and anticipate strong double-digit growth in profits this year. The acquisition of Channel 5 has been an unqualified success. And the continued launch of new networks in Europe, Latin America and Africa has enabled us to build and grow our scale in the most important developing and developed markets.

The Snapchat deal that we announced this morning is an indicator. You will see more deals to come. As I said in my remarks, I will leave no stone unturned. I never have and I never will. And our objective is to build value. We are building value for the long term. We're building value with a view to getting a better valuation of our stock in the short term. But we will not take actions that undermine that value. And we believe that with consistency in leadership, consistency in purpose, driving our content around the world, the across multiple platforms, finding new source of revenues in licensing, consumer products and other areas, we will get Viacom back to the growth that we all want to see."

We've also looked at having a healthy environment for our marketing partners. As you know, we have taken down our ad load in several key time periods across several of our networks.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's first quarter results.First, I want to thank my colleague, mentor and friend Sumner, who is listening on the phone, for his vision, his guidance and his inspiration",3254,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's first quarter results.
First, I want to thank my colleague, mentor and friend Sumner, who is listening on the phone, for his vision, his guidance and his inspiration, all of which will continue to energize us with Sumner as our Chairman Emeritus. I am honored to be the new Executive Chairman of Viacom, and I will do my utmost to continue to drive Viacom's operations forward and restore our stock to its proper valuation, but more on that later in my remarks.
Now let's take a quick look at the numbers. In the first quarter, revenues declined 6% to $3.15 billion. Adjusted operating income was $839 million, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $470 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 9% to $1.18 per diluted share.
2015 was a challenging year for Viacom, as it was for many in the industry. However, it was a watershed year in which we took many important steps to position Viacom for the future. We reorganized and refocused our organization, increasing both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment production pipelines. We also stepped up our investment in data measurement and marketing expertise and fueled our growth in the most attractive overseas markets. And we did all of this while delivering record earnings per share in 2015 and the highest Media Networks revenue in our history. As we turn the corner into 2016, the hard work and investment is bearing fruit. Let me give you a few of the highlights.
We have dynamic, new leadership in our business units and several of our major networks, including MTV and VH1. Viacom's creative culture is stronger than ever. Our focus on original programming and rapid deployment is paying off. Existing hits such as Lip Sync Battle, PAW Patrol, Love & Hip Hop; and exciting new programming like Game Shakers, Younger, Teachers and I Love Kellie Pickler are continuing to attract valuable and devoted audiences. In fact, Viacom had 7 of the top 20 cable series in the quarter. Most major networks have seen year-over-year range improvement, and that ratings strength is driving advertising improvement. There will be more to come as the changes underway at Comedy Central and MTV kick in and the ad market continues to strengthen.
An enhanced distribution ecosystem is coming together, with strong upside for content providers. We are experimenting and reaping the benefits of increased consumer choice. Our international business is a strong performer with great upside but remains underappreciated. We are expanding distribution, creating differentiated and popular content, building on Channel 5's substantial successes, launching the high-margin Paramount Channel to even more territories and building our success in India's high-growth market. And Paramount is into its rebuilding process, with the movie pipeline improving and TV operations off to a strong start. Already, we've seen solid critical response in box office performance from the first quarter releases, and there is much more to come throughout the year.
Turning to the Media Networks results. Revenues declined 3% to $2.57 billion in the quarter, including a 1% adverse impact of foreign exchange.
Before we move on to discuss our advertising results in detail, I'd like to spend a moment to discuss the wide-ranging and innovative agreement with Snapchat that we announced this morning. The deal is important for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it is indicative of the flexible and innovative approach we are taking to grow our digital and mobile expertise rapidly and at a global scale. As part of the deal, we will bring 2 new high-profile channels to Snapchat Discover: a Comedy Central international channel and an MTV channel in the U.S. These, on top of our other successful discovery channels, make us one of the largest publishers on Snapchat Discover. Importantly, Viacom will also become the external ad sales representative for Snapchat's advertising inventory, giving us the chance to offer even more value to our clients. In addition, validating the continuing cultural influence of our programming, Snapchat will increase the number of Live Stories it publishes, tied to Viacom's tentpole events such as the VMAs, the EMAs, the BET awards and others. Snapchat's immersive and extremely popular short-form video platform aligns perfectly with our leadership in both premium long- and short-form storytelling for these same audiences.
This deal between Viacom and Snapchat is a major step forward in the evolution of the marketplace, made possible by our shared focus on young audiences; and Viacom's content expertise, proprietary targeting, custom marketing solutions, industry-leading sales force; and our global strength. It's a great partnership for both companies and is indicative of more innovation to come.
Looking back on the quarter. Domestic ad sales declined 4% in the quarter, a substantial sequential improvement from the prior quarter. Continued ratings gains based on the content investment we made over the last few years across our channel groups are driving this positive momentum. Most of our networks are performing well and are making meaningful contributions as audience levels build. Excluding the performance of Comedy Central and MTV, our domestic television ad sales growth was solidly positive. Once ratings at MTV and Comedy Central turn around, and that work is well underway, the rebound will be even more clear. And the rebound will be fueled by Viacom's continuing leadership in delivery of the most progressive and innovative solutions in the marketplace.
We recently announced an update to our proprietary Echo platform which measures the effectiveness of custom-created social marketing campaigns. We'll go to the upfront with expanded offerings in Vantage. And clients are already embracing the new Velocity content network harnessing Velocity's creative and production resources to create data-driven, branded content programs distributed across social platforms for advertising partners.
Domestic affiliate revenues are substantially flat in the quarter, with positive organic growth offset by the timing of content available to certain digital distributors. Absent that impact, domestic affiliate revenues grew in the low mid-single digits. With the majority of our distribution agreements locked in to long-term deals, we had no large renewals in the quarter. However, we continue to work closely with these partners to develop new avenues for viewers to enjoy Viacom programming. To date, our authenticated sites and apps reach 75% of the subscriber universe. And in the quarter, we launched robust Apple TV apps for Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Comedy Central and MTV; and apps on Roku for MTV and Nick Jr. Viacom is currently in negotiations to extend our distribution agreement with DISH, with whom we have a long and productive relationship. We have entered into a short-term extension with them as we hammer out the details of a long-term renewal. There may be short-term hiccups along the way, but we firmly believe that we will ultimately reach an agreement that will be productive for both sides. It has been a strong quarter for many of our individual networks, each of which has become more flexible, more aggressive and more entrepreneurial. There is greater sharing of strategies and best practices across the house, which enhances our ability to make the most of the unprecedented amount of high-quality original programming we are rolling out.
Original programming is key to reducing viewer fatigue, provides greater opportunities for advertiser integration, brings value in secondary markets and reinforces our network's cultural impact at the virtual and the real world watercooler. There is no better example of this than Nickelodeon, our biggest brand. In the first quarter, Nick's ratings improved over the prior year, and in the current quarter, we are looking at greater gains. Nickelodeon is the 2 to 11 leader in total day ratings and has been its nearest competitor for 26 weeks straight in this demo. In fact, Nick's lead over the competition continued to widen in the quarter, with Nickelodeon 30% ahead of Disney and 78% ahead of Cartoon Network. We had the #1 and #2 kids series in the quarter. Nick's newest preschool hit, Blaze and the Monster Machines, ranked #1 across TV with kids 2 to 5, posting gains of 47% from a year ago. PAW Patrol continued its strength in second place.
This year, Nick animation celebrates its 25th anniversary, and its creative culture has never been more vibrant. In the quarter, Nick owned the top 3 animated shows on TV with kids 2 to 11: ALVINNN!!!, SpongeBob SquarePants and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. A new season of Turtles kicked off last month. And we'll have new episodes from SpongeBob, The Fairly Odd Parents, ALVINNN!!!, Harvey Beaks, Sanjay & Craig, Pig Goat Banana Cricket, Rabbids and Miraculous throughout the quarter. And next month, Blake Shelton will be hosting the Kids' Choice Awards, Nickelodeon's most important tentpole.
VH1 is another turnaround story that we're extremely excited about. Under new leadership, the network has reversed earlier ratings declines, and that positive momentum is accelerating faster than in any other Viacom brand. VH1's first quarter prime time ratings in the 18 to 49 demo were up 5%, and in the quarter, ratings were up a stunning 40%. VH1 is now the #1 prime time cable network on Mondays among adults 18 to 49 and a top 10 cable network overall in that demo. Driven by the Love & Hip Hop and Black Ink Crew franchises, VH1 had 4 of the top 20 original cable series in the first quarter. And the network is expanding on this success, increasing its output of original programming through an additional night per week.
TV Land C3 ratings were also up in the quarter, as smart acquisitions drove sequentially higher viewership each month. As we move to the current quarter, TV Land's high-quality original programming is already hitting, with the season 2 premiere of Younger driving 78% higher ratings than the season 1 series premier. In addition, Teachers, the critically acclaimed new comedy, has gotten off to a solid start. As we move through the quarter, the network will debut the single-cam comedy Lopez, starring George Lopez; and the final season of The Soul Man, featuring Cedric the Entertainer and Niecy Nash.
BET also benefited from the steady investment of distinctive content. It continues to build momentum and exhibits strong ratings growth. The network has reversed significant challenges in 2015, culminating in double-digit ratings growth in the first quarter. BET is now the #16 ad-supported cable network among adults 18 to 49, up from #20 a year ago. And it's the only network among the top 20 to post double-digit ratings gains over last year. BET remains the #1 cable TV network among African-Americans. We're proud of what the BET team has done and how quickly they are reaping the rewards of the targeted investments in programming we've made. The best is yet to come at BET, and we're looking forward to continued growth as the network continues its evolution.
Spike had a solid first quarter with premieres of Ink Master drawing higher ratings and the Bar Rescue franchise showing continued strength and growth. Spike teased its second season of Lip Sync Battle with its first holiday special, which delivered almost 2 million viewers and was the #1 entertainment show in cable with all viewers 18 to 49 as well as women 18 to 49. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance of Rhythm Nation has become a pop culture sensation, now with 10 million views on YouTube and growing. Moving to the current quarter, the official season 2 premiere of Lip Sync Battle shattered ratings and digital records for the network. The 1-hour special drew 4.7 million viewers, making it the most-watched original series episode in Spike history. The season 2 debut is the #1 ranked show in all of television in the time slot with adults 18 to 49 and adults 18 to 34 as well as women 18 to 49 and women 18 to 34. The season 2 premiere has been viewed over 55 million times on various digital platforms. To date, Lip Sync Battle content overall secured 0.5 billion views across all platforms. Lip Sync Battle is without a doubt a global phenomenon. The U.S. version of the program can now be seen in 120 countries and territories worldwide. The format is also under license in 130 territories, most recently debuting in China where 30 million people viewed the program online in its first weekend. In addition, we have already launched the format on Channel 5 in the U.K., to great success, where it is averaging a 22% share among viewers 16 to 34.
Comedy Central remains a force with men 18 to 34, with 4 of the top 25 cable entertainment series in the quarter. South Park showed continued strength and ranked #2 in that demo. And The Daily Show with Trevor Noah was the most-watched late-night talk show for this valuable audience as well as with adults 18 to 24. The story of The Daily Show is strong with 3 consecutive months of growth with total viewers and video consumption, including a robust 3 million full-episode starts each week across digital platforms. Trevor Noah has proven to be a star, and he will continue to build on the strong start especially with valuable young audiences across multiple platforms. Historically, The Daily Show sees double-digit increases in a presidential election year, so we believe even better results are ahead.
Some soft spot in the schedule and ongoing consumption shifts to under-measured platforms resulted in challenging ratings overall, but I have great confidence Comedy Central will overcome these issues. The recent renewals of Inside Amy Schumer and Broad City are continuing evidence that the network is on solid creative footing and remains the first choice for today's hottest comedy talent. We are already seeing a rebound. Ratings in the second half of the quarter began to improve, led by a new season of Workaholics and the series premiere of Idiotsitter. In addition, tonight, Comedy Central will kick off a new season of Tosh.0; and premiere Not Safe With Nikki Glaser, a new, very naughty and very funny series from a popular comedian.
Despite several bright spots, MTV experienced a difficult first quarter overall. Scripted originals still ranked at the top of their time periods, but ratings were lower than expected. As MTV moved into the second quarter, 2 of the network's best-performing franchises, Teen Mom and Teen Wolf, returned to strong LIVE+3 ratings. And the premiere of the epic fantasy series The Shannara Chronicles drew 7.5 million viewers across all telecasts. MTV's development process didn't adapt quickly enough to the shifting preferences of its audiences. We're fixing that by accelerating its development pipeline and returning its best series in faster cycles. The network's new management is deep in a turnaround plan; and has already greenlit several new series, with 4 slated for fiscal 2016. I have complete confidence that MTV is headed in the right direction.
Outside the U.S., our footprint continues to grow with launches of TeenNick in Italy, BET in France and Comedy Central in the Czech Republic and Norway. In addition, Viacom International Media Networks will be launching the Paramount Channel in Italy at the end of the month. Paramount Channel continues to be a good, strategic business for us. It is already profitable and allows us to further monetize owned content at minimal incremental cost.
As you know, India has been an area of great focus and thoughtful investment for Viacom. It is the world's leading growth market and a country where we are growing our revenues and growing our share. In the mass entertainment category, Colors has now established itself as the top-ranked urban channel in India. MTV is #1 in the youth genre. Nickelodeon is #1 with kids, and VH1 is the #1 English entertainment network. Our India channels are quickly building large, dedicated audiences; and there are very exciting opportunities to come.
Paramount closed the first quarter with 2 December releases that have exceeded expectations. Daddy's Home, starting Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, has already earned more than $210 million at the global box office. And the 5-time Academy Award-nominated The Big Short continues to win accolades, including top honors at the Producers Guild Awards. It's a good start to an important year for Paramount, one where we will once again make full use of our exceptional infrastructure and talent. Coming up this weekend, Paramount will be releasing the highly anticipated Zoolander 2, which has been generating great buzz for months. Later in the quarter, we'll have Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, featuring Tina Fey; and producer J.J. Abrams' 10 Cloverfield Lane. Looking through the end of 2016, Paramount will be releasing Star Trek Beyond, also from producer J.J. Abrams; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows from producer Michael Bay; and a reimagining of the classic Ben-Hur. And next fiscal year, Paramount's full slate will include an all-new Jack Reacher starring Tom Cruise, Paramount Animation's Monster Trucks and an epic thriller directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Brad Pitt.
Paramount Television's quarter also started out strong with a live production of Grease on FOX. The telecast was a hit with critics and audiences and delivered more than 14 million LIVE+3 viewers in the U.S.
Paramount is a very valuable and significantly undervalued part of Viacom. Its library of hit films generates significant recurring income year after year. It has been, from a historical standpoint, in a brief income slump due in part to a recent low number of theatrical releases, which reduces the positive waterfall impact of prior year film releases. This will change now that we are back on track to release approximately 15 high-quality releases a year, including numerous tentpoles. At the same time, what is now a low-cost startup television production operation will ramp up the profitability over the next few years. Once we get through this rebuilding process and related investment, we expect Paramount to pump out significant operating income and free cash flow in the years to come. At the same time, its content will provide the fuel for EPIX in the U.S., a growing number of Paramount channels outside of the U.S.; and will serve as an important source of television content for Media Networks, including Nickelodeon, Spike and MTV.
In conclusion, I want to address the speculation about Viacom and our future. Our outlook and the facts have been distorted and obscured by the naysayers, self-interested critics and publicity seekers. We will not be distracted or deterred as we build for the bright future ahead of us. As Executive Chairman and CEO, I will continue to work tirelessly to secure that future and will leave no stone unturned either tactically or strategically. Sumner and I have a more than 30-year history side-by-side building his media empire. He and the board of Viacom, believing in my abilities and my character, have entrusted me with weighty responsibilities, none of which are inconsistent or incompatible. My singular objective is to protect and build value for all of Viacom shareholders and, in doing so, for all the beneficiaries of Sumner's trust not only including the descendants of his daughter but also those of her brother. And finally, let me be absolutely clear: I could not be more focused on getting Viacom's stock price back to the much higher level it enjoyed under my leadership just a short time ago. No one should doubt my resolve or the resolve of our entire management team in making that happen. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website.
Now let's take a look at our segment results.
At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 3%, and international revenues declined 4%. Excluding a 7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 3%, reflecting growth in advertising and affiliate revenues. Page 9 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 3% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 4%, and international revenues were down 2%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had an 8 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 6%, driven by growth in Europe. In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were down 1%. Domestic revenues were substantially flat in the quarter, while international revenues declined 6%. Domestic affiliate revenues were unfavorably impacted by the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements. Foreign exchange had a 9 percentage point unfavorable impact on international affiliate revenue growth. Ancillary revenues were down 19%, driven by lower consumer products revenue, reflecting comparisons to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles merchandise sale in the December quarter of last year as well as the decline in television syndication revenue.
Expenses decreased 3% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expenses were down 3%, while distribution and other expenses decreased 4%. SG&A expense decreased 2% in the quarter. The decreases in programming and SG&A costs were principally due to the savings from our strategic realignment last year.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 4% for the quarter, and the adjusted operating income margin was 41%. The decline in operating income was driven by the revenue decline of 3%, partially offset by the 3% decline in expenses.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 15% in the quarter principally due to decreases in theatrical and home entertainment revenues, partially offset by an increase in license fees. Foreign exchange had a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact on Filmed Entertainment revenue growth. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Theatrical revenues declined 44%. The decline in revenues was due to lower carryover revenues given the difficult comparison to the strong performance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the December quarter of last year, as well as lower revenues from our current-quarter releases. Of our more significant releases, The Big Short and Daddy's Home were both released in December of this year compared to Interstellar, which was released earlier in last year's December quarter. Home entertainment revenues declined 24%, reflecting lower carryover revenues due to comparisons to Transformers: Age of Extinction in the December quarter of last year. Revenue from license fees increased 25%, primarily driven by the licensing of certain titles in subscription video-on-demand and television.
Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $146 million in the quarter, as compared to a loss of $60 million last year. The decrease in operating results reflects the timing and mix of current-quarter releases, as well as lower contributions from prior-period releases.
Now moving beyond the segment results. The other items line reflects a gain of $2 million versus 18 -- an $18 million loss in the December quarter of last year. Last year's loss was principally due to foreign exchange. In terms of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting a 50 basis point increase as compared to prior year.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2016 fiscal year that haven't already been discussed.
For the quarter, we had a cash use of $152 million, which compares to $57 million of free cash flow in the December quarter of last year. Page 5 of the web presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to higher working capital utilization and lower operating income. Working capital was negatively impacted by the timing of film receivables from home entertainment and television.
Now moving on to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate, with an average cost at the end of the quarter of 4.6%. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion of total debt and $327 million cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.2x. We have $368 million remaining outstanding of our 6.25% senior notes which mature on April 30. We plan on paying these notes off.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenues, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements which are tied to product availability. For the fiscal year 2016, we expect growth in affiliate revenues to be in the low, mid-single-digit range. For the full year, we expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid-single digits. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic-international profitability mix.
At Paramount, we are excited about the upcoming slate, including our summer tentpoles Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. For fiscal 2016, we expect profits to be weighted to the back half of the year as the studio benefits from their summer releases. Looking ahead of the studio's production and development pipeline: Paramount has just wrapped production on Jack Reacher 2. This month, the studio is commencing production on 4 major films. Scarlett Johansson will star in Ghost in the Shell, which is in partnership with DreamWorks. Baywatch, starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron; the newest chapter in Vin Diesel's action franchise, xXx 3, The Return of Xander Cage; and a romantic thriller set in World War II, which is directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. In the spring, the studio starts production on Academy Award-winning filmmaker Alexander Payne's next movie called Downsizing, starring Matt Damon.
In summary, while last year we experienced broad ratings weaknesses, we took organizational and creative steps to address those challenges. The progress we began to see at the end of fiscal 2015 is continuing. In the December quarter, 6 of our top 10 networks saw a growth in ratings. In March quarter-to-date, we are seeing ratings growth for our overall portfolio of Media Networks. At Paramount, they have started the fiscal year with several successes at the box office, and we look forward to the summer tentpole releases. In terms of our international Media Networks, we are benefiting from our investment over the past several years and anticipate strong double-digit growth in profits this year. The acquisition of Channel 5 has been an unqualified success. And the continued launch of new networks in Europe, Latin America and Africa has enabled us to build and grow our scale in the most important developing and developed markets.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's first quarter results.First, I want to thank my colleague, mentor and friend Sumner, who is listening on the phone, for his vision, his guidance and his inspiration",3248,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's first quarter results.
First, I want to thank my colleague, mentor and friend Sumner, who is listening on the phone, for his vision, his guidance and his inspiration, all of which will continue to energize us with Sumner as our Chairman Emeritus. I am honored to be the new Executive Chairman of Viacom, and I will do my utmost to continue to drive Viacom's operations forward and restore our stock to its proper valuation, but more on that later in my remarks.
Now let's take a quick look at the numbers. In the first quarter, revenues declined 6% to $3.15 billion. Adjusted operating income was $839 million, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $470 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 9% to $1.18 per diluted share.
2015 was a challenging year for Viacom as it was for many in the industry. However, it was a watershed year in which we took many important steps to position Viacom for the future. We reorganized and refocused our organization, increasing both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment production pipelines. We also stepped up our investment in data measurement and marketing expertise and fueled our growth in the most attractive overseas markets. And we did all of this while delivering record earnings per share in 2015 and the highest Media Networks revenue in our history. As we turn the corner into 2016, the hard work and investment is bearing fruit. Let me give you a few of the highlights.
We have dynamic new leadership in our business units and several of our major networks, including MTV and VH1. Viacom's creative culture is stronger than ever. Our focus on original programming and rapid deployment is paying off. Existing hits such as Lip Sync Battle, PAW Patrol, Love & Hip Hop; and exciting new programming like Game Shakers, Younger, Teachers and I Love Kellie Pickler are continuing to attract valuable and devoted audiences. In fact, Viacom had 7 of the top 20 cable series in the quarter. Most major networks have seen year-over-year ratings improvement, and that ratings strength is driving advertising improvement. There'll be more to come as the changes underway at Comedy Central and MTV kick in and the ad market continues to strengthen.
An enhanced distribution ecosystem is coming together with strong upside for content providers. We are experimenting and reaping the benefits of increased consumer choice. Our international business is a strong performer with great upside but remains underappreciated. We are expanding distribution, creating differentiated and popular content, building on Channel 5's substantial successes, launching the high-margin Paramount Channel to even more territories and building our success in India's high-growth market. And Paramount is into its rebuilding process with the movie pipeline improving and TV operations off to a strong start. Already, we've seen solid critical response in box office performance from the first quarter releases, and there is much more to come throughout the year.
Turning to the Media Networks results. Revenues declined 3% to $2.57 billion in the quarter, including a 1% adverse impact of foreign exchange. 
Before we move on to discuss our advertising results in detail, I'd like to spend a moment to discuss the wide-ranging and innovative agreement with Snapchat that we announced this morning. The deal is important for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it is indicative of the flexible and innovative approach we are taking to grow our digital and mobile expertise rapidly and at a global scale. As part of the deal, we will bring 2 new high-profile channels to Snapchat Discover: a Comedy Central international channel and an MTV channel in the U.S. These, on top of our other successful discovery channels, make us one of the largest publishers on Snapchat Discover. Importantly, Viacom will also become the external ad sales representative for Snapchat's advertising inventory, giving us the chance to offer even more value to our clients. In addition, validating the continuing cultural influence of our programming, Snapchat will increase the number of Live Stories it publishes tied to Viacom's tentpole events, such as the VMAs, the EMAs, the BET awards and others. Snapchat's immersive and extremely popular short-form video platform aligns perfectly with our leadership in both premium long- and short-form storytelling for these same audiences.
This deal between Viacom and Snapchat is a major step forward in the evolution of the marketplace, made possible by our shared focus on young audiences and Viacom's content expertise, proprietary targeting, custom marketing solutions, industry-leading sales force, and our global strength. It's a great partnership for both companies and is indicative of more innovation to come.
Looking back on the quarter. Domestic ad sales declined 4% in the quarter, a substantial sequential improvement from the prior quarter. Continued ratings gains based on the content investment we made over the last few years across our channel groups are driving this positive momentum. Most of our networks are performing well and are making meaningful contributions as audience levels build. Excluding the performance of Comedy Central and MTV, our domestic television ad sales growth was solidly positive. Once ratings at MTV and Comedy Central turn around, and that work is well underway, the rebound will be even more clear. And the rebound will be fueled by Viacom's continuing leadership in delivery of the most progressive and innovative solutions in the marketplace.
We recently announced an update to our proprietary Echo platform, which measures the effectiveness of custom-creative social marketing campaigns. We'll go to the upfront with expanded offerings in Vantage and clients are already embracing the new Velocity content network, harnessing Velocity's creative and production resources to create data-driven, branded content programs distributed across social platforms for advertising partners.
Domestic affiliate revenues are substantially flat in the quarter with positive organic growth offset by the timing of content available to certain digital distributors. Absent that impact, domestic affiliate revenues grew in the low mid-single digits. With the majority of our distribution agreements locked in to long-term deals, we had no large renewals in the quarter. However, we continue to work closely with these partners to develop new avenues for viewers to enjoy Viacom programming. To-date, our authenticated sites and apps reach 75% of the subscriber universe. And in the quarter, we launched robust Apple TV apps for Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Comedy Central and MTV; and apps on Roku for MTV and Nick Jr. Viacom is currently in negotiations to extend our distribution agreement with DISH, with whom we have a long and productive relationship. We have entered into a short-term extension with them as we hammer out the details of a long-term renewal. There may be short-term hiccups along the way, but we firmly believe that we will ultimately reach an agreement that will be productive for both sides. 
It has been a strong quarter for many of our individual networks, each of which has become more flexible, more aggressive and more entrepreneurial. There is greater sharing of strategies and best practices across the house, which enhances our ability to make the most of the unprecedented amount of high-quality original programming we are rolling out.
Original programming is key to reducing viewer fatigue, provides greater opportunities for advertiser integration, brings value in secondary markets and reinforces our network's cultural impact at the virtual and the real-world watercooler. There's no better example of this than Nickelodeon, our biggest brand. In the first quarter, Nick's ratings improved over the prior year, and in the current quarter, we are looking at greater gains. Nickelodeon is the 2 to 11 leader in total day ratings and has beaten its nearest competitor for 26 weeks straight in this demo. In fact, Nick's lead over the competition continued to widen in the quarter with Nickelodeon 30% ahead of Disney and 78% ahead of Cartoon Network. We had the #1 and #2 kids series in the quarter. Nick's newest preschool hit, Blaze and the Monster Machines, ranked #1 across TV with kids 2 to 5, posting gains of 47% from a year ago. PAW Patrol continued its strength in second place.
This year, Nick animation celebrates its 25th anniversary, and its creative culture has never been more vibrant. In the quarter, Nick owned the top 3 animated shows on TV with kids 2 to 11: ALVINNN!!!, SpongeBob SquarePants and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. A new season of Turtles kicked off last month, and we'll have new episodes from SpongeBob, The Fairly Odd Parents, ALVINNN!!!, Harvey Beaks, Sanjay & Craig, Pig Goat Banana Cricket, Rabbids and Miraculous throughout the quarter. And next month, Blake Shelton will be hosting the Kids' Choice Awards, Nickelodeon's most important tentpole.
VH1 is another turnaround story that we're extremely excited about. Under new leadership, the network has reversed earlier ratings declines, and that positive momentum is accelerating faster than at any other Viacom brand. VH1's first quarter prime-time ratings in the 18 to 49 demo were up 5%, and in the quarter, ratings were up a stunning 40%. VH1 is now the #1 prime-time cable network on Mondays among adults 18 to 49 and a top 10 cable network overall in that demo. Driven by the Love & Hip Hop and Black Ink Crew franchises, VH1 had 4 of the top 20 original cable series in the first quarter. And the network is expanding on this success, increasing its output of original programming through an additional night per week.
TV Land C3 ratings were also up in the quarter as smart acquisitions drove sequentially higher viewership each month. As we move to the current quarter, TV Land's high-quality original programming is already hitting, with the season 2 premiere of Younger driving 78% higher ratings than the season 1 series premier. In addition, Teachers, the critically acclaimed new comedy, has gotten off to a solid start. As we move through the quarter, the network will debut the single-cam comedy Lopez, starring George Lopez; and the final season of The Soul Man, featuring Cedric the Entertainer and Niecy Nash.
BET also benefited from the steady investment in distinctive content. It continues to build momentum and exhibits strong ratings growth. The network has reversed significant challenges in 2015, culminating in double-digit ratings growth in the first quarter. BET is now the #16 ad-supported cable network among adults 18 to 49, up from #20 a year ago. And it's the only network among the top 20 to post double-digit ratings gains over last year. BET remains the #1 cable TV network among African-Americans. 
We're proud of what the BET team has done and how quickly they are reaping the rewards of the targeted investments in programming we've made. The best is yet to come at BET, and we're looking forward to continued growth as the network continues its evolution.
Spike had a solid first quarter with premieres of Ink Master drawing higher ratings and the Bar Rescue franchise showing continued strength and growth. Spike teased its second season of Lip Sync Battle with its first holiday special, which delivered almost 2 million viewers and was the #1 entertainment show on cable with all viewers 18 to 49 as well as women 18 to 49. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance of Rhythm Nation has become a pop culture sensation now with 10 million views on YouTube and growing. Moving to the current quarter, the official season 2 premiere of Lip Sync Battle shattered ratings and digital records for the network. The 1-hour special drew 4.7 million viewers, making it the most-watched original series episode in Spike history. The season 2 debut is the #1 ranked show in all of television in the time slot with adults 18 to 49 and adults 18 to 34 as well as women 18 to 49 and women 18 to 34. The season 2 premiere has been viewed over 55 million times on various digital platforms. 
To-date, Lip Sync Battle content overall secured 0.5 billion views across all platforms. Lip Sync Battle is without a doubt a global phenomenon. The U.S. version of the program can now be seen in 120 countries and territories worldwide. The format is also under license in more than 30 territories, most recently debuting in China where 30 million people viewed the program online in its first weekend. In addition, we have already launched the format on Channel 5 in the U.K, to great success, where it is averaging a 22% share among viewers 16 to 34.
Comedy Central remains a force with men 18 to 34 with 4 of the top 25 cable entertainment series in the quarter. South Park showed continued strength and ranked #2 in that demo. And The Daily Show with Trevor Noah was the most-watched late-night talk show for this valuable audience as well as with adults 18 to 24. The story of The Daily Show is strong with 3 consecutive months of growth with total viewers and video consumption, including a robust 3 million full-episode starts each week across digital platforms. Trevor Noah has proven to be a star, and he will continue to build on his strong start, especially with valuable young audiences across multiple platforms. Historically, The Daily Show sees double-digit increases in a presidential election year, so we believe even better results are ahead.
Some soft spots in our schedule and ongoing consumption shifts to under-measured platforms resulted in challenging ratings overall, but I have great confidence Comedy Central will overcome these issues. The recent renewals of Inside Amy Schumer and Broad City are continuing evidence that the network is on solid creative footing and remains the first choice for today's hottest comedy talent. We're already seeing a rebound. Ratings in the second half of the quarter began to improve, led by a new season of Workaholics and the series premiere of Idiotsitter. In addition, tonight, Comedy Central will kick off a new season of Tosh.0; and premiere Not Safe With Nikki Glaser, a new, very naughty and very funny series from a popular comedian.
Despite several bright spots, MTV experienced a difficult first quarter overall. Scripted originals still ranked at the top of their time periods, but ratings were lower than expected. As MTV moved into the second quarter, 2 of the network's best-performing franchises, Teen Mom and Teen Wolf, returned to strong LIVE+3 ratings. And the premiere of the epic fantasy series The Shannara Chronicles drew 7.5 million viewers across all telecasts. MTV's development process didn't adapt quickly enough to the shifting preferences of its audiences. We're fixing that by accelerating its development pipeline and returning its best series in faster cycles. The network's new management is deep in a turnaround plan and has already greenlit several new series with 4 slated for fiscal 2016. I have complete confidence that MTV is headed in the right direction.
Outside the U.S., our footprint continues to grow with launches of TeenNick in Italy, BET in France, and Comedy Central in the Czech Republic and Norway. In addition, Viacom International Media Networks will be launching the Paramount Channel in Italy at the end of the month. Paramount Channel continues to be a good, strategic business for us. It is already profitable and allows us to further monetize owned content at minimal incremental cost.
As you know, India has been an area of great focus and thoughtful investment for Viacom. It is the world's leading growth market in a country where we are growing our revenues and growing our share. In the mass entertainment category, Colors has now established itself as a top-ranked urban channel in India. MTV is #1 in the youth genre. Nickelodeon is #1 with kids, and VH1 is the #1 English entertainment network. Our India channels are quickly building large, dedicated audiences, and there are very exciting opportunities to come.
Paramount closed the first quarter with 2 December releases that have exceeded expectations. Daddy's Home, starting Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, has already earned more than $210 million at the global box office. And the 5-time Academy Award-nominated The Big Short continues to win accolades, including top honors at the Producers Guild Awards. It's a good start to an important year for Paramount, one where we will once again make full use of our exceptional infrastructure and talent. Coming up this weekend, Paramount will be releasing the highly anticipated Zoolander 2, which has been generating great buzz for months. Later in the quarter, we'll have Whiskey Tango Foxtrot featuring Tina Fey; and producer J.J. Abrams' 10 Cloverfield Lane. Looking through the end of 2016, Paramount will be releasing Star Trek Beyond, also from producer J.J. Abrams; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows from producer Michael Bay; and a reimagining of the classic Ben-Hur. And next fiscal year, Paramount's full slate will include an all-new Jack Reacher starring Tom Cruise, Paramount Animation's Monster Trucks, and an epic thriller directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Brad Pitt.
Paramount Television's quarter also started out strong with a live production of Grease on FOX. The telecast was a hit with critics and audiences and delivered more than 14 million LIVE+3 viewers in the U.S.
Paramount is a very valuable and significantly undervalued part of Viacom. Its library of hit films generates significant recurring income year after year. It has been, from a historical standpoint, in a brief income slump due in part to a recent low number of theatrical releases, which reduces the positive waterfall impact of prior year film releases. This will change now that we are back on track to release approximately 15 high-quality releases a year, including numerous tentpoles. 
At the same time, what is now a low-cost start-up television production operation will ramp up to profitability over the next few years. Once we get through this rebuilding process and related investment, we expect Paramount to pump out significant operating income and free cash flow in the years to come. At the same time, its content will provide the fuel for EPIX in the U.S., a growing number of Paramount channels outside of the U.S.; and will serve as an important source of television content for Media Networks, including Nickelodeon, Spike and MTV.
In conclusion, I want to address the speculation about Viacom and our future. Our outlook and the facts have been distorted and obscured by the naysayers, self-interested critics and publicity seekers. We will not be distracted or deterred as we build for the bright future ahead of us. As Executive Chairman and CEO, I will continue to work tirelessly to secure that future and will leave no stone unturned either tactically or strategically. Sumner and I have a more than 30-year history side-by-side building his media empire. He and the board of Viacom, believing in my abilities and my character, have entrusted me with weighty responsibilities, none of which are inconsistent or incompatible. My singular objective is to protect and build value for all of Viacom shareholders and, in doing so, for all the beneficiaries of Sumner's trust not only include the descendants of his daughter but also those of her brother. And finally, let me be absolutely clear: I could not be more focused on getting Viacom's stock price back to the much higher level it enjoyed under my leadership just a short time ago. No one should doubt my resolve or the resolve of our entire management team in making that happen. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website. Now let's take a look at our segment results.",611,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website. Now let's take a look at our segment results.
At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 3%, and international revenues declined 4%. Excluding a 7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 3%, reflecting growth in advertising and affiliate revenues. Page 9 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 3% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 4%, and international revenues were down 2%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had an 8 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 6% driven by growth in Europe. In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were down 1%. Domestic revenues were substantially flat in the quarter while international revenues declined 6%. Domestic affiliate revenues were unfavorably impacted by the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements. Foreign exchange had a 9 percentage point unfavorable impact on international affiliate revenue growth. Ancillary revenues were down 19%, driven by lower consumer products revenue, reflecting comparisons to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles merchandise sale in the December quarter of last year as well as the decline in television syndication revenue.
Expenses decreased 3% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expenses were down 3%, while distribution and other expenses decreased 4%. SG&A expense decreased 2% in the quarter. The decreases in programming and SG&A costs were principally due to the savings from our strategic realignment last year.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 4% for the quarter, and the adjusted operating income margin was 41%. The decline in operating income was driven by the revenue decline of 3% partially offset by the 3% decline in expenses.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 15% in the quarter principally due to decreases in theatrical and home entertainment revenues partially offset by an increase in license fees. Foreign exchange had a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact on Filmed Entertainment revenue growth. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Theatrical revenues declined 44%. The decline in revenues was due to lower carryover revenues given the difficult comparison to the strong performance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the December quarter of last year as well as lower revenues from our current-quarter releases. Of our more significant releases, The Big Short and Daddy's Home, were both released in December of this year compared to Interstellar, which was released earlier in last year's December quarter. Home entertainment revenues declined 24% reflecting lower carryover revenues due to comparisons to Transformers: Age of Extinction in the December quarter of last year. 
Revenue from license fees increased 25% primarily driven by the licensing of certain titles in subscription video-on-demand and television. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $146 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $60 million last year. The decrease in operating results reflects the timing and mix of current-quarter releases as well as lower contributions from prior-period releases.
Now moving beyond the segment results. The other items line reflects a gain of $2 million versus 18 -- an $18 million loss in the December quarter of last year. Last year's loss was principally due to foreign exchange. In terms of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting a 50 basis point increase as compared to the prior year.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2016 fiscal year that haven't already been discussed.
For the quarter, we had a cash use of $152 million, which compares to $57 million of free cash flow in the December quarter of last year. Page 5 of the web presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to higher working capital utilizations and lower operating income. Working capital was negatively impacted by the timing of film receivables from home entertainment and television.
Now moving on to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at the end of the quarter of 4.6%. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion of total debt and $327 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.2x. We have $368 million remaining outstanding of our 6.25% senior notes, which mature on April 30. We plan on paying these notes off.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenues, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements which are tied to product availability. For the fiscal year 2016, we expect growth in affiliate revenues to be in the low mid-single-digit range. For the full year, we expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid-single digits. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic-international profitability mix.
At Paramount, we are excited about the upcoming slate, including our summer tentpoles Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. For fiscal 2016, we expect profits to be weighted to the back half of the year as the studio benefits from their summer releases. Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline. Paramount has just wrapped production on Jack Reacher 2. This month, the studio is commencing production on 4 major films. Scarlett Johansson will star in Ghost in the Shell, which is in partnership with DreamWorks. Baywatch, starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron; the newest chapter in Vin Diesel's action franchise, xXx 3: The Return of Xander Cage; and the romantic thriller set in World War II, which is directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. In the spring, the studio starts production on Academy Award-winning filmmaker Alexander Payne's next movie called Downsizing, starring Matt Damon.
In summary, while last year we experienced broad ratings weaknesses, we took organizational and creative steps to address those challenges. The progress we began to see at the end of fiscal 2015 is continuing. In the December quarter, 6 of our top 10 networks saw a growth in ratings. In March quarter-to-date, we are seeing ratings growth for our overall portfolio of Media Networks. At Paramount, they have started the fiscal year with several successes at the box office, and we look forward to the summer tentpole releases. In terms of our international Media Networks, we are benefiting from our investment over the past several years and anticipate strong double-digit growth in profits this year. The acquisition of Channel 5 has been an unqualified success. And the continued launch of new networks in Europe, Latin America and Africa has enabled us to build and grow our scale in the most important developing and developed markets.

Thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's results for 2016 second quarter. As we move forward, we have several notable areas of strength, including ratings improvement in key network, solid visibility on long-term affiliate revenue growth, increasing value generated from the growing use of technology and data and continued growth in our international business. We made solid progress in the quarter driving significant change across our brands to increase the value of our content and better position us for the future. 
There are 4 major strategic objectives driving change and future growth at Viacom. First and foremost, we continued to make substantial investments in content, specifically original content, a long-term imperative that is generating clear result and building long-term value. This includes steadily escalating content investments in television and film as well as short-form mobile content. Second, we are upgrading and expanding our already substantial data capabilities to deliver more accurate metrics for advertisers and greater monetization potential. We are out in the lead in this area and are beginning to reap the benefit, which will accelerate as we go forward. Third, we are maximizing our opportunities for revenue growth with traditional distributors, while moving forward with new forms of distribution. Our content ownership and the popularity of our content on new platforms and social media are providing new options as the ecosystem evolves. And fourth, we continue to look at strategic options to enhance our competitive position and unlock the value of our businesses. Our exploration of the strategic minority investor in Paramount is an excellent example as is our continued international expansion. 
Looking at the numbers, in the second quarter, revenues declined 3% to $3 billion. Adjusted operating income was $586 million and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $303 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined to $0.76 per diluted share. 
Turning to Media Networks. Revenues declined 3% to $2.38 billion in the quarter. Ad sales revenues were down 5% in the U.S. While it is early in the quarter, we hope to improve the rate of change in ad sales revenue even as we reduce unit load at several of our network, which bodes well for brand health and future financial performance. 
This year, we expect a strong upfront, a tripling of Viacom vantage clients and additional interest in kids, where Viacom has some of its greatest strength. The movie studios are coming to this upfront with the increased number of kids and family-oriented theatrical releases and as the dominant kids network, this is very positive for Nickelodeon. 
In addition, we have recently launched Viacom Vantage studio audition, the first data-driven ad product specifically for the studio category where we see significant opportunities for overall growth. Domestic affiliate revenues in the current quarter decreased 2%, impacted as we had previously discussed at the rate realignment with a major distributor and slight declines in distribution in line with industry trends. SVOD revenues are expected to be more significant in the second half of our fiscal year. 
Based on the long-term deals we've recently closed, we expect to grow affiliate revenues with traditional distributors and overall at mid-single digit rates in 2017 when the rate realignment will be behind us and beyond. 
Our recent renewal with DISH on favorable terms was an important moment for Viacom. In the past year, we have successfully renewed distribution deals with several major distributors representing over 44 million subscribers. We now have long-term deals in place with all of the major distributors and an extended runway for steady affiliate revenue growth. 
We have a real opportunity to build on that momentum. Our networks are highly valued by our cable, satellite and telco partners because they drive substantial live and video-on-demand viewership. In fact, the reach of our networks is vastly underappreciated. We continue to own the largest share of viewership in multiple key demographics on the highly monetizable cable-television platform. Viacom networks combined represents the largest share of cable viewing of any cable family for all viewers 2 plus according to Nielsen. And we gained more share compared to a year ago than any other family of cable networks among viewers 2 to 49, where we have 21% of viewership. We also have the largest share of viewers 18 to 34, also 21% and 18 to 49 at over 17%. 
The significance of this share shift will become even more evident as new, more robust measurement tools take hold in the market. In addition, our networks and the demos they attract are much desired for OTT streaming service is from new entrants in the industry as well as of those developed by the traditional distributors such as Swing. 
While cable penetration continues to decline across the industry, the penetration of connected devices is growing at a double-digit clip. In fact, 34% of broadband households subscribed to 2 or more paid Internet video services. The Viacom network portfolio is the leader in the U.S. among broadband-only homes and drive significant viewership on long-form platforms like Amazon, Hulu and Roku, as well as on short-form platforms like YouTube and Snapchat. Viacom's strong position as a valued content provider in both traditional cable and the fast-growing broadband and the mobile universe will continue to work in our favor as we lead the content providers into this new world. 
It gives us great confidence that our brands connection with valuable audiences are as strong as ever. We will maintain our focus on improving traditional ratings and also work to increase monetization in broadband power distribution by collaborating with our partners on subscription models and advertising features that will make these platforms more economically attractive. 
One of the ways we're meeting these challenges is by continuing to expand our data and add technology capability, exemplified by today's announcement with Roku. Among connected device owners, Roku Holmes have the highest reach, average days used and hours used per day. In fact, Roku usage is greater than Xbox, Chrome Cast and Apple TV combined and that lead is accelerating. This first-of-its-kind partnership will allow us to leverage, aggregate data from Roku, enabling sophisticated ad targeting at an unprecedented scale in the TV environment. Through this partnership, we can offer better, more targeted ad product. We also have a financial investment in Roku. 
Combined with partnerships with comScore, TiVo, Symphony, Snapchat and several others, a continuing relationship with Nielsen and our expanding internal expertise, we're building a platform that's second to none. There is no question that Internet delivery is here to stay, and we continue to grow quickly through new and bigger OTT and SVOD services as well as an improving TV Everywhere experience. 
Now turning to a brief update on our Media Networks. We are rejuvenating and repositioning several of our network and seeing positive results. Viacom had 8 of the top 30 ad-supported cable networks in the 2-plus demo and 9 of the top 30 in the 18 to 49 demo, 1 more than last year in each. We also had the highest number of top 20 cable series among core demos. 
Nickelodeon continues its leading performance, taking the #1 spot in 2 to 11 for 37 consecutive weeks and pulling away from its competitors on a total day and head-to-head basis. Blaze and the Monster Machines was the #1 program across all television with young kids for the second consecutive quarter. 
Among kids 2 to 11, Nickelodeon on the top 2 animated shows, SpongeBob SquarePants and ALVINNN!!! and 4 of the top 5 programs throughout the quarter. On the consumer product side, Pop Patrol is the #1 preschool property with every mass retailer. The property is a success in nearly every license product category, including preschool toys, where it's #1, apparel, home goods and accessories. 
VH1 rating were the best in 6 years with strong double-digit gains across the board. At Spike, Lip Sync Battle remains the most-watched original series in the channels history, and Season 2 continues to deliver a big and a broad audience. It's also a global hit now in more than 120 countries. 
Bellator, which Spike acquired in 2011, is another global success story. Currently the fastest-growing combat sports franchise worldwide, Bellator is averaging 1.2 million viewers this year, a 45% increase over 2015. Bellator held its first European event in Torino, Italy this month with 2 additional international events planned this year, the first in London and airing on Viacom's Channel 5 and the second in Israel. We expect Bellator to grow into a significant Viacom asset in its own right. 
At MTV, overall ratings remain soft but MTV's programming continues to capture substantial audience share with 5 of the top 25 programs on cable among viewers 12 to 34. And the new overall and programming leadership, MTV is committed to bringing more live music and music-inspired programming into the network. Last week, MTV put on a reimagined upfront event that was very warmly received by the ad community. The upcoming slate features 14 new series and specials fueled by top-tier producing talent like Mark Barnett and including Wonderland, the network's first weekly live music performance series in nearly 20 years that debuts this fall. 
At Comedy Central, changing viewing patterns continue to impact ratings but declines narrowed significantly versus the prior quarter. Comedy Central continues to develop hit new programming, including this quarter's Not Safe With Nikki Glaser and has returning popular multiplatform shows, such as Inside Amy Schumer, Broad City, Touch.0 and Another Period. The turnaround of MTV and Comedy Central will be a driver of our advertising revenue recovery as we head into our next fiscal year. 
Viacom's international Media Networks performance continues to be strong with even more growth on the horizon. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, advertising revenues increased 6% in the quarter and affiliate revenues rose 11% in the quarter. This is an important and underappreciated part of our portfolio that has grown significantly and now includes the Paramount Channel, Channel 5, Viacom 18, Spike, Comedy as well as even better, more localized MTV and Nickelodeon networks. Ratings are strong in our international brands particularly MTV. 
In India, Viacom and our JV partner have 16 networks and a country-leading position. We are showing strong growth in regional market and have recently launched [ph], on advertising supported VOD platform that will have Colors, MTV and Nick content as well as original long- and short-form content. 
In the U.K., our brands continue to show solid growth. Channel 5 reached its highest share ever in the 16 to 34 demo in the quarter and MTV, Nick and Comedy all posted double-digit share increases. Nickelodeon remains the #1 kids channel group in pay-television. 
International markets also give us a valuable opportunity to experiment with new digital platforms and monetization strategy. For example, Play Plex, a flexible app-based distribution platform for all of Viacom's global brands can help our pay-TV operator partners create a great TV Everywhere experience for consumers or be distributed as an over-the-top service. We are particularly excited about Play Plex as an authenticated or direct-to-consumer mobile product in markets without cable and pay-TV infrastructure. 
RMR results were disappointing this quarter, largely due to 2 titles that perform below expectations. We look forward to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the current quarter and the Start Trek Beyond, Ben-Hur, Jack Reacher tool, Rings in several other promising titles later in the year. 
Paramount Television continues to make rapid progress with 15 shows ordered to production and an additional 10 set up at networks, including Maniac, a comedy starting Emma Stone and Jonah Hill for Netflix. 
Turning to EPIX. We are looking forward to the introduction of its first 2 original scripted series in default, including Paramount's Berlin Station. EPIX has the youngest audience of all of the major premium services and was the fastest-growing premium network in the U.S., growing more than 35% year-over-year in 2015. 
The process of identifying a strategic minority investor in Paramount is continuing and on track to securing agreement by the end of June. The strategic and evaluation possibilities are compelling. Like the entire media industry, the motion picture business is evolving. A strong strategic partner for Paramount, particularly one that provides international and/or technological cloud and expertise will provide important benefits to both Paramount and Viacom. 
In summary, we are creating more and more original programming under revitalized network leadership and that is bearing fruit, both in the U.S. and abroad. We have secured renewals with all of our major U.S. distribution affiliates. We are entering to partnerships with a number of new market entrants, including Snapchat, Roku, comScore and more. Our international expansion will provide opportunities to drive significant value and growth for Viacom for the foreseeable future. And Paramount is poised for renewed success, driven by full slate and a vibrant television business. Our entire management team is completely focused on putting the building blocks for growth in place this year. We have a smart strategy and are investing in our properties in the U.S. and around the world, setting us up to become a growth story in fiscal 2017 and beyond. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to jade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for March quarter are available on our website. Now let's take a look at our segment results. 
At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 4% and international revenues were substantially flat. Excluding a 7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 7%, reflecting growth in advertising and affiliate revenues. 
Page 9 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 4% in the quarter, domestic revenues were down 5% and international revenues were down 1%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 7 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 6%, driven by growth in Europe. 
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were down 1%; domestic revenues declined 2% in the quarter, reflecting a modest decline in subscribers and previously disclosed rate adjustment by a major distributor, partially offset by rate increases across the remaining subscriber base. Excluding a 7 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues increased 11%, driven by new channel launches, increased subscribers and rate increase. Expenses increased 2% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expenses were up 6%, while distribution and other expenses decreased 10%. SG&A expense decreased 2% in the quarter. The increase in programming costs was due to our ongoing investment in original content. The decrease in SG&A cost was principally due to lower advertising and promotional expenses. 
Within Media Networks adjusted operating income was down 11% for the quarter and the adjusted operating income margin was 33.8%. Decline in operating income was driven by the 3 percentage point decrease in revenue and the 2% increase in expense. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 1% in the quarter principally due to a decrease in home entertainment revenue, partially offset by an increase in license fees. Foreign exchange had a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact on Filmed Entertainment revenue growth. Page 12 of the web presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. 
Theatrical revenues increased 6% due to higher carryover revenues from Daddy's Home and The Big Short, which were both released late in the December quarter, partially offset by lower revenues from the current quarter releases. Home entertainment revenues declined 21%, reflecting lower revenue from catalog nd third-party business subscribers. Revenue from license fees increased 17%, primarily driven by the licensing of certain titles in subscription video-on-demand. 
Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $136 million in the quarter as compared to income of $1 million last year. The loss in the quarter  primarily reflects the performance of Zoolander 2 and Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. 
In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting 100 basis points increase compared to the prior year. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

In the quarter, we generated $382 million in free cash flow, which compares to $598 million of free cash flow in the March quarter of last year. 
Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year principally due to lower adjusted operating income. 
Moving on to our debt. The debt remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. We ended the quarter with $12.5 billion total debt and $480 million of cash and cash equivalents. 
At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.3x. We have $368 million remaining of our outstanding senior -- 6.25% senior notes, which mature on April 30. We plan on paying these notes off. 
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenues, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transaction and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. 
For the fiscal 2016 year, we continue to expect growth in affiliate revenues to be in the low mid-single-digit range. 
For the full year, we continue to expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid-single-digits. Given the timing of shows coming on air in the back half of the year, we expect programming expense growth to be weighted through the June quarter. Additionally, we expect marketing expense to be higher in the June quarter related to the launch of these shows. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.8%. 
At Paramount, while it has been a difficult first half of the year, we are looking forward to our summer releases, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. Given the first half performance, we expect the studio to generate a loss in fiscal 2016 [ph].

But as you point out, we have limited inventory available to take advantage of that right now and what will drive improvement in addition to several of the networks that I mentioned the improving, will be the continuing improvement at Comedy Central and MTV, which are obviously big networks for us and where we have both stepped up our level of programming. We have revitalized the leadership at MTV and a new direction that advertisers welcome, and we will be able to benefit from as we head into the upfront. Additionally, again, related to the upfront, we now have much in-hand capabilities, driven by our Viacom Vantage and our other products, which will help us drive pricing as we go to the upfront and beyond. So we think this is a period where we can, as I mentioned, in my remarks, we hope to see -- it's very early in the quarter but we hope to see some improvement this quarter.

And overall we have many opportunities to grow other forms of affiliate revenue, whether it's SVOD platforms, whether it's other over-the-top product or even Swing as part of our recent DISH agreement. So we have some visibility that allows us to protect the mid-single-digits. Of course, where we land on that depends a lot on what impact happens with that forward subscriber counts and the like, but I'm encouraged by the stabilization that appears to be taking hold in the marketplace."

So we have a very but a vital process but let me give you a few more details on the process. Yes, obviously, we won't talk about specifics until we announce a result. But we have window down from over 40 companies that expressed interest. We are in the final stages of windowing that down to a handful of strong players. They will be receiving management presentations of from this period until mid-May, after which we will get into detailed negotiation, discussion, diligence, all with a view to entering into an agreement, as I mentioned in my remarks, by the end of June. There is strong interest from around the world. And we think come at this stage, based on the conversations that I've I have had, that we will have a compelling result that will be both a strategic driver, reflect the significant value of Paramount, which after all is one of the greatest studios in Hollywood with 100-plus year history. So I think that today's announcement is just a validation of the value of the highest form of content, which this motion picture content and, as I mentioned earlier, at Paramount, we have the great growth opportunity created by a new television production operation that in and of itself is a growth business for the future of Paramount."

Thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's results for 2016 second quarter. As we move forward, we have several notable areas of strength, including ratings improvement in key network, solid visibility on long-term affiliate revenue growth, increasing value generated from the growing use of technology and data and continued growth in our international business. We made solid progress in the quarter driving significant change across our brands to increase the value of our content and better position us for the future. 
There are 4 major strategic objectives driving change and future growth at Viacom. First and foremost, we continue to make substantial investments in content, specifically original content, a long-term imperative that is generating clear results and building long-term value. This includes steadily escalating content investments in television and film as well as short-form mobile content. 
Second, we are upgrading and expanding our already substantial data capabilities to deliver more accurate metrics for advertisers and greater monetization potential. We are out in the lead in this area and are beginning to reap the benefit, which will accelerate as we go forward. 
Third, we are maximizing our opportunities for revenue growth with traditional distributors, while moving forward with new forms of distribution. Our content ownership and the popularity of our content on new platforms and social media are providing new options as the ecosystem evolves. 
And fourth, we continue to look at strategic options to enhance our competitive position and unlock the value of our businesses. Our exploration of the strategic minority investor in Paramount is an excellent example as is our continued international expansion. 
Looking at the numbers, in the second quarter, revenues declined 3% to $3 billion. Adjusted operating income was $586 million, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $303 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined to $0.76 per diluted share. 
Turning to Media Networks. Revenues declined 3% to $2.38 billion in the quarter. Ad sales revenues were down 5% in the U.S. While it is early in the quarter, we hope to improve the rate of change in ad sales revenue even as we reduce unit load at several of our network, which bodes well for brand health and future financial performance. This year, we expect a strong upfront, a tripling of Viacom Vantage clients and additional interest in kids, where Viacom has some of its greatest strength. The movie studios are coming to this upfront with an increased number of kids and family-oriented theatrical releases. And as the dominant kids network, this is very positive for Nickelodeon. 
In addition, we have recently launched Viacom Vantage Studio Edition, the first data-driven ad products specifically for the studio category where we see significant opportunities for overall growth. Domestic affiliate revenues in the current quarter decreased 2%, impacted as we had previously discussed at the rate realignment with a major distributor and slight declines in distribution in line with industry trend. SVOD revenues are expected to be more significant in the second half of our fiscal year. 
Based on the long-term deals we've recently closed, we expect to grow affiliate revenues with traditional distributors and overall at mid-single digit rates in 2017 when the rate realignment will be behind us and beyond.  
Our recent renewal with DISH on favorable terms was an important moment for Viacom. In the past year, we have successfully renewed distribution deals with several major distributors representing over 44 million subscribers. We now have long-term deals in place with all of the major distributors and an extended runway for steady affiliate revenue growth. 
We have a real opportunity to build on that momentum. Our networks are highly valued by our cable, satellite and telco partners because they drive substantial live and video-on-demand viewership. In fact, the reach of our networks is vastly underappreciated. We continue to own the largest share of viewership in multiple key demographics on the highly monetizable cable-television platform. Viacom networks combined represent the largest share of cable viewing of any cable family for all viewers, 2+, according to Nielsen. And we gained more share compared to a year ago than any other family of cable networks among viewers 2 to 49, where we have 21% of viewership. We also have the largest share of viewers 18 to 34, also 21%; and 18 to 49 at over 17%. 
The significance of this share shift will become even more evident as new, more robust measurement tools take hold in the market. In addition, our networks and the demos they attract are much desired for OTT streaming service is from new entrants in the industry as well as of those developed by the traditional distributors such as Sling. 
While cable penetration continues to decline across the industry, the penetration of connected devices is growing at a double-digit clip. In fact, 34% of broadband households subscribed to 2 or more paid Internet video services. The Viacom network portfolio is the leader in the U.S. among broadband-only homes and drive significant viewership on long-form platforms like Amazon, Hulu and Roku, as well as on short-form platforms like YouTube and Snapchat. Viacom's strong position as a valued-content provider in both traditional cable and the fast-growing broadband and mobile universe will continue to work in our favor as we lead the content providers into this new world. 
It gives us great confidence that our brands' connections with valuable audiences are as strong as ever. We will maintain our focus on improving traditional ratings and also work to increase monetization in broadband power distribution by collaborating with our partners on subscription models and advertising features that will make these platforms more economically attractive. 
One of the ways we're meeting these challenges is by continuing to expand our data and ad technology capability, exemplified by today's announcement with Roku. Among connected device owners, Roku homes have the highest reach, average days used and hours used per day. In fact, Roku usage is greater than Xbox, Chromecast and Apple TV combined, and that lead is accelerating. This first-of-its-kind partnership will allow us to leverage aggregate data from Roku, enabling sophisticated ad targeting at an unprecedented scale in the TV environment. Through this partnership, we can offer better, more targeted ad product. We also have a financial investment in Roku. 
Combined with partnerships with comScore, TiVo, Symphony, Snapchat and several others, a continuing relationship with Nielsen and our expanding internal expertise, we're building a platform that's second to none. There is no question that Internet delivery is here to stay, and we continue to grow quickly through new and bigger OTT and SVOD services as well as an improving TV Everywhere experience. 
Now turning to a brief update on our Media Networks. We are rejuvenating and repositioning several of our network and seeing positive results. Viacom had 8 of the top 30 ad-supported cable networks in the 2+ demo and 9 of the top 30 in the 18 to 49 demo, 1 more than last year in each. We also had the highest number of top 20 cable series among core demos. 
Nickelodeon continues its leading performance, taking the #1 spot in 2 to 11 for 37 consecutive weeks and pulling away from its competitors on a total day and head-to-head basis. Blaze and the Monster Machines was the #1 program across all television with young kids for the second consecutive quarter. Among kids 2 to 11, Nickelodeon on the top 2 animated shows, SpongeBob SquarePants and ALVINNN!!! and 4 of the top 5 programs throughout the quarter. On the consumer product side, PAW Patrol is the #1 preschool property with every mass retailer. The property is a success in nearly every license product category, including preschool toys, where it is #1, apparel, home goods and accessories. 
VH1's rating were the best in 6 years with strong double-digit gains across the board. At Spike, Lip Sync Battle remains the most-watched original series in the channel's history, and Season 2 continues to deliver a big and a broad audience. It's also a global hit now in more than 120 countries. 
Bellator, which Spike acquired in 2011, is another global success story. Currently the fastest-growing combat sports franchise worldwide, Bellator is averaging 1.2 million viewers this year, a 45% increase over 2015. Bellator held its first European event in Torino, Italy this month with 2 additional international events planned this year, the first in London and airing on Viacom's Channel 5, and the second in Israel. We expect Bellator to grow into a significant Viacom asset in its own right. 
At MTV, overall ratings remain soft but MTV's programming continues to capture substantial audience share with 5 of the top 25 programs on cable among viewers 12 to 34. Under new overall and programming leadership, MTV is committed to bringing more live music and music-inspired programming to the network. Last week, MTV put on a reimagined upfront event that was very warmly received by the ad community. The upcoming slate features 14 new series and specials fueled by top-tier producing talent like Mark Burnett and including Wonderland, the network's first weekly live music performance series in nearly 20 years that debuts this fall. 
At Comedy Central, changing viewing patterns continue to impact ratings but declines narrowed significantly versus the prior quarter. Comedy Central continues to develop hit new programming, including this quarter's Not Safe With Nikki Glaser and is returning popular multiplatform shows, such as Inside Amy Schumer, Broad City, Tosh.0 and Another Period. The turnaround of MTV and Comedy Central will be a driver of our advertising revenue recovery as we head into our next fiscal year. 
Viacom's International Media Networks performance continues to be strong with even more growth on the horizon. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, advertising revenues increased 6% in the quarter, and affiliate revenues rose 11% in the quarter. This is an important and underappreciated part of our portfolio that has grown significantly and now includes the Paramount Channel, Channel 5, Viacom 18, Spike, Comedy as well as even better, more localized MTV and Nickelodeon networks. Ratings are strong in our international brands particularly MTV. 
In India, Viacom and our JV partner have 16 networks and a country-leading position. We are showing strong growth in regional market and have recently launched VOOT, an advertising supported VOD platform that will house COLORS, MTV and Nick content as well as original long and short-form content. 
In the U.K., our brands continue to show solid growth. Channel 5 reached its highest share ever in the 16 to 34 demo in the quarter. And MTV, Nick and Comedy all posted double-digit share increases. Nickelodeon remains the #1 kids' channel group in pay television. 
International markets also give us a valuable opportunity to experiment with new digital platforms and monetization strategy. For example, Play Plex, a flexible app-based distribution platform for all of Viacom's global brands can help our pay-TV operator partners create a great TV Everywhere experience for consumers or be distributed as an over-the-top service. We are particularly excited about Play Plex as an authenticated or direct-to-consumer mobile product in markets without cable and pay-TV infrastructure. 
Paramount results were disappointing this quarter, largely due to 2 titles that performed below expectations. We look forward to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the current quarter and Star Trek Beyond, Ben-Hur, Jack Reacher 2, Rings and several other promising titles later in the year. Paramount Television continues to make rapid progress with 15 shows ordered to production and an additional 10 set up at networks, including Maniac, a comedy starting Emma Stone and Jonah Hill for Netflix. 
Turning to EPIX. We are looking forward to the introduction of its first 2 original scripted series in the fall, including Paramount's Berlin Station. EPIX has the youngest audience of all of the major premium services and was the fastest-growing premium network in the U.S., growing more than 35% year-over-year in 2015. 
The process of identifying a strategic minority investor in Paramount is continuing and on track to securing agreement by the end of June. The strategic and valuation possibilities are compelling. Like the entire media industry, the motion picture business is evolving. A strong strategic partner for Paramount, particularly one that provides international and/or technological cloud and expertise will provide important benefits to both Paramount and Viacom. 
In summary, we are creating more and more original programming under revitalized network leadership, and that is bearing fruit both in the U.S. and abroad. We have secured renewals with all of our major U.S. distribution affiliates. We are entering into partnerships with a number of new market entrants, including Snapchat, Roku, comScore and more. Our international expansion will provide opportunities to drive significant value and growth for Viacom for the foreseeable future. And Paramount is poised for renewed success, driven by a full slate and a vibrant television business. Our entire management team is completely focused on putting the building blocks for growth in place this year. We have a smart strategy and are investing in our properties in the U.S. and around the world, setting us up to become a growth story in fiscal 2017 and beyond. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter are available on our website. Now let's take a look at our segment results. 
At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 4%, and international revenues were substantially flat. Excluding a 7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 7%, reflecting growth in advertising and affiliate revenues. 
Page 9 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 4% in the quarter, domestic revenues were down 5%. And international revenues were down 1%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 7 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 6%, driven by growth in Europe. 
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were down 1%. Domestic revenues declined 2% in the quarter, reflecting a modest decline in subscribers at a previously disclosed rate adjustment -- major distributor, partially offset by rate increases across the remaining subscriber base. Excluding a 7 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues increased 11%, driven by new channel launches, increased subscribers and rate increase. Expenses increased 2% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expenses were up 6%, while distribution and other expenses decreased 10%. SG&A expense decreased 2% in the quarter. The increase in programming costs was due to our ongoing investment in original content. The decrease in SG&A cost was principally due to lower advertising and promotional expenses. 
Within Media Networks adjusted operating income, it was down 11% for the quarter. And the adjusted operating income margin was 33.8%. Decline in operating income was driven by the 3 percentage point decrease in revenue and the 2% increase in expense. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 1% in the quarter principally due to a decrease in home entertainment revenue, partially offset by an increase in license fees. Foreign exchange had a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact on Filmed Entertainment revenue growth. Page 12 of the web presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. 
Theatrical revenues increased 6% due to higher carryover revenues from Daddy's Home and The Big Short, which were both released late in the December quarter, partially offset by lower revenues from the current quarter releases. Home entertainment revenues declined 21%, reflecting lower revenue from catalog and third-party business subscribers. Revenue from license fees increased 17%, primarily driven by the licensing of certain titles in subscription video-on-demand. 
Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $136 million in the quarter as compared to income of $1 million last year. The loss in the quarter primarily reflects the performance of Zoolander 2 and Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. 
In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting 100 basis points increase compared to the prior year. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt, as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2016 fiscal year that haven't already been discussed. 
In the quarter, we generated $382 million in free cash flow, which compares to $598 million of free cash flow in the March quarter of last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year is principally due to lower adjusted operating income. 
Moving on to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. We ended the quarter with $12.5 billion total debt and $480 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.3x. We have $368 million remaining over our outstanding senior -- 6.25% senior notes, which mature on April 30. We plan on paying these notes off. 
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenues, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transaction and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. 
For the fiscal 2016 year, we continue to expect growth in affiliate revenues to be in the low mid-single-digit range. For the full year, we continue to expect that Media Networks' programming expense growth rate will be in the mid-single digits. Given the timing of shows coming on air in the back half of the year, we expect programming expense growth to be weighted through the June quarter. Additionally, we expect marketing expense to be higher in the June quarter related to the launch of these shows. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.8%. 
At Paramount, while it has been a difficult first half of the year, we are looking forward to our summer releases, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. Given the first half performance, we expect the studio to generate a loss in fiscal 2016.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to your questions."

But as you point out, we have limited inventory available to take advantage of that right now and what will drive improvement in addition to several of the networks that I mentioned improving will be the continuing improvement at Comedy Central and MTV, which are obviously big networks for us and where we have both stepped up our level of programming. We have revitalized the leadership at MTV and a new direction that advertisers welcome and we will be able to benefit from as we head into the upfront. Additionally, again, related to the upfront, we now have much enhance capabilities driven by our Viacom Vantage and other products, which will help us drive pricing as we go to the upfront and beyond.

So we'll see it -- we  certainly now have, especially with the last big major behind us in DISH, good visibility on traditional, which is why I singled that out. And then overall, we have many opportunities to grow other forms of affiliate revenue whether it's SVOD platforms, whether it's other over-the-top product or even Sling as part of our recent DISH agreement. So we have some visibility that allows us to project the mid-single digits. Of course, where we land on that depends a lot on what, in fact, happens.

So the vast majority of the shows were basically picked up over the last, certainly over the last year with a lot -- over the last several months. And as shows have been green lit, they've been making a number of announcements. Some of them are for our own network, like School of Rock, which has been ordered for a second season on Nickelodeon as it's off to a great start. We're looking at an original series for TV Land kind of a Paramount Television. We have an original series slated for Spike from Paramount. And this fall, we have Berlin Station on EPIX. That's just our own network. We -- I mentioned Maniac on Netflix. We have other series that's for our SVOD services. We have series on HBO. We have series on Fox. We had GREASE LIVE. That was very successful on Fox. We have series on Turner Network. We really have series across the board. Some of it, original concepts. And some of them based on titles in the Paramount library. So there are many, many opportunities to create new series just starting with our own library of great compiles that can be turned into television series. It, of course, allows us also to sell in the global marketplace. So we were very happy with the rapid list off. And we think as series get on air, get into multiple seasons, it will be a great leg for Paramount and an important driver of long-term performance for Paramount. And it's certainly an interesting aspect of this as we explore a strategic transaction. Vantage, on the top supplement, what I have to say on Vantage, but it's been certainly a key part of the conversation with our major branded advertisers. And remember that as I've said previously, the over 3/4 of advertising comes from our top 100 advertisers. And we are in this upfront expecting to triple the number of Vantage participants to approximately 33 players. Take the 33 against the top 100 and think of the 32 as concentrated in the top 50. So it's a substantial part of our upfront discussions. And we talked about Vantage. We have all sorts of other services that come with it under the Velocity and Echo capabilities at great marketing, social media connectivity, et cetera. And that will grow from there. Next, we built up the capability to be able to ramp up for this level, and we will continue to ramp up our capability. Tom, do you want to add something?"

But it's not just China. In many other places, you have local MVPDs that are setting up robust services. They watched what happened in the U.S. and so they got ahead of some of the U.S. players that have now expanded globally. So in many countries, we're seeing the opportunity for us be greater with local players than the U.S.-based services that are ""exporting abroad.""

And whether it's the continuous expansion of shows like Teen Mom or Shannara, which we have renewed and scream and so forth. So but we're adding on a lot of programming. We're focusing on the M in MTV. And Comedy Central also has a really strong lineup but I mentioned a lot of the shows. And again, I think, the imperative as we go forward is to add to the volume of compelling Millennial-oriented original programming and event. Just mentioned the -- going back to MTV, the great success that they reinvented, MTV Movie Awards this year, where we improved overall viewership in what was a multi-cast show by over 50%. And I think it was a great representation of the grant in a new way and you'll see a lot more of that as we go forward under new leadership."

You look at the fact that we are in the animation business as we have animated family-oriented titles going forward or the franchises that we are growing out of Nickelodeon, such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and SpongeBob and others. So we have a very vital process, but let me give you a few more details on the process. Yes, obviously, we'll -- we won't talk about specifics until we announce a result. But we have windowed down from over 40 companies that expressed interest. We are in the final stages of windowing that down to a handful of strong players. They will be receiving management presentations of from this period until mid-May, after which we will get into detailed negotiation, discussion, diligence, all with a view to entering into an agreement, as I mentioned in my remarks, by the end of June. There is strong interest from around the world. And we think, at this stage, based on the conversations that I have had, that we will have a compelling result that will be both a strategic driver, reflect the significant value of Paramount, which after all is one of the greatest studios in Hollywood with 100-plus year history. So I think that today's announcement is just the validation of the value of the highest form of content, which is motion picture content. And as I mentioned earlier, at Paramount, we have the great growth opportunity created by a new television production operation that in and of itself is a growth business for the future of Paramount."

Thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's results for 2016 second quarter. As we move forward, we have several notable areas of strength, including ratings improvement in key network, solid visibility on long-ter",2201,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's results for 2016 second quarter. As we move forward, we have several notable areas of strength, including ratings improvement in key network, solid visibility on long-term affiliate revenue growth, increasing value generated from the growing use of technology and data and continued growth in our international business. We made solid progress in the quarter driving significant change across our brands to increase the value of our content and better position us for the future. 
There are 4 major strategic objectives driving change and future growth at Viacom. First and foremost, we continue to make substantial investments in content, specifically original content, a long-term imperative that is generating clear results and building long-term value. This includes steadily escalating content investments in television and film as well as short-form mobile content. Second, we are upgrading and expanding our already substantial data capabilities to deliver more accurate metrics for advertisers and greater monetization potential. We are out in the lead in this area and are beginning to reap the benefit, which will accelerate as we go forward. 
Third, we are maximizing our opportunities for revenue growth with traditional distributors, while moving forward with new forms of distribution. Our content ownership and the popularity of our content on new platforms and social media are providing new options as the ecosystem evolves. And fourth, we continue to look at strategic options to enhance our competitive position and unlock the value of our businesses. Our exploration of a strategic minority investor in Paramount is an excellent example as is our continued international expansion. Looking at the numbers, in the second quarter, revenues declined 3% to $3 billion. Adjusted operating income was $586 million, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $303 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined to $0.76 per diluted share. 
Turning to Media Networks. Revenues declined 3% to $2.38 billion in the quarter. Ad sales revenues were down 5% in the U.S. While it is early in the quarter, we hope to improve the rate of change in ad sales revenue even as we reduce unit load at several of our network, which bodes well for brand health and future financial performance. This year, we expect a strong upfront, a tripling of Viacom Vantage clients and additional interest in kids, where Viacom has some of its greatest strength. The movie studios are coming to this upfront with an increased number of kids and family-oriented theatrical releases. And as the dominant kids network, this is very positive for Nickelodeon.  In addition, we have recently launched Viacom Vantage Studio Edition, the first data-driven ad products specifically for the studio category where we see significant opportunities for overall growth. 
Domestic affiliate revenues in the current quarter decreased 2%, impacted as we had previously discussed at the rate realignment with a major distributor and slight declines in distribution in line with industry trend. SVOD revenues are expected to be more significant in the second half of our fiscal year. Based on the long-term deals we've recently closed, we expect to grow affiliate revenues with traditional distributors and overall at mid-single digit rates in 2017 when the rate realignment will be behind us and beyond.  
Our recent renewal with DISH on favorable terms was an important moment for Viacom. In the past year, we have successfully renewed distribution deals with several major distributors representing over 44 million subscribers. We now have long-term deals in place with all of the major distributors and an extended runway for steady affiliate revenue growth. We have a real opportunity to build on that momentum. Our networks are highly valued by our cable, satellite and telco partners because they drive substantial live and video-on-demand viewership. In fact, the reach of our networks is vastly underappreciated. We continue to own the largest share of viewership in multiple key demographics on the highly monetizable cable-television platform. Viacom networks combined represent the largest share of cable viewing of any cable family for all viewers, 2+, according to Nielsen. And we gained more share compared to a year ago than any other family of cable networks among viewers 2 to 49, where we have 21% of viewership. We also have the largest share of viewers 18 to 34, also 21%; and 18 to 49 at over 17%. 
The significance of this share shift will become even more evident as new, more robust measurement tools take hold in the market. In addition, our networks and the demos they attract are much desired for OTT streaming services from new entrants in the industry as well as of those developed by the traditional distributors such as Sling. 
While cable penetration continues to decline across the industry, the penetration of connected devices is growing at a double-digit clip. In fact, 34% of broadband households subscribed to 2 or more paid Internet video services. The Viacom network portfolio is the leader in the U.S. among broadband-only homes and drives significant viewership on long-form platforms like Amazon, Hulu and Roku, as well as on short-form platforms like YouTube and Snapchat. Viacom's strong position as a valued-content provider in both traditional cable and the fast-growing broadband and mobile universe will continue to work in our favor as we lead the content providers into this new world. 
It gives us great confidence that our brands' connections with valuable audiences are as strong as ever. We will maintain our focus on improving traditional ratings and also work to increase monetization in broadband power distribution by collaborating with our partners on subscription models and advertising features that will make these platforms more economically attractive. One of the ways we're meeting these challenges is by continuing to expand our data and ad technology capability, exemplified by today's announcement with Roku. Among connected device owners, Roku homes have the highest reach, average days used and hours used per day. In fact, Roku usage is greater than Xbox, Chromecast and Apple TV combined, and that lead is accelerating. This first-of-its-kind partnership will allow us to leverage aggregate data from Roku, enabling sophisticated ad targeting at an unprecedented scale in the TV environment. Through this partnership, we can offer better, more targeted ad product. We also have a financial investment in Roku. 
Combined with partnerships with comScore, TiVo, Symphony, Snapchat and several others, a continuing relationship with Nielsen and our expanding internal expertise, we're building a platform that's second to none. There is no question that Internet delivery is here to stay, and we continue to grow quickly through new and bigger OTT and SVOD services as well as an improving TV Everywhere experience. 
Now turning to a brief update on our Media Networks. We are rejuvenating and repositioning several of our network and seeing positive results. Viacom had 8 of the top 30 ad-supported cable networks in the 2+ demo and 9 of the top 30 in the 18 to 49 demo, 1 more than last year in each. We also had the highest number of top 20 cable series among core demos. 
Nickelodeon continues its leading performance, taking the #1 spot in 2 to 11 for 37 consecutive weeks and pulling away from its competitors on a total day and head-to-head basis. Blaze and the Monster Machines was the #1 program across all television with young kids for the second consecutive quarter. Among kids 2 to 11, Nickelodeon owned the top 2 animated shows, SpongeBob SquarePants and ALVINNN!!! and 4 of the top 5 programs throughout the quarter. On the consumer product side, PAW Patrol is the #1 preschool property with every mass retailer. The property is a success in nearly every license product category, including preschool toys, where it is #1, apparel, home goods and accessories. 
VH1's ratings were the best in 6 years with strong double-digit gains across the board. At Spike, Lip Sync Battle remains the most-watched original series in the channel's history, and Season 2 continues to deliver a big and a broad audience. It's also a global hit now in more than 120 countries. Bellator, which Spike acquired in 2011, is another global success story. Currently the fastest-growing combat sports franchise worldwide, Bellator is averaging 1.2 million viewers this year, a 45% increase over 2015. Bellator held its first European event in Torino, Italy this month with 2 additional international events planned this year, the first in London and airing on Viacom's Channel 5, and the second in Israel. We expect Bellator to grow into a significant Viacom asset in its own right. 
At MTV, overall ratings remain soft but MTV's programming continues to capture substantial audience share with 5 of the top 25 programs on cable among viewers 12 to 34. Under new overall and programming leadership, MTV is committed to bringing more live music and music-inspired programming to the network. Last week, MTV put on a reimagined upfront event that was very warmly received by the ad community. The upcoming slate features 14 new series and specials fueled by top-tier producing talent like Mark Burnett and including Wonderland, the network's first weekly live music performance series in nearly 20 years that debuts this fall. 
At Comedy Central, changing viewing patterns continue to impact ratings but declines narrowed significantly versus the prior quarter. Comedy Central continues to develop hit new programming, including this quarter's Not Safe With Nikki Glaser and its returning popular multiplatform shows, such as Inside Amy Schumer, Broad City, Tosh.0 and Another Period. The turnaround of MTV and Comedy Central will be a driver of our advertising revenue recovery as we head into our next fiscal year. 
Viacom's International Media Networks performance continues to be strong with even more growth on the horizon. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, advertising revenues increased 6% in the quarter, and affiliate revenues rose 11% in the quarter. This is an important and underappreciated part of our portfolio that has grown significantly and now includes the Paramount Channel, Channel 5, Viacom 18, Spike, Comedy as well as even better, more localized MTV and Nickelodeon networks. Ratings are strong in our international brands, particularly MTV. 
In India, Viacom and our JV partner have 16 networks and a country-leading position. We are showing strong growth in regional market and have recently launched VOOT, an advertising supported VOD platform that will house COLORS, MTV and Nick content as well as original long and short-form content.  In the U.K., our brands continue to show solid growth. Channel 5 reached its highest share ever in the 16 to 34 demo in the quarter. And MTV, Nick and Comedy all posted double-digit share increases. Nickelodeon remains the #1 kids' channel group in pay television. 
International markets also give us a valuable opportunity to experiment with new digital platforms and monetization strategy. For example, Play Plex, a flexible app-based distribution platform for all of Viacom's global brands can help our pay-TV operator partners create a great TV Everywhere experience for consumers or be distributed as an over-the-top service. We are particularly excited about Play Plex as an authenticated or direct-to-consumer mobile product in markets without cable and pay-TV infrastructure. 
Paramount results were disappointing this quarter, largely due to 2 titles that performed below expectations. We look forward to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the current quarter and Star Trek Beyond, Ben-Hur, Jack Reacher 2, Rings and several other promising titles later in the year. Paramount Television continues to make rapid progress with 15 shows ordered to production and an additional 10 set up at networks, including Maniac, a comedy starting Emma Stone and Jonah Hill for Netflix. 
Turning to EPIX. We are looking forward to the introduction of its first 2 original scripted series in the fall, including Paramount's Berlin Station. EPIX has the youngest audience of all of the major premium services and was the fastest-growing premium network in the U.S., growing more than 35% year-over-year in 2015. The process of identifying a strategic minority investor in Paramount is continuing and on track to securing agreement by the end of June. The strategic and valuation possibilities are compelling. Like the entire media industry, the motion picture business is evolving. A strong strategic partner for Paramount, particularly one that provides international and/or technological cloud and expertise will provide important benefits to both Paramount and Viacom. 
In summary, we are creating more and more original programming under revitalized network leadership, and that is bearing fruit both in the U.S. and abroad. We have secured renewals with all of our major U.S. distribution affiliates. We are entering into partnerships with a number of new market entrants, including Snapchat, Roku, comScore and more. Our international expansion will provide opportunities to drive significant value and growth for Viacom for the foreseeable future. And Paramount is poised for renewed success, driven by a full slate and a vibrant television business. Our entire management team is completely focused on putting the building blocks for growth in place this year. We have a smart strategy and are investing in our properties in the U.S. and around the world, setting us up to become a growth story in fiscal 2017 and beyond. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter are available on our website. Now let's take a look at our segment results. 
At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 4%, and international revenues were substantially flat. Excluding a 7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 7%, reflecting growth in advertising and affiliate revenues. 
Page 9 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 4% in the quarter, domestic revenues were down 5% and international revenues were down 1%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 7 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 6%, driven by growth in Europe. 
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were down 1%. Domestic revenues declined 2% in the quarter, reflecting a modest decline in subscribers and a previously disclosed rate adjustment [indiscernible] major distributor, partially offset by rate increases across the remaining subscriber base. Excluding a 7 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues increased 11%, driven by new channel launches, increased subscribers and rate increase. 
Expenses increased 2% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expenses were up 6%, while distribution and other expenses decreased 10%. SG&A expense decreased 2% in the quarter. The increase in programming costs was due to our ongoing investment in original content. The decrease in SG&A cost was principally due to lower advertising and promotional expenses.  Within Media Networks adjusted operating income, it was down 11% for the quarter. And the adjusted operating income margin was 33.8%. Decline in operating income was driven by the 3 percentage point decrease in revenue and the 2% increase in expense. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 1% in the quarter principally due to a decrease in home entertainment revenue, partially offset by an increase in license fees. Foreign exchange had a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact on Filmed Entertainment revenue growth. Page 12 of the web presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. 
Theatrical revenues increased 6% due to higher carryover revenues from Daddy's Home and The Big Short, which were both released late in the December quarter, partially offset by lower revenues from the current quarter releases. Home entertainment revenues declined 21%, reflecting lower revenue from catalog and third-party distribution partners. Revenue from license fees increased 17%, primarily driven by the licensing of certain titles in subscription video-on-demand.  Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $136 million in the quarter as compared to income of $1 million last year. The loss in the quarter primarily reflects the performance of Zoolander 2 and Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.  In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting a 100 basis point increase compared to the prior year. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

In the quarter, we generated $382 million in free cash flow, which compares to $598 million of free cash flow in the March quarter of last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year is principally due to lower adjusted operating income. 
Moving on to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. We ended the quarter with $12.5 billion total debt and $480 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.3x. We have $368 million remaining over our outstanding 6.25% senior notes, which mature on April 30. We plan on paying these notes off. 
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenues, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transaction and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability.  For the fiscal 2016 year, we continue to expect growth in affiliate revenues to be in the low mid-single-digit range. For the full year, we continue to expect that Media Networks' programming expense growth rate will be in the mid-single digits. Given the timing of shows coming on air in the back half of the year, we expect programming expense growth to be weighted through the June quarter. Additionally, we expect marketing expense to be higher in the June quarter related to the launch of these shows. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.8%. 
At Paramount, while it has been a difficult first half of the year, we are looking forward to our summer releases, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. Given the first half performance, we expect the studio to generate a loss in fiscal 2016.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to your questions."

But as you point out, we have limited inventory available to take advantage of that right now and what will drive improvement in addition to several of the networks that I mentioned improving will be the continuing improvement at Comedy Central and MTV, which are obviously big networks for us and where we have both stepped up our level of programming. We have revitalized the leadership at MTV and a new direction that advertisers welcome and we will be able to benefit from as we head into the upfront. Additionally, again, related to the upfront, we now have much enhanced capabilities driven by our Viacom Vantage and other products, which will help us drive pricing as we go to the upfront and beyond. So we think this is a period where we can -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we hope to see -- it is very early in the quarter. But we hope to see some improvement this quarter.

And then overall, we have many opportunities to grow other forms of affiliate revenue whether it's SVOD platforms, whether it's other over-the-top product or even Sling as part of our recent DISH agreement. So we have some visibility that allows us to project the mid-single digit. Of course, where we land on that depends a lot on what, in fact, happens. We'd go forward on subscriber counts and the like, but I'm encouraged by the stabilization that appears to be taking hold in the marketplace."

We started Paramount Television less than 2 years ago from scratch. So the vast majority of the shows were basically picked up over the last, certainly over the last year with a lot -- over the last several months. And as shows have been green lit, they've been making a number of announcements. Some of them are for our own network, like School of Rock, which has been ordered for a second season on Nickelodeon as it's off to a great start. We're looking at an original series for TV Land coming from Paramount Television. We have an original series slated for Spike from Paramount. And this fall, we have Berlin Station on EPIX. That's just our own network. We -- I mentioned Maniac on Netflix. We have other series that's for our SVOD services. We have series on HBO. We have series on Fox. We had GREASE LIVE. That was very successful on Fox. We have series on Turner Network. We really have series across the board. Some of it, original concepts and some of them based on titles in the Paramount library. So there are many, many opportunities to create new series just starting with our own library of great film piles that can be turned into a television series. It, of course, allows us also to sell in the global marketplace. So we were very happy with the rapid list off. And we think as series get on air, get into multiple seasons, it will be a great leg for Paramount and an important driver of long-term performance for Paramount. And it's certainly an interesting aspect of this as we explore a strategic transaction. Vantage, I'll let Tom supplement what I have to say on Vantage, but it's been certainly a key part of the conversation with our major branded advertisers. And remember that as I've said previously, the over 3/4 of advertising comes from our top 100 advertisers. And we are in this upfront expecting to triple the number of Vantage participants to approximately 33 players. Take the 33 against the top 100 and think of the 32 [ph] as being concentrated in the top 50. So it's a substantial part of our upfront discussions. And we talked about Vantage. We have all sorts of other services that come with it under the Velocity and Echo capabilities, have to create marketing, social media connectivity, et cetera. And that will grow from there. Next, we built up the capability to be able to ramp up for this level, and we will continue to ramp up our capability. Tom, do you want to add something?"

So we continue to see that as a growing opportunity. We are being selective in what programming we make available and what the windows are. And as I've talked about in prior earnings calls, we are differentiating among types of programming based on the performance that we see. And in many cases, we see a presence for our shows at SVOD by our seasons, for example, as being an important marketing driver for a new season, a good vehicle for catch-up and other things of that nature. On the international marketplace, clearly, it is a fast-growing opportunity. It is a significant opportunity in many countries where there's not a robust traditional delivery market. And importantly, we are seeing a lot of these SVOD services are local, not the ones that we talk about here in the U.S. There's a lot of local competition in the marketplace. The last time I looked at it, for example, in a country like China, there are 7 major, and I'm sure several others beyond the 7 majors that I was looking at, SVOD players that are local. But it's not just China. In many other places, you have local MVPDs that are setting up robust services. They watched what happened in the U.S. and so they got ahead of some of the U.S. players that have now expanded globally. So in many countries, we're seeing the opportunity for us be greater with local players than the U.S.-based services that are ""exporting abroad."" At the same time, we're doing a fair amount of business with the U.S.-based ones as they looked for international growth. So overall, it's a good opportunity for us. And since you bring up international, the opportunity to distribute content on various mobile services, particularly in countries where there's not a real good established pay television infrastructure is also a significant area of growth as we look into the years ahead."

And again, I think, the imperative as we go forward is to add to the volume of compelling Millennial-oriented original programming and event. Just mentioned the -- going back to MTV, the great success that they reinvented, MTV Movie Awards this year, where we improved overall viewership in what was a multi-cast show by over 50%.

You look at the 15 movies a year, major movies that we're putting year after year. You'll look at the growing international potential. You look at the fact that we are in the animation business as we have animated family-oriented titles going forward or the franchises that we are growing out of Nickelodeon, such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and SpongeBob and others. So we have a very vital process, but let me give you a few more details on the process. Obviously, we'll -- we won't talk about specifics until we announce a result. But we have winnowed down from over 40 companies that expressed interest. We are in the final stages of winnowing that down to a handful of strong players. They will be receiving management presentations of from this period until mid-May, after which we will get into detailed negotiation, discussion, diligence, all with a view to entering into an agreement, as I mentioned in my remarks, by the end of June. There is strong interest from around the world. And we think, at this stage, based on the conversations that I have had, that we will have a compelling result that will be both a strategic driver, reflect the significant value of Paramount, which after all is one of the greatest studios in Hollywood with 100-plus year history. So I think today's announcement is just a validation of the value of the highest form of content, which is motion picture content. And as I mentioned earlier, at Paramount, we have the great growth opportunity created by a new television production operation that in and of itself is a growth business for the future of Paramount."

Last week,",2386,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Viacom's third quarter earnings call. As you know, since our last call, we have been subject to controversy relating to governance, which has obviously created an overhang for our company. Last week, courts in Massachusetts and Delaware rejected motions to dismiss, allowed discovery to proceed and scheduled trials to take place in October. We view these favorable court rulings as positive steps that move us ahead to a resolution. In light of the litigation, we won't be able to comment further on this topic during today's call. 
Meanwhile, Viacom continues to focus on making progress against our strategic plan. We are increasing our investments in more and more original content across multiple platforms, extending our lead in sophisticated data products, building engaging new consumer experiences through innovative, thoughtful distribution partnerships as well as new consumer products, recreation and hospitality initiatives, expanding our formidable international presence and forging new strategic paths, including a potential partnership to unlock the value of Paramount and provide competitive advantages for the studio and Viacom overall. These initiatives are the most recent manifestation of a careful, comprehensive and consistent vision for Viacom that we have pursued since I became CEO in 2006 to focus on original content, enhance our distribution revenues and build a robust international business while adapting to change. That job is never done, nor is it easy. There are disruptive challenges in our industry, particularly for those companies like Viacom that focus on younger demographics, but we are having increasing success at several of our brands. And we are leveraging those learnings to accelerate that success at other properties. 
Wade and Tom will go into the numbers in a moment. First, let me review some of the drivers of our results for the quarter and what lies ahead. In ad sales, we concluded a strong upfront. More advertisers committed early instead of waiting for the scatter market later when inventory is scarce. This movement and ratings progress at core networks as well as our new advertising products resulted in mid to high single-digit price and volume increases. Our end-to-end, data-driven marketing solutions continue to help us lead the way and advance advertising. And our proprietary, predictive engine, Vantage, is in even more demand by sophisticated marketing partners. We expected to triple the number of Vantage deals from last year to this year. And we exceeded that goal. In this upfront, we will secure 35 to 40 Vantage deals with our partners. Significantly, more than half are based on comScore metrics, signaling a welcome market shift to alternative currencies. 
In addition, we held the industry's first-ever data front, where we showcased our data capabilities and announced Vantage Intent powered by long-time partner, American Express. This exclusive, unprecedented collaboration resulted in the first product to tap American Express's unique data using predictive analytics to help marketers reach consumers even earlier in their purchase consideration process. 
These are all powerful examples of how we have transformed our company over the last several years. 
On the affiliate side, in the third quarter, we signed long-term deals with both DISH and Cox, both with solid annual rate increases. The decline in affiliate revenues was impacted by several factors, including the lapping of a large SVOD deal last year. As we disclosed in June, we expected to complete a significant SVOD agreement in the third quarter of this year, but recent uncertainty, coupled with our evaluation of various new distribution opportunities, have led to a slowdown of these discussions. 
As we have discussed, despite the continuing impact of changing audience behaviors and preferences, I am pleased to say that, in the June quarter, we've stabilized our ratings and several of our networks are leading the industry in their categories. Viacom holds 6 of the top 30 ad-supported cable networks. And our family of networks captures the most share in nearly every demo, 2 plus, 2 to 11, 2 to 49, and most importantly, 18 to 49 and 18 to 34. And through the 5 weeks of the fourth quarter, our revenue weighted ratings are up. Among viewers 2-plus, in the third quarter, VH1 delivered the biggest ratings gain of any of the 30 largest non-U.S. cable networks and Nick Jr. had the largest year-over-year ratings increase of any rated network. And we're also seeing strong traction across platforms. Viewership on our mobile apps is up 26% over the third quarter of last year. 
Nickelodeon story is a highlight and a perfect example of our strategy across the company to broaden our revenue base and drive audience engagement. Nickelodeon's ratings increased 6% in the quarter, and it extended its #1 ranking among kids 2 to 11 to 52 straight weeks, increasing an already substantial lead to over 20% over our biggest competitor in the quarter in that demo. And the best news is that much of Nickelodeon's success is driven by a broad lineup of popular programming that is new and fresh from a variety of genres, including animation, live-action and preschool. Leading the way is Henry Danger, which is the quarter's #1 show among kids 2 to 11 and 6 to 11, averaging 2.4 million total viewers per episode. Nick's newest animated series, the Loud House, has become a runaway hit and is averaging almost 2 million viewers per episode. In the current quarter, Kids Choice Sports outpaced last year's strong performance, up double digits, and like all of Nickelodeon's tentpole events, continues to be an extremely attractive opportunity for advertisers. On digital platforms, Nick continues to see strong year-over-year growth in video viewing, up almost 20% for the quarter across Nick and Nick Jr. sites and apps. 
Moving into the consumer products world. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Blaze and the Monster Machines, PAW Patrol and Shimmer and Shine are all strong consumer success stories with outstanding growth potential. Additionally, our recreation and hospitality efforts continue to come online. Finally, the SpongeBob Musical has opened in Chicago to very positive critical buzz. We're looking forward to bring it to New York next fiscal year. This is the new Nickelodeon -- and her talented creative team have been building. And we couldn't be more excited or proud of the great turnaround they have engineered fueled by strategic insight, continued investment and unwavering faith in their capabilities. There is no kid's brand with more magic than Nickelodeon right now. And we believe their broad portfolio of legitimate hits will drive significant diversified growth for years to come. 
VH1 is also a great story and a blueprint of our investment in great content, acceleration of the development process and smart use of data can drive improved performance. VH1 expanded its ratings gain in Q3, finishing up 33%. That's right. 33%, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. VH1 is making aggressive investments in distinctive programming and drilling in on what VH1 fans want. Love & Hip Hop Atlanta continues to be a juggernaut and rank as the #1 reality show in cable. In fact, VH1 has 2 of the top 5 reality cable shows. Hip Hop Honors, which aired in July, was the highest-rated VH1 tentpole in 15 years with over 3 million viewers. We're building on these proven properties in the current quarter with Love & Hip Hop Hollywood and the new Amber Rose Show, which we took straight to air and developing in real-time using sophisticated applications of audience science. In addition, our marketing and scheduling teams at VH1 are applying proprietary learnings from Viacom's data insight capabilities to drive additional viewership and engagement, helping our hit shows gain even more audience traction. VH1 is leading the charge, and we are exploring ways that these strategies can be applied seamlessly to our other adult networks. 
Comedy Central's ratings improved significantly towards the end of the third quarter, and the network is up year-over-year in the fourth quarter so far. New leadership is reinvigorating the brand, and we are looking forward to a new season of Drunk History, the premiere of a new standup series produced by and starring Kevin Hart and the Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe. And of course, Kyle, Cartman and the Southpark Gang are back for a historic 20th season premiering next month. Their anniversary celebration was a hit at Comic Con. The extraordinary longevity is a true testament to the creative excellence of Trey and Matt, the deep devotion of the show's fans and the outstanding team at Comedy Central. 
The BET awards also continued its strong run, ranking as the #1 cable award show among audiences 18 to 49 for the 2015-2016 broadcast season, claiming the top spot for the second consecutive year. Among African-American viewers, the program has ranked as television's #1 awards show for the last 15 years. 
Moving on to our international Media Networks. We continue to see a strong performance by Bob and his team with both advertising and affiliate revenues increasing at double-digit levels, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Looking ahead, we remain intently focused on expanding and leveraging our diverse set of assets. We continue to diversify and strengthen our brand portfolio, reflecting demographic and market-specific opportunities. 10 years ago, when I became CEO, our international portfolio was singularly focused on youth. Today, our portfolio is radically different, with more breadth and depth, with a focus on the global 6: Nick, Nick Jr, MTV, Comedy Central, the Paramount Channel and SPIKE. In fact, the Paramount Channel, the largest ad-supported movie channel in the world, is now in 93 million homes outside the U.S. 
Our first major push beyond MTV was the Nickelodeon portfolio, which now reaches 283 million homes internationally. And we are now a major player in the adult demographic, which is significantly larger than our kids or youth segments. Comedy Central, our third global brand, is in 180 million homes outside the U.S. We now have 11 Paramount channels, the largest ad-supported international film channel in the world, built from scratch in just 4 short years. And we've begun the rollout of SPIKE, which is doing very well for us in the 3 markets we've launched. In just the past fiscal year alone, Viacom International Media Networks launched 15 new channels, with particular focus on the Middle East and Africa this past quarter. 
Of course, we also have 2 flagship local brands in the general entertainment space, Channel 5 in the U.K. and Colors in India, and both are operating extremely well. Again, 2 significant and highly promising businesses that did not exist at Viacom 10 years ago. 
In total, our channels now reached 3.8 billion aggregate subscribers, more than any other family of networks in the world. And looking ahead, there is very significant opportunity. 
The second priority is evolving from being simply an exporter of U.S. content to becoming a global content producer. We still bring a lot of high-performing domestic Viacom content overseas markets, particularly on the kid's side, but we are also increasing production of Viacom International Media Networks for our networks around the world. In fact, there are 7 in-house productions currently underway for Nickelodeon's global channels. 
Third, and perhaps most exciting for its obvious significance to our entire portfolio, we are redefining what it means to be a TV network. Across our international footprint, pay-TV penetration is approximately 40%, presenting us with attractive opportunities to exploit our digital products, including the Viacom Play Plex platform. Viacom Play Plex provides TV Everywhere functionality to cable customers, subscription services for mobile operators as well as direct-to-consumer opportunities. We've got the infrastructure, the brands, the content and the products to quickly scale the way we get content to consumers across 180 countries. 
Finally, Viacom International Media Networks is already generating significant revenues through consumer products, and we see a lot of potential in recreation, particularly retail, hotels and life experiences. These opportunities exist throughout our portfolio, but we are putting particular focus on Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. 
Now let's talk about Paramount. There is no question the studio has had a rough go at the box office recently. But as they always do, we expect fortunes to turn. As you know, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows did not meet our expectations. But there's significant bright spots at the studio. In particular, Paramount Television continues to grow rapidly, delivering new titles in the quarter, including Berlin Station for EPIX. Paramount Television will be a continuing source of growth, augmenting the revitalization of Paramount's theatrical slate. Again, it is worth noting that Paramount's television production is a business that also did not exist a few years ago. We made it a priority to return Paramount to the television production business. And we made it happen. 
In the current quarter, we have the critically acclaimed Star Trek Beyond, which is still opening across territories around the world in the next several weeks. Later in the quarter, Paramount will open Florence Foster Jenkins with Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant and Ben-Hur. And coming in the first quarter of 2017, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, starring Tom Cruise. 
Regarding our exploration of the sale of a 49% interest in Paramount to a strategic buyer, as we previously disclosed, we have narrowed the process down to a handful of prospects. The process has slowed down in recent weeks, but we have reason to believe the favorable court developments last week will create a better environment that will allow us to progress with several parties toward a highly beneficial transaction to present to our board. 
To conclude, we continue to focus on our strategic initiatives and are confident that there will be a significant fruit as we prepare for our next fiscal year. The ratings at our domestic Media Networks are improving. Our successful upfront and continued leadership in data-driven products will allow us to take advantage of continued ratings improvements at key networks. Our distribution landscape will improve as we lap the fiscal 2016 consolidation impacts and SVOD comps and we continue to grow and monetize new platforms. Our international networks will continue to expand in scope and value. And Paramount will see better days ahead with improved film slate performance, television production, and we hope, a groundbreaking strategic alliance. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Wade."

Media Networks adjusted operating income was down 22% in the quarter and the adjusted operating margin was 34.7%, and a decline in operating income was driven by the 3% decrease in revenues and the 11% increase. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were up 30% in the quarter principally due to increases in theatrical revenue and license fees. Page 12 of the web presentation provides the breakdown of the Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues increased to $91 million due to the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows in the quarter. License fees increased 39%, principally driven by the licensing of certain titles and subscription video-on-demand as well as contributions from our television production business. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $26 million in the quarter as compared to income of $48 million last year. The loss in the quarter reflects the underperformance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. 
In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting a 100 basis point increase as compared to the prior year. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt as well as factors impacting our September quarter of fiscal 2016 that haven't already been discussed. 
For the quarter, we generated $90 million of free cash flow, which compares to $300 million of free cash flow in the June quarter of last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to lower operating income and higher working capital utilization, which was due to net investment in film product. This was partially offset by lower cash taxes. 
In terms of our debt, it remains principally fixed-rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. During the quarter, we repaid $368 million of our outstanding 6.25% senior notes that came due in April. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $192 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.6x. 
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenue, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. For fiscal year 2016, we expect domestic affiliate revenues to decline at low to mid-single-digit rate. However, due to continuing uncertainty around the timing and completion of an SVOD distribution agreement, affiliate revenues could decline at mid to high single-digit rates. For the full year, we expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the low to mid-single digits. And Paramount, given the underperformance of certain films in the current year's slate, we expect to generate an operating loss for the September quarter as well as for the full fiscal year. 
In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.8%.

Our brands are what drive our business. So to some extent, probably the biggest impact has been on the ability to move forward rapidly on the Paramount transaction, which had initially been targeted to result in an agreement about a month ago. So that's certainly been slowed down. But as I indicated in my prepared remarks, they continue. And I hope that we will reach a conclusion on that, that will be beneficial to the company in due course. So that's really the principal impact, apart from the general distraction naturally. But it does not deter us from pursuing our international growth. It does not deter us from getting affiliate agreements concluded. It does not deter us from producing great new programming. It does not deter our management teams across our networks to be really focused on building our ratings. It does not deter us in getting a successful upfront. It does not deter us in developing continued industry-leading marketing products. Did not deter us from finding new ways to distribute our content to our audiences everywhere they are on every device they utilize and does not deter us from continually entering into new partnerships with companies like Roku, Snapchat and comScore and on and on. So we're focused. We are driving value for this company. And we view any difficulties that we face as a challenge that we will overcome. We'll be creative and overcoming and really search for every opportunity. I touched on some opportunities that will take a while to unfold. But they're pretty exciting. When you think about the power of the Nickelodeon brand, the fact that we have ratings success for so many new shows -- yes, people used to talk about our being so dependent on SpongeBob, but now we have such an array of shows. And each of those shows has consumer products opportunity around the world, particularly as we have grown our Nickelodeon footprint. And speaking of SpongeBob, this musical is really great now. When it hits Broadway, it could be an opportunity, not just inherently, but to revitalize that property. So the opportunities are manyfold. We have a strong management team. As you know, over the last 1.5 years, we have reorganized significantly. We have new leadership at several of our networks. You're seeing the effects already that the new leadership is bringing, VH1 being the perfect example that I cited. So yes, it's a distraction. But in the scope of time, it will be viewed as temporary. And our strategic initiatives continue unabated."

And by the way, we have many other brands that we're driving, whether it's BET or different Nick brands and so forth. But so -- when I'm referring to 6 brands, I'm talking the ones that are global and reach every continent and continue to grow across as many countries in those continents as possible. But when you have in the U.K., we bought Channel 5, very attractive acquisition. We revitalized the brand. I mean, literally, we changed the brand logo, and we have invested in programming. And we have a leading position there. It's gained share. We've also looked to build scale in other countries. And it's paying off. So we are -- we have really been building a platform the last several years, which is really now coming to maturity. We just have a lot of opportunities to expand there. We're focused on building value. I've said it over and over again. And in India, which is not a consolidated entity, continues to grow at extraordinary rates. We continue to grow at extraordinary rates year after year for years to come. We continue to add networks there. It's a network -- it's a country with a lot of opportunity, large population, fastest economic growth rate in the world today, the top growing economy in the world with a population that just loves entertainment. So our sector is growing much faster than GDP. So I believe, I talked about the last 10 years and how it's grown to this point, I believe over the next 10 years our international assets are going to have a value that potentially surpasses the entire value of the company today on the trajectory that we have."

And so with the average rate increases, we have good rate increase across our portfolio with no significant renewals coming up in '17. So we've got a pretty good lock there. We think there's a potential for stabilization of traditional distributors, subscriber count, given that there are some benefits in terms of maintaining distribution stickiness, which we've seen from the larger, more adept entities that have resulted. And the new distribution opportunities that we have are incremental, whether it's a sling, better penetration of platforms like Sony View and the many other opportunities that are there.

Welcome to Viacom's third quarter earnings call. As you know, since our last call, we have been subject to controversy relating to governance, which has obviously created an overhang for our company. Last week,",2393,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Viacom's third quarter earnings call. As you know, since our last call, we have been subject to controversy relating to governance, which has obviously created an overhang for our company. Last week, courts in Massachusetts and Delaware rejected motions to dismiss, allowed discovery to proceed and scheduled trials to take place in October. We view these favorable court rulings as positive steps that move us ahead to a resolution. In light of the litigation, we won't be able to comment further on this topic during today's call. 
Meanwhile, Viacom continues to focus on making progress against our strategic plan. We are increasing our investments in more and more original content across multiple platforms, extending our lead in sophisticated data products, building engaging new consumer experiences through innovative, thoughtful distribution partnerships as well as new consumer products, recreation and hospitality initiatives, expanding our formidable international presence and forging new strategic paths, including a potential partnership to unlock the value of Paramount and provide competitive advantages for the studio and Viacom overall. These initiatives are the most recent manifestation of a careful, comprehensive and consistent vision for Viacom that we have pursued, since I became CEO in 2006, to focus on original content, enhance our distribution revenues and build a robust international business while adapting to change. That job is never done, nor is it easy. There are disruptive challenges in our industry, particularly for those companies like Viacom that focus on younger demographics, but we are having increasing success at several of our brands and we are leveraging those learnings to accelerate that success at other properties. 
Wade and Tom will go into the numbers in a moment. First, let me review some of the drivers of our results for the quarter and what lies ahead. In ad sales, we concluded a strong upfront. More advertisers committed early instead of waiting for the scatter market later when inventory is scarce. This movement and ratings progress at core networks as well as our new advertising products resulted in mid to high single-digit price and volume increases. Our end-to-end, data-driven marketing solutions continue to help us lead the way in advanced advertising. And our proprietary, predictive engine, Vantage, is in even more demand by sophisticated marketing partners. We expected to triple the number of Vantage deals from last year to this year. And we exceeded that goal. In this upfront, we will secure 35 to 40 Vantage deals with our partners. Significantly, more than half are based on comScore metrics, signaling a welcome market shift to alternative currencies. 
In addition, we held the industry's first-ever data front, where we showcased our data capabilities and announced Vantage Intent, powered by long-time partner, American Express. This exclusive, unprecedented collaboration resulted in the first product to tap American Express's unique data using predictive analytics to help marketers reach consumers even earlier in their purchase consideration process. 
These are all powerful examples of how we have transformed our company over the last several years. 
On the affiliate side, in the third quarter, we signed long-term deals with both DISH and Cox, both with solid annual rate increases. The decline in affiliate revenues was impacted by several factors, including the lapping of a large SVOD deal last year. As we disclosed in June, we expected to complete a significant SVOD agreement in the third quarter of this year, but recent uncertainty, coupled with our evaluation of various new distribution opportunities, has led to a slowdown of these discussions. 
As we have discussed, despite the continuing impact of changing audience behaviors and preferences, I am pleased to say that in the June quarter, we've stabilized our ratings and several of our networks are leading the industry in their categories. Viacom holds 6 of the top 30 ad-supported cable networks. And our family of networks captures the most share in nearly every demo, 2 plus, 2 to 11, 2 to 49, and most importantly, 18 to 49 and 18 to 34. And through the 5 weeks of the fourth quarter, our revenue weighted ratings are up. Among viewers 2-plus, in the third quarter, VH1 delivered the biggest ratings gain of any of the 30 largest non-U.S. cable networks and Nick Jr. had the largest year-over-year ratings increase of any rated network. And we're also seeing strong traction across platforms. Viewership on our mobile apps is up 26% over the third quarter of last year. 
Nickelodeon story is a highlight, and a perfect example of our strategy across the company to broaden our revenue base and drive audience engagement. Nickelodeon's ratings increased 6% in the quarter, and it extended its #1 ranking among kids 2 to 11 to 52 straight weeks, increasing an already substantial lead to over 20% over our biggest competitor in the quarter in that demo. And the best news is that, much of Nickelodeon's success is driven by a broad lineup of popular programming that is new and fresh from a variety of genres, including animation, live-action and preschool. Leading the way is Henry Danger, which is the quarter's #1 show among kids 2 to 11 and 6 to 11, averaging 2.4 million total viewers per episode. Nick's newest animated series, the Loud House, has become a runaway hit and is averaging almost 2 million viewers per episode. In the current quarter, Kids Choice Sports outpaced last year's strong performance, up double digits, and like all of Nickelodeon's tentpole events, continues to be an extremely attractive opportunity for advertisers. On digital platforms, Nick continues to see strong year-over-year growth in video viewing, up almost 20% for the quarter across Nick and Nick Jr. sites and apps. 
Moving into the consumer products world. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Blaze and the Monster Machines, PAW Patrol and Shimmer and Shine are all strong consumer success stories, with outstanding growth potential. Additionally, our recreation and hospitality efforts continue to come online. Finally, the SpongeBob Musical has opened in Chicago to very positive critical buzz. We're looking forward to bringing it to New York next fiscal year. This is the new Nickelodeon, that Cyma Zarghami, and her talented creative team have been building, and we couldn't be more excited or proud of the great turnaround they have engineered fueled by strategic insight, continued investment and unwavering faith in their capabilities. There is no kid's brand with more magic than Nickelodeon right now, and we believe that their broad portfolio of legitimate hits will drive significant diversified growth for years to come. 
VH1 is also a great story and a blueprint of our investment in great content, acceleration of the development process and smart use of data can drive improved performance. VH1 expanded its ratings gain in Q3, finishing up 33%. That's right. 33%, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. VH1 is making aggressive investments in distinctive programming and drilling in on what VH1 fans want. Love & Hip Hop Atlanta continues to be a juggernaut and rank as the #1 reality show in cable. In fact, VH1 has 2 of the top 5 reality cable shows. Hip Hop Honors, which aired in July, was the highest-rated VH1 tentpole in 15 years, with over 3 million viewers. We're building on these proven properties in the current quarter with Love & Hip Hop Hollywood and the new Amber Rose Show, which we took straight to air and are developing in real-time using sophisticated applications of audience science. In addition, our marketing and scheduling teams at VH1 are applying proprietary learnings from Viacom's data insight capabilities to drive additional viewership and engagement, helping our hit shows gain even more audience traction. VH1 is leading the charge, and we are exploring ways that these strategies can be applied seamlessly to our other adult networks. 
Comedy Central's ratings improved significantly towards the end of the third quarter, and the network is up year-over-year in the fourth quarter so far. New leadership is reinvigorating the brand, and we are looking forward to a new season of Drunk History, the premiere of a new standup series produced by and starring Kevin Hart, and the Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe. And of course, Kyle, Cartman and the South Park Gang are back for a historic 20th season premiering next month. Their anniversary celebration was a hit at Comic Con. Their extraordinary longevity is a true testament to the creative excellence of Trey and Matt, the deep devotion of the show's fans and the outstanding team at Comedy Central. 
The BET awards also continued its strong run, ranking as the #1 cable award show among audiences 18 to 49 for the 2015-2016 broadcast season, claiming the top spot for the second consecutive year. Among African-American viewers, the program has ranked as television's #1 awards show for the last 15 years. 
Moving on to our international Media Networks. We continue to see a strong performance by Bob Bakish and his team, with both advertising and affiliate revenues increasing at double-digit levels, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Looking ahead, we remain intently focused on expanding and leveraging our diverse set of assets. We continue to diversify and strengthen our brand portfolio, reflecting demographic and market-specific opportunities. 10 years ago, when I became CEO, our international portfolio was singularly focused on youth. Today, our portfolio is radically different, with more breadth and depth, with a focus on the global 6: Nick, Nick Jr, MTV, Comedy Central, the Paramount Channel and SPIKE. In fact, the Paramount Channel, the largest ad-supported movie channel in the world, is now in 93 million homes outside the U.S. 
Our first major push beyond MTV was the Nickelodeon portfolio, which now reaches 283 million homes internationally. And we are now a major player in the adult demographic, which is significantly larger than our kids or youth segments. Comedy Central, our third global brand, is in 180 million homes outside the U.S. We now have 11 Paramount channels, the largest ad-supported international film channel in the world, built from scratch in just 4 short years. And we've begun the rollout of SPIKE, which is doing very well for us in the 3 markets we've launched. In just the past fiscal year alone, Viacom International Media Networks launched 15 new channels, with particular focus on the Middle East and Africa this past quarter. 
Of course, we also have 2 flagship local brands in the general entertainment space, Channel 5 in the U.K. and Colors in India, and both are operating extremely well. Again, 2 significant and highly promising businesses that did not exist at Viacom 10 years ago. 
In total, our channels now reach 3.8 billion aggregate subscribers, more than any other family of networks in the world. And looking ahead, there is very significant opportunity. 
The second priority is evolving from being simply an exporter of U.S. content to becoming a global content producer. We still bring a lot of high-performing domestic Viacom content overseas markets, particularly on the kid's side, but we are also increasing production of Viacom International Media Networks for our networks around the world. In fact, there are 7 in-house productions currently underway for Nickelodeon's global channels. 
Third, and perhaps most exciting for its obvious significance to our entire portfolio, we are redefining what it means to be a TV network. Across our international footprint, pay-TV penetration is approximately 40%, presenting us with attractive opportunities to exploit our digital products, including the Viacom Play Plex platform. Viacom Play Plex provides TV Everywhere functionality to cable customers, subscription services for mobile operators as well as direct-to-consumer opportunities. We've got the infrastructure, the brands, the content and the products to quickly scale the way we get content to consumers across 180 countries. 
Finally, Viacom International Media Networks is already generating significant revenues through consumer products, and we see a lot of potential in recreation, particularly retail, hotels and life experiences. These opportunities exist throughout our portfolio, but we are putting particular focus on Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. 
Now let's talk about Paramount. There is no question the studio has had a rough go at the box office recently. But as they always do, we expect fortunes to turn. As you know, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows did not meet our expectations. But there are significant bright spots at the studio. In particular, Paramount Television continues to grow rapidly, delivering new titles in the quarter, including Berlin Station for EPIX. Paramount Television will be a continuing source of growth, augmenting the revitalization of Paramount's theatrical slate. Again, it is worth noting that Paramount's television production is a business that also did not exist a few years ago. We made it a priority to return Paramount to the television production business. And we made it happen. 
In the current quarter, we have the critically acclaimed Star Trek Beyond, which is still opening across territories around the world in the next several weeks. Later in the quarter, Paramount will open Florence Foster Jenkins with Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant and Ben-Hur. And coming in the first quarter of 2017, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, starring Tom Cruise. 
Regarding our exploration of the sale of a 49% interest in Paramount to a strategic buyer, as we previously disclosed, we have narrowed the process down to a handful of prospects. The process has slowed down in recent weeks, but we have reason to believe the favorable court developments last week will create a better environment that will allow us to progress with several parties toward a highly beneficial transaction to present to our board. 
To conclude, we continue to focus on our strategic initiatives, and are confident that they will bear significant fruit as we prepare for our next fiscal year. The ratings at our domestic Media Networks are improving. Our successful upfront and continued leadership in data-driven products will allow us to take advantage of continued ratings improvements at key networks. Our distribution landscape will improve as we lap the fiscal 2016 consolidation impacts and SVOD comps, and we continue to grow and monetize new platforms. Our international networks group will continue to expand in scope and value. And Paramount will see better days ahead through improved film slate performance, television production, and we hope, a groundbreaking strategic alliance. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website. From a total company perspective, revenues grew 2",493,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website. 
From a total company perspective, revenues grew 2% to $3.1 billion. Adjusted operating income was $769 million, and adjusted net earnings were $419 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined to $1.05 in the quarter.
Now let's take a look at our segments results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 7%, and International revenues were up 13%. Excluding a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 18% reflecting double-digit growth in advertising affiliate and our [indiscernible] revenues.
Page 9 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. 
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 1% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 4% and in International our revenues were up 13%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 6 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 19%, driven by growth in Europe.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were down 8%. Domestic revenues declined 10% in the quarter, reflecting a difficult comparison with product made available under certain distribution agreements in the June quarter of last year.  Excluding a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues increased 12%, driven by the completion of certain distribution agreements. 
Expenses increased 11% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expenses were up 12% while distribution and other expenses decreased 8%. SG&A expense increased 13% in the quarter. The increase in programming costs was due to our continuing investment in original content. The increase in SG&A cost was principally due to higher advertising and promotional expense.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 22% for the quarter and the adjusted operating margin was 34.7%. The  decline in operating income was driven by the 3% decrease in revenues and the 11% increase in expenses.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were up 30% in the quarter principally due to increases in theatrical revenue and license fees. Page 12 of the web presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues increased to $91 million due to the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows in the quarter. License fees increased 39%, principally driven by the licensing of certain titles and subscription video-on-demand as well as contributions from our television production business. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $26 million in the quarter as compared to income of $48 million last year. The loss in the quarter reflects the underperformance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. 
In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting a 100 basis point increase as compared to the prior year. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt as well as factors impacting our September quarter of fiscal 2016 that haven't already been discussed. 
For the quarter, we generated $90 million of free cash flow, which compares to $300 million of free cash flow in the June quarter of last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to lower operating income and higher working capital utilization, which was due to net investment in film product. This was partially offset by lower cash taxes. 
In terms of our debt, it remains principally fixed-rate, with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. During the quarter, we repaid $368 million of our outstanding 6.25% senior notes that became due in April. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $192 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.6x. 
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenue, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. For fiscal year 2016, we expect domestic affiliate revenues to decline at low to mid-single-digit rate. However, due to continuing uncertainty around the timing of completion of an SVOD distribution agreement, affiliate revenues could decline at mid- to high single-digit rates. For the full year, we expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the low to mid-single digits. And at Paramount, given the underperformance of certain films in the current year's slate, we expect to generate an operating loss for the September quarter as well as for the full fiscal year. 
In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.8%. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to your questions. Operator?"

Our brands are what drive our business. So to some extent, probably the biggest impact has been on the ability to move forward rapidly on the Paramount transaction, which had initially been targeted to result in an agreement about a month ago. So that's certainly been slowed down. But as I indicated in my prepared remarks, they continue. And I hope that we will reach a conclusion on that, that will be beneficial to the company in due course. So that's really the principal impact, apart from the general distraction naturally. But it does not deter us from pursuing our international growth; does not deter us from getting affiliate agreements concluded; does not deter us from producing great new programming; does not deter our management teams across our networks to be really focused on building our ratings; did not deter us in getting a successful upfront; did not deter us in developing continued industry-leading marketing products; did not deter us from finding new ways to distribute our content to our audiences everywhere they are, on every device they utilize; and does not deter us from continually entering into new partnerships with companies like Roku, Snapchat and comScore and on and on. So we're focused. We are driving value for this company. And we view any difficulties that we face as a challenge that we will overcome. We'll be creative and overcoming, and really search for every opportunity. I touched on some opportunities that will take a while to unfold. But they're pretty exciting. When you think about the power of the Nickelodeon brand, the fact that we have ratings success for so many new shows -- yet, people used to talk about our being so dependent on SpongeBob, but now we have such an array of shows. And each of those shows has consumer products opportunity around the world, particularly as we have grown our Nickelodeon footprint. And speaking of SpongeBob, this musical is really great now. When it hits Broadway, it could be an opportunity, not just inherently, but to revitalize that property. So the opportunities are manyfold. We have a strong management team. As you know, over the last 1.5 years, we have reorganized significantly. We have new leadership at several of our networks. You're seeing the effects already that the new leadership is bringing, VH1 being the perfect example that I cited. So yes, it's a distraction. But in the scope of time, it will be viewed as temporary. And our strategic initiatives continue unabated."

But when you have in the U.K., we bought Channel 5, very attractive acquisition. We revitalized the brand. I mean, literally, we changed the brand logo, and we have invested in programming. And we have a leading position there. It's gained share. We've also looked to build scale in other countries. And it's paying off. So we are -- we have really been building a platform the last several years, which is really now coming to maturity. We just have a lot of opportunities to expand there. We are focused on building value. I've said it over and over again. And in India, which is not a consolidated entity, continues to grow at extraordinary rates. We continue to grow at extraordinary rates year after year for years to come. We continue to add networks there. It's a network -- it's a country with a lot of opportunity, a large population, fastest economic growth rate in the world today, the top growing economy in the world with a population that just loves entertainment. So our sector is growing much faster than GDP. So I believe, I talked about the last 10 years and how it's grown to this point, I believe over the next 10 years our international assets are going to have a value that potentially surpasses the entire value of the company today on the trajectory that we have."

And so, with the average rate increases, we have good rate increase across our portfolio with no significant renewals coming up in '17. So we've got a pretty good lock there. We think there's a potential for stabilization of traditional distributors, subscriber count, given that there are some benefits in terms of maintaining distribution stickiness, which we've seen from the larger, more adept entities that have resulted. And in new distribution opportunities that we have are incremental, whether it's a sling, a better penetration of platforms like Sony Vue and the many other opportunities that are there.

Welcome to Viacom's third quarter earnings call. As you know, since our last call, we have been subject to controversy relating to governance, which has obviously created an overhang for our company. Last week,",2394,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Viacom's third quarter earnings call. As you know, since our last call, we have been subject to controversy relating to governance, which has obviously created an overhang for our company. Last week, courts in Massachusetts and Delaware rejected motions to dismiss, allowed discovery to proceed and scheduled trials to take place in October. We view these favorable court rulings as positive steps that move us ahead to a resolution. In light of the litigation, we won't be able to comment further on this topic during today's call. 
Meanwhile, Viacom continues to focus on making progress against our strategic plan. We are increasing our investments in more and more original content across multiple platforms, extending our lead in sophisticated data products, building engaging new consumer experiences through innovative, thoughtful distribution partnerships as well as new consumer products, recreation and hospitality initiatives, expanding our formidable international presence and forging new strategic paths, including a potential partnership to unlock the value of Paramount and provide competitive advantages for the studio and Viacom overall. These initiatives are the most recent manifestation of a careful, comprehensive and consistent vision for Viacom that we have pursued, since I became CEO in 2006, to focus on original content, enhance our distribution revenues and build a robust international business while adapting to change. That job is never done, nor is it easy. There are disruptive challenges in our industry, particularly for those companies like Viacom that focus on younger demographics, but we are having increasing success at several of our brands and we are leveraging those learnings to accelerate that success at other properties. 
Wade and Tom will go into the numbers in a moment. First, let me review some of the drivers of our results for the quarter and what lies ahead. In ad sales, we concluded a strong upfront. More advertisers committed early instead of waiting for the scatter market later when inventory is scarce. This movement and ratings progress at core networks as well as our new advertising products resulted in mid to high single-digit price and volume increases. Our end-to-end, data-driven marketing solutions continue to help us lead the way in advanced advertising. And our proprietary, predictive engine, Vantage, is in even more demand by sophisticated marketing partners. We expected to triple the number of Vantage deals from last year to this year and we exceeded that goal. In this upfront, we will secure 35 to 40 Vantage deals with our partners. Significantly, more than half are based on comScore metrics, signaling a welcome market shift to alternative currencies. 
In addition, we held the industry's first-ever data front, where we showcased our data capabilities and announced Vantage Intent, powered by long-time partner, American Express. This exclusive, unprecedented collaboration resulted in the first product to tap American Express's unique data using predictive analytics to help marketers reach consumers even earlier in their purchase consideration process. 
These are all powerful examples of how we have transformed our company over the last several years. 
On the affiliate side, in the third quarter, we signed long-term deals with both DISH and Cox, both with solid annual rate increases. The decline in affiliate revenues was impacted by several factors, including the lapping of a large SVOD deal last year. As we disclosed in June, we expected to complete a significant SVOD agreement in the third quarter of this year, but recent uncertainty, coupled with our evaluation of various new distribution opportunities, has led to a slowdown of these discussions. 
As we have discussed, despite the continuing impact of changing audience behaviors and preferences, I am pleased to say that in the June quarter, we've stabilized our ratings and several of our networks are leading the industry in their categories. Viacom holds 6 of the top 30 ad-supported cable networks. And our family of networks captures the most share in nearly every demo, 2 plus, 2 to 11, 2 to 49, and most importantly, 18 to 49 and 18 to 34. And through the 5 weeks of the fourth quarter, our revenue weighted ratings are up. Among viewers 2-plus, in the third quarter, VH1 delivered the biggest ratings gain of any of the 30 largest non-U.S. cable networks and Nick Jr. had the largest year-over-year ratings increase of any rated network. And we're also seeing strong traction across platforms. Viewership on our mobile apps is up 26% over the third quarter of last year. 
Nickelodeon story is a highlight, and a perfect example of our strategy across the company to broaden our revenue base and drive audience engagement. Nickelodeon's ratings increased 6% in the quarter, and it extended its #1 ranking among kids 2 to 11 to 52 straight weeks, increasing an already substantial lead to over 20% over our biggest competitor in the quarter in that demo. And the best news is that, much of Nickelodeon's success is driven by a broad lineup of popular programming that is new and fresh from a variety of genres, including animation, live-action and preschool. Leading the way is Henry Danger, which is the quarter's #1 show among kids 2 to 11 and 6 to 11, averaging 2.4 million total viewers per episode. Nick's newest animated series, the Loud House, has become a runaway hit and is averaging almost 2 million viewers per episode. In the current quarter, Kids Choice Sports outpaced last year's strong performance, up double digits, and like all of Nickelodeon's tentpole events, continues to be an extremely attractive opportunity for advertisers. On digital platforms, Nick continues to see strong year-over-year growth in video viewing, up almost 20% for the quarter across Nick and Nick Jr. sites and apps. 
Moving into the consumer products world. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Blaze and the Monster Machines, PAW Patrol and Shimmer and Shine are all strong consumer success stories, with outstanding growth potential. Additionally, our recreation and hospitality efforts continue to come online. Finally, the SpongeBob Musical has opened in Chicago to very positive critical buzz. We're looking forward to bringing it to New York next fiscal year. This is the new Nickelodeon, that Cyma Zarghami, and her talented creative team have been building, and we couldn't be more excited or proud of the great turnaround they have engineered fueled by strategic insights, continued investment and unwavering faith in their capabilities. There is no kid's brand with more magic than Nickelodeon right now, and we believe that their broad portfolio of legitimate hits will drive significant diversified growth for years to come. 
VH1 is also a great story and a blueprint of our investment in great content, acceleration of the development process and smart use of data can drive improved performance. VH1 expanded its ratings gain in Q3, finishing up 33%. That's right. 33%, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. VH1 is making aggressive investments in distinctive programming and drilling in on what VH1 fans want. Love & Hip Hop Atlanta continues to be a juggernaut and ranked as the #1 reality show in cable. In fact, VH1 has 2 of the top 5 reality cable shows. Hip Hop Honors, which aired in July, was the highest-rated VH1 tentpole in 15 years, with over 3 million viewers. We're building on these proven properties in the current quarter with Love & Hip Hop Hollywood and the new Amber Rose Show, which we took straight to air and are developing in real-time using sophisticated applications of audience science. In addition, our marketing and scheduling teams at VH1 are applying proprietary learnings from Viacom's data insight capabilities to drive additional viewership and engagement, helping our hit shows gain even more audience traction. VH1 is leading the charge, and we are exploring ways that these strategies can be applied seamlessly to our other adult networks. 
Comedy Central's ratings improved significantly towards the end of the third quarter, and the network is up year-over-year in the fourth quarter so far. New leadership is reinvigorating the brand, and we are looking forward to a new season of Drunk History, the premiere of a new standup series produced by and starring Kevin Hart, and the Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe. And of course, Kyle, Cartman and the South Park Gang are back for a historic 20th season premiering next month. Their anniversary celebration was a hit at Comic Con. Their extraordinary longevity is a true testament to the creative excellence of Trey and Matt, the deep devotion of the show's fans and the outstanding team at Comedy Central. 
The BET awards also continued its strong run, ranking as the #1 cable award show among audiences 18 to 49 for the 2015-2016 broadcast season, claiming the top spot for the second consecutive year. Among African-American viewers, the program has ranked as television's #1 awards show for the last 15 years. 
Moving on to our international Media Networks. We continue to see a strong performance by Bob Bakish and his team, with both advertising and affiliate revenues increasing at double-digit levels, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Looking ahead, we remain intently focused on expanding and leveraging our diverse set of assets. We continue to diversify and strengthen our brand portfolio, reflecting demographic and market-specific opportunities. 10 years ago, when I became CEO, our international portfolio was singularly focused on youth. Today, our portfolio is radically different, with more breadth and depth, with a focus on the global 6: Nick, Nick Jr, MTV, Comedy Central, the Paramount Channel and SPIKE. In fact, the Paramount Channel, the largest ad-supported movie channel in the world, is now in 93 million homes outside the U.S. 
Our first major push beyond MTV was the Nickelodeon portfolio, which now reaches 283 million homes internationally. And we are now a major player in the adult demographic, which is significantly larger than our kids or youth segments. Comedy Central, our third global brand, is in 180 million homes outside the U.S. We now have 11 Paramount channels, the largest ad-supported international film channel in the world, built from scratch in just 4 short years. And we've begun the rollout of SPIKE, which is doing very well for us in the 3 markets we've launched. In just the past fiscal year alone, Viacom International Media Networks launched 15 new channels, with particular focus on the Middle East and Africa this past quarter. 
Of course, we also have 2 flagship local brands in the general entertainment space, Channel 5 in the U.K. and Colors in India, and both are operating extremely well. Again, 2 significant and highly promising businesses that did not exist at Viacom 10 years ago. 
In total, our channels now reach 3.8 billion aggregate subscribers, more than any other family of networks in the world. And looking ahead, there is very significant opportunity. 
The second priority is evolving from being simply an exporter of U.S. content to becoming a global content producer. We still bring a lot of high-performing domestic Viacom content to overseas markets, particularly on the kid's side, but we are also increasing production of Viacom International Media Networks for our networks around the world. In fact, there are 7 in-house productions currently underway for Nickelodeon's global channels. 
Third, and perhaps most exciting for its obvious significance to our entire portfolio, we are redefining what it means to be a TV network. Across our international footprint, pay-TV penetration is approximately 40%, presenting us with attractive opportunities to exploit our digital products, including the Viacom Play Plex platform. Viacom Play Plex provides TV Everywhere functionality to cable customers, subscription services for mobile operators as well as direct-to-consumer opportunities. We've got the infrastructure, the brands, the content and the products to quickly scale the way we get content to consumers across 180 countries. 
Finally, Viacom International Media Networks is already generating significant revenues through consumer products, and we see a lot of potential in recreation, particularly retail, hotels and live experiences. These opportunities exist throughout our portfolio, but we are putting particular focus on Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. 
Now let's talk about Paramount. There is no question the studio has had a rough go at the box office recently. But as they always do, we expect fortunes to turn. As you know, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows did not meet our expectations. But there are significant bright spots at the studio. In particular, Paramount Television continues to grow rapidly, delivering new titles in the quarter, including Berlin Station for EPIX. Paramount Television will be a continuing source of growth, augmenting the revitalization of Paramount's theatrical slate. Again, it is worth noting that Paramount's television production is a business that also did not exist a few years ago. We made it a priority to return Paramount to the television production business. And we made it happen. 
In the current quarter, we have the critically acclaimed Star Trek Beyond, which is still opening across territories around the world in the next several weeks. Later in the quarter, Paramount will open Florence Foster Jenkins with Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant and Ben-Hur. And coming in the first quarter of 2017, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, starring Tom Cruise. 
Regarding our exploration of the sale of a 49% interest in Paramount to a strategic buyer, as we previously disclosed, we have narrowed the process down to a handful of prospects. The process has slowed down in recent weeks, but we have reason to believe the favorable court developments last week will create a better environment that will allow us to progress with several parties toward a highly beneficial transaction to present to our board. 
To conclude, we continue to focus on our strategic initiatives, and are confident that they will bear significant fruit as we prepare for our next fiscal year. The ratings at our domestic Media Networks are improving. Our successful upfront and continued leadership in data-driven products will allow us to take advantage of continued ratings improvements at key networks. Our distribution landscape will improve as we lap the fiscal 2016 consolidation impacts and SVOD comps, and we continue to grow and monetize new platforms. Our international networks group will continue to expand in scope and value. And Paramount will see better days ahead through improved film slate performance, television production, and we hope, a groundbreaking strategic alliance. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Wade."

From a total company perspective, revenues grew 2",493,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website. 
From a total company perspective, revenues grew 2% to $3.1 billion. Adjusted operating income was $769 million, and adjusted net earnings were $419 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined to $1.05 in the quarter.
Now let's take a look at our segments results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 7%, and International revenues were up 13%. Excluding a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 18% reflecting double-digit growth in advertising affiliate and our [indiscernible] revenues.
Page 9 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. 
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 1% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 4% and in International our revenues were up 13%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 6 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 19%, driven by growth in Europe.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were down 8%. Domestic revenues declined 10% in the quarter, reflecting a difficult comparison with product made available under certain distribution agreements in the June quarter of last year.  Excluding a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues increased 12%, driven by the completion of certain distribution agreements. 
Expenses increased 11% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expenses were up 12% while distribution and other expenses decreased 8%. SG&A expense increased 13% in the quarter. The increase in programming costs was due to our continuing investment in original content. The increase in SG&A cost was principally due to higher advertising and promotional expense.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 22% for the quarter and the adjusted operating margin was 34.7%. The  decline in operating income was driven by the 3% decrease in revenues and the 11% increase in expenses.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were up 30% in the quarter principally due to increases in theatrical revenue and license fees. Page 12 of the web presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues increased to $91 million due to the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows in the quarter. License fees increased 39%, principally driven by the licensing of certain titles and subscription video-on-demand as well as contributions from our television production business. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $26 million in the quarter as compared to income of $48 million last year. The loss in the quarter reflects the underperformance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. 
In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting a 100 basis point increase as compared to the prior year. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."
25403751,364908930,1025068,"Viacom, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Wade. I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt as well as factors impacting our September quarter of fiscal 2016 that haven't already been discussed. For the quarter, we generated $90 million of free cash flow, which compares to $300 million o",342,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt as well as factors impacting our September quarter of fiscal 2016 that haven't already been discussed. 
For the quarter, we generated $90 million of free cash flow, which compares to $300 million of free cash flow in the June quarter of last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to lower operating income and higher working capital utilization, which was due to net investment in film product. This was partially offset by lower cash taxes. 
In terms of our debt, it remains principally fixed-rate, with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. During the quarter, we repaid $368 million of our outstanding 6.25% senior notes that came due in April. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $192 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.6x. 
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenue, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. For fiscal year 2016, we expect domestic affiliate revenues to decline at low to mid-single-digit rates. However, due to continuing uncertainty around the timing of completion of an SVOD distribution agreement, affiliate revenues could decline at mid- to high single-digit rates. For the full year, we expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the low to mid-single digits. And at Paramount, given the underperformance of certain films in the current year's slate, we expect to generate an operating loss for the September quarter as well as for the full fiscal year. 
In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.8%. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to your questions. Operator?"

Our brands are what drive our business. So to some extent, probably the biggest impact has been on the ability to move forward rapidly on the Paramount transaction, which had initially been targeted to result in an agreement about a month ago. So that's certainly been slowed down. But as I indicated in my prepared remarks, they continue. And I hope that we will reach a conclusion on that, that will be beneficial to the company in due course. So that's really the principal impact, apart from the general distraction naturally. But it does not deter us from pursuing our international growth; does not deter us from getting affiliate agreements concluded; does not deter us from producing great new programming; does not deter our management teams across our networks to be really focused on building our ratings; did not deter us in getting a successful upfront; did not deter us in developing continued industry-leading marketing products; did not deter us from finding new ways to distribute our content to our audiences everywhere they are, on every device they utilize; and does not deter us from continually entering into new partnerships with companies like Roku, Snapchat and comScore and on and on. So we're focused. We are driving value for this company. And we view any difficulties that we face as a challenge that we will overcome. We'll be creative and overcoming, and really search for every opportunity. I touched on some opportunities that will take a while to unfold. But they're pretty exciting. When you think about the power of the Nickelodeon brand, the fact that we have ratings success for so many new shows -- yet, people used to talk about our being so dependent on SpongeBob, but now we have such an array of shows. And each of those shows has consumer products opportunity around the world, particularly as we have grown our Nickelodeon footprint. And speaking of SpongeBob, this musical is really great now. When it hits Broadway, it could be an opportunity, not just inherently, but to revitalize that property. So the opportunities are manyfold. We have a strong management team. As you know, over the last 1.5 years, we have reorganized significantly. We have new leadership at several of our networks. You're seeing the effects already that the new leadership is bringing, VH1 being the perfect example that I cited. So yes, it's a distraction. But in the scope of time, it will be viewed as temporary. And our strategic initiatives continue unabated."

But when you have in the U.K.-- we bought Channel 5, very attractive acquisition. We revitalized the brand. I mean, literally, we changed the brand logo, and we have invested in programming. And we have a leading position there. It's gained share. We've also looked to build scale in other countries. And it's paying off. So we are -- we have really been building a platform the last several years, which is really now coming to maturity. We still have a lot of opportunity to expand there. We are focused on building value. I've said it over and over again. And in India, which is not even a consolidated entity, continues to grow at extraordinary rates. We'll continue to grow at extraordinary rates year after year for years to come. We continue to add networks there. It's a network -- it's a country with a lot of opportunity, a large population, fastest economic growth rate in the world today, the top growing economy in the world with a population that just loves entertainment. So our sector is growing much faster than GDP. So I believe, I talked about the last 10 years and how it's grown to this point, I believe over the next 10 years our international assets are going to have a value that potentially surpasses the entire value of the company today on the trajectory that we have."

And so, with the average rate increases, we have good rate increase across our portfolio with no significant renewals coming up in '17. So we've got a pretty good lock there. We think there's the potential for stabilization of traditional distributors, subscriber counts, given that there are some benefits in terms of maintaining distribution stickiness, which we've seen from the larger, more adept entities that have resulted. And in new distribution opportunities that we have are incremental, whether it's a sling, a better penetration of platforms like Sony Vue and the many other opportunities that are there.

Welcome to Viacom's third quarter earnings call. As you know, since our last call, we have been subject to controversy relating to governance, which has obviously created an overhang for our company. Last week,",2394,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Viacom's third quarter earnings call. As you know, since our last call, we have been subject to controversy relating to governance, which has obviously created an overhang for our company. Last week, courts in Massachusetts and Delaware rejected motions to dismiss, allowed discovery to proceed and scheduled trials to take place in October. We view these favorable court rulings as positive steps that move us ahead to a resolution. In light of the litigation, we won't be able to comment further on this topic during today's call. 
Meanwhile, Viacom continues to focus on making progress against our strategic plan. We are increasing our investments in more and more original content across multiple platforms, extending our lead in sophisticated data products, building engaging new consumer experiences through innovative, thoughtful distribution partnerships as well as new consumer products, recreation and hospitality initiatives, expanding our formidable international presence and forging new strategic paths, including a potential partnership to unlock the value of Paramount and provide competitive advantages for the studio and Viacom overall. These initiatives are the most recent manifestation of a careful, comprehensive and consistent vision for Viacom that we have pursued, since I became CEO in 2006, to focus on original content, enhance our distribution revenues and build a robust international business while adapting to change. That job is never done, nor is it easy. There are disruptive challenges in our industry, particularly for those companies like Viacom that focus on younger demographics, but we are having increasing success at several of our brands and we are leveraging those learnings to accelerate that success at other properties. 
Wade and Tom will go into the numbers in a moment. First, let me review some of the drivers of our results for the quarter and what lies ahead. In ad sales, we concluded a strong upfront. More advertisers committed early instead of waiting for the scatter market later when inventory is scarce. This movement and ratings progress at core networks as well as our new advertising products resulted in mid to high single-digit price and volume increases. Our end-to-end, data-driven marketing solutions continue to help us lead the way in advanced advertising. And our proprietary, predictive engine, Vantage, is in even more demand by sophisticated marketing partners. We expected to triple the number of Vantage deals from last year to this year and we exceeded that goal. In this upfront, we will secure 35 to 40 Vantage deals with our partners. Significantly, more than half are based on comScore metrics, signaling a welcome market shift to alternative currencies. 
In addition, we held the industry's first-ever data front, where we showcased our data capabilities and announced Vantage Intent, powered by long-time partner, American Express. This exclusive, unprecedented collaboration resulted in the first product to tap American Express's unique data using predictive analytics to help marketers reach consumers even earlier in their purchase consideration process. 
These are all powerful examples of how we have transformed our company over the last several years. 
On the affiliate side, in the third quarter, we signed long-term deals with both DISH and Cox, both with solid annual rate increases. The decline in affiliate revenues was impacted by several factors, including the lapping of a large SVOD deal last year. As we disclosed in June, we expected to complete a significant SVOD agreement in the third quarter of this year, but recent uncertainty, coupled with our evaluation of various new distribution opportunities, has led to a slowdown of these discussions. 
As we have discussed, despite the continuing impact of changing audience behaviors and preferences, I am pleased to say that in the June quarter, we've stabilized our ratings and several of our networks are leading the industry in their categories. Viacom holds 6 of the top 30 ad-supported cable networks. And our family of networks captures the most share in nearly every demo, 2 plus, 2 to 11, 2 to 49, and most importantly, 18 to 49 and 18 to 34. And through the 5 weeks of the fourth quarter, our revenue weighted ratings are up. Among viewers 2-plus, in the third quarter, VH1 delivered the biggest ratings gain of any of the 30 largest non-U.S. cable networks and Nick Jr. had the largest year-over-year ratings increase of any rated network. And we're also seeing strong traction across platforms. Viewership on our mobile apps is up 26% over the third quarter of last year. 
Nickelodeon story is a highlight, and a perfect example of our strategy across the company to broaden our revenue base and drive audience engagement. Nickelodeon's ratings increased 6% in the quarter, and it extended its #1 ranking among kids 2 to 11 to 52 straight weeks, increasing an already substantial lead to over 20% over our biggest competitor in the quarter in that demo. And the best news is that, much of Nickelodeon's success is driven by a broad lineup of popular programming that is new and fresh from a variety of genres, including animation, live-action and preschool. Leading the way is Henry Danger, which is the quarter's #1 show among kids 2 to 11 and 6 to 11, averaging 2.4 million total viewers per episode. Nick's newest animated series, the Loud House, has become a runaway hit and is averaging almost 2 million viewers per episode. In the current quarter, Kids Choice Sports outpaced last year's strong performance, up double digits, and like all of Nickelodeon's tentpole events, continues to be an extremely attractive opportunity for advertisers. On digital platforms, Nick continues to see strong year-over-year growth in video viewing, up almost 20% for the quarter across Nick and Nick Jr. sites and apps. 
Moving into the consumer products world. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Blaze and the Monster Machines, PAW Patrol and Shimmer and Shine are all strong consumer success stories, with outstanding growth potential. Additionally, our recreation and hospitality efforts continue to come online. Finally, the SpongeBob Musical has opened in Chicago to very positive critical buzz. We're looking forward to bringing it to New York next fiscal year. This is the new Nickelodeon, that Cyma Zarghami, and her talented creative team have been building, and we couldn't be more excited or proud of the great turnaround they have engineered fueled by strategic insights, continued investment and unwavering faith in their capabilities. There is no kid's brand with more magic than Nickelodeon right now, and we believe that their broad portfolio of legitimate hits will drive significant diversified growth for years to come. 
VH1 is also a great story and a blueprint of our investment in great content, acceleration of the development process and smart use of data can drive improved performance. VH1 expanded its ratings gain in Q3, finishing up 33%. That's right. 33%, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. VH1 is making aggressive investments in distinctive programming and drilling in on what VH1 fans want. Love & Hip Hop Atlanta continues to be a juggernaut and ranked as the #1 reality show in cable. In fact, VH1 has 2 of the top 5 reality cable shows. Hip Hop Honors, which aired in July, was the highest-rated VH1 tentpole in 15 years, with over 3 million viewers. We're building on these proven properties in the current quarter with Love & Hip Hop Hollywood and the new Amber Rose Show, which we took straight to air and are developing in real-time using sophisticated applications of audience science. In addition, our marketing and scheduling teams at VH1 are applying proprietary learnings from Viacom's data insight capabilities to drive additional viewership and engagement, helping our hit shows gain even more audience traction. VH1 is leading the charge, and we are exploring ways that these strategies can be applied seamlessly to our other adult networks. 
Comedy Central's ratings improved significantly towards the end of the third quarter, and the network is up year-over-year in the fourth quarter so far. New leadership is reinvigorating the brand, and we are looking forward to a new season of Drunk History, the premiere of a new standup series produced by and starring Kevin Hart, and the Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe. And of course, Kyle, Cartman and the South Park Gang are back for a historic 20th season premiering next month. Their anniversary celebration was a hit at Comic Con. Their extraordinary longevity is a true testament to the creative excellence of Trey and Matt, the deep devotion of the show's fans and the outstanding team at Comedy Central. 
The BET awards also continued its strong run, ranking as the #1 cable award show among audiences 18 to 49 for the 2015-2016 broadcast season, claiming the top spot for the second consecutive year. Among African-American viewers, the program has ranked as television's #1 awards show for the last 15 years. 
Moving on to our international Media Networks. We continue to see a strong performance by Bob Bakish and his team, with both advertising and affiliate revenues increasing at double-digit levels, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Looking ahead, we remain intently focused on expanding and leveraging our diverse set of assets. We continue to diversify and strengthen our brand portfolio, reflecting demographic and market-specific opportunities. 10 years ago, when I became CEO, our international portfolio was singularly focused on youth. Today, our portfolio is radically different, with more breadth and depth, with a focus on the global 6: Nick, Nick Jr, MTV, Comedy Central, the Paramount Channel and SPIKE. In fact, the Paramount Channel, the largest ad-supported movie channel in the world, is now in 93 million homes outside the U.S. 
Our first major push beyond MTV was the Nickelodeon portfolio, which now reaches 283 million homes internationally. And we are now a major player in the adult demographic, which is significantly larger than our kids or youth segments. Comedy Central, our third global brand, is in 180 million homes outside the U.S. We now have 11 Paramount channels, the largest ad-supported international film channel in the world, built from scratch in just 4 short years. And we've begun the rollout of SPIKE, which is doing very well for us in the 3 markets we've launched. In just the past fiscal year alone, Viacom International Media Networks launched 15 new channels, with particular focus on the Middle East and Africa this past quarter. 
Of course, we also have 2 flagship local brands in the general entertainment space, Channel 5 in the U.K. and Colors in India, and both are operating extremely well. Again, 2 significant and highly promising businesses that did not exist at Viacom 10 years ago. 
In total, our channels now reach 3.8 billion aggregate subscribers, more than any other family of networks in the world. And looking ahead, there is very significant opportunity. 
The second priority is evolving from being simply an exporter of U.S. content to becoming a global content producer. We still bring a lot of high-performing domestic Viacom content to overseas markets, particularly on the kid's side, but we are also increasing production of Viacom International Media Networks for our networks around the world. In fact, there are 7 in-house productions currently underway for Nickelodeon's global channels. 
Third, and perhaps most exciting for its obvious significance to our entire portfolio, we are redefining what it means to be a TV network. Across our international footprint, pay-TV penetration is approximately 40%, presenting us with attractive opportunities to exploit our digital products, including the Viacom Play Plex platform. Viacom Play Plex provides TV Everywhere functionality to cable customers, subscription services for mobile operators as well as direct-to-consumer opportunities. We've got the infrastructure, the brands, the content and the products to quickly scale the way we get content to consumers across 180 countries. 
Finally, Viacom International Media Networks is already generating significant revenues through consumer products, and we see a lot of potential in recreation, particularly retail, hotels and live experiences. These opportunities exist throughout our portfolio, but we are putting particular focus on Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. 
Now let's talk about Paramount. There is no question the studio has had a rough go at the box office recently. But as they always do, we expect fortunes to turn. As you know, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows did not meet our expectations. But there are significant bright spots at the studio. In particular, Paramount Television continues to grow rapidly, delivering new titles in the quarter, including Berlin Station for EPIX. Paramount Television will be a continuing source of growth, augmenting the revitalization of Paramount's theatrical slate. Again, it is worth noting that Paramount's television production is a business that also did not exist a few years ago. We made it a priority to return Paramount to the television production business. And we made it happen. 
In the current quarter, we have the critically acclaimed Star Trek Beyond, which is still opening across territories around the world in the next several weeks. Later in the quarter, Paramount will open Florence Foster Jenkins with Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant and Ben-Hur. And coming in the first quarter of 2017, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, starring Tom Cruise. 
Regarding our exploration of the sale of a 49% interest in Paramount to a strategic buyer, as we previously disclosed, we have narrowed the process down to a handful of prospects. The process has slowed down in recent weeks, but we have reason to believe the favorable court developments last week will create a better environment that will allow us to progress with several parties toward a highly beneficial transaction to present to our board. 
To conclude, we continue to focus on our strategic initiatives, and are confident that they will bear significant fruit as we prepare for our next fiscal year. The ratings at our domestic Media Networks are improving. Our successful upfront and continued leadership in data-driven products will allow us to take advantage of continued ratings improvements at key networks. Our distribution landscape will improve as we lap the fiscal 2016 consolidation impacts and SVOD comps, and we continue to grow and monetize new platforms. Our international networks group will continue to expand in scope and value. And Paramount will see better days ahead through improved film slate performance, television production, and we hope, a groundbreaking strategic alliance. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website. From a total company perspective, revenues grew 2",493,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website. 
From a total company perspective, revenues grew 2% to $3.1 billion. Adjusted operating income was $769 million, and adjusted net earnings were $419 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined to $1.05 in the quarter.
Now let's take a look at our segments results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 7%, and International revenues were up 13%. Excluding a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 18% reflecting double-digit growth in advertising affiliate and our [indiscernible] revenues.
Page 9 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. 
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 1% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 4% and in International our revenues were up 13%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 6 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 19%, driven by growth in Europe.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were down 8%. Domestic revenues declined 10% in the quarter, reflecting a difficult comparison with product made available under certain distribution agreements in the June quarter of last year.  Excluding a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues increased 12%, driven by the completion of certain distribution agreements. 
Expenses increased 11% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expenses were up 12% while distribution and other expenses decreased 8%. SG&A expense increased 13% in the quarter. The increase in programming costs was due to our continuing investment in original content. The increase in SG&A cost was principally due to higher advertising and promotional expense.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 22% for the quarter and the adjusted operating margin was 34.7%. The  decline in operating income was driven by the 3% decrease in revenues and the 11% increase in expenses.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were up 30% in the quarter principally due to increases in theatrical revenue and license fees. Page 12 of the web presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues increased to $91 million due to the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows in the quarter. License fees increased 39%, principally driven by the licensing of certain titles and subscription video-on-demand as well as contributions from our television production business. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $26 million in the quarter as compared to income of $48 million last year. The loss in the quarter reflects the underperformance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. 
In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting a 100 basis point increase as compared to the prior year. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."
25403751,364908930,1026156,"Viacom, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Wade.

I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt as well as factors impacting our September quarter of fiscal 2016 that haven't already been discussed. 
For the quarter, we generated $90 million of free cash flow, which compares to $300 million of free cash flow in the June quarter of last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to lower operating income and higher working capital utilization, which was due to net investment in film product. This was partially offset by lower cash taxes. 
In terms of our debt, it remains principally fixed-rate, with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. During the quarter, we repaid $368 million of our outstanding 6.25% senior notes that came due in April. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $192 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.6x. 
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenue, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. For fiscal year 2016, we expect domestic affiliate revenues to decline at low to mid-single-digit rates. However, due to continuing uncertainty around the timing of completion of an SVOD distribution agreement, affiliate revenues could decline at mid- to high single-digit rates. For the full year, we expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the low to mid-single digits. And at Paramount, given the underperformance of certain films in the current year's slate, we expect to generate an operating loss for the September quarter as well as for the full fiscal year. 
In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.8%.

Our brands are what drive our business. So to some extent, probably the biggest impact has been on the ability to move forward rapidly on the Paramount transaction, which had initially been targeted to result in an agreement about a month ago. So that's certainly been slowed down. But as I indicated in my prepared remarks, they continue. And I hope that we will reach a conclusion on that, that will be beneficial to the company in due course. So that's really the principal impact, apart from the general distraction naturally. But it does not deter us from pursuing our international growth; does not deter us from getting affiliate agreements concluded; does not deter us from producing great new programming; does not deter our management teams across our networks to be really focused on building our ratings; did not deter us in getting a successful upfront; did not deter us in developing continued industry-leading marketing products; did not deter us from finding new ways to distribute our content to our audiences everywhere they are, on every device they utilize; and does not deter us from continually entering into new partnerships with companies like Roku, Snapchat and comScore and on and on. So we're focused. We are driving value for this company. And we view any difficulties that we face as a challenge that we will overcome. We'll be creative and overcoming, and really search for every opportunity. I touched on some opportunities that will take a while to unfold. But they're pretty exciting. When you think about the power of the Nickelodeon brand, the fact that we have ratings success for so many new shows -- yet, people used to talk about our being so dependent on SpongeBob, but now we have such an array of shows. And each of those shows has consumer products opportunity around the world, particularly as we have grown our Nickelodeon footprint. And speaking of SpongeBob, this musical is really great now. When it hits Broadway, it could be an opportunity, not just inherently, but to revitalize that property. So the opportunities are manyfold. We have a strong management team. As you know, over the last 1.5 years, we have reorganized significantly. We have new leadership at several of our networks. You're seeing the effects already that the new leadership is bringing, VH1 being the perfect example that I cited. So yes, it's a distraction. But in the scope of time, it will be viewed as temporary. And our strategic initiatives continue unabated."

But when you have in the U.K.-- we bought Channel 5, very attractive acquisition. We revitalized the brand. I mean, literally, we changed the brand logo, and we have invested in programming. And we have a leading position there. It's gained share. We've also looked to build scale in other countries. And it's paying off. So we are -- we have really been building a platform the last several years, which is really now coming to maturity. We still have a lot of opportunity to expand there. We are focused on building value. I've said it over and over again. And in India, which is not even a consolidated entity, continues to grow at extraordinary rates. We'll continue to grow at extraordinary rates year after year for years to come. We continue to add networks there. It's a network -- it's a country with a lot of opportunity, a large population, fastest economic growth rate in the world today, the top growing economy in the world with a population that just loves entertainment. So our sector is growing much faster than GDP. So I believe, I talked about the last 10 years and how it's grown to this point, I believe over the next 10 years our international assets are going to have a value that potentially surpasses the entire value of the company today on the trajectory that we have."

We think there's the potential for stabilization of traditional distributors, subscriber counts, given that there are some benefits in terms of maintaining distribution stickiness, which we've seen from the larger, more adept entities that have resulted. And in new distribution opportunities that we have are incremental, whether it's a sling, a better penetration of platforms like Sony Vue and the many other opportunities that are there.

We've got a lot to cover today. And along with Wade, I am pleased to welcome Kern Schireson, who will provide an overview and update on our industry-leading data strategy.

And along with Wade, I am pleased to welcome Kern Schireson, who will provide an overview and update on our industry-leading data strategy. Kern has worked at Viacom for several years to develop and then expand Viacom's capabilities in this area. It's an exciting and quickly growing part of our core business. You'll also be hearing from Bob Bakish, who will discuss the recent achievements coming out of our International Media Networks business and his views on the company overall. 
As you know, Bob has been selected to lead the company as CEO. And I believe that there is nobody better suited for that role. Not only has he built critical scale in our complex international businesses, but he has driven technological and strategic innovation while consistently increasing profitability. With that track record, his deep knowledge of our overall business and his appreciation of the people and culture that have made Viacom great, he is exactly the right leader for Viacom's next chapter. 
The special committee of our Board of Directors is continuing to work with its financial and legal advisers to explore the merits of a combination with CBS. While we will not have an update for review today on that process, but we want to be very clear that Viacom will continue to operate for the long term with a strategy of driving growth, building our core businesses and positioning the company for success in the years ahead. 
We released our financials earlier today, which were towards the higher end of the guidance we provided in September. On the Media Networks side of the business, ratings headwinds and our strategic decision to reduce unit loads at some of our networks put pressure on advertising growth in the quarter. However, the reinvigorated high-performing networks, like Nickelodeon and VH1, have shown that we can generate ad revenue quickly as ratings rebound. And we have brought new management to MTV and Comedy Central to kickstart rating recoveries at those properties. 
In addition, we are significantly increasing our incremental revenues driven by next-generation ad products that are not defined by the traditional currencies. And we are working with the MVPDs on further expanding addressable digital ad insertion at scale. Bob will talk in great detail about our international business, but we are seeing solid strength in those ad markets. Outside the U.S., our ad revenues increased 6% in the quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven primarily by strong growth in Europe. 
On a macro level, the advertising marketplace is very good right now, leading to high demand for inventory across all of our networks. Our upfront was strong and scatter in the December quarter continues to look good. We're seeing spending coming out of digital and back into the TV marketplace, which is absorbing inventory and driving price improvements. All of these factors give us confidence in our Q1 results. And we expect to deliver an approximate 500 basis point improvement over the year-over-year decline in Q4. 
On the affiliate side, we faced challenging comps in the quarter related to a large contribution from an SVOD deal that we accounted for in Q4 2015. Absent the impact of SVOD on our core traditional affiliate revenue growth, it was essentially flat. However, we're looking ahead with confidence with most of our distribution partners committed to long-term deals at attractive rates and our continued growth in cable share in the quarter. As OTT options continue to grow, we are extremely optimistic about the particular value of Viacom's younger-skewing networks in those offerings. We are approaching each of those opportunities very strategically with a view to driving the most long-term value for the portfolio overall. 
The popularity of these services makes it increasingly difficult to measure consumption. So we've been working to fine-tune our internal metrics to capture all points of monetization and monetizable viewing, including linear, cable VOD and SVOD. Based on this analysis, the consumption of Viacom Media Networks' content across all the domestic linear and digital platforms is increasing on an absolute basis and up 3% in the quarter year-over-year. 
One of the offerings we're very enthusiastic about is DIRECTV NOW. It delivers a robust bundle with 11 Viacom networks in its 100-network portfolio. We view it as a complementary offering to the marketplace, opening up new options for a generation of young consumers who love our programming but have a resistance to signing up with a traditional cable-delivered bundle. We are also working with other existing distribution partners to define new ways to make content available to them on an increasing number of platforms. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see an increase in our domestic affiliate growth to low single digits, which assumes the impact of a low single-digit decline in the overall cable subscriber universe. 
Moving on to quickly touch upon some of our key networks. Nickelodeon continues to thrive, extending its winning streak to 5 straight quarters at #1 total day with kids 2 to 11 and kids 2 to 5 with a double-digit lead against its 2 largest competitors. Nick's success can't be overstated. The network owned the top 6 shows on TV for kids 2 to 11 in the quarter, including the overall #1 program, The Thundermans. The quarter's top animated program for this demo, the Loud House, is one of the fastest-growing kids' hits, having launched in May at #1 and stayed on top since then. We're in season 2 already. And to meet the audience's demand for this homegrown Nickelodeon show, we have already announced the pickup of season 3. It's a great example of our commitment to quick, assertive investments to keep our most popular content on the air and fresh, which has been -- which we've been applying more and more aggressively to our growing number of Nickelodeon hits. 
Moving offscreen. Nick is actively expanding its recreational offerings to serve the whole family with initiatives like the 5-star luxury Nick Resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and the fast-selling family show, PAW Patrol Live!, based on this year's top preschool show. In consumer products, Nickelodeon continues to have great success with lines based on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and PAW Patrol. Products for Blaze and the Monster Machines and Shimmer and Shine just hit shows this summer and the demand is rising fast, particularly for Shimmer and Shine, which was a Halloween costume favorite this year, a traditional indicator of a property's growing popularity. 
VH1 continues to build on its upward momentum, closing out the quarter with 3 of the top non-sports cable shows and #1-rated reality show, Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta. For the fiscal year, VH1 boasts the fastest-growing growth among cable's top 20 and has delivered ratings increases in 5 consecutive quarters. Chris McCarthy has done an incredible job of driving success at VH1. And last month, we added oversight of MTV to his portfolio. He's fired up about the turnaround opportunities there and we're expecting big things from him. 
And a quick note about Comedy Central, which has been a key focus of ours. South Park has opened its 20th season with the highest ratings it's had for several years. The episodes that aired in the fourth quarter were up 27% over the previous season. And the season premiere was the show's highest-rated episode in a decade. We're also seeing more and more momentum behind Trevor Noah as audience continues to build. The election has put The Daily Show front and center again as Trevor has delivered his higher monthly ratings in October and was the highest-rated and most-watched daily late-night talk show among millennial men. We are projecting that fiscal Q1 is going to be his best-rated quarter ever. 
And finally, the upcoming film slate from Paramount Pictures includes an incredible lineup of filmmakers and stars. This November, the studio will release the critically-acclaimed film, Arrival, starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, as well as Allied, starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. In December, the studio will release the comedy, Office Christmas Party, starring Jennifer Aniston, along with Denzel Washington's Fences and Martin Scorsese's highly anticipated, Silence, based on the acclaimed novel. It's a very strong slate. At Paramount TV, Berlin Station is already in production on seasons 2 and 3 for EPIX. And Shooter, starring Ryan Phillippe and executive produced by Mark Wahlberg, premieres November 15 on USA. It's a quickly growing business and currently Paramount has 30 shows in development. 
Now let's turn the call over to Wade for more about the numbers."
25403751,404351967,1080935,"Viacom, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2016",2016-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Today, I'm going to cover our operating results, our cash flow and our capital structure, including steps we've taken to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. I will also speak to seasonal factors impacting our fiscal 2017.",866,"Thanks, Tom. Today, I'm going to cover our operating results, our cash flow and our capital structure, including steps we've taken to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. I will also speak to seasonal factors impacting our fiscal 2017. 
Looking at the full year on a total company basis. Viacom generated $12.5 billion of revenue, $2.7 billion of adjusted operating income, $1.2 billion of operating free cash flow and $3.68 of adjusted earnings per share. For the September quarter, total company revenues were $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $538 million. Adjusted net earnings were $273 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.69 for the quarter. 
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues for the quarter were down 11% compared to the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 14%, and international revenues were up 2%. Excluding an 11 percentage point unfavorable foreign currency impact, international revenues were up 13%, reflecting double-digit growth in affiliate and ancillary revenues. Page 8 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 8% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 8% and international revenues were down 7%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 13 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 6%, driven by continued growth in Europe. 
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues in the quarter were down 16%. Domestic revenues declined 19% in the quarter, principally reflecting lower revenues from SVOD arrangements as we made a strategic decision to reduce the amount of programming we license to these distributors. International affiliate revenues increased 7% in the quarter. Excluding an 8 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international affiliate revenues increased 15%, driven by new channel launches, increased subscribers, rate increases and the completion of certain SVOD arrangements. 
Expenses decreased 2% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense was 5% lower while distribution and other expense decreased 20%. SG&A expense increased 9% in the quarter. The decrease in programming expense in the quarter was principally driven by the timing of airing of original programming. The decline in distribution and other expense primarily reflects lower participations in residuals related to lower SVOD revenue. The increase in SG&A cost was principally due to severance and other employee-related costs. Media Networks' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $750 million and the adjusted operating income margin was 30%. The decline in adjusted operating income was driven by the 11% decline in revenues, partially offset by the 2% decrease in revenues. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 24%, principally due to the decrease in theatrical revenues. Page 11 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues decreased to $203 million due to the difficult comparisons to the strong international performance of Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation in the September quarter of last year. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $137 million in the quarter. The decline versus the prior year quarter reflects lower revenues as well as a previously disclosed $115 million programming impairment charge. 
In terms of taxes, the full year adjusted effective tax rate was 31.7%, reflecting a 50 basis point increase as compared to the prior year. In terms of our debt, it remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. We had $11.9 billion of total debt and $379 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.9x. We took several steps to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. Subsequent to quarter-end, we issued $400 million of 2.25% senior notes due in 2020 and $900 million of 3.45% senior notes due in 2026. Following the issuance, we initiated a redemption of the $400 million outstanding of our December 2016 notes and the $500 million outstanding of our April 2017 notes. We also reduced our dividend by 50%, starting with the payment we made on October 3. This will provide us with over $300 million of incremental liquidity on an annual basis. Given our strong free cash flow generation, we plan to delever over time in order to preserve our investment-grade status. 
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2017. For the full year, we expect that the Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid- to high single digits. In terms of Media Networks SG&A expense, we anticipate year-over-year growth to be weighted to the first half of the year due to the timing of spend on multiplatform data products as well as advertising and promotion expense related to the marketing of new original series. For Paramount, given the timing and mix of our films, we anticipate a higher P&A expense in the December quarter. This will result in difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior-year quarter. In terms of taxes, for 2017, we're forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kern."

As we discussed on prior calls, Viacom's been investing in data capabilities over the past several years. These investments in research, first-party data and advanced data science are delivering better insights and new tools across our business. Our better understanding of our fans and a more sophisticated perspective on how, when and where our content fits into their lives means better support for programming, scheduling, acquisitions, marketing, and of course, our ad sales business. 
In advertising sales, it's perhaps easiest to measure the economic impact of these advances as we can transparently benchmark against the outcomes from traditional approaches to targeting, transacting and measuring the value of television advertising. Because TV advertising has, for years, been measured only in terms of age and gender-based segments, females 18 to 34, for example, advertisers and publishers alike have had to sell, plan and deliver campaigns around metrics that do not actually match with the advertisers' true target audience. Because we can't communicate with precision around who an advertiser wants to reach or to whom in fact an ad is delivered, both sides of the marketplace suffer. 
Let's put this in concrete terms. Imagine an auto manufacturer who wants to reach trucking tenders, consumers who may be in the market for a new pickup truck in the next 90 days. In the traditional currency of television, this advertiser would only be able to buy and plan against the traditional demo, like males 18 to 49. Publishers who guarantee delivery against that metric would logically deliver units optimized to reach those males 18 to 49, as all other impressions of a 52-year-old, for example, who might very well be actively shopping for a truck would be considered waste and would not be appropriately valued. Now however, our increasingly sophisticated use of data from multiple sources allows us to understand our audience in more detail than ever before. For the first time, it's possible to accurately identify our fans and viewers, not just by their age and gender, but their income, location, brand awareness, shopping patterns, intentions and even aspirations. Ultimately, this high-resolution view of our fans and our advertisers' target audience allows us to better match advertiser campaigns with our content. These means better results for our advertisers and for our own business. 
Going back to that trucking tender we talked about. Viacom would use all available privacy-complaint to identify households in which a truck ad could have maximum impact, and we would optimize delivery against those homes. The advertiser in turn can now measure the success of the campaign and pay Viacom for those impressions that reached the actual target, not a blunt proxy based only on age and gender. 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about the infrastructure required to do this as it represents a very real and proprietary position of leadership for Viacom. We started with our first-party data management platform fueled by direct one-to-one engagement with our fans on social and digital platforms, which, in total, represent more than half the households in the U.S. Over the last 2 years, we've extended that reach with unique access to set-top box data from tens of millions of homes, real-time location data from hundreds of millions of mobile devices and commerce patterns from multiple sources including, but not limited to, our multiyear exclusive partnership with American Express. All of this data representing literally billions of new data points, informing our perspective on the intersection of content and commerce each month, is carefully de-identified, combined and analyzed by our teams of researchers, marketers and data scientists. From the perspective of our advertisers, these improvements in audience precision and the better matching of content and viewership with their campaign yields demonstrably higher engagement and more measurable impact. Based on these results, we've seen 100% retention and steady year-over-year growth in advertiser participation. Further, when fewer impressions are delivered outside the intended target, those impressions that would otherwise be considered wasted for one advertiser can be intelligently allocated to other advertisers for whom they deliver real value. With television inventory fundamentally oversubscribed, every impression that is reallocated for greater impact translates directly to our bottom line. All of this has been talked about for many years, but in many cases, has lived only in the realm of theory, or it was perceived to be locked up with the long-term potential of one-to-one addressable advertising. At Viacom, however, we have begun to see real results from our growing capabilities in data science as it enabled sophisticated targeting, advanced currencies and more precise and transparent reporting of results. 
In this last upfront, Viacom wrote more than 50 deals that included Viacom Vantage, our advanced data product, which allows advertisers to target and guarantee against these new metrics. In total, the advertisers who participate in Vantage represented close to $1 billion of upfront commitments, spanning 9 key verticals and 10 major buying agencies. 
While some of the value unlocked in this approach will grow and show an even greater impact as the infrastructure for addressable TV matures, even today, we're seeing real value return to the marketplace through more efficient and transparent audience measurement. Our benchmarks demonstrate that we're unlocking measurably better outcomes for our advertisers. We're already seeing this upside in the revenue per impression delivered through Viacom Vantage. As we continue to work together with our partners in the linear television ecosystem to scale this capability across a larger portion of the dollars transacted on Viacom, that growth will continue. As we identify new ways to measure and value impressions delivered outside of the linear ecosystem, most of which go entirely un-monetized or under-monetized today, we anticipate an even greater impact on our advertising business. 
And now I'll turn it over to Bob."

Before I begin, I have to say a few words of appreciation. Tom Dooley has dedicated 35 years of his life to this company as a driving force behind many of its biggest wins and a steady hand during times of transition, and most recently, provided assured, excellent leadership throughout the changes this year. I'm honored to be taking the handoff from him, and I'm grateful for his wisdom and counsel. I'd also like to say thank you to Sumner, Shari, Tom May and the entire Viacom board for this amazing opportunity. But even more so, for their tireless drive to do right by Viacom. And while the board and special committee consider whether a CBS transaction makes sense, they've asked me to maximize Viacom's potential as an independent company. And I'm committed to doing just that. I'm very excited about this new role and the many opportunities at hand for us. I've already pooled together the senior team across the company, and we're at work identifying near-term opportunities to accelerate our evolution while building a long-term vision for the future. At the same time, I'm reimmersing myself in the domestic business with a focus on how we can strengthen MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount. 
While we have our challenges, we also have an incredibly strong foundation from which to build. It is important to remember that Viacom has the highest share of viewing in the U.S. among all cable groups in every demo in which we compete. And worldwide, Viacom is the largest global media company by reach. We have a very strong footing, and I look forward to sharing more detailed plans on how we can build off it as soon as I can. But today, I want to take the opportunity to give you a bit of a window on how I think and how we operate. And the best way to do that is to look at how we transformed Viacom International Media Networks. I joined Viacom's international business in 2007. It was at a crossroads, too focused on MTV, too dependent on the U.S. for content, too disconnected from market to market around the world. In the past decade, our team has addressed these issues and built a true multinational organization. We've diversified dramatically to a portfolio that includes widely-distributed MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Centrals the growing SPIKE brand, and Paramount Channel, now the largest ad-supported multichannel in the world, and 2 key local players in the U.K.'s Channel 5 and India's Colors. In 2006, MTV accounted for over 80% of our business. Today, no brand accounts for even 30%. We've become a global producer of original content, not just an exporter. We have 2,700 hours of original programming planned for 2017, and much of that consists of highly exportable formats with modest costs per episode. And we've built an organization that is interconnected across brands, businesses and geographies, while fostering a culture that provides itself on entrepreneurship, innovation and adaptability. As a result, Viacom International Media Networks just closed its best year ever. 
Looking ahead, we continue to be hugely focused on scale, brands, content and products. First, scale. Our #1 priority in international is to get there. We've done this through organic expansion of Nickelodeon and Comedy Central globally and through the more recent international launches of Paramount Channel, SPIKE and Nick Jr. And we've done very well with big, mass market general entertainment networks in priority markets. Channel 5 in the U.K. is thriving. It just delivered its most profitable year ever, and it gives Viacom the highest share of any international media company in the biggest market outside the U.S. We also have a leading position in India through our Viacom 18 joint venture, home to the Colors brand, which is now the fastest-growing media company in the fastest-growing media market in the world. 
Second, on brands. The key word is focus. Rather than launching additional U.S. brands internationally, we focused on international core 6: MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Comedy Central, Paramount Channel and SPIKE. We're investing to grow these brands while maintaining a lean powerful portfolio that will be attractive to both pay TV and emerging distributors, particularly virtual MVPDs. And within that footprint, we have plenty of room to grow. Comedy Central and Paramount Channel remain far less penetrated than MTV. In 2017, we already have launches planned in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Russia, Benelux, Asia and more. 
Third, on the creative side. Viacom International Media Networks emergence as a global content engine has energized our team and strengthened our ability to localize formats. We shoot multiple versions of our biggest hits concurrently with great economics. At our new studio in Miami, Channel 5 in London and production hubs in Amsterdam and Madrid. It's a formula that works. Our U.K. version of Jersey Shore, Geordie Shore, regularly beats Game of Thrones in the demo in its premiere time slot. Yes, you heard that right. Audience share for MTV, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. is up as we localize more formats and increase international production for global use. Meanwhile, we continue to export a lot of U.S. programming, particularly via Nickelodeon, which does very well. 
Fourth and finally, products. Redefining what it means to be a branded TV network across platforms through product innovation is a huge priority for us. Pay-TV penetration outside the U.S. is well under 50%, meaning broadband growth across fixed and mobile platforms has the potential to more than double our distribution by the end of the decade. I believe this is the single biggest opportunity for our business internationally. And while the economics of digital distribution still trail linear, we believe incremental expansion of our reach will pay big returns in the long run for our brands and businesses. And last year's launch of our Viacom Play Plex suite of apps for our international brands was a big step forward in this regard. Each app features full episodes, clips on demand, along with a live linear feed. We tailor distribution market by market to reach well beyond our linear footprint. For example, we have authenticated deals with pay-TV partners in Mexico, mobile distribution with partners in Asia, our over-the-top and direct-to-consumer as we've done with BET Play in more than 100 countries -- 100 markets worldwide where BET doesn't have a linear fleet. Further, we're proving that product innovation can exist within a traditional TV environment with our personalized interactive linear channels, My Nick Jr. and My MTV. I believe a lot of our successful international approach can be brought home to the domestic market. I've seen it work, and it's a big reason that I'm truly optimistic about Viacom. As I said earlier, I'm working with the senior management across the company to identify short-term opportunities while building on a long-term strategy. MTV is clearly a priority for me. We've had a lot of success in evolving and strengthening that brand internationally, and I'm very pleased with the recent leadership change here in the U.S. I will seek more collaborative and forward-thinking partnerships with our long-standing domestic distributors, and I'll also be working closely with Paramount. Finally, I'll make sure we have a structure that supports feed, sharing of resources and a global outlook. It's imperative that we operate more globally. The opportunity is there. Viacom is home to some of the world's most iconic and internationally-resonant brands. I've seen what those brands and our phenomenal people can do when equipped with a focused forward-looking strategy and a strong organization for which to create and connect with millions. I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support and commitment to Viacom. I look forward to keeping you informed of our plans and progress, and thank you for joining today's call. I also look forward to an open dialogue. 
With that, I'll pass it back to Tom."

One is, remember the big-picture perspective that we, Viacom, have the largest share of viewing of all pay-TV network companies. More specifically, if you look at our portfolio of networks, if you take our top 6 networks, roughly 80% to 85% of this affiliate revenue [indiscernible] And if you go to top 8, that number goes to 90% to 95%. So even if you were to look at a scenario where you were to spin the portfolio a bit, the vast, vast majority of economics would be maintained. Second point I'd make on skinny bundles is, with the -- particularly the AT&T DIRECTV enhancement and their pack, skinny is not really that skinny. And we're thrilled with that deal. We believe it absolutely reflects a marketplace understanding of the value of our networks. And there, we're going to be among having the most -- the largest portfolio of networks on the platform with 11. So that, I think, is also a very strong statement. I would say, broadly speaking, this is a very exciting development in the category. OTT delivery of services and bundles of networks, particularly the ones that are pay-TV-friendly, like the ones I've just discussed, it's also, by the way, huge opportunity internationally, services like Sky Now. And remember, international pay-TV penetration is far lower than domestic. And so, it will provide a lot of upside, very exciting development for the industry for sure. In terms of the positive affiliate, yes, we are confident that we will have a return to growth in the affiliate side of the business as we move forward, even and particularly when you look at the domestic, even assuming a universe decline. So our guidance for fiscal Q1 of mid-single-digit 3%-ish [ph] growth assumes a 3% decline in universe. So we will still grow even if there's a universe decline. And then internationally, again, we see significant growth, and you saw the numbers in the quarter."

At the same time, on the OTT side, many of these partners -- many of these platforms increasingly are, let's use the word related, to a traditional player. The canary in the coal mine on that probably was Sky Now in the U.K. And really, all the distributors around the world, I think it's fair to say, are looking at playing in that space. Then when you look at the traditional -- traditional, a bad word, the SVOD category, you think of aggregators, we look at that on an opportunity-by-opportunity basis, consider specifics about a market specific player and a specific act. And determine what they want to do there. We certainly have a role in the world from a consumer perspective, but we are looking at this part of a holistic strategy, and that will dictate what we do."

The way the flow-through of the business works in terms of profitability, we have P&A upfront. The first few quarters are going to be negative, but we think that Paramount, as it gets to the back half of this year, will have very successful opportunities to begin to turn around and get back to profitability. In particular, we have this little film called Transformers 5 coming out that we have great expectations around and think it's going to be one of the biggest movies of the summer.

As part of doing that, I believe we got to bring the team together and then unlock really what I've convinced as a whole lot of great thinking throughout the organization and all levels of the organization and then identify through that the ideas we want to bring to life. When you look at it from the top-down, there's some clear weakness areas. We talked about MTV. Comedy Central, we have some recent good trend lines in Trevor. By the way, Trevor Noah is significantly stronger internationally than John was. So the Trevor Noah franchise is a great one, and the fact that he's really connecting through this election cycle is a very exciting development. And also South Park's 20th. 20-year-old franchise and the new episodes are doing extremely well, and that's another global franchise. So there's some good stuff starting to happen at Comedy Central. And obviously, we'd like to see more happen. On the Paramount side, as Tom and Wade indicated, and I've been speaking with Brad regularly and just starting to get into that, obviously, the film slate will be highly important. We also want to see what we can do on the marketing side in the short term To see if that is not an incremental opportunity. So I think there's a clear set of priorities, and I'm convinced that by working with the team we will unlock a good action plan. Obviously, part of that will be content investments, but I think it's important that based on -- you understand that based on my experience, a lot of this is about mix of investments, not about you have to spend dramatically more money necessarily. And again, our international experience shows that you can deliver very significant audiences in genres other than high-dollar scripted programming. So I think mix will continue to be an opportunity."

We've got a lot to cover today. And along with Wade, I am pleased to welcome Kern Schireson, who will provide an overview and update on our industry-leading data strategy.

And along with Wade, I am pleased to welcome Kern Schireson, who will provide an overview and update on our industry-leading data strategy. Kern has worked at Viacom for several years to develop and then expand Viacom's capabilities in this area. It's an exciting and quickly growing part of our core business. You'll also be hearing from Bob Bakish, who will discuss the recent achievements coming out of our International Media Networks business and his views on the company overall. 
As you know, Bob has been selected to lead the company as CEO. And I believe that there is nobody better suited for that role. Not only has he built critical scale in our complex international businesses, but he has driven technological and strategic innovation while consistently increasing profitability. With that track record, his deep knowledge of our overall business and his appreciation of the people and culture that have made Viacom great, he is exactly the right leader for Viacom's next chapter. 
The special committee of our Board of Directors is continuing to work with its financial and legal advisers to explore the merits of a combination with CBS. While we will not have an update for review today on that process, but we want to be very clear that Viacom will continue to operate for the long term with a strategy of driving growth, building our core businesses and positioning the company for success in the years ahead. 
We released our financials earlier today, which were towards the higher end of the guidance we provided in September. On the Media Networks side of the business, ratings headwinds and our strategic decision to reduce unit loads at some of our networks put pressure on advertising growth in the quarter. However, the reinvigorated high-performing networks, like Nickelodeon and VH1, have shown that we can generate ad revenue quickly as ratings rebound. And we have brought new management to MTV and Comedy Central to kickstart rating recoveries at those properties. 
In addition, we are significantly increasing our incremental revenues driven by next-generation ad products that are not defined by the traditional currencies. And we are working with the MVPDs on further expanding addressable digital ad insertion at scale. Bob will talk in great detail about our international business, but we are seeing solid strength in those ad markets. Outside the U.S., our ad revenues increased 6% in the quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven primarily by strong growth in Europe. 
On a macro level, the advertising marketplace is very good right now, leading to high demand for inventory across all of our networks. Our upfront was strong and scatter in the December quarter continues to look good. We're seeing spending coming out of digital and back into the TV marketplace, which is absorbing inventory and driving price improvements. All of these factors give us confidence in our Q1 results. And we expect to deliver an approximate 500 basis point improvement over the year-over-year decline in Q4. 
On the affiliate side, we faced challenging comps in the quarter related to a large contribution from an SVOD deal that we accounted for in Q4 2015. Absent the impact of SVOD on our core traditional affiliate revenue growth, it was essentially flat. However, we're looking ahead with confidence with most of our distribution partners committed to long-term deals at attractive rates and our continued growth in cable share in the quarter. As OTT options continue to grow, we are extremely optimistic about the particular value of Viacom's younger-skewing networks in those offerings. We are approaching each of those opportunities very strategically with a view to driving the most long-term value for the portfolio overall. 
The popularity of these services makes it increasingly difficult to measure consumption. So we've been working to fine-tune our internal metrics to capture all points of monetization and monetizable viewing, including linear, cable VOD and SVOD. Based on this analysis, the consumption of Viacom Media Networks' content across all the domestic linear and digital platforms is increasing on an absolute basis and up 3% in the quarter year-over-year. 
One of the offerings we're very enthusiastic about is DIRECTV NOW. It delivers a robust bundle with 11 Viacom networks in its 100-network portfolio. We view it as a complementary offering to the marketplace, opening up new options for a generation of young consumers who love our programming but have a resistance to signing up with a traditional cable-delivered bundle. We are also working with other existing distribution partners to define new ways to make content available to them on an increasing number of platforms. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see an increase in our domestic affiliate growth to low single digits, which assumes the impact of a low single-digit decline in the overall cable subscriber universe. 
Moving on to quickly touch upon some of our key networks. Nickelodeon continues to thrive, extending its winning streak to 5 straight quarters at #1 total day with kids 2 to 11 and kids 2 to 5 with a double-digit lead against its 2 largest competitors. Nick's success can't be overstated. The network owned the top 6 shows on TV for kids 2 to 11 in the quarter, including the overall #1 program, The Thundermans. The quarter's top animated program for this demo, the Loud House, is one of the fastest-growing kids' hits, having launched in May at #1 and stayed on top since then. We're in season 2 already. And to meet the audience's demand for this homegrown Nickelodeon show, we have already announced the pickup of season 3. It's a great example of our commitment to quick, assertive investments to keep our most popular content on the air and fresh, which has been -- which we've been applying more and more aggressively to our growing number of Nickelodeon hits. 
Moving offscreen. Nick is actively expanding its recreational offerings to serve the whole family with initiatives like the 5-star luxury Nick Resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and the fast-selling family show, PAW Patrol Live!, based on this year's top preschool show. In consumer products, Nickelodeon continues to have great success with lines based on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and PAW Patrol. Products for Blaze and the Monster Machines and Shimmer and Shine just hit shows this summer and the demand is rising fast, particularly for Shimmer and Shine, which was a Halloween costume favorite this year, a traditional indicator of a property's growing popularity. 
VH1 continues to build on its upward momentum, closing out the quarter with 3 of the top non-sports cable shows and #1-rated reality show, Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta. For the fiscal year, VH1 boasts the fastest-growing growth among cable's top 20 and has delivered ratings increases in 5 consecutive quarters. Chris McCarthy has done an incredible job of driving success at VH1. And last month, we added oversight of MTV to his portfolio. He's fired up about the turnaround opportunities there and we're expecting big things from him. 
And a quick note about Comedy Central, which has been a key focus of ours. South Park has opened its 20th season with the highest ratings it's had for several years. The episodes that aired in the fourth quarter were up 27% over the previous season. And the season premiere was the show's highest-rated episode in a decade. We're also seeing more and more momentum behind Trevor Noah as audience continues to build. The election has put The Daily Show front and center again as Trevor has delivered his higher monthly ratings in October and was the highest-rated and most-watched daily late-night talk show among millennial men. We are projecting that fiscal Q1 is going to be his best-rated quarter ever. 
And finally, the upcoming film slate from Paramount Pictures includes an incredible lineup of filmmakers and stars. This November, the studio will release the critically-acclaimed film, Arrival, starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, as well as Allied, starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. In December, the studio will release the comedy, Office Christmas Party, starring Jennifer Aniston, along with Denzel Washington's Fences and Martin Scorsese's highly anticipated, Silence, based on the acclaimed novel. It's a very strong slate. At Paramount TV, Berlin Station is already in production on seasons 2 and 3 for EPIX. And Shooter, starring Ryan Phillippe and executive produced by Mark Wahlberg, premieres November 15 on USA. It's a quickly growing business and currently Paramount has 30 shows in development. 
Now let's turn the call over to Wade for more about the numbers."
25403751,404351967,1081173,"Viacom, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2016",2016-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Today, I'm going to cover our operating results, our cash flow and our capital structure, including steps we've taken to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. I will also speak to seasonal factors impacting our fiscal 2017.",868,"Thanks, Tom. Today, I'm going to cover our operating results, our cash flow and our capital structure, including steps we've taken to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. I will also speak to seasonal factors impacting our fiscal 2017. 
Looking at the full year on a total company basis. Viacom generated $12.5 billion of revenue, $2.7 billion of adjusted operating income, $1.2 billion of operating free cash flow and $3.68 of adjusted earnings per share. For the September quarter, total company revenues were $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $538 million. Adjusted net earnings were $273 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.69 for the quarter. 
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues for the quarter were down 11% compared to the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 14%, and international revenues were up 2%. Excluding an 11 percentage point unfavorable foreign currency impact, international revenues were up 13%, reflecting double-digit growth in affiliate and ancillary revenues. Page 8 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 8% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 8% and international revenues were down 7%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 13 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 6%, driven by continued growth in Europe. 
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues in the quarter were down 16%. Domestic revenues declined 19% in the quarter, principally reflecting lower revenues from SVOD arrangements as we made a strategic decision to reduce the amount of programming we license to these distributors. International affiliate revenues increased 7% in the quarter. Excluding an 8 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international affiliate revenues increased 15%, driven by new channel launches, increased subscribers, rate increases and the completion of certain SVOD arrangements. 
Expenses decreased 2% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense was 5% lower while distribution and other expense decreased 20%. SG&A expense increased 9% in the quarter. The decrease in programming expense in the quarter was principally driven by the timing of airing of original programming. The decline in distribution and other expense primarily reflects lower participations in residuals related to lower SVOD revenue. The increase in SG&A cost was principally due to severance and other employee-related costs. Media Networks' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $750 million and the adjusted operating income margin was 30%. The decline in adjusted operating income was driven by the 11% decline in revenues, partially offset by the 2% decrease in revenues. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 24%, principally due to the decrease in theatrical revenues. Page 11 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues decreased to $203 million due to the difficult comparisons to the strong international performance of Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation in the September quarter of last year. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $137 million in the quarter. The decline versus the prior year quarter reflects lower revenues as well as a previously disclosed $115 million programming impairment charge. 
In terms of taxes, the full year adjusted effective tax rate was 31.7%, reflecting a 50 basis point increase as compared to the prior year. In terms of our debt, it remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. We had $11.9 billion of total debt and $379 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.9x. We took several steps to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. Subsequent to quarter-end, we issued $400 million of 2.25% senior notes due in 2020 and $900 million of 3.45% senior notes due in 2026. Following the issuance, we initiated the redemption of the $400 million outstanding of our December 2016 notes and the $500 million outstanding of our April 2017 notes. We also reduced our dividend by 50%, starting with the payment we made on October 3. This will provide us with over $300 million of incremental liquidity on an annual basis. Given our strong free cash flow generation, we plan to delever over time in order to preserve our investment-grade status. 
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2017. For the full year, we expect that the Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid- to high single digits. In terms of Media Networks' SG&A expense, we anticipate year-over-year growth to be weighted to the first half of the year due to the timing of spend on multi-platform and data products as well as advertising and promotion expense related to the marketing of new original series. For Paramount, given the timing and mix of our films, we anticipate a higher P&A expense in the December quarter. This will result in difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior year quarter. In terms of taxes, for 2017, we're forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kern."

As we've discussed on prior calls, Viacom has been investing in data capabilities over the past several years. These investments in research, first-party data and advanced data science are delivering better insights and new tools across our business. A better understanding of our fans and a more sophisticated perspective on how, when and where our content fits into their lives means better support for programming, scheduling, acquisitions, marketing, and of course, our ad sales business. 
In advertising sales, it's perhaps easiest to measure the economic impact of these advances as we can transparently benchmark against the outcomes from traditional approaches to targeting, transacting and measuring the value of television advertising. Because TV advertising has, for years, been measured only in terms of age and gender-based segments, females 18 to 34, for example, advertisers and publishers alike have had to sell, plan and deliver campaigns around metrics that do not actually match with the advertisers' true target audience. Because we can't communicate with precision around who an advertiser wants to reach or to whom in fact an ad is delivered, both sides of the marketplace suffer. 
Let's put this in concrete terms. Imagine an auto manufacturer who wants to reach trucking tenders, consumers who may be in the market for a new pickup truck in the next 90 days. In the traditional currency of television, this advertiser would only be able to buy and plan against a traditional demo, like males 18 to 49. Publishers who guarantee delivery against that metric would logically deliver units optimized to reach those males 18 to 49 as all other impressions, a 52-year-old, for example, who might very well be actively shopping for a truck, would be considered waste and would not be appropriately valued. 
Now however, our increasingly sophisticated use of data from multiple sources allows us to understand our audience in more detail than ever before. For the first time, it's possible to accurately identify our fans and viewers, not just by their age and gender but their income, location, brand awareness, shopping patterns, intentions and even aspirations. Ultimately, this high-resolution view of our fans and our advertisers' target audience allows us to better match advertiser campaigns with our content. These means better results for our advertisers and for our own business. 
Going back to that trucking tender we talked about. Viacom would use all available privacy-compliant data to identify households in which a truck ad could have maximum impact and we would optimize delivery against those homes. The advertiser in turn can now measure the success of the campaign and pay Viacom for those impressions that reached the actual target, not a blunt proxy based only on age and gender. 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about the infrastructure required to do this as it represents a very real and proprietary position of leadership for Viacom. We started with our first-party data management platform fueled by direct one-to-one engagement with our fans on social and digital platforms, which in total represent more than half the households in the U.S. Over the last 2 years, we've extended that reach with unique access to set-top box data from tens of millions of homes, real-time location data from hundreds of millions of mobile devices and commerce patterns from multiple sources including, but not limited to, our multiyear exclusive partnership with American Express. 
All of this data representing literally billions of new data points, informing our perspective on the intersection of content and commerce each month, is carefully de-identified, combined and analyzed by our teams of researchers, marketers and data scientists. From the perspective of our advertisers, these improvements in audience precision and the better matching of content and viewership with their campaign yield demonstrably higher engagement and more measurable impact. Based on these results, we have seen 100% retention and steady year-over-year growth in advertiser participation. 
Further, when fewer impressions are delivered outside the intended target, those impressions that would otherwise be considered wasted for one advertiser can be intelligently allocated to other advertisers for whom they deliver real value. With television inventory fundamentally oversubscribed, every impression that is reallocated for greater impact translates directly to our bottom line. All of this has been talked about for many years, but in many cases, has lived only in the realm of theory or it was perceived to be locked up with the long-term potential of one-to-one addressable advertising. At Viacom, however, we have begun to see real results from our growing capabilities in data science as it has enabled sophisticated targeting, advanced currencies and more precise and transparent reporting of results. 
In this last upfront, Viacom wrote more than 50 deals that included Viacom Vantage, our advanced data product, which allows advertisers to target and guarantee against these new metrics. In total, the advertisers who participated in Vantage represented close to $1 billion of upfront commitments, spanning 9 key verticals and 10 major buying agencies. While some of the value unlocked in this approach will grow and show an even greater impact as the infrastructure for addressable TV matures, even today, we're seeing real value return to the marketplace through more efficient and transparent audience measurement. 
Our benchmarks demonstrate that we're unlocking measurably better outcomes for our advertisers. We're already seeing this upside in the revenue per impression delivered through Viacom Vantage. As we continue to work together with our partners in the linear television ecosystem to scale this capability across a larger portion of the dollars transacted on Viacom, that growth will continue. As we identify new ways to measure and value impressions delivered outside of the linear ecosystem, most of which go entirely unmonetized or undermonetized today, we anticipate an even greater impact on our advertising business. 
And now I'll turn it over to Bob."

Before I begin, I have to say a few words of appreciation. Tom Dooley has dedicated 35 years of his life to this company as a driving force behind many of its biggest wins and a steady hand during times of transition, and most recently, p",1319,"Thank you, Kern. Before I begin, I have to say a few words of appreciation. Tom Dooley has dedicated 35 years of his life to this company as a driving force behind many of its biggest wins and a steady hand during times of transition, and most recently, provided assured, excellent leadership throughout the changes this year. I'm honored to be taking the handoff from him and I'm grateful for his wisdom and counsel. 
I'd also like to say thank you to Sumner, Shari, Tom May and the entire Viacom board for this amazing opportunity. But even more so, for their tireless drive to do right by Viacom. And while the board and its special committee consider whether a CBS transaction makes sense, they've asked me to maximize Viacom's potential as an independent company. And I'm committed to doing just that. 
I'm very excited about this new role and the many opportunities at hand for us. I've already pulled together the senior team across the company, and we're at work identifying near-term opportunities to accelerate our evolution while building a long-term vision for the future. At the same time, I'm reimmersing myself in the domestic business with a focus on how we can strengthen MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount. 
While we have our challenges, we also have an incredibly strong foundation from which to build. It is important to remember that Viacom has the highest share of viewing in the U.S. among all cable groups in every demo in which we compete. And worldwide, Viacom is the largest global media company by reach. We have a very strong footing. And I look forward to sharing more detailed plans on how we can build off it as soon as I can. 
But today, I want to take the opportunity to give you a bit of a window on how I think and how I operate. And the best way to do that is to look at how we've transformed Viacom International Media Networks. I joined Viacom's international business in 2007. It was at a crossroads, too focused on MTV, too dependent on the U.S. for content, too disconnected from market-to-market around the world. In the past decade, our team has addressed these issues and built a true multinational organization. We've diversified dramatically to a portfolio that includes widely distributed MTVs, Nickelodeons and Comedy Centrals, the growing Spike brand and a Paramount Channel, now the largest ad-supported movie channel in the world, and 2 key local players in the U.K.'s Channel 5 and India's COLORS. 
In 2006, MTV accounted for over 80% of our business. Today, no brand accounts for even 30%. We've become a global producer of original content, not just an exporter. We have 2,700 hours of original programming planned for 2017. And much of that consists of highly exportable formats with modest cost per episode. And we've built an organization that is interconnected across brands, businesses and geographies while fostering a culture that provides itself on entrepreneurship, innovation and adaptability. As a result, Viacom International Media Networks just closed its best year ever. 
Looking ahead, we continue to be hugely focused on scale, brands, content and products. First, scale. Our #1 priority in international is to get bigger. We've done this through organic expansion of Nickelodeon and Comedy Central globally and through the more recent international launches of Paramount Channel, Spike and Nick Jr. And we've done very well with big, mass market, general entertainment networks in priority markets. Channel 5 in the U.K. is thriving. It just delivered its most profitable year ever. And it gives Viacom the highest share of any international media company in the biggest market outside the U.S. We also have a leading position in India through our Viacom 18 joint venture, home to the COLORS brand, which is now the fastest-growing media company in the fastest-growing media market in the world. 
Second, on brands. The key word is focus. Rather than launching additional U.S. brands internationally, we focus on international core 6: MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Comedy Central, Paramount Channel and Spike. We're investing to grow these brands while maintaining a lean, powerful portfolio that will be attractive to both pay-TV and emerging distributors, particularly virtual MVPDs. And within that footprint, we have plenty of room to grow. Comedy Central and Paramount Channel remain far less penetrated than MTV. In 2017, we already have launches planned in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Russia, Benelux, Asia and more. 
Third, on the creative side. Viacom International Media Networks' emergence as a global content engine has energized our team and strengthened our ability to localize formats. We shoot multiple versions of our biggest hits concurrently with great economics at our new studio in Miami, Channel 5 in London and production hubs in Amsterdam and Madrid. It's a formula that works. Our U.K. version of Jersey Shore, Geordie Shore, regularly beats Game of Thrones in the demo in its premiere time slot. Yes, you heard that right. Audience share for MTV, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. is up as we localize more formats and increase international production for global use. Meanwhile, we continue to export a lot of U.S. programming, particularly via Nickelodeon, which does very well. 
Fourth and finally, products. Redefining what it means to be a branded TV network across platforms through product innovation is a huge priority for us. Pay-TV penetration outside the U.S. is well under 50%, meaning broadband growth across fixed and mobile platforms has the potential to more than double our distribution by the end of the decade. I believe this is the single biggest opportunity for our business internationally. And while the economics of digital distribution still trail linear, we believe incremental expansion of our reach will pay big returns in the long run for our brands and businesses. And last year's launch of our Viacom Play Plex suite of apps for our international brands was a big step forward in this regard. Each app features full episodes, clips on demand, along with a live linear feed. 
We tailor distribution market-by-market to reach well beyond our linear footprint. For example, we have authenticated deals with pay-TV partners in Mexico, mobile distribution with partners in Asia, our over-the-top and direct-to-consumer as we've done with BET Play in more than 100 countries -- in 100 markets worldwide where BET doesn't have a linear feet. Further, we're proving that product innovation can exist within a traditional TV environment with our personalized interactive linear channels, My Nick Jr. and My MTV. 
I believe a lot of our successful international approach can be brought home to the domestic market. I've seen it work and it's a big reason that I'm truly optimistic about Viacom. As I said earlier, I'm working with the senior management across the company to identify short-term opportunities while building on a long-term strategy. MTV is clearly a priority for me. We've had a lot of success in evolving and strengthening that brand internationally. And I'm very pleased with the recent leadership change here in the U.S. I will seek more collaborative and forward-thinking partnerships with our long-standing domestic distributors. And I'll also be working closely with Paramount. 
Finally, I'll make sure we have a structure that supports speed, sharing of resources and a global outlook. It's imperative that we operate more globally. The opportunity is there. Viacom is home to some of the world's most iconic and internationally resonant brands. I've seen what those brands and our phenomenal people can do when equipped with a focused forward-looking strategy and a strong organization from which to create and connect with millions. 
I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support and commitment to Viacom. I look forward to keeping you informed of our plans and progress. And thank you for joining today's call. I also look forward to an open dialogue. 
With that, I'll pass it back to Tom."

One is remember the big-picture perspective that we, Viacom, have the largest share of viewing of all pay-TV network companies. More specifically, if you look at our portfolio of networks, if you take our top 6 networks, roughly 80% to 85% of the affiliate revenue accrues to those. And if you go to the top 8, that number goes to 90% to 95%. So even if you were to look at a scenario where you were to thin the portfolio a bit, the vast, vast majority of economics would be maintained. Second point I'd make on skinny bundles is with the -- particularly the AT&T DIRECTV announcement on their pack, skinny is not really that skinny. And we're thrilled with that deal. We believe it absolutely reflects a marketplace understanding of the value of our networks. And there, we're going to be among having the most -- the largest portfolio of networks on the platform with 11. So that, I think, is also a very strong statement. I would say, broadly speaking, this is a very exciting development in the category, OTT delivery of services and bundles of networks, particularly the ones that are pay-TV-friendly, like the ones I just discussed. It's also, by the way, huge opportunity internationally, services like Sky NOW. And remember, international pay-TV penetration is far lower than domestic, and so it will provide a lot of upside, very exciting development for the industry for sure. In terms of the positive affiliate, yes, we are confident that we will have a return to growth in the affiliate side of the business as we move forward, even -- and particularly when you look at the domestic, even assuming a universe decline. So our guidance for fiscal Q1 of mid-single-digit 3%-ish growth assumes a 3% decline in the universe. So we will still grow even if there's a universe decline. And then internationally, again we see significant growth. And you saw the numbers in the quarter."

If you look at the MTV EMA, which happened in Rotterdam last weekend, and you look at its performance on the MTVs all around the world, it is a clear indication based on the data I've seen to date of just how powerful improving your platform can be. Because the MTV share in general is up, but the data I have on the EMAs, which isn't in all markets yet, it takes time to cobble it together internationally, is on 12 to 24s, we were up 59%, and on 15 to 34s, we were up 42%. So again, it speaks to the vitality. And it's not like we invest far more than the U.S. in MTV. In fact, we invest far, far less. And if you look at the EMA, it costs a fraction of what the VMA costs. So sure, you have to look at resources you have on hand. But I'm absolutely confident that with the resources that Viacom commands, particularly where you can redeploy some of those, we absolutely have the firepower to do it."

Clearly, we're very focused on the MVPD space. But the good news about the VMVPD space is increasingly these are platforms that are operated and therefore consistent with some of the philosophies that are in the -- that are built to pay-TV industry. So by focusing on it, having the right product mix, making sure your teams are really running at it, that is the key enabler because there is not a shadow of a doubt that the distribution infrastructure, particularly through mobile, will be there.

We have deep partnerships around the world with pay-TV operators. And we believe there's incremental opportunity there. And we believe that they are supportive of content businesses such as ours. So we come with a lens of looking for a pay-TV-friendly strategy. And in the last quarter, we've done a mix of deals in traditional pay. By the way, you can see that today, we announced that Spike is going 24 hours in the Netherlands with Ziggo. Ziggo is a Liberty Global company. We have a very significant relationship and partnership with Liberty Global. And they're obviously a key customer of ours. And it's a partnership that works for both of us. And I think the indication is we continue to do more things with them. That's very healthy. At the same time, on the OTT side, many of these partners -- many of these platforms increasingly are, let's use the word related, to a traditional player. The canary in the coal mine on that probably was Sky NOW in the U.K. And really all the distributors around the world, I think it's fair to say, are looking at playing in that space. Then when you look at the traditional -- traditional is a bad word, the SVOD category and you think of aggregators, we will look at that on an opportunity-by-opportunity basis, consider specifics about a market and a specific player and a specific [indiscernible] and determine what they want to do there. They certainly have a role in the world from a consumer perspective, but we are looking at it as part of a holistic strategy. And that will dictate what we do."

The way the flow-through of the business works in terms of profitability, we have P&A upfront. The first few quarters are going to be negative. But we think that Paramount, as it gets to the back half of this year, will have very successful opportunities to begin to turn around and get back to profitability. In particular, we have this little film called Transformers 5 coming out that we have great expectations around and think it's going to be one of the biggest movies of the summer.

As part of doing that, I believe we've got to bring the team together and unlock really what I'm convinced is a whole lot of great thinking throughout the organization and in all levels of the organization, and then identify through that the ideas we want to bring to life. When you look at it from the top-down, there's some clear weakness areas. We've talked about MTV. Comedy Central, we have some recent good trend lines in Trevor. By the way, Trevor Noah is significantly stronger internationally than Jon was. So the Trevor Noah franchise is a great one. And the fact that he's really connecting through this election cycle is a very exciting development. And also South Park's 20th, 20-year-old franchise and the new episodes are doing extremely well. And that's another global franchise. So there's some good stuff starting to happen at Comedy Central. And obviously, we'd like to see more happen. On the Paramount side, as Tom and Wade indicated and I've been speaking with Brad regularly and just starting to get into that, obviously the film slate will be highly important. We're also going to see what we can do on the marketing side in the short term to see if that is an incremental opportunity. So I think there's a clear set of priorities and I'm convinced that by working with the team, we will unlock a good action plan. Obviously, part of that will be content investments. But I think it's important that based on -- you understand that based on my experience, a lot of this is about mix of investments, not about you have to spend dramatically more money necessarily. Again, our international experience shows that you can deliver very significant audiences in genres other than high-dollar scripted programming. So I think mix will continue to be an opportunity."

And along with Wade, I am pleased to welcome Kern Schireson, who will provide an overview and update on our industry-leading data strategy. Kern has worked at Viacom for several years to develop and then expand Viacom's capabilities in this area. It's an exciting and quickly growing part of our core business. 
You'll also be hearing from Bob Bakish, who will discuss the recent achievements coming out of our International Media Networks business and his views on the company overall. 
As you know, Bob has been selected to lead the company as CEO. And I believe that there is nobody better suited for that role. Not only has he built critical scale in our complex international businesses, but he has driven technological and strategic innovation while consistently increasing profitability. With that track record, his deep knowledge of our overall business and his appreciation of the people and culture that have made Viacom great, he's exactly the right leader for Viacom's next chapter. 
The special committee of our Board of Directors is continuing to work with its financial and legal advisers to explore the merits of a combination with CBS, but we will not have an update for you today on that process. But we want to be very clear that Viacom will continue to operate for the long term with a strategy of driving growth, building our core businesses and positioning the company for success in the years ahead. 
We released our financials earlier today, which were towards the higher end of the guidance we provided in September. On the Media Networks side of the business, ratings headwinds and our strategic decision to reduce unit loads at some of our networks put pressure on advertising growth in the quarter. However, the reinvigorated high-performing networks, like Nickelodeon and VH1, have shown that we can generate ad revenue quickly as ratings rebound. And we have brought new management to MTV and Comedy Central to kick-start rating recoveries at those properties. 
In addition, we are significantly increasing our incremental revenues driven by next-generation ad products that are not defined by the traditional currencies. And we are working with the MVPDs on further expanding addressable digital ad insertion at scale. Bob will talk in great detail about our international business, but we are seeing solid strength in those ad markets. Outside the U.S., our ad revenues increased 6% in the quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by -- primarily by strong growth in Europe. 
On a macro level, the advertising marketplace is very good right now, leading to high demand for inventory across all of our networks. Our upfront was strong and scatter in the December quarter continues to look good. We're seeing spending coming out of digital and back into the TV marketplace, which is absorbing inventory and driving price improvements. All of these factors give us confidence in our Q1 results. And we expect to deliver an approximate 500-basis-point improvement over the year-over-year decline in Q4. 
On the affiliate side, we faced challenging comps in the quarter related to a large contribution from an SVOD deal that we accounted for in Q4 2015. Absent the impact of SVOD, on our core traditional affiliate revenue growth, it was essentially flat. However, we're looking ahead with confidence with most of our distribution partners committed to long-term deals at attractive rates and our continued growth in cable share in the quarter. As OTT options continue to grow, we are extremely optimistic about the particular value of Viacom's younger-skewing networks in those offerings. We are approaching each of those opportunities very strategically with a view to driving the most long-term value for the portfolio overall. 
The popularity of these services makes it increasingly difficult to measure consumption. So we've been working to fine-tune our internal metrics to capture all points of monetization and monetizable viewing, including linear, cable VOD and SVOD. Based on this analysis, the consumption of Viacom Media Networks' content across all the domestic linear and digital platforms is increasing on an absolute basis and up 3% in the quarter year-over-year. 
One of the offerings we're very enthusiastic about is DIRECTV NOW. It delivers a robust bundle with 11 Viacom networks in its 100-network portfolio. We view it as a complementary offering to the marketplace, opening up new options for a generation of young consumers who love our programming but have a resistance to signing up with a traditional cable-delivered bundle. We are also working with other existing distribution partners to define new ways to make content available to them on an increasing number of platforms. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see an increase in our domestic affiliate growth to low single digits, which assumes the impact of a low single-digit decline in the overall cable subscriber universe. 
Moving on to quickly touch upon some of our key networks. Nickelodeon continues to thrive, extending its winning streak to 5 straight quarters at #1 total day with kids 2 to 11 and kids 2 to 5 with a double-digit lead against its 2 largest competitors. Nick's success can't be overstated. The network owned the top 6 shows on TV for kids 2 to 11 in the quarter, including the overall #1 program, The Thundermans. The quarter's top animated program for this demo, the Loud House, is one of the fastest-growing kids' hits, having launched in May at #1 and stayed on top since then. We're in season 2 already. And to meet the audience's demand for this homegrown Nickelodeon show, we have already announced the pickup of season 3. It's a great example of our commitment to quick, assertive investments to keep our most popular content on the air and fresh, which has been -- which we've been applying more and more aggressively to our growing number of Nickelodeon hits. 
Moving offscreen. Nick is actively expanding its recreational offerings to serve the whole family with initiatives like the 5-star luxury Nick Resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and the fast-selling family show, PAW Patrol Live!, based on this year's top preschool show. In consumer products, Nickelodeon continues to have great success with lines based on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and PAW Patrol. Products for Blaze and the Monster Machines and Shimmer and Shine just hit shows this summer and the demand is rising fast, particularly for Shimmer and Shine, which was a Halloween costume favorite this year, a traditional indicator of a property's growing popularity. 
VH1 continues to build on its upward momentum, closing out the quarter with 3 of the top non-sports cable shows and #1-rated reality show, Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta. For the fiscal year, VH1 boasts the fastest-growing growth among cable's top 20 and has delivered ratings increases in 5 consecutive quarters. Chris McCarthy has done an incredible job of driving success at VH1. And last month, we added oversight of MTV to his portfolio. He's fired up about the turnaround opportunities there and we're expecting big things from him. 
And a quick note about Comedy Central, which has been a key focus of ours. South Park has opened its 20th season with the highest ratings it's had for several years. The episodes that aired in the fourth quarter were up 27% over the previous season. And the season premiere was the show's highest-rated episode in a decade. We're also seeing more and more momentum behind Trevor Noah as audience continues to build. The election has put The Daily Show front and center again as Trevor has delivered his highest monthly ratings in October and was the highest-rated and most-watched daily late-night talk show among millennial men. We are projecting that fiscal Q1 is going to be his best-rated quarter ever. 
And finally, the upcoming film slate from Paramount Pictures includes an incredible lineup of filmmakers and stars. This November, the studio will release the critically-acclaimed film, Arrival, starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, as well as Allied, starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. In December, the studio will release the comedy, Office Christmas Party, starring Jennifer Aniston, along with Denzel Washington's Fences and Martin Scorsese's highly anticipated, Silence, based on the acclaimed novel. It's a very strong slate. At Paramount TV, Berlin Station is already in production on seasons 2 and 3 for EPIX. And Shooter, starring Ryan Phillippe and executive produced by Mark Wahlberg, premieres November 15 on USA. It's a quickly growing business and currently Paramount has 30 shows in development. 
Now let's turn the call over to Wade for more about the numbers."

Today, I'm going to cover our operating results, our cash flow and our capital structure, including steps we've taken to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. I will also speak to seasonal factors impacting our fiscal 2017.",866,"Thanks, Tom. Today, I'm going to cover our operating results, our cash flow and our capital structure, including steps we've taken to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. I will also speak to seasonal factors impacting our fiscal 2017. 
Looking at the full year on a total company basis. Viacom generated $12.5 billion of revenue, $2.7 billion of adjusted operating income, $1.2 billion of operating free cash flow and $3.68 of adjusted earnings per share. For the September quarter, total company revenues were $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $538 million. Adjusted net earnings were $273 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.69 for the quarter. 
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues for the quarter were down 11% compared to the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 14%, and international revenues were up 2%. Excluding an 11 percentage point unfavorable foreign currency impact, international revenues were up 13%, reflecting double-digit growth in affiliate and ancillary revenues. Page 8 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. 
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 8% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 8% and international revenues were down 7%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 13 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 6%, driven by continued growth in Europe. 
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues in the quarter were down 16%. Domestic revenues declined 19% in the quarter, principally reflecting lower revenues from SVOD arrangements as we made a strategic decision to reduce the amount of programming we license to these distributors. International affiliate revenues increased 7% in the quarter. Excluding an 8 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international affiliate revenues increased 15%, driven by new channel launches, increased subscribers, rate increases and the completion of certain SVOD arrangements. 
Expenses decreased 2% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense was 5% lower while distribution and other expense decreased 20%. SG&A expense increased 9% in the quarter. The decrease in programming expense in the quarter was principally driven by the timing of airing of original programming. The decline in distribution and other expense primarily reflects lower participations in residuals related to lower SVOD revenue. The increase in SG&A cost was principally due to severance and other employee-related costs. 
Media Networks' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $750 million and the adjusted operating income margin was 30%. The decline in adjusted operating income was driven by the 11% decline in revenues, partially offset by the 2% decrease in revenues. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 24%, principally due to the decrease in theatrical revenues. Page 11 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues decreased to $203 million due to the difficult comparisons to the strong international performance of Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation in the September quarter of last year. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $137 million in the quarter. The decline versus the prior-year quarter reflects lower revenues as well as a previously disclosed $115 million programming impairment charge. 
In terms of taxes, the full year adjusted effective tax rate was 31.7%, reflecting a 50 basis point increase as compared to the prior year. 
In terms of our debt, it remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. We had $11.9 billion of total debt and $379 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.9x. We took several steps to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. Subsequent to quarter-end, we issued $400 million of 2.25% senior notes due in 2020 and $900 million of 3.45% senior notes due in 2026. Following the issuance, we initiated the redemption of the $400 million outstanding of our December 2016 notes and the $500 million outstanding of our April 2017 notes. We also reduced our dividend by 50%, starting with the payment we made on October 3. This will provide us with over $300 million of incremental liquidity on an annual basis. Given our strong free cash flow generation, we plan to delever over time in order to preserve our investment-grade status. 
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2017. For the full year, we expect that the Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid- to high single digits. In terms of Media Networks' SG&A expense, we anticipate year-over-year growth to be weighted to the first half of the year due to the timing of spend on multi-platform and data products as well as advertising and promotion expense related to the marketing of new original series. For Paramount, given the timing and mix of our films, we anticipate a higher P&A expense in the December quarter. This will result in difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior-year quarter. In terms of taxes, for 2017, we're forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kern."

As we've discussed on prior calls, Viacom has been investing in data capabilities over the past several years. These investments in research, first-party data and advanced data science are delivering better insights and new tools across our business. A better understanding of our fans and a more sophisticated perspective on how, when and where our content fits into their lives means better support for programming, scheduling, acquisitions, marketing and, of course, our ad sales business. 
In advertising sales, it's perhaps easiest to measure the economic impact of these advances as we can transparently benchmark against the outcomes from traditional approaches to targeting, transacting and measuring the value of television advertising. Because TV advertising has, for years, been measured only in terms of age and gender-based segments, females 18 to 34, for example, advertisers and publishers alike have had to sell, plan and deliver campaigns around metrics that do not actually match with the advertisers' true target audience. 
Because we can't communicate with precision around who an advertiser wants to reach or to whom in fact an ad was delivered, both sides of the marketplace suffer. Let's put this in concrete terms. Imagine an auto manufacturer wants to reach trucking tenders, consumers who may be in the market for a new pickup truck in the next 90 days. In the traditional currency of television, this advertiser would only be able to buy and plan against a traditional demo, like males 18 to 49. Publishers who guarantee delivery against that metric would, logically, deliver units optimized to reach those males 18 to 49 as all other impressions, a 52-year-old, for example, who might very well be actively shopping for a truck, would be considered waste and would not be appropriately valued. 
Now, however, our increasingly sophisticated use of data from multiple sources allows us to understand our audience in more detail than ever before. For the first time, it's possible to accurately identify our fans and viewers, not just by their age and gender but their income, location, brand awareness, shopping patterns, intentions and even aspirations. Ultimately, this high-resolution view of our fans and our advertisers' target audience allows us to better match advertiser campaigns with our content. This means better results for our advertisers and for our own business. 
Going back to that trucking tender we talked about. Viacom would use all available privacy-compliant data to identify households in which a truck ad could have maximum impact and we would optimize delivery against those homes. The advertiser in turn can now measure the success of the campaign and pay Viacom for those impressions that reach the actual target; not a blunt proxy based only on age and gender. 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about the infrastructure required to do this as it represents a very real and proprietary position of leadership for Viacom. We started with our first-party data management platform fueled by direct one-to-one engagement with our fans on social and digital platforms, which in total represent more than half the households in the U.S. Over the last 2 years, we've extended that reach with unique access to set-top box data from tens of millions of homes, real-time location data from hundreds of millions of mobile devices and commerce patterns from multiple sources including, but not limited to, our multiyear exclusive partnership with American Express. 
All of this data, representing literally billions of new data points, informing our perspective on the intersection of content and commerce each month, is carefully de-identified, combined and analyzed by our teams of researchers, marketers and data scientists. From the perspective of our advertisers, these improvements in audience precision and the better matching of content and viewership with their campaign yield demonstrably higher engagement and more measurable impact. Based on these results, we have seen 100% retention and steady year-over-year growth in advertiser participation. 
Further, when fewer impressions are delivered outside the intended target, those impressions that would otherwise be considered wasted for one advertiser can be intelligently allocated to other advertisers for whom they deliver real value. With television inventory fundamentally oversubscribed, every impression that is reallocated for greater impact translates directly to our bottom line. All of this has been talked about for many years, but in many cases, has lived only in the realm of theory or it was perceived to be locked up with the long-term potential of one-to-one addressable advertising. At Viacom, however, we have begun to see real results from our growing capabilities in data science as it has enabled sophisticated targeting, advanced currencies and more precise and transparent reporting of results. 
In this last upfront, Viacom wrote more than 50 deals that included Viacom Vantage, our advanced data product, which allows advertisers to target and guarantee against these new metrics. In total, the advertisers who participated in Vantage represented close to $1 billion of upfront commitments, spanning 9 key verticals and 10 major buying agencies. While some of the value unlocked in this approach will grow and show an even greater impact as the infrastructure for addressable TV matures, even today, we're seeing real value return to the marketplace through more efficient and transparent audience measurement. 
Our benchmarks demonstrate that we're unlocking measurably better outcomes for our advertisers. We're already seeing this upside in the revenue per impression delivered through Viacom Vantage. As we continue to work together with our partners in the linear television ecosystem to scale this capability across a larger portion of the dollars transacted on Viacom, that growth will continue. As we identify new ways to measure and value impressions delivered outside of the linear ecosystem, most of which go entirely unmonetized or undermonetized today, we anticipate an even greater impact on our advertising business. 
And now I'll turn it over to Bob."

Before I begin, I have to say a few words of appreciation. Tom Dooley has dedicated 35 years of his life to this company as a driving force behind many of its biggest wins and a steady hand during times of transition, and most recently, p",1319,"Thank you, Kern. Before I begin, I have to say a few words of appreciation. Tom Dooley has dedicated 35 years of his life to this company as a driving force behind many of its biggest wins and a steady hand during times of transition, and most recently, provided assured, excellent leadership throughout the changes this year. I'm honored to be taking the handoff from him and I'm grateful for his wisdom and counsel. 
I'd also like to say thank you to Sumner, Shari, Tom May and the entire Viacom board for this amazing opportunity, but even more so, for their tireless drive to do right by Viacom. And while the board and its special committee consider whether a CBS transaction makes sense, they've asked me to maximize Viacom's potential as an independent company. And I'm committed to doing just that. 
I'm very excited about this new role and the many opportunities at hand for us. I've already pulled together the senior team across the company, and we're at work identifying near-term opportunities to accelerate our evolution while building a long-term vision for the future. At the same time, I'm reimmersing myself in the domestic business with a focus on how we can strengthen MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount. 
While we have our challenges, we also have an incredibly strong foundation from which to build. It is important to remember that Viacom has the highest share of viewing in the U.S. among all cable groups in every demo in which we compete. And worldwide, Viacom is the largest global media company by reach. We have a very strong footing. And I look forward to sharing more detailed plans on how we can build off it as soon as I can. 
But today, I want to take the opportunity to give you a bit of a window on how I think and how I operate. And the best way to do that is to look at how we've transformed Viacom International Media Networks. I joined Viacom's international business in 2007. It was at a crossroads, too focused on MTV, too dependent on the U.S. for content, too disconnected from market-to-market around the world. In the past decade, our team has addressed these issues and built a true multinational organization. We've diversified dramatically to a portfolio that includes widely distributed MTVs, Nickelodeons and Comedy Centrals, the growing Spike brand and a Paramount Channel, now the largest ad-supported movie channel in the world, and 2 key local players in the U.K.'s Channel 5 and India's COLORS. 
In 2006, MTV accounted for over 80% of our business. Today, no brand accounts for even 30%. We've become a global producer of original content, not just an exporter. We have 2,700 hours of original programming planned for 2017. And much of that consists of highly exportable formats with modest cost per episode. And we've built an organization that is interconnected across brands, businesses and geographies while fostering a culture that provides itself on entrepreneurship, innovation and adaptability. As a result, Viacom International Media Networks just closed its best year ever. 
Looking ahead, we continue to be hugely focused on scale, brands, content and products. First, scale. Our #1 priority in international is to get bigger. We've done this through organic expansion of Nickelodeon and Comedy Central globally and through the more recent international launches of Paramount Channel, Spike and Nick Jr. And we've done very well with big, mass market, general entertainment networks in priority markets. Channel 5 in the U.K. is thriving. It just delivered its most profitable year ever. And it gives Viacom the highest share of any international media company in the biggest market outside the U.S. We also have a leading position in India through our Viacom 18 joint venture, home to the COLORS brand, which is now the fastest-growing media company in the fastest-growing media market in the world. 
Second, on brands. The key word is focus. Rather than launching additional U.S. brands internationally, we focus on international core 6: MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Comedy Central, Paramount Channel and Spike. We're investing to grow these brands while maintaining a lean, powerful portfolio that will be attractive to both pay-TV and emerging distributors, particularly virtual MVPDs. And within that footprint, we have plenty of room to grow. Comedy Central and Paramount Channel remain far less penetrated than MTV. In 2017, we already have launches planned in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Russia, Benelux, Asia and more. 
Third, on the creative side. Viacom International Media Networks' emergence as a global content engine has energized our team and strengthened our ability to localize formats. We shoot multiple versions of our biggest hits concurrently with great economics at our new studio in Miami, Channel 5 in London and production hubs in Amsterdam and Madrid. It's a formula that works. Our U.K. version of Jersey Shore, Geordie Shore, regularly beats Game of Thrones in the demo in its premiere time slot. Yes, you heard that right. Audience share for MTV, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. is up as we localize more formats and increase international production for global use. Meanwhile, we continue to export a lot of U.S. programming, particularly via Nickelodeon, which does very well. 
Fourth and finally, products. Redefining what it means to be a branded TV network across platforms through product innovation is a huge priority for us. Pay-TV penetration outside the U.S. is well under 50%, meaning broadband growth across fixed and mobile platforms has the potential to more than double our distribution by the end of the decade. I believe this is the single biggest opportunity for our business internationally. And while the economics of digital distribution still trail linear, we believe incremental expansion of our reach will pay big returns in the long run for our brands and businesses. And last year's launch of our Viacom Play Plex suite of apps for our international brands was a big step forward in this regard. Each app features full episodes, clips on demand, along with a live linear feed. 
We tailor distribution market-by-market to reach well beyond our linear footprint. For example, we have authenticated deals with pay-TV partners in Mexico, mobile distribution with partners in Asia, our over-the-top and direct-to-consumer as we've done with BET Play in more than 100 countries -- in 100 markets worldwide where BET doesn't have a linear feed. Further, we're proving that product innovation can exist within a traditional TV environment with our personalized interactive linear channels, My Nick Jr. and My MTV. 
I believe a lot of our successful international approach can be brought home to the domestic market. I've seen it work and it's a big reason that I'm truly optimistic about Viacom. As I said earlier, I'm working with the senior management across the company to identify short-term opportunities while building on a long-term strategy. MTV is clearly a priority for me. We've had a lot of success in evolving and strengthening that brand internationally. And I'm very pleased with the recent leadership change here in the U.S. I will seek more collaborative and forward-thinking partnerships with our long-standing domestic distributors. And I'll also be working closely with Paramount. 
Finally, I'll make sure we have a structure that supports speed, sharing of resources and a global outlook. It's imperative that we operate more globally. The opportunity is there. Viacom is home to some of the world's most iconic and internationally resonant brands. I've seen what those brands and our phenomenal people can do when equipped with a focused forward-looking strategy and a strong organization from which to create and connect with millions. 
I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support and commitment to Viacom. I look forward to keeping you informed of our plans and progress. And thank you for joining today's call. I also look forward to an open dialogue. 
With that, I'll pass it back to Tom."

One is remember the big-picture perspective that we, Viacom, have the largest share of viewing of all pay-TV network companies. More specifically, if you look at our portfolio of networks and you take our top 6 networks, roughly 80% to 85% of the affiliate revenue accrues to those. And if you go to the top 8, that number goes to 90% to 95%. So even if you were to look at a scenario where you were to thin the portfolio a bit, the vast, vast majority of economics would be maintained. Second point I'd make on skinny bundles is with the -- particularly the AT&T DIRECTV announcement on their pack, skinny is not really that skinny. And we're thrilled with that deal. We believe it absolutely reflects a marketplace understanding of the value of our networks. And there, we're going to be among having the most -- the largest portfolio of networks on the platform with 11. So that, I think, is also a very strong statement. I would say, broadly speaking, this is a very exciting development in the category, OTT delivery of services and bundles of networks, particularly the ones that are pay-TV-friendly, like the ones I just discussed. It's also, by the way, a huge opportunity internationally, services like Sky NOW. And remember, international pay-TV penetration is far lower than domestic, and so it will provide a lot of upside, very exciting development for the industry for sure. In terms of the positive affiliate, yes, we are confident that we will have a return to growth in the affiliate side of the business as we move forward, even -- and particularly when you look at the domestic, even assuming a universe decline. So our guidance for fiscal Q1 of mid-single-digit 3%-ish growth assumes a 3% decline in the universe. So we will still grow even if there's a universe decline. And then internationally, again, we see significant growth. And you saw the numbers in the quarter."

If you look at the MTV EMA, which happened in Rotterdam last weekend, and you look at its performance on the MTVs all around the world, it is a clear indication, based on the data I've seen to date, of just how powerful improving your platform can be. Because the MTV share in general is up, but the data I have on the EMAs, which isn't all markets yet, it takes time to cobble it together internationally, is on 12 to 24s, we were up 59%, and on 15 to 34s, we were up 42%. So again, it speaks to the vitality. And it's not like we invest far more than the U.S. In MTV, in fact, we invest far, far less. And if you look at the EMA, it costs a fraction of what the VMA costs. So sure, you have to look at resources you have on hand. But I'm absolutely confident that with the resources that Viacom commands, particularly where you can redeploy some of those, we absolutely have the firepower to do it."

And it's about focusing our investments on content and, call it, broad marketing and promotion, including what you're doing in social and the like, on those brands so that they're as strong as possible and have a solid footing regardless of the distribution platform. Clearly, we're very focused on the MVPD space. But the good news about the VMVPD space is increasingly, these are platforms that are operated and therefore consistent with some of the philosophies that are in the -- that are built to pay-TV industry. So by focusing on it, having the right product mix, making sure your teams are really running at it, that is the key enabler because there is not a shadow of a doubt that the distribution infrastructure, particularly through mobile, will be there.

We have deep partnerships around the world with pay-TV operators. And we believe there's incremental opportunity there. And we believe that they are supportive of content businesses such as ours. So we come with a lens of looking for a pay-TV-friendly strategy. And in the last quarter, we've done a mix of deals in traditional pay. By the way, you can see that today, we announced that Spike is going 24 hours in the Netherlands with Ziggo. Ziggo is a Liberty Global company. We have a very significant relationship and partnership with Liberty Global. And they're obviously a key customer of ours. And it's a partnership that works for both of us. And I think the indication is we continue to do more things with them. That's very healthy. At the same time, on the OTT side, many of these partner -- many of these platforms increasingly are, let's use the word related, to a traditional player. The canary in the coal mine on that probably was Sky NOW in the U.K. And really all the distributors around the world, I think it's fair to say, are looking at playing in that space. Then when you look at the traditional -- traditional is a bad word, the SVOD category and you think of aggregators, we will look at that on an opportunity-by-opportunity basis, consider specifics about a market and a specific player and a specific app and determine what we want to do there. They certainly have a role in the world from a consumer perspective, but we are looking at it as part of a holistic strategy. And that will dictate what we do."

The way the flow-through of the business works in terms of profitability, we have P&A upfront. The first few quarters are going to be negative. But we think that Paramount, as it gets to the back half of this year, will have very successful opportunities to begin to turn around and get back to profitability. In particular, we have this little film called Transformers 5 coming out that we have great expectations around and think it's going to be one of the biggest movies of the summer.

As part of doing that, I believe we've got to bring the team together and unlock really what I'm convinced is a whole lot of great thinking throughout the organization and at all levels of the organization, and then identify through that the ideas we want to bring to life. When you look at it from the top-down, there's some clear weakness areas, as we've talked about, MTV. Comedy Central, we have some recent good trend lines in Trevor. By the way, Trevor Noah is significantly stronger internationally than Jon was. So the Trevor Noah franchise is a great one. And the fact that he's really connecting through this election cycle is a very exciting development. And also South Park's 20th, 20-year-old franchise and the new episodes are doing extremely well. And that's another global franchise. So there's some good stuff starting to happen at Comedy Central. And obviously, we'd like to see more happen. On the Paramount side, as Tom and Wade indicated and I've been speaking with Brad regularly and just starting to get into that, obviously the film slate will be highly important. We're also going to see what we can do on the marketing side in the short term to see if that is an incremental opportunity. So I think there's a clear set of priorities and I'm convinced that by working with the team, we will unlock a good action plan. Obviously, part of that will be content investments. But I think it's important that based on -- you understand that based on my experience, a lot of this is about mix of investments, not about you have to spend dramatically more money necessarily. Again, our international experience shows that you can deliver very significant audiences in genres other than high-dollar scripted programming. So I think mix will continue to be an opportunity."

And along with Wade, I am pleased to welcome Kern Schireson, who will provide an overview and update on our industry-leading data strategy. Kern has worked at Viacom for several years to develop and then expand Viacom's capabilities in this area. It's an exciting and quickly growing part of our core business. 
You'll also be hearing from Bob Bakish, who will discuss the recent achievements coming out of our International Media Networks business and his views on the company overall. 
As you know, Bob has been selected to lead the company as CEO. And I believe that there is nobody better suited for that role. Not only has he built critical scale in our complex international businesses, but he has driven technological and strategic innovation while consistently increasing profitability. With that track record, his deep knowledge of our overall business and his appreciation of the people and culture that have made Viacom great, he's exactly the right leader for Viacom's next chapter. 
The special committee of our Board of Directors is continuing to work with its financial and legal advisers to explore the merits of a combination with CBS, but we will not have an update for you today on that process. But we want to be very clear that Viacom will continue to operate for the long term with a strategy of driving growth, building our core businesses and positioning the company for success in the years ahead. 
We released our financials earlier today, which were towards the higher end of the guidance we provided in September. On the Media Networks side of the business, ratings headwinds and our strategic decision to reduce unit loads at some of our networks put pressure on advertising growth in the quarter. However, the reinvigorated high-performing networks, like Nickelodeon and VH1, have shown that we can generate ad revenue quickly as ratings rebound. And we have brought new management to MTV and Comedy Central to kick-start rating recoveries at those properties. 
In addition, we are significantly increasing our incremental revenues driven by next-generation ad products that are not defined by the traditional currencies. And we are working with the MVPDs on further expanding addressable digital ad insertion at scale. Bob will talk in great detail about our international business, but we are seeing solid strength in those ad markets. Outside the U.S., our ad revenues increased 6% in the quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by -- primarily by strong growth in Europe. 
On a macro level, the advertising marketplace is very good right now, leading to high demand for inventory across all of our networks. Our upfront was strong and scatter in the December quarter continues to look good. We're seeing spending coming out of digital and back into the TV marketplace, which is absorbing inventory and driving price improvements. All of these factors give us confidence in our Q1 results. And we expect to deliver an approximate 500-basis-point improvement over the year-over-year decline in Q4. 
On the affiliate side, we faced challenging comps in the quarter related to a large contribution from an SVOD deal that we accounted for in Q4 2015. Absent the impact of SVOD, on our core traditional affiliate revenue growth, it was essentially flat. However, we're looking ahead with confidence with most of our distribution partners committed to long-term deals at attractive rates and our continued growth in cable share in the quarter. As OTT options continue to grow, we are extremely optimistic about the particular value of Viacom's younger-skewing networks in those offerings. We are approaching each of those opportunities very strategically with a view to driving the most long-term value for the portfolio overall. 
The popularity of these services makes it increasingly difficult to measure consumption. So we've been working to fine-tune our internal metrics to capture all points of monetization and monetizable viewing, including linear, cable VOD and SVOD. Based on this analysis, the consumption of Viacom Media Networks' content across all the domestic linear and digital platforms is increasing on an absolute basis and up 3% in the quarter year-over-year. 
One of the offerings we're very enthusiastic about is DIRECTV NOW. It delivers a robust bundle with 11 Viacom networks in its 100-network portfolio. We view it as a complementary offering to the marketplace, opening up new options for a generation of young consumers who love our programming but have a resistance to signing up with a traditional cable-delivered bundle. We are also working with other existing distribution partners to define new ways to make content available to them on an increasing number of platforms. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see an increase in our domestic affiliate growth to low single digits, which assumes the impact of a low single-digit decline in the overall cable subscriber universe. 
Moving on to quickly touch upon some of our key networks. Nickelodeon continues to thrive, extending its winning streak to 5 straight quarters at #1 total day with kids 2 to 11 and kids 2 to 5 with a double-digit lead against its 2 largest competitors. Nick's success can't be overstated. The network owned the top 6 shows on TV for kids 2 to 11 in the quarter, including the overall #1 program, The Thundermans. The quarter's top animated program for this demo, the Loud House, is one of the fastest-growing kids' hits, having launched in May at #1 and stayed on top since then. We're in season 2 already. And to meet the audience's demand for this homegrown Nickelodeon show, we have already announced the pickup of season 3. It's a great example of our commitment to quick, assertive investments to keep our most popular content on the air and fresh, which has been -- which we've been applying more and more aggressively to our growing number of Nickelodeon hits. 
Moving offscreen. Nick is actively expanding its recreational offerings to serve the whole family with initiatives like the 5-star luxury Nick Resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and the fast-selling family show, PAW Patrol Live!, based on this year's top preschool show. In consumer products, Nickelodeon continues to have great success with lines based on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and PAW Patrol. Products for Blaze and the Monster Machines and Shimmer and Shine just hit shows this summer and the demand is rising fast, particularly for Shimmer and Shine, which was a Halloween costume favorite this year, a traditional indicator of a property's growing popularity. 
VH1 continues to build on its upward momentum, closing out the quarter with 3 of the top non-sports cable shows and #1-rated reality show, Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta. For the fiscal year, VH1 boasts the fastest-growing growth among cable's top 20 and has delivered ratings increases in 5 consecutive quarters. Chris McCarthy has done an incredible job of driving success at VH1. And last month, we added oversight of MTV to his portfolio. He's fired up about the turnaround opportunities there and we're expecting big things from him. 
And a quick note about Comedy Central, which has been a key focus of ours. South Park has opened its 20th season with the highest ratings it's had for several years. The episodes that aired in the fourth quarter were up 27% over the previous season. And the season premiere was the show's highest-rated episode in a decade. We're also seeing more and more momentum behind Trevor Noah as audience continues to build. The election has put The Daily Show front and center again as Trevor has delivered his highest monthly ratings in October and was the highest-rated and most-watched daily late-night talk show among millennial men. We are projecting that fiscal Q1 is going to be his best-rated quarter ever. 
And finally, the upcoming film slate from Paramount Pictures includes an incredible lineup of filmmakers and stars. This November, the studio will release the critically-acclaimed film, Arrival, starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, as well as Allied, starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. In December, the studio will release the comedy, Office Christmas Party, starring Jennifer Aniston, along with Denzel Washington's Fences and Martin Scorsese's highly anticipated, Silence, based on the acclaimed novel. It's a very strong slate. At Paramount TV, Berlin Station is already in production on seasons 2 and 3 for EPIX. And Shooter, starring Ryan Phillippe and executive produced by Mark Wahlberg, premieres November 15 on USA. It's a quickly growing business and currently Paramount has 30 shows in development. 
Now let's turn the call over to Wade for more about the numbers."

Today, I'm going to cover our operating results, our cash flow and our capital structure, including steps we've taken to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs.

Today, I'm going to cover our operating results, our cash flow and our capital structure, including steps we've taken to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. I will also speak to seasonal factors impacting our fiscal 2017. 
Looking at the full year on a total company basis. Viacom generated $12.5 billion of revenue, $2.7 billion of adjusted operating income, $1.2 billion of operating free cash flow and $3.68 of adjusted earnings per share. For the September quarter, total company revenues were $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $538 million. Adjusted net earnings were $273 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.69 for the quarter. 
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues for the quarter were down 11% compared to the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 14%, and international revenues were up 2%. Excluding an 11 percentage point unfavorable foreign currency impact, international revenues were up 13%, reflecting double-digit growth in affiliate and ancillary revenues. Page 8 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. 
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 8% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 8% and international revenues were down 7%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 13 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 6%, driven by continued growth in Europe. 
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues in the quarter were down 16%. Domestic revenues declined 19% in the quarter, principally reflecting lower revenues from SVOD arrangements as we made a strategic decision to reduce the amount of programming we license to these distributors. International affiliate revenues increased 7% in the quarter. Excluding an 8 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international affiliate revenues increased 15%, driven by new channel launches, increased subscribers, rate increases and the completion of certain SVOD arrangements. 
Expenses decreased 2% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense was 5% lower while distribution and other expense decreased 20%. SG&A expense increased 9% in the quarter. The decrease in programming expense in the quarter was principally driven by the timing of airing of original programming. The decline in distribution and other expense primarily reflects lower participations in residuals related to lower SVOD revenue. The increase in SG&A cost was principally due to severance and other employee-related costs. 
Media Networks' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $750 million and the adjusted operating income margin was 30%. The decline in adjusted operating income was driven by the 11% decline in revenues, partially offset by the 2% decrease in revenues. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 24%, principally due to the decrease in theatrical revenues. Page 11 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues decreased to $203 million due to the difficult comparisons to the strong international performance of Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation in the September quarter of last year. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $137 million in the quarter. The decline versus the prior-year quarter reflects lower revenues as well as a previously disclosed $115 million programming impairment charge. 
In terms of taxes, the full year adjusted effective tax rate was 31.7%, reflecting a 50 basis point increase as compared to the prior year. 
In terms of our debt, it remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. We had $11.9 billion of total debt and $379 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.9x. We took several steps to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. Subsequent to quarter-end, we issued $400 million of 2.25% senior notes due in 2020 and $900 million of 3.45% senior notes due in 2026. Following the issuance, we initiated the redemption of the $400 million outstanding of our December 2016 notes and the $500 million outstanding of our April 2017 notes. We also reduced our dividend by 50%, starting with the payment we made on October 3. This will provide us with over $300 million of incremental liquidity on an annual basis. Given our strong free cash flow generation, we plan to delever over time in order to preserve our investment-grade status. 
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2017. For the full year, we expect that the Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid- to high single digits. In terms of Media Networks' SG&A expense, we anticipate year-over-year growth to be weighted to the first half of the year due to the timing of spend on multi-platform and data products as well as advertising and promotion expense related to the marketing of new original series. For Paramount, given the timing and mix of our films, we anticipate a higher P&A expense in the December quarter. This will result in difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior-year quarter. In terms of taxes, for 2017, we're forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kern."

As we've discussed on prior calls, Viacom has been investing in data capabilities over the past several years. These investments in research, first-party data and advanced data science are delivering better insights and new tools across our business. A better understanding of our fans and a more sophisticated perspective on how, when and where our content fits into their lives means better support for programming, scheduling, acquisitions, marketing and, of course, our ad sales business. 
In advertising sales, it's perhaps easiest to measure the economic impact of these advances as we can transparently benchmark against the outcomes from traditional approaches to targeting, transacting and measuring the value of television advertising. Because TV advertising has, for years, been measured only in terms of age and gender-based segments, females 18 to 34, for example, advertisers and publishers alike have had to sell, plan and deliver campaigns around metrics that do not actually match with the advertisers' true target audience. 
Because we can't communicate with precision around who an advertiser wants to reach or to whom in fact an ad was delivered, both sides of the marketplace suffer. Let's put this in concrete terms. Imagine an auto manufacturer wants to reach trucking tenders, consumers who may be in the market for a new pickup truck in the next 90 days. In the traditional currency of television, this advertiser would only be able to buy and plan against a traditional demo, like males 18 to 49. Publishers who guarantee delivery against that metric would, logically, deliver units optimized to reach those males 18 to 49 as all other impressions, a 52-year-old, for example, who might very well be actively shopping for a truck, would be considered waste and would not be appropriately valued. 
Now, however, our increasingly sophisticated use of data from multiple sources allows us to understand our audience in more detail than ever before. For the first time, it's possible to accurately identify our fans and viewers, not just by their age and gender but their income, location, brand awareness, shopping patterns, intentions and even aspirations. Ultimately, this high-resolution view of our fans and our advertisers' target audience allows us to better match advertiser campaigns with our content. This means better results for our advertisers and for our own business. 
Going back to that trucking tender we talked about. Viacom would use all available privacy-compliant data to identify households in which a truck ad could have maximum impact and we would optimize delivery against those homes. The advertiser in turn can now measure the success of the campaign and pay Viacom for those impressions that reach the actual target; not a blunt proxy based only on age and gender. 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about the infrastructure required to do this as it represents a very real and proprietary position of leadership for Viacom. We started with our first-party data management platform fueled by direct one-to-one engagement with our fans on social and digital platforms, which in total represent more than half the households in the U.S. Over the last 2 years, we've extended that reach with unique access to set-top box data from tens of millions of homes, real-time location data from hundreds of millions of mobile devices and commerce patterns from multiple sources including, but not limited to, our multiyear exclusive partnership with American Express. 
All of this data, representing literally billions of new data points, informing our perspective on the intersection of content and commerce each month, is carefully de-identified, combined and analyzed by our teams of researchers, marketers and data scientists. From the perspective of our advertisers, these improvements in audience precision and the better matching of content and viewership with their campaign yield demonstrably higher engagement and more measurable impact. Based on these results, we have seen 100% retention and steady year-over-year growth in advertiser participation. 
Further, when fewer impressions are delivered outside the intended target, those impressions that would otherwise be considered wasted for one advertiser can be intelligently allocated to other advertisers for whom they deliver real value. With television inventory fundamentally oversubscribed, every impression that is reallocated for greater impact translates directly to our bottom line. All of this has been talked about for many years, but in many cases, has lived only in the realm of theory or it was perceived to be locked up with the long-term potential of one-to-one addressable advertising. At Viacom, however, we have begun to see real results from our growing capabilities in data science as it has enabled sophisticated targeting, advanced currencies and more precise and transparent reporting of results. 
In this last upfront, Viacom wrote more than 50 deals that included Viacom Vantage, our advanced data product, which allows advertisers to target and guarantee against these new metrics. In total, the advertisers who participated in Vantage represented close to $1 billion of upfront commitments, spanning 9 key verticals and 10 major buying agencies. While some of the value unlocked in this approach will grow and show an even greater impact as the infrastructure for addressable TV matures, even today, we're seeing real value return to the marketplace through more efficient and transparent audience measurement. 
Our benchmarks demonstrate that we're unlocking measurably better outcomes for our advertisers. We're already seeing this upside in the revenue per impression delivered through Viacom Vantage. As we continue to work together with our partners in the linear television ecosystem to scale this capability across a larger portion of the dollars transacted on Viacom, that growth will continue. As we identify new ways to measure and value impressions delivered outside of the linear ecosystem, most of which go entirely unmonetized or undermonetized today, we anticipate an even greater impact on our advertising business. 
And now I'll turn it over to Bob."

Before I begin, I have to say a few words of appreciation. Tom Dooley has dedicated 35 years of his life to this company as a driving force behind many of its biggest wins and a steady hand during times of transition, and most recently, p",1319,"Thank you, Kern. Before I begin, I have to say a few words of appreciation. Tom Dooley has dedicated 35 years of his life to this company as a driving force behind many of its biggest wins and a steady hand during times of transition, and most recently, provided assured, excellent leadership throughout the changes this year. I'm honored to be taking the handoff from him and I'm grateful for his wisdom and counsel. 
I'd also like to say thank you to Sumner, Shari, Tom May and the entire Viacom board for this amazing opportunity, but even more so, for their tireless drive to do right by Viacom. And while the board and its special committee consider whether a CBS transaction makes sense, they've asked me to maximize Viacom's potential as an independent company. And I'm committed to doing just that. 
I'm very excited about this new role and the many opportunities at hand for us. I've already pulled together the senior team across the company, and we're at work identifying near-term opportunities to accelerate our evolution while building a long-term vision for the future. At the same time, I'm reimmersing myself in the domestic business with a focus on how we can strengthen MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount. 
While we have our challenges, we also have an incredibly strong foundation from which to build. It is important to remember that Viacom has the highest share of viewing in the U.S. among all cable groups in every demo in which we compete. And worldwide, Viacom is the largest global media company by reach. We have a very strong footing. And I look forward to sharing more detailed plans on how we can build off it as soon as I can. 
But today, I want to take the opportunity to give you a bit of a window on how I think and how I operate. And the best way to do that is to look at how we've transformed Viacom International Media Networks. I joined Viacom's international business in 2007. It was at a crossroads, too focused on MTV, too dependent on the U.S. for content, too disconnected from market-to-market around the world. In the past decade, our team has addressed these issues and built a true multinational organization. We've diversified dramatically to a portfolio that includes widely distributed MTVs, Nickelodeons and Comedy Centrals, the growing Spike brand and a Paramount Channel, now the largest ad-supported movie channel in the world, and 2 key local players in the U.K.'s Channel 5 and India's COLORS. 
In 2006, MTV accounted for over 80% of our business. Today, no brand accounts for even 30%. We've become a global producer of original content, not just an exporter. We have 2,700 hours of original programming planned for 2017. And much of that consists of highly exportable formats with modest cost per episode. And we've built an organization that is interconnected across brands, businesses and geographies while fostering a culture that provides itself on entrepreneurship, innovation and adaptability. As a result, Viacom International Media Networks just closed its best year ever. 
Looking ahead, we continue to be hugely focused on scale, brands, content and products. First, scale. Our #1 priority in international is to get bigger. We've done this through organic expansion of Nickelodeon and Comedy Central globally and through the more recent international launches of Paramount Channel, Spike and Nick Jr. And we've done very well with big, mass market, general entertainment networks in priority markets. Channel 5 in the U.K. is thriving. It just delivered its most profitable year ever. And it gives Viacom the highest share of any international media company in the biggest market outside the U.S. We also have a leading position in India through our Viacom 18 joint venture, home to the COLORS brand, which is now the fastest-growing media company in the fastest-growing media market in the world. 
Second, on brands. The key word is focus. Rather than launching additional U.S. brands internationally, we focus on international core 6: MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Comedy Central, Paramount Channel and Spike. We're investing to grow these brands while maintaining a lean, powerful portfolio that will be attractive to both pay-TV and emerging distributors, particularly virtual MVPDs. And within that footprint, we have plenty of room to grow. Comedy Central and Paramount Channel remain far less penetrated than MTV. In 2017, we already have launches planned in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Russia, Benelux, Asia and more. 
Third, on the creative side. Viacom International Media Networks' emergence as a global content engine has energized our team and strengthened our ability to localize formats. We shoot multiple versions of our biggest hits concurrently with great economics at our new studio in Miami, Channel 5 in London and production hubs in Amsterdam and Madrid. It's a formula that works. Our U.K. version of Jersey Shore, Geordie Shore, regularly beats Game of Thrones in the demo in its premiere time slot. Yes, you heard that right. Audience share for MTV, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. is up as we localize more formats and increase international production for global use. Meanwhile, we continue to export a lot of U.S. programming, particularly via Nickelodeon, which does very well. 
Fourth and finally, products. Redefining what it means to be a branded TV network across platforms through product innovation is a huge priority for us. Pay-TV penetration outside the U.S. is well under 50%, meaning broadband growth across fixed and mobile platforms has the potential to more than double our distribution by the end of the decade. I believe this is the single biggest opportunity for our business internationally. And while the economics of digital distribution still trail linear, we believe incremental expansion of our reach will pay big returns in the long run for our brands and businesses. And last year's launch of our Viacom Play Plex suite of apps for our international brands was a big step forward in this regard. Each app features full episodes, clips on demand, along with a live linear feed. 
We tailor distribution market-by-market to reach well beyond our linear footprint. For example, we have authenticated deals with pay-TV partners in Mexico, mobile distribution with partners in Asia, our over-the-top and direct-to-consumer as we've done with BET Play in more than 100 countries -- in 100 markets worldwide where BET doesn't have a linear feed. Further, we're proving that product innovation can exist within a traditional TV environment with our personalized interactive linear channels, My Nick Jr. and My MTV. 
I believe a lot of our successful international approach can be brought home to the domestic market. I've seen it work and it's a big reason that I'm truly optimistic about Viacom. As I said earlier, I'm working with the senior management across the company to identify short-term opportunities while building on a long-term strategy. MTV is clearly a priority for me. We've had a lot of success in evolving and strengthening that brand internationally. And I'm very pleased with the recent leadership change here in the U.S. I will seek more collaborative and forward-thinking partnerships with our long-standing domestic distributors. And I'll also be working closely with Paramount. 
Finally, I'll make sure we have a structure that supports speed, sharing of resources and a global outlook. It's imperative that we operate more globally. The opportunity is there. Viacom is home to some of the world's most iconic and internationally resonant brands. I've seen what those brands and our phenomenal people can do when equipped with a focused forward-looking strategy and a strong organization from which to create and connect with millions. 
I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support and commitment to Viacom. I look forward to keeping you informed of our plans and progress. And thank you for joining today's call. I also look forward to an open dialogue. 
With that, I'll pass it back to Tom."

One is remember the big-picture perspective that we, Viacom, have the largest share of viewing of all pay-TV network companies. More specifically, if you look at our portfolio of networks and you take our top 6 networks, roughly 80% to 85% of the affiliate revenue accrues to those. And if you go to the top 8, that number goes to 90% to 95%. So even if you were to look at a scenario where you were to thin the portfolio a bit, the vast, vast majority of economics would be maintained. Second point I'd make on skinny bundles is with the -- particularly the AT&T DIRECTV announcement on their pack, skinny is not really that skinny. And we're thrilled with that deal. We believe it absolutely reflects a marketplace understanding of the value of our networks. And there, we're going to be among having the most -- the largest portfolio of networks on the platform with 11. So that, I think, is also a very strong statement. I would say, broadly speaking, this is a very exciting development in the category, OTT delivery of services and bundles of networks, particularly the ones that are pay-TV-friendly, like the ones I just discussed. It's also, by the way, a huge opportunity internationally, services like Sky NOW. And remember, international pay-TV penetration is far lower than domestic, and so it will provide a lot of upside, very exciting development for the industry for sure. In terms of the positive affiliate, yes, we are confident that we will have a return to growth in the affiliate side of the business as we move forward, even -- and particularly when you look at the domestic, even assuming a universe decline. So our guidance for fiscal Q1 of mid-single-digit 3%-ish growth assumes a 3% decline in the universe. So we will still grow even if there's a universe decline. And then internationally, again, we see significant growth. And you saw the numbers in the quarter."

If you look at the MTV EMA, which happened in Rotterdam last weekend, and you look at its performance on the MTVs all around the world, it is a clear indication, based on the data I've seen to date, of just how powerful improving your platform can be. Because the MTV share in general is up, but the data I have on the EMAs, which isn't all markets yet, it takes time to cobble it together internationally, is on 12 to 24s, we were up 59%, and on 15 to 34s, we were up 42%. So again, it speaks to the vitality. And it's not like we invest far more than the U.S. In MTV, in fact, we invest far, far less. And if you look at the EMA, it costs a fraction of what the VMA costs. So sure, you have to look at resources you have on hand. But I'm absolutely confident that with the resources that Viacom commands, particularly where you can redeploy some of those, we absolutely have the firepower to do it."

And those persuadable audiences, people who are about to embark on moving in with a partner, purchasing a new vehicle, growing their family, those are really, really exciting moments.

And as we build, we talk about this what we call VIMN, Viacom International Media Networks, core 6. And it's about focusing our investments on content and, call it, broad marketing and promotion, including what you're doing in social and the like, on those brands so that they're as strong as possible and have a solid footing regardless of the distribution platform. Clearly, we're very focused on the MVPD space. But the good news about the VMVPD space is increasingly, these are platforms that are operated and therefore consistent with some of the philosophies that are in the -- that are built to pay-TV industry. So by focusing on it, having the right product mix, making sure your teams are really running at it, that is the key enabler because there is not a shadow of a doubt that the distribution infrastructure, particularly through mobile, will be there.

We have deep partnerships around the world with pay-TV operators. And we believe there's incremental opportunity there. And we believe that they are supportive of content businesses such as ours. So we come with a lens of looking for a pay-TV-friendly strategy. And in the last quarter, we've done a mix of deals in traditional pay. By the way, you can see that today, we announced that Spike is going 24 hours in the Netherlands with Ziggo. Ziggo is a Liberty Global company. We have a very significant relationship and partnership with Liberty Global. And they're obviously a key customer of ours. And it's a partnership that works for both of us. And I think the indication is we continue to do more things with them. That's very healthy. At the same time, on the OTT side, many of these partner -- many of these platforms increasingly are, let's use the word related, to a traditional player. The canary in the coal mine on that probably was Sky NOW in the U.K. And really all the distributors around the world, I think it's fair to say, are looking at playing in that space. Then when you look at the traditional -- traditional is a bad word, the SVOD category and you think of aggregators, we will look at that on an opportunity-by-opportunity basis, consider specifics about a market and a specific player and a specific app and determine what we want to do there. They certainly have a role in the world from a consumer perspective, but we are looking at it as part of a holistic strategy. And that will dictate what we do."

We're very excited about Arrival and Allied and the other 2 distribution deals that we've got teed up. And I think those are -- that's the beginning of the turnaround. The way the flow-through of the business works in terms of profitability, we have P&A upfront. The first few quarters are going to be negative. But we think that Paramount, as it gets to the back half of this year, will have very successful opportunities to begin to turn around and get back to profitability. In particular, we have this little film called Transformers 5 coming out that we have great expectations around and think it's going to be one of the biggest movies of the summer. Wade, do you want to add to that?"

So a couple of things, as I stated in my remarks, I am -- I've been chartered by the board to focus on running Viacom as an independent company. That is very much my mandate and what they've asked me to do. As part of doing that, I believe we've got to bring the team together and unlock really what I'm convinced is a whole lot of great thinking throughout the organization and at all levels of the organization, and then identify through that the ideas we want to bring to life. When you look at it from the top-down, there's some clear weakness areas, as we've talked about, MTV. Comedy Central, we have some recent good trend lines in Trevor. By the way, Trevor Noah is significantly stronger internationally than Jon was. So the Trevor Noah franchise is a great one. And the fact that he's really connecting through this election cycle is a very exciting development. And also South Park's 20th, 20-year-old franchise and the new episodes are doing extremely well. And that's another global franchise. So there's some good stuff starting to happen at Comedy Central. And obviously, we'd like to see more happen. On the Paramount side, as Tom and Wade indicated and I've been speaking with Brad regularly and just starting to get into that, obviously the film slate will be highly important. We're also going to see what we can do on the marketing side in the short term to see if that is an incremental opportunity. So I think there's a clear set of priorities and I'm convinced that by working with the team, we will unlock a good action plan. Obviously, part of that will be content investments. But I think it's important that based on -- you understand that based on my experience, a lot of this is about mix of investments, not about you have to spend dramatically more money necessarily. Again, our international experience shows that you can deliver very significant audiences in genres other than high-dollar scripted programming. So I think mix will continue to be an opportunity."

I think Brad Grey and his team, he's made changes on his team and is focused on putting in place the kind of movies that we think will result in a significant turnaround and refocused on bottom line profitability and the type of movies that he's putting into production. And as I said, as we look down the road here and I think as we get through the end of this quarter, you'll see Paramount having a much better performance in the pictures that it's putting into the marketplace.
