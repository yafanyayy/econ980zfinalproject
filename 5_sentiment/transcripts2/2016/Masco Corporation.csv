Please turn to Slide 4. 2015 was a transformative year for Masco. This time last year, we outlined the 3 elements of our strategy for value creation: number one, realizing the full potential of our core businesses; number two, leveraging opportunity across those businesses; and number three, actively managing our portfolio. 
Our focused execution enabled us to achieve the objectives we set out for ourselves in each of these areas. In 2015, we delivered solid full year results. We created a stronger foundation for future profitable growth, and we generated greater shareholder value. 
On June 30, we successfully spun off our installation segment, transforming Masco into a global branded building products company, where our distinct advantages, brands and innovation are key success factors. These distinct advantages as well as our operating discipline we've deployed in our businesses drove both top and bottom line growth. 
Our revenues for the year grew 6%, excluding the impact of currency. Notably, despite a weakening global economy, our international revenues increased 4% in local currency. Our operating margin grew 190 basis points to 13%, our highest operating margin since 2006, demonstrating our strong operating leverage and operational execution. All 4 of our segments contributed to this top and bottom line growth by continuing to capitalize on their leadership positions in the building products industry. 
Let me provide you with some key highlights. Most impressive was the turnaround story of our Cabinet business. By driving share gains at retail and dealer channels with KraftMaid, realizing significant benefits from cost savings initiatives and improving pricing dynamics in the builder channel, we drove a remarkable 810 basis points improvement in operating margin, surpassing everyone's expectations. We are proud of this accomplishment and excited about the future outlook of this business. 
Our Plumbing segment had another outstanding year. By leveraging the strength of their brands and innovative products, Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins, our spa business, each broke sales and profit records in 2015. Illustrating their leadership -- industry leadership, Hansgrohe was recognized with numerous international design awards, and Delta Faucet received the 2015 WaterSense Sustained Excellence Award, the highest recognition from the Environmental Protection Agency for their exemplary effort to support water efficiency. 
And our Decorative Architectural segment, Behr drove gallon growth with their innovative new product BEHR MARQUEE, their expansion into the Pro segment and their award-winning customer satisfaction levels. We remain committed to investing behind our growth initiatives, including launching 4 new Pro paint supercenters in 2015, which further improve our fulfillment and service capabilities to the professional paint contractor. 
Behr's leadership position in the architectural paint industry was reaffirmed with its #1 ranking in the J.D. Power's 2015 pink satisfaction study in the interior paint category. From a quality perspective, Behr distinguished itself by simultaneously being awarded a #1 ranking in interior paint, exterior paint and exterior stains by leading consumer testing organization. 
In our Other Specialty Products segment, Milgard Windows, the leading window brand in the Western United States, successfully capitalized on new home construction growth and growing repair/remodel demand for higher-end offerings. 
Capping off Masco's strong operational performance this year was our ability to generate nearly $0.5 billion in cash. Consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy, we returned over $575 million to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends in 2015. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and great performance in 2015. 
I will now turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail."

As Irene mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges. 
Our 2015 performance was characterized by strong sales growth, driven by customer-focused innovation and solid operating margin expansion resulting from cost control and productivity improvements. The fourth quarter was our 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and profit growth. 
We finished the year strong with both our fourth quarter and full year sales increasing 6%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. All of our segments contributed to our strong sales growth in 2015. 
Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the fourth quarter by approximately $45 million and the full year by approximately $250 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies, including the euro, pound and Canadian dollar. North American sales increased 6%, excluding the impact of currency for both the fourth quarter and the full year through strong demand of our repair and remodeling and new home construction products across all channels of distribution. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity represents approximately 83% of our total sales. 
International sales increased 4% in local currency in the quarter and grew about [ph] 5% in local currency for the full year as our international plumbing and window businesses continued to perform above expectations. Demonstrating our ability to leverage SG&A as we drive growth, our SG&A as a percent of sales improved 50 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18.5% and improved 20 basis points for the full year to 18.6% of sales. And we delivered solid bottom line performance as operating income increased 31% in the quarter to $219 million with operating margin expanding 280 basis points to 12.8%. 
For the full year, operating income increased 19% to $927 million with operating margin expanding 190 basis points to 13%. The effective currency negatively impacted operating income by approximately $6 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $42 million for the full year. For the fourth quarter, our EPS increased 61% to $0.29 and for the full year, increased 35% to $1.19. 
Please turn to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment continued its momentum on both a top and bottom line in the fourth quarter. Sales increased 10%, excluding the impact of currency. This solid performance was driven by strong sales increases of faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products. 
We're also pleased with our European performance in the quarter as our international plumbing businesses grew 5% in local currency despite a tepid macro environment. Operating profit in the quarter increased 19%, excluding the impact of currency driven by incremental volume and a favorable price/commodity relationship, particularly in Europe. 
Turning to the full year 2015, this segment delivered another terrific performance as demonstrated by our Delta Hansgrohe and Watkins businesses, all experiencing record sales in operating profit. Excluding the $218 million of foreign currency translation, sales increased 8% driven by growth in faucets, showers, spas and new program wins in rough plumbing. 
North American sales increased 10%, excluding the $31 million impact of foreign currency related to the Canadian dollar as we continue to experience strong sales growth in both the trade and retail channels in 2015. More specifically, our luxury brand, Brizo, continues to drive consumer demand in trade and showrooms for our innovative new products such as kitchen faucet. In addition, Delta gained share in faucets, showers and bathing with new product introductions at retail and trade. 
Our European businesses continued to outperform, delivering 5% growth in local currency as Hansgrohe grew its share in its core Central European markets with new faucet and shower offerings. And excluding the $30 million impact of foreign currency translation and the unfavorable impact of our commodity hedge of $14 million [ph], full year operating income increased 9%. 
Turning to Slide 8. In the Decorative Architectural product segment, fourth quarter sales decreased 4%, driven by reduced paint and stain volumes in the DIY channel. This decline was driven in part by difficult year-over-year comparison. You may recall in the fourth quarter of 2014, the timing of inventory replenishment orders favorably impacted our results as the segment sales increased 7% in the fourth quarter of last year -- 2014. 
Solid sales -- solid gains in the Pro channel partially offset this decline. If you exclude the period impacted by the timing of replenishment orders, we experienced mid-single-digit gallon growth in the quarter. 
Full year sales grew 2%, excluding the $11 million impact of currency due to the introduction of BEHR MARQUEE Interior paints, strong BEHR PRO growth and Liberty Hardware's continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. Operating income increased 6% in the fourth quarter, and for the full year, operating income grew 12% over the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are very pleased with the execution of the turnaround plan by the Cabinet team in 2015. Segment sales increased 5% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. 
We continued our momentum from the third quarter with strong KraftMaid sales in the retail channel. Additionally, our dealer-exclusive KraftMaid Vantage product line is performing very well in the dealer channel and delivered both increased volume and favorable mix. Partially offsetting this growth was the deliberate exit of certain low-margin direct to builder business. 
Segment profitability in the fourth quarter improved $26 million over the prior year, and our operating margin was 7.5%, our best fourth quarter margin in this segment since 2007. For the full year, operating profit improved $82 million to $51 million, which was $10 million more than we anticipated at the end of the third quarter. This was due to continued growth of our higher price point semicustom KraftMaid offering and the benefits associated with operational and other cost savings initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 10. Milgard capped off 2015 with a great fourth quarter as they continue to drive higher volume and have favorable mix shift through our premium window and door product lines. Milguard's growth, coupled with gains from the recent acquisition of Evolution Windows in the U.K., resulted in Q4 segment sales increasing 9%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. This segment's operating profit was flat excluding foreign currency translation, primarily due to increased volume and improved mix, offset by increased ERP spend and other costs. 
For the full year, segment sales grew 10%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation with strong window growth in the U.S. with our dealers and custom builders as consumers upgraded their purchases to higher price point product. This strong volume growth and improved mix resulted in operating profit improvement of 25%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
And turning to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet was strong with approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity. This will enable us to execute on balanced capital allocation strategy of investing in our business -- to growing our businesses, pursuing strategic M&A, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and strengthening our financial flexibility by reducing our outstanding debt. We continue to produce some of the best working capital results in the industry as working capital as a percent of sales dropped to a record low, 11.1%, at year-end. This is the result of great execution in our supply chain initiatives that helped us generate nearly $500 million in free cash flow in 2015. At the same time, we delivered and our commitment to return capital to shareholders by repurchasing 17.2 million shares in 2015 and raising our dividend in the fourth quarter. 
Now with that, I'll pass the call back over to Keith."

And as we enter 2016, we look forward to capitalizing on the momentum that we've built over this past year. 
Despite a level of global economic ambiguity, we remain encouraged with the opportunities before us. The fundamentals driving our core U.S.-based repair and remodel business, which I'll remind you represents approximately 80% of our sales, are strong. Interest rates remain at historically low levels, which support home affordability. Demographic trends are increasingly favorable, which to drive household formations. Home prices are appreciating, boosting consumers' confidence to invest in their homes. U.S. residential housing stock is aging with the average age of the U.S. home 35 years, and housing turnover, which is a leading indicator for our repair/remodel business, has accelerated. Our international businesses have demonstrated that they can perform even in periods of economic volatility as demonstrated by our international sales growth of 4% in local currency. 
We will continue to drive shareholder value by deploying the capital we generate from our strong free cash flow, including investing in organic growth, investing in strategic M&A, continuing opportunistic share buybacks inconsistent dividends and retiring debt. Given our industry-leading positions, robust innovation pipeline and the operational benefits from our Masco Operating System, we remain on track to reach our 2017 EPS target of $1.80 that we set for ourselves back in 2015. 
With that, I'll now open the call up for Q&A."

And now that Joe Gross and the team at Masco Cabinetry really had a chance to execute on turnaround plan, we are seeing very good growth with particularly our KraftMaid brand at both retail and the dealer channel.

In terms of the international ambiguity and some of the risk there, we have a very strong business in Hansgrohe. We sell to some 135 countries, and I think with their 2015 4% growth demonstration of their capabilities that, that tells me that we figured out how to maneuver through this ambiguity.

The value of the Vantage product offering that we launched is significant, and there -- that volume is a mix help for us. So we are seeing some favorable mix in cabinets. Clearly, we've done a good job of cost takeouts. We had, as you recall, some significant issues around in ERP implementation in '14. We've put that behind us, and the team is really locked and loaded in on a pipeline of further cost reduction. So we're continuing to drive it, but admittedly, the year-over-year cost takeouts will not be as strong as they were when we look at '16 versus '15 as they were in '15 versus '14. The better you get, the harder it is to get better. We took a lot of that cost issues out of the ERP systems, but we're going to continue to work on it. So going forward, more specifically, you can think about approximately a $15 million carryover of cost improvements that we would have in that business. And then if you later in the kind of growth rates that we talked about with R&R at about 5%, new construction at about 10%, you know the mix of our business in those 2 demand drivers, think about around a 30% to 35% drop down in that incremental volume, and I think that gets you right into where we are thinking about segment for '16."

So our quality there is what I would consider best-in-class when you look at the quality coming out of that flat finishing line. We have new products that we're launching. The products that we have already launched are taking off. So cabinets are real positive story, and we're looking forward to profitably growing that business, particularly in the dealer channel. In plumbing, again, very good story. We're seeing nice mix shift. We also have very strong performance out of Delta with a record year, and that's saying something for a company that's been as successful as Delta has been, and Hansgrohe also had a record year, another very successful company with an outstanding leadership team in place there. So we're clearly ahead of where we thought we would be. So that's on the plus side as we think about moving out and going into 2017. From a windows perspective, we're continuing to grow and outpace the market and gain share. We have our Texas plant that's coming up nicely. The new ERP system so far is going very well. We've already implemented several components of that without a hiccup. So we feel good about that, and that's an outstanding value proposition with that Milgard value proposition out there that, that has driven their share performance. So from a plumbing, cabinets, paint perspective while we talked about some puts and takes in terms of some stuff that's running hotter than we thought and stuff that's a little cooler than we thought, on balance, we feel good and remain committed to the $1.80."

So the $15 million certainly we're going to try to get everything we can in terms of the cost take outs, but we're also investing in this business and balancing it with growth investments around new products, around some pricing and some advertising and programs that we're running.

And it's been a continued focus of the teams, but consumers are driving that. And that's why you've seen nearly double-digit growth in that segment for the last 12 quarters or so. So really, really strong growth partially impacted by mix. So then we launched that Essence product about 3 years ago. So that's driving it. And then I'd say if you look at our paint segment as well, we'll launch BEHR MARQUEE interior paint this year, and we did see -- well, that's a $45 a gallon or so price point for us at retail our highest retail price points we have seen some nice mix shift, so that is a new product introduction that is driving some of that mix benefit that we're seeing, and I'll let Keith talk about both plumbing and cabinetry."

Steve, I would say that the mix shift we're seeing is more broad based. It's certainly not just the constraint to one segment. Our spa business, for example, that is an extremely discretionary, high dollar ticket item, and we continue to do very well in that business with a record year. So that's significant, and our windows business with the Essence product line, we're seeing that shift to that higher-end product very clearly. On the plumbing side, some of our most successful product lines are those that we sell in the showrooms, the high end. We've talked about Brizo, Hansgrohe and in our showroom-based products in Delta as well that you do look at this just an anecdotal view as I was out of the builder show and the Kitchen and Bath show in Vegas, the most exciting part of the booths where we've got the most traffic were in those higher-end items. So it's broad-based MARQUEE in paint. So it's -- I see it as a general trend in terms of driving the upgrades. Clearly, a part of that we are enjoying due to new product introductions the KraftMaid Vantage line has got quite impressive penetration in our dealers segments, and that's -- it's very helpful as we present it to need dealers that we signed up. So between share of wallet, driving share of wallet in our existing dealer base to helping us have a solid value proposition to dealers, it's very helpful. So product creates a fundamental component as does channel focus, getting deeper and deeper relationships on our existing dealers, both in the plumbing segment as well as in cabinets is very helpful. Understanding how our channel makes money in this higher end is helping to drive them in that direction. We're seeing that in plumbing wholesalers in particular. So it's broad based. It certainly is driven by new product introductions, but it's also has a fundamental component around channel focus in relationships."

I guess, my question here is what's changed versus, let's say, 10 or 15 years ago? Because obviously, you're very effective at serving large customers. So that's really nothing new for Masco. So I'm curious as to what do you think has changed in the industry and your relationship with a larger builders such that this business that really just doesn't make sense for a large producer like Masco.

So your take per unit is significantly clipped in some of these customers, but you still have the costs of that last mile of delivery. You still have to manage the installation and manage the punch out and all the other issues that go with keeping customers happy in this segment.

Please turn to Slide 4. 2015 was a transformative year for Masco. This time last year, we outlined the 3 elements of our strategy for value creation: number one, realizing the full potential of our core businesses; number two, leveraging opportunity across those businesses; and number three, actively managing our portfolio. 
Our focused execution enabled us to achieve the objectives we set out for ourselves in each of these areas. In 2015, we delivered solid full year results. We created a stronger foundation for future profitable growth, and we generated greater shareholder value. 
On June 30, we successfully spun off our Installation segment, transforming Masco into a global branded building products company, where our distinct advantages, brand and innovation are key success factors. These distinct advantages, as well as our operating discipline we've deployed in our businesses, drove both top and bottom line growth. 
Our revenues for the year grew 6%, excluding the impact of currency. Notably, despite a weakening global economy, our international revenues increased 4% in local currency. Our operating margin grew 190 basis points to 13%, our highest operating margin since 2006, demonstrating our strong operating leverage and operational execution. All 4 of our segments contributed to this top and bottom line growth by continuing to capitalize on their leadership positions in the building products industry. 
Let me provide you with some key highlights. Most impressive was the turnaround story of our Cabinet business. By driving share gains at retail and dealer channels with KraftMaid, realizing significant benefits from cost savings initiatives and improving pricing dynamics in the builder channel, we drove a remarkable 810 basis points improvement in operating margin, surpassing everyone's expectations. We're proud of this accomplishment and excited about the future outlook of this business. 
Our Plumbing segment had another outstanding year. By leveraging the strength of their brands and innovative products, Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins, our spa business, each broke sales and profit records in 2015. Illustrating their leadership -- industry leadership, Hansgrohe was recognized with numerous international design awards, and Delta Faucet received the 2015 WaterSense Sustained Excellence Award, the highest recognition from the Environmental Protection Agency for their exemplary effort to support water efficiency. 
In our Decorative Architectural segment, Behr drove gallon growth with their innovative new product BEHR MARQUEE, their expansion into the Pro segment and their award-winning customer satisfaction levels. We remain committed to investing behind our growth initiatives, including launching 4 new Pro paint supercenters in 2015, which further improve our fulfillment and service capabilities to the professional paint contractor. 
Behr's leadership position in the architectural paint industry was reaffirmed with its #1 ranking in the J.D. Power's 2015 Paint Satisfaction Study in the interior paint category. From a quality perspective, Behr distinguished itself by simultaneously being awarded a #1 ranking in interior paint, exterior paint and exterior stains by leading consumer testing organization. 
In our Other Specialty Products segment, Milgard Windows, the leading window brand in the Western United States, successfully capitalized on new home construction growth and growing repair/remodel demand for higher-end offerings. 
Capping off Masco's strong operational performance this year was our ability to generate nearly $0.5 billion in cash. Consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy, we returned over $575 million to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends in 2015. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and great performance in 2015. 
I will now turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail."

As Irene mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges. 
Our 2015 performance was characterized by strong sales growth, driven by customer-focused innovation and solid operating margin expansion resulting from cost control and productivity improvement. The fourth quarter was our 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and profit growth. We finished the year strong with both our fourth quarter and full year sales increasing 6%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. All of our segments contributed to our strong sales growth in 2015. 
Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the fourth quarter by approximately $45 million and the full year by approximately $250 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies, including the euro, pound and Canadian dollar. North American sales increased 6%, excluding the impact of currency, for both the fourth quarter and the full year through strong demand of our repair and remodeling and new home construction products across all channels of distribution. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity represents approximately 83% of our total sales. 
International sales increased 4% in local currency in the quarter and were up 5% in local currency for the full year, and our international plumbing and window businesses continued to perform above expectations. Demonstrating our ability to leverage SG&A as we drive growth, our SG&A as a percent of sales improved 50 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18.5%, and improved 20 basis points for the full year to 18.6% of sales. And we delivered solid bottom line performance as operating income increased 31% in the quarter to $219 million, with operating margin expanding 280 basis points to 12.8%.
For the full year, operating income increased 19% to $927 million, with operating margin expanding 190 basis points to 13%. The effect of currency negatively impacted operating income by approximately $6 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $42 million for the full year. For the fourth quarter, our EPS increased 61% to $0.29; and for the full year, increased 35% to $1.19. 
Please turn to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment continued its momentum on both a top and bottom line in the fourth quarter. Sales increased 10%, excluding the impact of currency. This solid performance was driven by strong sales increases of faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products. 
We're also pleased with our European performance in the quarter, as our international plumbing businesses grew 5% in local currency despite a tepid macroeconomic environment. Operating profit in the quarter increased 19%, excluding the impact of currency driven by incremental volume and a favorable price/commodity relationship, particularly in Europe. 
Turning to the full year 2015, this segment delivered another terrific performance as demonstrated by our Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins businesses all experiencing record sales in operating profit. Excluding the $218 million of foreign currency translation, sales increased 8% driven by growth in faucets, showers, spas and new program wins in rough plumbing. 
North American sales increased 10%, excluding the $31 million impact of foreign currency related to the Canadian dollar as we continue to experience strong sales growth in both the trade and retail channels in 2015. More specifically, our luxury brand, Brizo, continues to drive consumer demand in trade and showrooms for our innovative new products such as the Artesso kitchen faucet. In addition, Delta gained share in faucets, showers and bathing with new product introductions at retail and trade. 
Our European businesses continued to outperform, delivering 5% growth in local currency as Hansgrohe grew its share in its core Central European markets with new faucet and shower offerings. And excluding the $30 million impact of foreign currency translation and the unfavorable impact of our commodity hedge of $14 million, full year operating income increased 9%. 
Turning to Slide 8. In the Decorative Architectural Products segment, fourth quarter sales decreased 4%, driven by reduced paint and stain volumes in the DIY channel. This decline was driven in part from a difficult year-over-year comparison. You may recall in the fourth quarter of 2014, the timing of inventory replenishment orders favorably impacted our results as the segment sales increased 7% in the fourth quarter of last year -- or 2014. Solid sales -- solid gains in the Pro channel partially offset this decline. If you exclude the period impacted by the timing of replenishment orders, we experienced mid-single-digit gallon growth in the quarter. 
Full year sales grew 2%, excluding the $11 million impact of currency due to the introduction of BEHR MARQUEE interior paint, strong BehrPro growth and Liberty Hardware's continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. Operating income increased 6% in the fourth quarter; and for the full year, operating income grew 12% over the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are very pleased with the execution on the turnaround plan by the Cabinet team in 2015. Segment sales increased 5% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. We continued our momentum from the third quarter with strong KraftMaid sales in the retail channel. Additionally, our dealer-exclusive KraftMaid Vantage product line is performing very well in the dealer channel and delivered both increased volume and favorable mix. Partially offsetting this growth was the deliberate exit of certain low-margin direct-to-builder business. 
Segment profitability in the fourth quarter improved $26 million over the prior year, and our operating margin was 7.5%, our best fourth quarter margin in this segment since 2007. For the full year, operating profit improved $82 million to $51 million, which was $10 million more than we anticipated at the end of the third quarter. This was due to continued growth of our higher price point semi-custom KraftMaid offering and the benefits associated with operational and other cost savings initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 10. Milgard capped off 2015 with a great fourth quarter, as they continue to drive higher volume and have favorable mix shift through our premium window and door product lines. Milguard's growth, coupled with gains from the recent acquisition of Evolution Windows in the U.K., resulted in Q4 segment sales increasing 9%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. This segment's operating profit was flat excluding foreign currency translation, primarily due to increased volume and improved mix, offset by increased ERP spend and other costs. 
For the full year, segment sales grew 10%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, with strong window growth in the U.S. with our dealers and custom builders as consumers upgraded their purchases to higher price point products. This strong volume growth and improved mix resulted in an operating profit improvement of 25%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
And turning to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet was strong with approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity. This will enable us to execute on our balanced capital allocation strategy of investing in our -- to growing our businesses, pursuing strategic M&A, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and strengthening our financial flexibility by reducing our outstanding debt.
We continue to produce some of the best working capital results in the industry as working capital, as a percent of sales, dropped to a record low 11.1%, at year-end. This is the result of great execution on our supply chain initiatives that helped us generate nearly $500 million in free cash flow in 2015. At the same time, we delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders by repurchasing 17.2 million shares in 2015 and raising our dividend in the fourth quarter. 
Now with that, I'll pass the call back over to Keith."

And as we enter 2016, we look forward to capitalizing on the momentum that we've built over this past year. 
Despite a level of global economic ambiguity, we remain encouraged with the opportunities before us. The fundamentals driving our core U.S.-based repair and remodel business, which I'll remind you represents approximately 80% of our sales, are strong. Interest rates remain at historically low levels, which support home affordability. 
Demographic trends are increasingly favorable, which to drive household formations. Home prices are appreciating, boosting consumers' confidence to invest in their homes. U.S. residential housing stock is aging with the average age of the U.S. home 35 years. And housing turnover, which is a leading indicator for our repair/remodel business, has accelerated.
Our international businesses have demonstrated that they can perform even in periods of economic volatility as demonstrated by our international sales growth of 4% in local currency. 
We will continue to drive shareholder value by deploying the capital we generate from our strong free cash flows, including investing in organic growth, investing in strategic M&A, continuing opportunistic share buybacks and consistent dividends and retiring debt.
Given our industry-leading positions, robust innovation pipeline and the operational benefits from our Masco Operating System, we remain on track to reach our 2017 EPS target of $1.80 that we set for ourselves back in 2015. 
With that, I'll now open the call up for Q&A."

But at the same time, looking at our share repurchases and making sure that we're doing the right thing for our shareholders by returning capital to them.

So we anticipate that continued ramp-up and feel good about how the last couple of years towards that goal in 2017 are going to roll in paint. In terms of cabinets, we've talked about that as well. That has exceeded our expectations. The team not only did a great job last year of ripping that cost out that we put in to protect the customer due to that ERP issue. But we're also now getting more productive. We put in a new finishing system, so our quality there is what I would consider best-in-class when you look at the quality coming out of that flat finishing line. We have new products that we're launching. The products that we have already launched are taking off. So cabinets are a real positive story, and we're looking forward to profitably growing that business, particularly in the dealer channel. In plumbing, again, a very good story. We're seeing nice mix shift. We also have very strong performance out of Delta with a record year, and that's saying something for a company that's been as successful as Delta has been. And Hansgrohe also had a record year, another very successful company with an outstanding leadership team in place there. So we're clearly ahead of where we thought we would be. So that's on the plus side as we think about moving out and going into 2017. From a windows perspective, we're continuing to grow and outpace the market and gain share. We have our Texas plant that's coming up nicely. The new ERP system so far is going very, very well. We've already implemented several components of that without a hiccup. So we feel good about that, and that's an outstanding value proposition with that Milgard value proposition out there that has driven their share performance.

In terms of -- let's say, the window business, for instance, we've seen a nice mix shift in our window business for the last probably 7 or 8 quarters as consumers have moved up the price continuum to either our high-end vinyl or our fiberglass window product at Milgard. And it's been a continued focus of the teams, but the consumers are driving that. And that's why you've seen nearly double-digit growth in that segment for the last 12 quarters or so. So really, really strong growth, partially impacted by mix. So then -- and we launched that Essence product about 3 years ago, so that's driving it. And then I'd say if you look at our paint segment as well, we launched BEHR MARQUEE interior paint this year. And we did see -- well, that's a $45 a gallon or so price point for us at retail, our highest retail price point, we have seen some nice mix shift there. So that is a new product introduction that is driving some of that mix benefit that we're seeing. And I'll let Keith talk about both plumbing and cabinetry."

Steve, I would say that the mix shift we're seeing is more broad based. It's certainly not just the constraint to one segment. Our spa business, for example, that is an extremely discretionary, high-dollar ticket item, and we continue to do very well in that business with a record year. So that's significant. And our windows business, with the Essence product line, we're seeing that shift to that higher-end product very clearly. On the plumbing side, some of our most successful product lines are those that we sell in the showrooms, in the high end. We've talked about Brizo, Hansgrohe and then our showroom-based products in Delta as well. And if you do look at the -- just an anecdotal view, as I was out of the builders' show and the Kitchen and Bath Show in Vegas, the most exciting part of the booths where we've got the most traffic were in those higher-end items. So it's broad-based MARQUEE in paint. So it's -- I see it as a general trend in terms of driving the upgrades. Clearly, a part of that we're enjoying due to new product introductions. The KraftMaid Vantage line has got a quite impressive penetration in our dealer segments, and that's -- it's very helpful as we present it to new dealers that we sign up. So between share of wallet -- driving share of wallet and our existing dealer base to helping us have a solid value proposition to new dealers, it's very helpful. So product creates a fundamental component as does channel focus, getting deeper and deeper relationships on our existing dealers, both in the plumbing segment as well as in cabinets is very helpful. Understanding how our channel makes money in this higher end and helping to drive them in that direction. We're seeing that in plumbing wholesalers in particular. So it's broad based. It certainly is driven by new product introductions, but it's also has a fundamental component around channel focus and relationships."

Switching gears, I wanted to just ask a general question about the exit from the Cabinet, the builder-direct business. My understanding is that this was something that -- you're still actively servicing the smaller builders in the market, which still represent the majority of the industry, but my understanding was sort of a larger builders that you chose to exit from. I guess, my question here is what's changed versus, let's say, 10 or 15 years ago? Because obviously, you're very effective at serving large customers. So that's really nothing new for Masco. So I'm curious as to what do you think has changed in the industry and your relationship with the larger builders, such that -- this is business that really just doesn't make sense for a large producer like Masco, are these larger builders de-specing their product? So it's just not the value proposition that's in there in cabinet? Or have they become noticeably more aggressive negotiators over the years?"

So you'd mentioned 15 years ago, I don't know if it was that long ago.

And then now you move forward to where -- and some of the market, not all but some of the market, you're down to in the 13 to 14 boxes per unit, flat-panel oak, very deco-tinted [ph] finishing levels and deco-tinted [ph] hardware, that sort of thing. So your take per unit is significantly clipped in some of these customers, but you still have the costs of that last mile of delivery. You still have to manage the installation and manage the punch-out and all the other issues that go with keeping customers happy in this segment. So I would say the main driver on it really was the change in the type of product that was being delivered and our ability to make money given the, by and large, fixed cost nature of that last mile install punch-out. But we're -- and it's not just the large builders, it's not strictly large builders. What we're looking for is builders that value our brand, builders that value our excellent service and then partnering up with them. And what we're finding is that there's good business out there for us to have, but there's some business that's not productive for us to have, and that's our approach."

Please turn to Slide 4. 2015 was a transformative year for Masco. This time last year, we outlined the 3 elements of our strategy for value creation: number one, realizing the full potential of our core businesses; number two, leveraging opportunity across those businesses; and number three, actively managing our portfolio. 
Our focused execution enabled us to achieve the objectives we set out for ourselves in each of these areas. In 2015, we delivered solid full year results. We created a stronger foundation for future profitable growth, and we generated greater shareholder value. 
On June 30, we successfully spun off our Installation segment, transforming Masco into a global branded building products company, where our distinct advantages, brand and innovation are key success factors. These distinct advantages, as well as our operating discipline we've deployed in our businesses, drove both top and bottom line growth. 
Our revenues for the year grew 6%, excluding the impact of currency. Notably, despite a weakening global economy, our international revenues increased 4% in local currency. Our operating margin grew 190 basis points to 13%, our highest operating margin since 2006, demonstrating our strong operating leverage and operational execution. All 4 of our segments contributed to this top and bottom line growth by continuing to capitalize on their leadership positions in the building products industry. 
Let me provide you with some key highlights. Most impressive was the turnaround story of our Cabinet business. By driving share gains at retail and dealer channels with KraftMaid, realizing significant benefits from cost savings initiatives and improving pricing dynamics in the builder channel, we drove a remarkable 810 basis points improvement in operating margin, surpassing everyone's expectations. We're proud of this accomplishment and excited about the future outlook of this business. 
Our Plumbing segment had another outstanding year. By leveraging the strength of their brands and innovative products, Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins, our spa business, each broke sales and profit records in 2015. Illustrating their leadership -- industry leadership, Hansgrohe was recognized with numerous international design awards, and Delta Faucet received the 2015 WaterSense Sustained Excellence Award, the highest recognition from the Environmental Protection Agency for their exemplary effort to support water efficiency. 
In our Decorative Architectural segment, Behr drove gallon growth with their innovative new product BEHR MARQUEE, their expansion into the Pro segment and their award-winning customer satisfaction levels. We remain committed to investing behind our growth initiatives, including launching 4 new Pro paint supercenters in 2015, which further improve our fulfillment and service capabilities to the professional paint contractor. 
Behr's leadership position in the architectural paint industry was reaffirmed with its #1 ranking in the J.D. Power's 2015 Paint Satisfaction Study in the interior paint category. From a quality perspective, Behr distinguished itself by simultaneously being awarded a #1 ranking in interior paint, exterior paint and exterior stains by leading consumer testing organization. 
In our Other Specialty Products segment, Milgard Windows, the leading window brand in the Western United States, successfully capitalized on new home construction growth and growing repair/remodel demand for higher-end offerings. 
Capping off Masco's strong operational performance this year was our ability to generate nearly $0.5 billion in cash. Consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy, we returned over $575 million to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends in 2015. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and great performance in 2015. 
I will now turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail."

As Irene mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges. 
Our 2015 performance was characterized by strong sales growth, driven by customer-focused innovation and solid operating margin expansion resulting from cost control and productivity improvement. The fourth quarter was our 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and profit growth. We finished the year strong with both our fourth quarter and full year sales increasing 6%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. All of our segments contributed to our strong sales growth in 2015. 
Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the fourth quarter by approximately $45 million and the full year by approximately $250 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies, including the euro, pound and Canadian dollar. North American sales increased 6%, excluding the impact of currency, for both the fourth quarter and the full year through strong demand of our repair and remodeling and new home construction products across all channels of distribution. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity represents approximately 83% of our total sales. 
International sales increased 4% in local currency in the quarter and were up 5% in local currency for the full year, and our international plumbing and window businesses continued to perform above expectations. Demonstrating our ability to leverage SG&A as we drive growth, our SG&A as a percent of sales improved 50 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18.5%, and improved 20 basis points for the full year to 18.6% of sales. And we delivered solid bottom line performance as operating income increased 31% in the quarter to $219 million, with operating margin expanding 280 basis points to 12.8%.
For the full year, operating income increased 19% to $927 million, with operating margin expanding 190 basis points to 13%. The effect of currency negatively impacted operating income by approximately $6 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $42 million for the full year. For the fourth quarter, our EPS increased 61% to $0.29; and for the full year, increased 35% to $1.19. 
Please turn to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment continued its momentum on both a top and bottom line in the fourth quarter. Sales increased 10%, excluding the impact of currency. This solid performance was driven by strong sales increases of faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products. 
We're also pleased with our European performance in the quarter, as our international plumbing businesses grew 5% in local currency despite a tepid macroeconomic environment. Operating profit in the quarter increased 19%, excluding the impact of currency driven by incremental volume and a favorable price/commodity relationship, particularly in Europe. 
Turning to the full year 2015, this segment delivered another terrific performance as demonstrated by our Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins businesses all experiencing record sales in operating profit. Excluding the $218 million of foreign currency translation, sales increased 8% driven by growth in faucets, showers, spas and new program wins in rough plumbing. 
North American sales increased 10%, excluding the $31 million impact of foreign currency related to the Canadian dollar as we continue to experience strong sales growth in both the trade and retail channels in 2015. More specifically, our luxury brand, Brizo, continues to drive consumer demand in trade and showrooms for our innovative new products such as the Artesso kitchen faucet. In addition, Delta gained share in faucets, showers and bathing with new product introductions at retail and trade. 
Our European businesses continued to outperform, delivering 5% growth in local currency as Hansgrohe grew its share in its core Central European markets with new faucet and shower offerings. And excluding the $30 million impact of foreign currency translation and the unfavorable impact of our commodity hedge of $14 million, full year operating income increased 9%. 
Turning to Slide 8. In the Decorative Architectural Products segment, fourth quarter sales decreased 4%, driven by reduced paint and stain volumes in the DIY channel. This decline was driven in part from a difficult year-over-year comparison. You may recall in the fourth quarter of 2014, the timing of inventory replenishment orders favorably impacted our results as the segment sales increased 7% in the fourth quarter of last year -- or 2014. Solid sales -- solid gains in the Pro channel partially offset this decline. If you exclude the period impacted by the timing of replenishment orders, we experienced mid-single-digit gallon growth in the quarter. 
Full year sales grew 2%, excluding the $11 million impact of currency due to the introduction of BEHR MARQUEE interior paint, strong BehrPro growth and Liberty Hardware's continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. Operating income increased 6% in the fourth quarter; and for the full year, operating income grew 12% over the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are very pleased with the execution on the turnaround plan by the Cabinet team in 2015. Segment sales increased 5% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. We continued our momentum from the third quarter with strong KraftMaid sales in the retail channel. Additionally, our dealer-exclusive KraftMaid Vantage product line is performing very well in the dealer channel and delivered both increased volume and favorable mix. Partially offsetting this growth was the deliberate exit of certain low-margin direct-to-builder business. 
Segment profitability in the fourth quarter improved $26 million over the prior year, and our operating margin was 7.5%, our best fourth quarter margin in this segment since 2007. For the full year, operating profit improved $82 million to $51 million, which was $10 million more than we anticipated at the end of the third quarter. This was due to continued growth of our higher price point semi-custom KraftMaid offering and the benefits associated with operational and other cost savings initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 10. Milgard capped off 2015 with a great fourth quarter, as they continue to drive higher volume and have favorable mix shift through our premium window and door product lines. Milguard's growth, coupled with gains from the recent acquisition of Evolution Windows in the U.K., resulted in Q4 segment sales increasing 9%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. This segment's operating profit was flat excluding foreign currency translation, primarily due to increased volume and improved mix, offset by increased ERP spend and other costs. 
For the full year, segment sales grew 10%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, with strong window growth in the U.S. with our dealers and custom builders as consumers upgraded their purchases to higher price point products. This strong volume growth and improved mix resulted in an operating profit improvement of 25%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
And turning to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet was strong with approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity. This will enable us to execute on our balanced capital allocation strategy of investing in our -- to growing our businesses, pursuing strategic M&A, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and strengthening our financial flexibility by reducing our outstanding debt.
We continue to produce some of the best working capital results in the industry as working capital, as a percent of sales, dropped to a record low 11.1%, at year-end. This is the result of great execution on our supply chain initiatives that helped us generate nearly $500 million in free cash flow in 2015. At the same time, we delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders by repurchasing 17.2 million shares in 2015 and raising our dividend in the fourth quarter. 
Now with that, I'll pass the call back over to Keith."

And as we enter 2016, we look forward to capitalizing on the momentum that we've built over this past year. 
Despite a level of global economic ambiguity, we remain encouraged with the opportunities before us. The fundamentals driving our core U.S.-based repair and remodel business, which I'll remind you represents approximately 80% of our sales, are strong. Interest rates remain at historically low levels, which support home affordability. 
Demographic trends are increasingly favorable, which to drive household formations. Home prices are appreciating, boosting consumers' confidence to invest in their homes. U.S. residential housing stock is aging with the average age of the U.S. home 35 years. And housing turnover, which is a leading indicator for our repair/remodel business, has accelerated.
Our international businesses have demonstrated that they can perform even in periods of economic volatility as demonstrated by our international sales growth of 4% in local currency. 
We will continue to drive shareholder value by deploying the capital we generate from our strong free cash flows, including investing in organic growth, investing in strategic M&A, continuing opportunistic share buybacks and consistent dividends and retiring debt.
Given our industry-leading positions, robust innovation pipeline and the operational benefits from our Masco Operating System, we remain on track to reach our 2017 EPS target of $1.80 that we set for ourselves back in 2015.

Gives me confidence in the health of the consumer as well as the overall macroeconomic indicators that we look at around jobs and home price appreciation, some of those other things that we talked about. In terms of the international ambiguity and some of the risk there, we have a very strong business in Hansgrohe. We sell to some 135 countries, and I think with their 2015 4% growth demonstration of their capabilities, that tells me that we figured out how to maneuver through this ambiguity.

The value of the Vantage product offering that we launched is significant, and there -- that volume is a mix help for us. So we're seeing some favorable mix in cabinets. Clearly, we've done a good job of cost takeouts. We had, as you recall, some significant issues around in ERP implementation in '14, we've put that behind us.

But admittedly, the year-over-year cost takeouts will not be as strong as they were when we look at '16 versus '15 as they were in '15 versus '14. The better you get, the harder it is to get better. We took a lot of that cost issues out of the ERP systems, but we're going to continue to work on it. So going forward, more specifically, you can think about approximately a $15 million carryover of cost improvements that we would have in that business. And then if you layer in the kind of growth rates that we talked about with R&R at about 5%, new construction at about 10%, you know the mix of our business and those 2 demand drivers, think about around a 30% to 35% drop down on that incremental volume, and I think that gets you right into where we're thinking about segment for '16."

At the Analyst Day, we had our growth rate back-end loaded as we anticipated the ramping up of our Pro initiative to take some time. We're actually doing better in Pro than we thought. So we anticipate that continued ramp-up and feel good about how the last couple of years towards that goal in 2017 are going to roll in paint. In terms of cabinets, we've talked about that as well. That has exceeded our expectations. The team not only did a great job last year of ripping that cost out that we put in to protect the customer due to that ERP issue, but we're also now getting more productive. We put in a new finishing system, so our quality there is what I would consider best-in-class when you look at the quality coming out of that flat finishing line. We have new products that we're launching. The products that we have already launched are taking off. So cabinets are a real positive story, and we're looking forward to profitably growing that business, particularly in the dealer channel. In plumbing, again, a very good story. We're seeing nice mix shift. We also have very strong performance out of Delta with a record year, and that's saying something for a company that's been as successful as Delta has been. And Hansgrohe also had a record year, another very successful company with an outstanding leadership team in place there. So we're clearly ahead of where we thought we would be. So that's on the plus side as we think about moving out and going into 2017. From a windows perspective, we're continuing to grow and outpace the market and gain share. We have our Texas plant that's coming up nicely. The new ERP system so far is going very, very well. We've already implemented several components of that without a hiccup. So we feel good about that, and that's an outstanding value proposition within that Milgard value proposition out there that has driven their share performance. So from a plumbing, cabinets, paint perspective, while we talked about some puts and takes in terms of some stuff that's running hotter than we thought and stuff that's a little cooler than we thought, on balance, we feel good and remain committed to the $1.80."

And it's been a continued focus of the teams, but the consumers are driving that. And that's why you've seen nearly double-digit growth in that segment for the last 12 quarters or so. So really, really strong growth, partially impacted by mix. So then -- and we launched that Essence product about 3 years ago, so that's driving it. And then I'd say if you look at our paint segment as well, we launched BEHR MARQUEE interior paint this year. And we did see -- and while that's a $45 a gallon or so price point for us at retail, our highest retail price point, we have seen some nice mix shift there.

Our spa business, for example, that is an extremely discretionary, high-dollar ticket item, and we continue to do very well in that business with a record year. So that's significant. And our windows business, with the Essence product line, we're seeing that shift to that higher-end product very clearly. On the plumbing side, some of our most successful product lines are those that we sell in the showrooms, in the high end. We've talked about Brizo, Hansgrohe and then our showroom-based products in Delta as well. And if you do look at the -- just an anecdotal view, as I was out of the builders' show and the Kitchen and Bath Show in Vegas, the most exciting part of the booths where we've got the most traffic were in those higher-end items. So it's broad-based MARQUEE in paint. So it's -- I see it as a general trend in terms of driving the upgrades. Clearly, a part of that we're enjoying due to new product introductions. The KraftMaid Vantage line has got a quite impressive penetration in our dealer segments, and that's -- it's very helpful as we present it to new dealers that we sign up. So between share of wallet -- driving share of wallet and our existing dealer base to helping us have a solid value proposition to new dealers, it's very helpful. So product clique plays a fundamental component as does channel focus, getting deeper and deeper relationships on our existing dealers, both in the plumbing segment as well as in cabinets is very helpful. Understanding how our channel makes money in this higher end and helping to drive them in that direction. We're seeing that in plumbing wholesalers in particular. So it's broad based.

I guess, my question here is what's changed versus, let's say, 10 or 15 years ago? Because obviously, you're very effective at serving large customers. So that's really nothing new for Masco. So I'm curious as to what do you think has changed in the industry and your relationship with the larger builders, such that this is business that really just doesn't make sense for a large producer like Masco, are these larger builders de-specing their product?

So your take per unit is significantly clipped in some of these customers, but you still have the costs of that last mile of delivery. You still have to manage the installation and manage the punch-out and all the other issues that go with keeping customers happy in this segment.

We carried last year's momentum into 2016, and we're off to a strong start this year. We experienced solid demand for our brands across the price continuum, including big-ticket items such as spas, windows and cabinets as well as smaller-ticket items in our paint and plumbing categories. 
Our portfolio's inherent operating leverage and our focus on cost control were key factors to our success. Looking specifically at the quarter, our top line increased by 5% when you exclude the impact of currency, which cost us $19 million in the quarter. Notably, our operating margin increased 350 basis points to 13.8%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage. This represents our best first quarter performance in 12 years. Importantly, our EPS grew 78% to $0.32 per common share. These results reflect our ability to capitalize on improving and market dynamics and our ability to generate solid consumer demand for our industry-leading brands. 
I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments' performance. Let's begin with Plumbing. Our portfolio of Plumbing businesses continued its strong performance and grew sales in North America by 5% when you exclude the impact of Canadian currency and grew internationally by 3% in local currency. 
Each of our Plumbing businesses contributed to this growth, including Hansgrohe, who yet again set a company record for quarterly sales and operating profit. The Delta and Brizo brands continue to resonate with the consumer and drive sales in both the retail and wholesale channels. Our premier wellness business, Watkins, demonstrated this success of their brand, dealer network and bolt-on acquisitions strategy by growing their top and bottom lines through the successful integration of Endless Pools. 
Our Decorative Architectural segment delivered an outstanding quarter as the investments we've made to support the growth of this segment continue to take hold. Behr drove sales with its award-winning core DIY products such as BEHR MARQUEE, its differentiated consumer experience in the aisle with the new color center and its launch of new products such as granite grip floor coatings. 
Our Pro paint sales continue to outpace the market growth as a result of our mutual efforts with the Home Depot to capture share in this channel. We remain committed to investing behind this important growth initiative. 
Turning to cabinets. The team delivered yet another strong quarter, maintaining their leadership position at retail and gaining share in the dealer channel with both Merillat and KraftMaid brands. To further position this business for profitable growth, the team has continued to optimize their sales mix by exiting low-margin direct-to-builder business in the Carolinas and exiting the kitchen countertop product category. Given these actions and Cabinetry's positive trajectory, we expect the segment to achieve operating profit margins between 8% and 9% in 2016. 
Our Windows and Other Specialty Products segment had another great quarter. Milgard, the leading window brand in the Western United States, grew their top line by 9% as they consistently executed against a dynamic economic environment. 
Augmenting our solid operational performance across all segments was our execution against key capital allocation initiatives. We strengthened our balance sheet by paying down $400 million in debt and refinancing 2 of our debt maturities. These actions will result in approximately $45 million of annual interest expense savings going forward. 
We also continued our share repurchase activity in the quarter, buying back approximately 3.2 million shares. To date, we've repurchased over 25 million shares against our 50 million share repurchase authorization, returning over $600 million to shareholders and thus, delivering on our commitment to drive shareholder value. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?"

As Irene mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges. 
We continued our positive momentum coming out of 2015 with a solid start to 2016. The first quarter of 2016 was our 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 5%. 
Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the first quarter by approximately $19 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar. North American sales were up 5% in the quarter. We're experiencing strong demand from our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as we consumers trading up to our better and best product offerings. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales. 
International sales increased 2% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international Plumbing and Window businesses. Gross margins expanded approximately 320 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year to 33.1%. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales improved as well, delivering a 20 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by focused cost control throughout the organization. 
We delivered very strong bottom line performance as operating income increased 39% to $237 million with operating margins expanding 350 basis points to 13.8%, our highest first quarter margin since 2004. And our EPS was $0.32, an improvement of $0.14 or 78% compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment sales increased 4% in the quarter, excluding the impact of currency driven by growth in our faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment sales by approximately $16 million in the quarter. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation related to the Canadian dollar, our North American sales grew 5%, driven by strong demand for our innovative Delta and Brizo brands in the wholesale channel. This performance was achieved despite, as we foreshadowed on our Q4 call, approximately $15 million of sales being pulled forward into Q4 of 2015 from Q1 of 2016 with several wholesale customers strived to hit higher rebate tiers in the final quarter of last year. North American plumbing sales increased 8%, if you exclude the impact of foreign currency and the sales pull forward. Our international plumbing sales increased 3% in local currency. 
Hansgrohe continues to outperform as it delivered its highest quarterly sales and operating profit in the company's history. This achievement is a testament to Hansgrohe's successful investment in brand, design and innovation. 
Operating profit for this segment increased 17% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume, productivity improvements in North America and a favorable price/commodity relationship in Europe. Our first quarter operating profit also benefited by approximately $5 million due to the timing of sales and marketing expenses at Delta. 
Turning to Slide 8. In the Decorative Architectural segment, first quarter sales grew 9%, fueled by strong demand for both Behr's core DIY products, including BEHR MARQUEE, KILZ primers and our new floor coatings products at The Home Depot as well as our Behr Pro paint initiative. Favorable weather supplemented this strong demand for our industry-leading products as evidenced by our strong exterior paints and stains sales in the quarter. 
Liberty Hardware had another solid quarter due to continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. Operating income increased 27% in the first quarter, principally due to the operating leverage and the strong volumes at Behr. While we've had a great start to 2016 with our Decorative Architectural segment, I want to remind you that this segment is facing a difficult comp in Q2 as the second quarter of 2015 was an all-time record sales quarter for Behr.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Cabinetry segment sales declined 5% in the quarter due to the deliberate exit of certain lower-margin businesses -- business with builder channel in the United States and select low-margin accounts in our U.K. Cabinet business. This decline was partially offset by high single-digit growth in the dealer channel. Both our Merillat offerings and our dealer-exclusive KraftMaid Vantage program continue to perform and drive increased volume and favorable mix. 
As Keith mentioned earlier, we took additional actions in the first quarter to position this segment for profitable growth, including exiting the Carolinas builder direct business and our retail kitchen countertop product line. These actions, when coupled with the previously announced pullback in our builder direct business, will negatively impact this segment's top line by about $60 million for the full year while improving its profitability. On a quarterly basis, the revenue impact will be approximately $15 million for each of the second, third and fourth quarters. 
Segment profitability in the first quarter improved $27 million over 2015. Our strong Q1 margin was driven by cost-savings initiatives and continued growth of our higher price point semicustom KraftMaid offering. This segment's profitability in the quarter was also favorably impacted by approximately $4 million due to the timing of certain operational and marketing-related expenses. As a result of the actions I mentioned earlier and the recent performance of this business, we anticipate operating margins for this segment should be between 8% and 9% in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Windows segment sales increased 9%, driven by a low double-digit sales growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard had seen strong demand in the Western U.S., resulting in increased volume and the continued benefit of a favorable shift toward our premium window and door product lines. 
Excluding the $2 million negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 9% as this segment continues to benefit from share gains, the acquisition of Evolution Manufacturing and growth in its Phoenix Door product line. This segment's operating profit decline in the quarter was due to increased ERP expenses at Milgard of approximately $5 million and incremental labor cost in preparation for the spring selling season for approximately $3 million. 
And turning to Slide 11, during the quarter, we took further actions to further strengthen our balance sheet. In March, we issued $400 million of 3.5% 5-year notes and $500 million of 4 3/8% 10-year notes. Earlier this month, we used the proceeds from the debt issuances together with cash on hand to repay and early retire of our $1 billion notes due in October 2016 and $300 million notes, which were due in Marchof  2017. To complete the retirement of these 2 debt maturities, we will incur approximately $40 million in onetime interest payment in the second quarter of 2016. Including this onetime payment, we anticipate interest expense for the second quarter to be approximately $88 million. The result of these transactions will be an annual interest expense reduction of nearly $45 million. 
Starting with our third quarter of 2016, our quarterly interest expense will be approximately $44 million. With these debt transactions, we have delivered on our long-term commitment to strengthen our balance sheet. Due to our strong cash flow and this recent debt retirement, we have greatly enhanced our financial flexibility as our net debt to EBITDA now stands at approximately 1.8x on a pro forma basis. From a working capital perspective, we delivered another strong quarter of performance with working capital as a percent of sales improving 50 basis points versus the prior year to 13.3%. 
Finally, as Keith mentioned during the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares valued at approximately $86 million. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Keith."

Our results reflect the strength of our powerful brands and our focus on operational excellence. We have strong positions in good industries, and our portfolio is aligned to improving macro trends. Existing home prices continue to appreciate, which is a driver for larger-ticket items such as cabinets and windows. Housing turnover continues to accelerate, which is a leading indicator of repair and remodel spend, and affordability remains well above the historic averages. 
As a result of these trends, the consumer continues to gain confidence to reinvest in the home, and we are well positioned to benefit from that. The strategies that we laid out last year are working, and going forward, we remain committed to one, investing behind our brands for growth; two, develop innovative products to ensure that we maintain our must-have position with our customers; three, focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the Masco Operating System; and finally, balancing our capital allocation between acquisitions with the right strategic fit and return, share buybacks and dividends. Our operational execution, coupled with our strengthened balance sheet and strong liquidity position, provides us with multiple levers to continue to drive shareholder value.

And so I think with raw materials slowly inflating, they're not dramatically inflating but starting to inflate, I think that will add some pressure on our gross margin going forward.

We're really proud of how the entire teams is responding to our SG&A initiatives, and we have done a nice job of controlling cost as we've grown the business. I think what I'm most proud of is particularly in our first quarter is the fact that we did a nice job of holding SG&A as a percent of sales having it decline despite the fact that we're investing in some of the programs that impact SG&A. For instance, I think we are now up to about 150 Pro sales reps in the Behr organizations, call it the Pro contractors. So incremental cost yet the fact that we're able to bring the SG&A as a percent down really, I think, gives a sense of how the organization is responding to our desire to hold costs constant as best we can. As we grow the business, well we had to invest in some SG&A yes, I think we will, but I really think the mantra that both myself and particularly Keith here are trying to get across to the organization is that this is the way that we can really help create shareholder value as we grow the business and holding our cost down, good things happen to the bottom line and to profits.

So going after and understanding the trends that are out there and launching new products to address those trends, both in terms of form and function, looks and aesthetics as well as price points. So going after the broad spectrum in terms of taste as well as price. And then with that, as you solve these launches into the channel, you have some launch expenses. Certainly there's a component of advertising that's in there, but primarily, it's more on the launch side. Outside of assortment, looking at the channel, as we grow, we have significant headroom, we believe, in share of wallet of our existing dealer base. And to help to drive that and to motivate that, there's an expense that you'd incur in terms of incentives, and we also believe that there's spas as we look at our national coverage where we can either get more dealers or get higher-quality dealers and to start up new dealers, that takes some money. So primarily the investments around product assortment enhancements and channel enhancements."

Turning to Slide 4. We carried last year's momentum into 2016, and we're off to a strong start this year. We experienced solid demand for our brands across the price continuum, including big-ticket items such as spas, windows and cabinets as well as smaller-ticket items in our paint and plumbing categories. Our portfolio's inherent operating leverage and our focus on cost control were key factors to our success.
Looking specifically at the quarter. Our top line increased by 5% when you exclude the impact of currency, which cost us $19 million in the quarter. Notably, our operating margin increased 350 basis points to 13.8%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage. This represents our best first quarter performance in 12 years. Importantly, our EPS grew 78% to $0.32 per common share. These results reflect our ability to capitalize on improving in-market dynamics and our ability to generate solid consumer demand for our industry-leading brands.
I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments' performance. Let's begin with Plumbing. Our portfolio of plumbing businesses continued its strong performance and grew sales in North America by 5% when you exclude the impact of Canadian currency and grew internationally by 3% in local currency.
Each of our plumbing businesses contributed to this growth, including Hansgrohe, who yet again set a company record for quarterly sales and operating profit. The Delta and Brizo brands continue to resonate with the consumer and drive sales in both the retail and wholesale channels. Our premier wellness business, Watkins, demonstrated the success of their brand, dealer network and bolt-on acquisition strategy by growing their top and bottom lines through the successful integration of Endless Pools.
Our Decorative Architectural segment delivered an outstanding quarter as the investments we've made to support the growth of this segment continue to take hold. Behr drove sales with its award-winning core DIY products such as BEHR MARQUEE, its differentiated consumer experience in the aisle with the new color center and its launch of new products such as granite grip floor coatings.
Our Pro paint sales continue to outpace the market growth as a result of our mutual efforts with The Home Depot to capture share in this channel. We remain committed to investing behind this important growth initiative.
Turning to Cabinets. The team delivered yet another strong quarter, maintaining their leadership position at retail and gaining share in the dealer channel with both Merillat and KraftMaid brands. To further position this business for profitable growth, the team has continued to optimize their sales mix by exiting low-margin direct-to-builder business in the Carolinas and exiting the kitchen countertop product category. Given these actions and cabinetry's positive trajectory, we expect this segment to achieve operating profit margins between 8% and 9% in 2016.
Our Windows and Other Specialty Products segment had another great quarter. Milgard, the leading window brand in the Western United States, grew their top line by 9% as they consistently executed against a dynamic economic environment.
Augmenting our solid operational performance across all segments was our execution against key capital allocation initiatives. We strengthened our balance sheet by paying down $400 million in debt and refinancing 2 of our debt maturities. These actions will result in approximately $45 million of annual interest expense savings going forward.
We also continued our share repurchase activity in the quarter, buying back approximately 3.2 million shares. To date, we've repurchased over 25 million shares against our 50 million share repurchase authorization, returning over $600 million to shareholders and thus, delivering on our commitment to drive shareholder value.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?"

Please turn to Slide 6. As Irene mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges.We continued our positive momentum coming",1293,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. As Irene mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges.
We continued our positive momentum coming out of 2015 with a solid start to 2016. The first quarter of 2016 was our 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 5%.
Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the first quarter by approximately $19 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar. 
North American sales were up 5% in the quarter. We're experiencing strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as we see consumers trading up to our better and best product offerings. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales.
International sales increased 2% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international plumbing and window businesses. 
Gross margins expanded approximately 320 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year to 33.1%. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales improved as well, delivering a 20 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by focused cost control throughout the organization.
We delivered very strong bottom line performance as operating income increased 39% to $237 million, with operating margins expanding 350 basis points to 13.8%, our highest first quarter margin since 2004. And our EPS was $0.32, an improvement of $0.14 or 78% compared to the first quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment sales increased 4% in the quarter, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $16 million in the quarter.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation related to the Canadian dollar, our North American sales grew 5%, driven by strong demand for our innovative Delta and Brizo brands in the wholesale channel. This performance was achieved despite, as we foreshadowed on our Q4 call, approximately $15 million of sales being pulled forward into Q4 of 2015 from Q1 of 2016, with several wholesale customers strived to hit higher rebate tiers in the final quarter of last year. North American plumbing sales increased 8%, if you exclude the impact of foreign currency and the sales pull forward. Our international plumbing sales increased 3% in local currency.
Hansgrohe continues to outperform as it delivered its highest quarterly sales and operating profit in the company's history. This achievement is a testament to Hansgrohe's successful investments in brand, design and innovation.
Operating profit for this segment increased 17% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume, productivity improvements in North America and a favorable price/commodity relationship in Europe. Our first quarter operating profit also benefited by approximately $5 million due to the timing of sales and marketing expenses at Delta.
Turning to Slide 8. In the Decorative Architectural segment, first quarter sales grew 9%, fueled by strong demand for both Behr's core DIY products, including BEHR MARQUEE, KILZ primers and our new floor coatings products at The Home Depot; as well as our Behr Pro paint initiative. Favorable weather supplemented this strong demand for our industry-leading products as evidenced by our strong exterior paints and stains sales in the quarter.
Liberty Hardware had another solid quarter due to continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. Operating income increased 27% in the first quarter, principally due to the operating leverage and the strong volumes at Behr.
While we've had a great start to 2016 with our Decorative Architectural segment, I want to remind you that this segment is facing a difficult comp in Q2 as the second quarter of 2015 was an all-time record sales quarter for Behr.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Cabinetry segment sales declined 5% in the quarter due to the deliberate exit of certain lower-margin businesses -- business with builder channel in the United States and select low-margin accounts in our U.K. Cabinet business. This decline was partially offset by high single-digit growth in the dealer channel. Both our Merillat offerings and our dealer-exclusive KraftMaid Vantage program continue to perform and drive increased volume and favorable mix.
As Keith mentioned earlier, we took additional actions in the first quarter to position this segment for profitable growth, including exiting the Carolinas builder direct business and our retail kitchen countertop product line. These actions, when coupled with the previously announced pullback in our builder direct business, will negatively impact this segment's top line by about $60 million for the full year while improving its profitability. On a quarterly basis, the revenue impact will be approximately $15 million for each of the second, third and fourth quarters.
Segment profitability in the first quarter improved $27 million over 2015. Our strong Q1 margin was driven by cost-savings initiatives and continued growth of our higher price point semi-custom KraftMaid offering. This segment's profitability in the quarter was also favorably impacted by approximately $4 million due to the timing of certain operational and marketing-related expenses. As a result of the actions I mentioned earlier and the recent performance of this business, we anticipate operating margins for this segment should be between 8% and 9% in 2016.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Windows segment sales increased 9%, driven by a low double-digit sales growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard had seen strong demand in the Western U.S., resulting in increased volume and the continued benefit of a favorable shift toward our premium window and door product lines.
Excluding the $2 million negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 9% as this segment continues to benefit from share gains, the acquisition of Evolution Manufacturing and growth in its Phoenix Door product line. This segment's operating profit decline in the quarter was due to increased ERP expenses at Milgard of approximately $5 million and incremental labor costs in preparation for the spring selling season for approximately $3 million.
And turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, we took further action to further strengthen our balance sheet. In March, we issued $400 million of 3.5% 5-year notes and $500 million of 4 3/8% 10-year notes. Earlier this month, we used the proceeds from these debt issuances, together with cash on hand, to repay and early retire of our $1 billion notes due in October 2016 and $300 million notes, which were due in March of 2017. To complete the retirement of these 2 debt maturities, we will incur approximately $40 million in onetime interest payment in the second quarter of 2016. Including this onetime payment, we anticipate interest expense for the second quarter to be approximately $88 million. The result of these transactions will be an annual interest expense reduction of nearly $45 million. Starting with the third quarter of 2016, our quarterly interest expense will be approximately $44 million.
With these debt transactions, we have delivered on our long-term commitment to strengthen our balance sheet. Due to our strong cash flow and this recent debt retirement, we have greatly enhanced our financial flexibility as our net debt-to-EBITDA now stands at approximately 1.8x on a pro forma basis. From a working capital perspective, we delivered another strong quarter of performance, with working capital as a percent of sales improving 50 basis points versus the prior year to 13.3%.
Finally, as Keith mentioned, during the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares valued at approximately $86 million.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Keith."

Our results reflect the strength of our powerful brands and our focus on operational excellence. We have strong positions in good industries, and our portfolio is aligned to improving macro trends. Existing home prices continue to appreciate, which is a driver for larger-ticket items such as cabinets and windows. Housing turnover continues to accelerate, which is a leading indicator of repair and remodel spend, and affordability remains well above historic averages.
As a result of these trends, the consumer continues to gain confidence to reinvest in the home, and we are well positioned to benefit from that. The strategies that we laid out last year are working. And going forward, we remain committed to, one, investing behind our brands for growth; two, developing innovative products to ensure that we maintain our must-have position with our customers; three, focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the Masco Operating System; and finally, balancing our capital allocation between acquisitions with the right strategic fit and return, share buybacks and dividends. Our operational execution, coupled with our strengthened balance sheet and strong liquidity position, provides us with multiple levers to continue to drive shareholder value.

As you probably realize, most of the commodities bottomed in January of this year as the year got off to a pretty choppy start with the overall stock market and economic environment. And since that time, we've seen a pretty consistent rise in both base metals, some of the hardware, and as Keith referenced a couple of minutes ago, we're seeing it also in TiO2 that goes into our paint business. And so I think with raw materials slowly inflating, they're not dramatically inflating but starting to inflate, I think that will add some pressure on our gross margin going forward. That said, to your point, the first quarter is seasonally, typically, our slowest quarter of the year. And as we enjoy the seasonal volumes that come with the second and third quarters, I think there's potential to have stronger gross margins as the year continues to unfold."

I think what I'm most proud of, particularly in the first quarter, is the fact that we did a nice job of holding SG&A as a percent of sales or having it decline despite the fact that we're investing in some of the programs that impact SG&A. For instance, I think we are now up to about 150 Pro sales reps in the Behr organization to call them the Pro or the contractors. So incremental costs, yet the fact that we're able to bring the SG&A as a percent down really, I think, is a -- gives a sense of how the organization is responding to our desire to hold costs constant as best we can. As we grow the business, while we have to invest some in SG&A, yes, I think we will, but I'd really think the mantra that both myself and particularly Keith are trying to get across to the organization is that this is the way that we can really help create shareholder value.

So it's a good point of sale for the dealers. And then we also bundled with that a pricing scheme that made it easier to sell an upgrade. So that's really what's been driving the benefit for us, so that combination of exclusivity and ability to more easily get a consumer to step up in terms of price to go for that higher content.

Turning to Slide 4. We carried last year's momentum into 2016, and we're off to a strong start this year. We experienced solid demand for our brands across the price continuum, including big-ticket items such as spas, windows and cabinets as well as smaller-ticket items in our paint and plumbing categories. Our portfolio's inherent operating leverage and our focus on cost control were key factors to our success.
Looking specifically at the quarter. Our top line increased by 5% when you exclude the impact of currency, which cost us $19 million in the quarter. Notably, our operating margin increased 350 basis points to 13.8%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage. This represents our best first quarter performance in 12 years. Importantly, our EPS grew 78% to $0.32 per common share. These results reflect our ability to capitalize on improving end-market dynamics and our ability to generate solid consumer demand for our industry-leading brands.
I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments' performance. Let's begin with Plumbing. Our portfolio of plumbing businesses continued its strong performance and grew sales in North America by 5% when you exclude the impact of Canadian currency and grew internationally by 3% in local currency.
Each of our plumbing businesses contributed to this growth, including Hansgrohe, who yet again set a company record for quarterly sales and operating profit. The Delta and Brizo brands continue to resonate with the consumer and drive sales in both the retail and wholesale channels. Our premier wellness business, Watkins, demonstrated the success of their brand, dealer network and bolt-on acquisition strategy by growing their top and bottom lines through the successful integration of Endless Pools.
Our Decorative Architectural segment delivered an outstanding quarter as the investments we've made to support the growth of this segment continue to take hold. Behr drove sales with its award-winning core DIY products such as BEHR MARQUEE, its differentiated consumer experience in the aisle with the new color center and its launch of new products such as Granite Grip floor coatings.
Our Pro paint sales continue to outpace market growth as a result of our mutual efforts with The Home Depot to capture share in this channel. We remain committed to investing behind this important growth initiative.
Turning to Cabinets. The team delivered yet another strong quarter, maintaining their leadership position at retail and gaining share in the dealer channel with both Merillat and KraftMaid brands. To further position this business for profitable growth, the team has continued to optimize their sales mix by exiting low-margin direct-to-builder business in the Carolinas and exiting the kitchen countertop product category. Given these actions and cabinetry's positive trajectory, we expect this segment to achieve operating profit margins between 8% and 9% in 2016.
Our Windows and Other Specialty Products segment had another great quarter. Milgard, the leading window brand in the Western United States, grew their top line by 9% as they consistently executed against a dynamic economic environment.
Augmenting our solid operational performance across all segments was our execution against key capital allocation initiatives. We strengthened our balance sheet by paying down $400 million in debt and refinancing 2 of our debt maturities. These actions will result in approximately $45 million of annual interest expense savings going forward.
We also continued our share repurchase activity in the quarter, buying back approximately 3.2 million shares. To date, we've repurchased over 25 million shares against our 50 million share repurchase authorization, returning over $600 million to shareholders and thus delivering on our commitment to drive shareholder value.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?"

Please turn to Slide 6.

Please turn to Slide 6. As Irene mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges.
We continued our positive momentum coming out of 2015 with a solid start to 2016. The first quarter of 2016 was our 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 5%.
Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the first quarter by approximately $19 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar. 
North American sales were up 5% in the quarter. We're experiencing strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as we see consumers trading up to our better and best product offerings. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales.
International sales increased 2% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international plumbing and window businesses. 
Gross margins expanded approximately 320 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year to 33.1%. Our SG&A as a percent of sales improved as well, delivering a 20 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by focused cost control throughout the organization.
We delivered very strong bottom line performance as operating income increased 39% to $237 million, with operating margins expanding 350 basis points to 13.8%, our highest first quarter margin since 2004. And our EPS was $0.32, an improvement of $0.14 or 78% compared to the first quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment sales increased 4% in the quarter, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $16 million in the quarter.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation related to the Canadian dollar, our North American sales grew 5%, driven by strong demand for our innovative Delta and Brizo brands in the wholesale channel. This performance was achieved despite, as we foreshadowed on our Q4 call, approximately $15 million of sales being pulled forward into Q4 of 2015 from Q1 of 2016, as several wholesale customers strived to hit higher rebate tiers in the final quarter of last year. North American plumbing sales increased 8%, if you exclude the impact of foreign currency and the sales pull forward. 
Our international plumbing sales increased 3% in local currency. Hansgrohe continues to outperform as it delivered its highest quarterly sales and operating profit in the company's history. This achievement is a testament to Hansgrohe's successful investments in brand, design and innovation.
Operating profit for this segment increased 17% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume, productivity improvements in North America and a favorable price/commodity relationship in Europe. Our first quarter operating profit also benefited by approximately $5 million due to the timing of sales and marketing expenses at Delta.
Turning to Slide 8. In the Decorative Architectural segment, first quarter sales grew 9%, fueled by strong demand for both Behr's core DIY products, including BEHR MARQUEE, KILZ primers and our new floor coatings products at The Home Depot, as well as our Behr Pro paint initiative. Favorable weather supplemented the strong demand for our industry-leading products as evidenced by our strong exterior paints and stains sales in the quarter.
Liberty Hardware had another solid quarter due to continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. Operating income increased 27% in the first quarter, principally due to the operating leverage and the strong volumes at Behr.
While we've had a great start to 2016 with our Decorative Architectural segment, I want to remind you that this segment is facing a difficult comp in Q2 as the second quarter of 2015 was an all-time record sales quarter for Behr.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Cabinetry segment sales declined 5% in the quarter due to the deliberate exit of certain lower-margin businesses -- business with builder channels in the United States and select low-margin accounts in our U.K. Cabinet business. This decline was partially offset by high single-digit growth in the dealer channel. Both our Merillat offerings and our dealer-exclusive KraftMaid Vantage program continue to perform and drive increased volume and favorable mix.
As Keith mentioned earlier, we took additional actions in the first quarter to position this segment for profitable growth, including exiting the Carolinas builder direct business and our retail kitchen countertop product line. These actions, when coupled with the previously announced pullback in our builder direct business, will negatively impact this segment's top line by about $60 million for the full year while improving its profitability. On a quarterly basis, the revenue impact will be approximately $15 million for each of the second, third and fourth quarters.
Segment profitability in the first quarter improved $27 million over 2015. Our strong Q1 margin was driven by cost-savings initiatives and continued growth of our higher price point semi-custom KraftMaid offering. This segment's profitability in the quarter was also favorably impacted by approximately $4 million due to the timing of certain operational and marketing-related expenses. As a result of the actions I mentioned earlier and the recent performance of this business, we anticipate operating margins for this segment should be between 8% and 9% in 2016.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Windows segment sales increased 9%, driven by a low double-digit sales growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard had seen strong demand in the Western U.S., resulting in increased volume and the continued benefit of a favorable shift toward our premium window and door product lines.
Excluding the $2 million negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 9% as this segment continues to benefit from share gains, the acquisition of Evolution Manufacturing and growth in its Phoenix Door product line. This segment's operating profit decline in the quarter was due to increased ERP expenses at Milgard of approximately $5 million and incremental labor costs in preparation for the spring selling season of approximately $3 million.
And turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, we took further action to further strengthen our balance sheet. In March, we issued $400 million of 3.5% 5-year notes and $500 million of 4 3/8% 10-year notes. Earlier this month, we used the proceeds from these debt issuances, together with cash on hand, to repay and early retire all of our $1 billion notes due in October 2016 and $300 million notes, which were due in March of 2017. To complete the retirement of these 2 debt maturities, we will incur approximately $40 million in a onetime interest payment in the second quarter of 2016. Including this onetime payment, we anticipate interest expense for the second quarter to be approximately $88 million. The result of these transactions will be an annual interest expense reduction of nearly $45 million. Starting with the third quarter of 2016, our quarterly interest expense will be approximately $44 million.
With these debt transactions, we have delivered on our long-term commitment to strengthen our balance sheet. Due to our strong cash flow and this recent debt retirement, we have greatly enhanced our financial flexibility as our net debt-to-EBITDA now stands at approximately 1.8x on a pro forma basis. From a working capital perspective, we delivered another strong quarter of performance, with working capital as a percent of sales improving 50 basis points versus the prior year to 13.3%.
Finally, as Keith mentioned, during the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares valued at approximately $86 million.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Keith."

Our results reflect the strength of our powerful brands and our focus on operational excellence. We have strong positions in good industries, and our portfolio is aligned to improving macro trends. Existing home prices continue to appreciate, which is a driver for larger-ticket items such as cabinets and windows. Housing turnover continues to accelerate, which is a leading indicator of repair and remodel spend, and affordability remains well above historic averages.
As a result of these trends, the consumer continues to gain confidence to reinvest in the home, and we are well positioned to benefit from that. The strategies that we laid out last year are working. And going forward, we remain committed to, one, investing behind our brands for growth; two, developing innovative products to ensure that we maintain our must-have position with our customers; three, focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the Masco Operating System; and finally, balancing our capital allocation between acquisitions with the right strategic fit and return, share buybacks and dividends. Our operational execution, coupled with our strengthened balance sheet and strong liquidity position, provides us with multiple levers to continue to drive shareholder value.
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?"

As you probably realize, most of the commodities bottomed in January of this year as the year got off to a pretty choppy start with the overall stock market and economic environment. And since that time, we've seen a pretty consistent rise in both base metals, some of the hard woods, and as Keith referenced a couple of minutes ago, we're seeing it also in TiO2 that goes into our paint business. And so I think with raw materials slowly inflating -- they're not dramatically inflating but starting to inflate, I think that will add some pressure on our gross margin going forward. That said, to your point, the first quarter is seasonally, typically, our slowest quarter of the year. And as we enjoy the seasonal volumes that come with the second and third quarters, I think there's potential to have stronger gross margins as the year continues to unfold."

In terms of how we toggle back between buybacks and acquisitions, we have the flexibility. If we saw a good deal and if that deal was bigger, we could certainly do it. But I'd tell you that we're being conservative in how we evaluate them. They need to be on strategy for our portfolio, and they need to be strong returns.

That's probably the one that -- where it's most evident as you've seen the progression we've made in the Cabinet business over the course of the last 4 quarters as we launched Vantage about this time last year. So you can see the impact that business has had on the Cabinet business, and you can also see it in our Plumbing segment. We've had pretty consistent margins from 2014 to 2015.

And we have done a nice job of controlling costs as we've grown the business. I think what I'm most proud of, particularly in the first quarter, is the fact that we did a nice job of holding SG&A as a percent of sales or having it decline despite the fact that we're investing in some of the programs that impact SG&A. For instance, I think we are now up to about 150 Pro sales reps in the Behr organization to call on the Pro-oriented contractors. So incremental costs, yet the fact that we're able to bring the SG&A as a percent down, really, I think, is a -- gives a sense of how the organization is responding to our desire to hold costs constant as best we can. As we grow the business, will we have to invest some in SG&A? Yes, I think we will, but I'd really think the mantra that both myself and particularly Keith are trying to get across to the organization is that this is the way that we can really help create shareholder value. As we grow the business and holding our costs down, good things happen to the bottom line and to profits. And so the entire team has responded particularly well to that.

These changes are another example of Masco's people development strategy at work. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased to report that the momentum we built in 2015 and carried forward into the first quarter of 2016 has continued year-to-date. We had a great second quarter as strength in our underlying markets, combined with solid execution, translated into excellent financial results. 
Looking specifically at the quarter, our top line increased by 4%. Notably, our adjusted operating margin increased 260 basis points to 17.1%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage, a favorable price/commodity environment and our culture of continuous cost improvement. This represents our best second quarter operating margin since 2002. 
Our adjusted EPS grew 21% to $0.46 per share, which includes the $40 million additional interest expense we incurred during the quarter, due to the early retirement of a portion of our debt. These results reflect our ability to capitalize on improving end market dynamics and our ability to generate robust consumer demand from our industry-leading brands. 
I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments performance. Let's begin with Plumbing. Our portfolio of Plumbing businesses continued its strong performance and grew sales in North America by 9% and grew sales internationally by 11% in local currency. This segment's strong growth was broad-based, with Delta, Hansgrohe and BrassCraft Manufacturing, our rough plumbing business, each having record quarters for both sales and operating profit. 
The Delta and Brizo brands continue to resonate with the consumer and drive sales growth in both the retail and wholesale channels in North America. While the Hansgrohe and Axor brands continue to gain share internationally. Watkins Manufacturing, our premier wellness and spa business within our Plumbing segment, also achieved a record sales quarter, a good sign that consumer confidence continues to build as exemplified by these big-ticket purchases. 
Our Decorative Architectural segment delivered a solid quarter despite being up against a tough comp as we pointed out on our last quarterly earnings call. We continued our strong Pro paint sales growth as a result of our mutual efforts with The Home Depot to grow and capture share in this channel. 
And BEHR MARQUEE, a high price point, DIY product, continued to post exceptional year-over-year comps. Behr was once again acknowledged as the quality leader by achieving a #1 ranking from a leading consumer testing organization for its BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA exterior paint. Our Behr products have now held the #1 ranking for interior and exterior paint as well as exterior stains for 4 years running, demonstrating our commitment to customer focus, award-winning high-quality products. Our investments in paint are paying off, and we intend to continue to reinvest in this segment to drive profitable volume growth along with our partner. 
Turning to Cabinets. The team delivered yet another strong quarter, growing our leadership position at retail and continuing to optimize sales mix by exiting low-margin, direct-to-builder business as we described on our first quarter earnings call. 
Moving to Windows and Other Specialty Products. Our sales grew by 3%, but we did not meet our operating profit expectations. We're working diligently to address this underperformance and remain confident in our long-term operating margin expectations of 10% to 13% for this segment that we outlined at our Investor Day. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter operating performance. 
Additionally, we continued progress against our key capital allocation initiatives, including finalizing our debt transactions and paying down $400 million in debt; repurchasing approximately 2.8 million shares, bringing our total shares repurchased to date to 28 million against our 50 million repurchase authorization; and lastly, our Board of Directors announcing its intention to increase our annual dividend by $0.02 per share beginning in the fourth quarter, expressing confidence in our future outlook. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?"

As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges. 
Our focused execution continued as we delivered strong top and bottom line growth in North America and internationally. The second quarter of 2016 was our 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth. 
Sales increased 4% for the quarter. The impact of foreign currency translation softened in the second quarter and negatively impacted our revenue by approximately $6 million. 
North American sales were up 3% in the quarter. We continued to experience strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as consumers are trading up to our better and best product offerings. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales. 
International sales increased 9% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international Plumbing and Window businesses. 
Gross margins expanded 220 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year to 35.2%. And our track record of SG&A improvement continued in the second quarter as SG&A as a percent of sales improved 40 [ph] basis points, driven by focused cost control and productivity improvement throughout the organization. 
We delivered very strong bottom line performance as operating profit increased 22% to $342 million, with operating margins expanding 260 basis points to 17.1%, our highest second quarter margin in 14 years. 
Our EPS was $0.46 in the quarter, an improvement of $0.08 or 21% compared to the second quarter of 2015. These results include the $40 million of onetime interest payment we noted in last quarter's earnings call to complete the retirement of debt maturities. This negatively impacted our EPS. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment had a terrific second quarter. Segment sales increased 10%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $5 million in the quarter. Our North American sales grew 9% in the second quarter. 
We experienced strong demand for our innovative Delta and Brizo brands with both our wholesale and large retail customers as we gained share in the quarter. Our second quarter sales also benefited by approximately $10 million due to loaded sales associated with the recent retail program win. 
Our international Plumbing sales increased 11% in local currency. Hansgrohe continues to outperform as it delivered its highest quarterly sales and operating profit in the company's history, breaking the record they set last quarter. 
We experienced sales growth around the globe with particular strength in Central and Northern Europe, the Americas and Asia. Additionally, our mix improved as our premium price point Axor brand grew double digits in the quarter. 
Operating profit for this segment increased 39% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume, productivity improvements and a favorable price/commodity relationship, particularly in Europe. This segment also benefited from a positive year-over-year commodity hedge impact of approximately $5 million. 
In the second half of 2016, we anticipate investing approximately $10 million in advertising and displays to support new product launches at both Delta and Brizo. Given this segment's sustained performance improvement but also taking into account further investments to grow the business, we are raising our long-term operating margin expectations for this segment from 16% to 17% to the high teens. 
Turning to Slide 8. In the Decorative Architectural segment, sales matched the second quarter of 2015. We experienced solid performance of our Behr MARQUEE interior product and continued strong growth across our Behr Pro business. 
However, as I mentioned on the first quarter call, this segment faced a difficult comp in Q2 as the second quarter of 2015 was a record sales quarter for Behr. In the second quarter of 2016, the timing and amount of incremental promotional expense for the Memorial Day and July 4th promotional events negatively impacted our revenues. You may recall last year's July 4th event was entirely in Q3 while this year's event straddled Q2 and Q3. 
Additionally, sales were negatively impacted by an in-store inventory drawdown late in the second quarter of 2016. 
Liberty Hardware had another solid quarter due to continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. We are also pleased that Liberty was recently awarded the final portion of a nationwide shower door program at The Home Depot. We will be resetting the remaining 800-plus stores with this innovative program in the fourth quarter. 
Operating profit increased $6 million in the second quarter, principally due to operating leverage on higher volume at Behr and Liberty. While we have experienced solid margins in the first half of the year, we will invest to grow gallons in the second half of 2016. At this time, we expect the amount of this investment to be approximately $30 million, the majority of which will be spent in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are extremely pleased with our Cabinet segment improved performance in Q2. Segment sales declined 3% due to the deliberate exit of certain lower-margin business within the builder direct channel in the United States and at select low-margin accounts in our U.K. Cabinet business. This decline was partially offset by KraftMaid's strong performance in the retail channel, resulting in double-digit growth and year-over-year share gains. 
In the dealer channel, we drove single-digit growth through increased volume and favorable mix as both our Merillat offerings and our dealer-exclusive KraftMaid Vantage program continue to resonate with our dealer base and consumers. Segment profitability in the second quarter improved $22 million or 147% over 2015. 
Our strong second quarter margin of 14.2% was driven by cost-savings initiatives as well as an improved mix as we reduced our exposure to lower-margin builder-direct business and enjoyed continued growth of our higher price point semi-custom KraftMaid offering. For the balance of 2016, we believe the revenue impact of our decision to exit select builder-direct business and our retail kitchen countertop business will negatively impact sales by approximately $15 million in both Q3 and Q4. 
In addition, through the second half of 2016, we will be launching new products under the KraftMaid and Quality brands and anticipate approximately $10 million of expense associated with these new product introductions. Finally, given this segment's sustained performance improvement, we are raising the long -- our long-term expectations for operating margins from 8% to 9% to a low to mid-teens. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Windows segment sales increased 3%, driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard's continued growth was driven by a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing. 
Excluding the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollars, our European window sales increased 10% as this segment continues to benefit from share gains through the strong performance of our premium price point window and door offerings. This segment's operating profit declined due to ERP expenses at Milgard of approximately $6 million, which we previously disclosed and adjustments in Milguard's warranty reserve of approximately $10 million. 
In addition, we experienced approximately $8 million of incremental labor cost and inefficiencies as Milgard continues to grow. Despite this quarter's results, we continue to believe this segment will achieve 10% to 13% operating margins long term. 
Now turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, we took additional action to further strengthen our balance sheet and unlock shareholder value. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of balance sheet liquidity. 
As we mentioned last quarter, in March, we issued $900 million of new notes. Than in mid-April, we used the proceeds from these debt issuances, together with cash on hand, to repay in order to retire all of our $1 billion notes due in October 2016 and all of our $300 million notes, which were due in March of 2017. 
To complete the retirement of these 2 debt maturities, we incurred approximately $40 million and a onetime interest payment during the quarter, which increased our interest expense to $87 million for the second quarter. However, the results of these transactions will generate an annual interest expense savings of nearly $45 million. 
Starting with our third quarter of 2016, our quarterly interest expense will be approximately $44 million. With these refinancing transactions, we have delivered on our long-term commitment to strengthen our balance sheet. Due to our strong cash flow and this recent debt retirement, we have greatly enhanced our financial flexibility as our net debt-to-EBITDA now stands at approximately 1.6x. 
From a working capital perspective, we delivered another strong quarter performance with working capital as a percent of sales improving 70 basis points versus the prior year to 13.3%. 
Finally, as Keith mentioned, we continued our share repurchase activity. And during the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares, valued at approximately $88 million. 
So with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

Our results reflect the strength of our powerful brands and our rigorous focus on operational excellence. 
Due to our continued success in these areas, we are raising our long-term margin expectations for our Plumbing segment to the high teens and for our Cabinet segment to the low to mid-teens. The fundamentals driving our business continue to accelerate. Home prices continue to appreciate, which is a driver for larger-ticket items such as cabinets and windows. 
Housing turnover continues to increase, which is a leading indicator of repair and remodel spend. And as you recall, repair and remodel is 83% of our business, and homes remain affordable, with improving access to credit as well as lower mortgage rates, stimulating housing and home improvement activity. 
Consumers continue to gain confidence to reinvest in their homes, and we are well positioned to benefit from those positive trends. The strategies that we laid out last year are working. Going forward, we remain committed to: investing behind our brands for growth; developing innovative, award-winning products to ensure we maintain our must-have position with our customers; focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the Masco Operating System; and finally, balancing our capital allocation between investing for growth, acquisitions with the right strategic fit and returns and returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.

In terms of our performance in paint, I think there's a couple of things to think about. As we talk about that glide plan closer to the high teens, 18% range, we're very pleased with the performance of the segment this quarter and the progress that we made. But as we talked about historically, we'll be investing in this business over the long term to help grow gallons, but I think it was a couple of 3 things that may influence the margin pressure down. First is commodities. We have been experiencing some mild commodity cost inflation from a major supplier's titanium, and I think as everyone is aware, they've announced further price increases related this year. The second is investments. As we've talked about historically, we are trying to grow this business and grow gallons in conjunction with our channel partner, The Home Depot. And so we're investing heavily to grow our Pro business. In fact, we are investing here in the back half of 2015 (sic) [ 2016 ] part of the $30 million investment that I outlined in my prepared remarks really goes to growing a hub stores. We have 100 new hub stores, where we'll be employing people to help grow our paint business in The Home Depot. And finally, mix is I think we've mentioned very clearly over the course of last couple of quarters, our Pro business does not have or come at the same margin profile as our core DIY business. So I think those are the 3 elements that, over time, will drive the margins closer to the high teens range from where we're at and from where we stand today in the 22% range."

As we talk to the various dealer and constituents around our business, we're hearing about good foot traffic and continued good spend. In the Cabinet and Window business, which both of those have a very strong component of R&R and that we're seeing improved mix as well. Now part of that is driven by productive changes we've made to our assortment and how we're managing the business, but it's also a general uptick in mix in terms of the market. I think your great indicators are lock and spa business. We set and others, as John said, we set another sales record there this quarter. And when you consider the discretionary nature of this product and its high price point, it really reflects on the consumer's appetite to reinvest in their homes. So we're seeing the consumers utilize credit more with larger-ticket purchases such as spas. So I think the consumer is feeling confident. That's a direct reflection on demand in R&R and then, of course, home price appreciation and new housing turnover, all of which are continuing to grow, which continue to feed that. With regards to your second question, Eric, around incremental payback on the Pro initiative, it's an outstanding payback for us. It's very profitable. While it doesn't have necessarily the margin of our core DIY business, it has outstanding returns for us, and I think importantly, the fact that we are so trying strategically with Home Depot that this is a very positive revenue source for us for quite a while.

Are those the only 2 major kind of items in a bridge that we should be modeling or thinking about for this quarter? Just because obviously, the profitability in this quarter was pretty substantial."

Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased to report that the momentum we built in 2015 and carried forward into the first quarter of 2016 has continued year-to-date. We had a great second quarter as strength in our underlying markets, combined with solid execution, translated into excellent financial results. 
Looking specifically at the quarter, our top line increased by 4%. Notably, our adjusted operating margin increased 260 basis points to 17.1%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage, a favorable price/commodity environment and our culture of continuous cost improvement. This represents our best second quarter operating margin since 2002. 
Our adjusted EPS grew 21% to $0.46 per share, which includes the $40 million additional interest expense we incurred during the quarter due to the early retirement of a portion of our debt. 
These results reflect our ability to capitalize on improving end market dynamics and our ability to generate robust consumer demand from our industry-leading brands. 
I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments' performance. Let's begin with Plumbing. 
Our portfolio of Plumbing businesses continued its strong performance and grew sales in North America by 9% and grew sales internationally by 11% in local currency. This segment's strong growth was broad based with Delta, Hansgrohe and BrassCraft Manufacturing, our rough plumbing business, each having record quarters for both sales and operating profit. The Delta and Brizo brands continue to resonate with the consumer and drive sales growth in both the retail and wholesale channels in North America, while the Hansgrohe and Axor brands continue to gain share internationally. Watkins Manufacturing, our premier wellness and spa business within our Plumbing segment, also achieved a record sales quarter, a good sign that consumer confidence continues to build, as exemplified by these big-ticket purchases. 
Our Decorative Architectural segment delivered a solid quarter despite being up against a tough comp, as we pointed out on our last quarterly earnings call. We continued our strong Pro paint sales growth as a result of our mutual efforts with The Home Depot to grow and capture share in this channel. 
And BEHR MARQUEE, a high-price-point, DIY product, continued to post exceptional year-over-year comps. Behr was once again acknowledged as the quality leader by achieving a #1 ranking from a leading consumer testing organization for its BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA exterior paint. Our Behr products have now held the #1 ranking for interior and exterior paint as well as exterior stains for 4 years running, demonstrating our commitment to customer focused, award-winning, high-quality products. Our investments in paint are paying off, and we intend to continue to reinvest in this segment to drive profitable volume growth along with our partner. 
Turning to cabinets. The team delivered yet another strong quarter, growing our leadership position at retail and continuing to optimize sales mix by exiting low-margin, direct-to-builder business, as we described on our first quarter earnings call. 
Moving to Windows and Other Specialty Products. Our sales grew by 3%, but we did not meet our operating profit expectations. We're working diligently to address this underperformance and remain confident in our long-term operating margin expectations of 10% to 13% for this segment that we outlined at our Investor Day. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter operating performance. 
Additionally, we continued progress against our key capital allocation initiatives, including finalizing our debt transactions and paying down $400 million in debt; repurchasing approximately 2.8 million shares, bringing our total shares repurchased to date to 28 million against our 50 million repurchase authorization; and lastly, our Board of Directors announcing its intention to increase our annual dividend by $0.02 per share beginning in the fourth quarter, expressing confidence in our future outlook. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?"

As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges. 
Our focused execution continued as we delivered strong top and bottom line growth in North America and internationally. The second quarter of 2016 was our 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth. 
Sales increased 4% for the quarter. The impact of foreign currency translation softened in the second quarter and negatively impacted our revenue by approximately $6 million. 
North American sales were up 3% in the quarter. We continued to experience strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as consumers are trading up to our better and best product offerings. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales. 
International sales increased 9% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international Plumbing and window businesses. 
Gross margins expanded 220 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year to 35.2%. And our track record of SG&A improvement continued in the second quarter as SG&A as a percent of sales improved 40 basis points, driven by focused cost control and productivity improvement throughout the organization. 
We delivered very strong bottom line performance as operating profit increased 22% to $342 million with operating margins expanding 260 basis points to 17.1%, our highest second quarter margin in 14 years. 
Our EPS was $0.46 in the quarter, an improvement of $0.08 or 21% compared to the second quarter of 2015. These results include the $40 million of onetime interest payment we noted in last quarter's earnings call to complete the retirement of debt maturities. This negatively impacted our EPS. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment had a terrific second quarter. Segment sales increased 10%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $5 million in the quarter. Our North American sales grew 9% in the second quarter. 
We experienced strong demand for our innovative Delta and Brizo brands with both our wholesale and large retail customers as we gained share in the quarter. Our second quarter sales also benefited by approximately $10 million due to load in sales associated with a recent retail program win. 
Our international Plumbing sales increased 11% in local currency. Hansgrohe continues to outperform as it delivered its highest quarterly sales and operating profit in the company's history, breaking the record they set last quarter. We experienced sales growth around the globe with particular strength in Central and Northern Europe, the Americas and Asia. Additionally, our mix improved as our premium price point Axor brand grew double digits in the quarter. 
Operating profit for this segment increased 39% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume, productivity improvements and a favorable price/commodity relationship, particularly in Europe. This segment also benefited from a positive year-over-year commodity hedge impact of approximately $5 million. 
In the second half of 2016, we anticipate investing approximately $10 million in advertising and displays to support new product launches at both Delta and Brizo. Given this segment's sustained performance improvement but also taking into account further investments to grow the business, we are raising our long-term operating margin expectations for this segment from 16% to 17% to the high teens. 
Turning to Slide 8. In the Decorative Architectural segment, sales matched the second quarter of 2015. We experienced solid performance of our BEHR MARQUEE Interior products and continued strong growth across our Behr Pro business. However, as I mentioned on the first quarter call, this segment faced a difficult comp in Q2 as the second quarter of 2015 was a record sales quarter for Behr. In the second quarter of 2016, the timing and amount of incremental promotional expense for the Memorial Day and July 4th promotional events negatively impacted our revenues. You may recall last year's July 4th event was entirely in Q3 while this year's event straddled Q2 and Q3. Additionally, sales were negatively impacted by an in-store inventory drawdown late in the second quarter of 2016. 
Liberty Hardware had another solid quarter due to continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. We are also pleased that Liberty was recently awarded the final portion of a nationwide shower door program at The Home Depot. We will be refitting the remaining 800-plus stores with this innovative program in the fourth quarter. 
Operating profit increased $6 million in the second quarter principally due to operating leverage on higher volume at Behr and Liberty. While we have experienced solid margins in the first half of the year, we will invest to grow gallons in the second half of 2016. At this time, we expect the amount of this investment to be approximately $30 million, a majority of which will be spent in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are extremely pleased with our Cabinet segment's improved performance in Q2. Segment sales declined 3% due to the deliberate exit of certain lower-margin business within the builder direct channel in the United States and at select low-margin accounts in our U.K. Cabinet business. This decline was partially offset by KraftMaid's strong performance in the retail channel, resulting in double-digit growth and year-over-year share gains. In the dealer channel, we drove single-digit growth through increased volume and a favorable mix as both our Merillat offerings and our dealer-exclusive KraftMaid Vantage program continued to resonate with our dealer base and consumers. Segment profitability in the second quarter improved $22 million or 147% over 2015. 
Our strong second quarter margin of 14.2% was driven by cost savings initiatives as well as an improved mix as we reduced our exposure to lower-margin builder-direct business and enjoyed continued growth of our higher-price-point, semi-custom KraftMaid offering. For the balance of 2016, we believe the revenue impact of our decision to exit select builder-direct business and our retail kitchen countertop business will negatively impact sales by approximately $15 million in both Q3 and Q4. In addition, through the second half of 2016, we will be launching new products under the KraftMaid and Quality brands and anticipate approximately $10 million of expense associated with these new product introductions. Finally, given this segment's sustained performance improvement, we are raising the long -- our long-term expectations for operating margins from 8% to 9% to a low to mid-teens. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our windows segment sales increased 3%, driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard's continued growth was driven by a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing. 
Excluding the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 10% as this segment continues to benefit from share gains through the strong performance of our premium-price-point window and door offerings. This segment's operating profit declined due to ERP expenses at Milgard of approximately $6 million, which we previously disclosed, and an adjustment to Milgard's warranty reserve of approximately $10 million. In addition, we experienced approximately $8 million of incremental labor costs and inefficiencies as Milgard continues to grow. Despite this quarter's results, we continue to believe this segment will achieve 10% to 13% operating margins long term. 
And turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, we took additional action to further strengthen our balance sheet and unlock shareholder value. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of balance sheet liquidity. 
As we mentioned last quarter, in March, we issued $900 million of new notes. Then in mid-April, we used the proceeds from these debt issuances, together with cash on hand, to repay in order to retire all of our $1 billion notes due in October 2016 and all of our $300 million notes, which were due in March of 2017. 
To complete the retirement of these 2 debt maturities, we incurred approximately $40 million and a onetime interest payment during the quarter, which increased our interest expense to $87 million for the second quarter. However, the results of these transactions will generate an annual interest expense savings of nearly $45 million. Starting with our third quarter of 2016, our quarterly interest expense will be approximately $44 million. 
With these refinancing transactions, we have delivered on our long-term commitment to strengthen our balance sheet. Due to our strong cash flow and this recent debt retirement, we have greatly enhanced our financial flexibility as our net debt-to-EBITDA now stands at approximately 1.6x. 
From a working capital perspective, we delivered another strong quarter of performance with working capital as a percent of sales improving 70 basis points versus the prior year to 13.3%. 
Finally, as Keith mentioned, we continued our share repurchase activity. And during the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares valued at approximately $88 million. 
So with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

Our results reflect the strength of our powerful brands and our rigorous focus on operational excellence. Due to our continued success in these areas, we are raising our long-term margin expectations for our Plumbing segment to the high teens and for our Cabinet segment to the low to mid-teens. 
The fundamentals driving our business continue to accelerate. Home prices continue to appreciate, which is a driver for larger-ticket items such as cabinets and windows. Housing turnover continues to increase, which is a leading indicator of repair and remodel spend. And as you recall, repair and remodel is 83% of our business. And homes remain affordable, with improving access to credit as well as lower mortgage rates, stimulating housing and home improvement activity. Consumers continue to gain confidence to reinvest in their homes, and we are well positioned to benefit from those positive trends. 
The strategies that we laid out last year are working. Going forward, we remain committed to: investing behind our brands for growth; developing innovative, award-winning products to ensure we maintain our must-have position with our customers; focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the Masco Operating System; and finally, balancing our capital allocation between investing for growth, acquisitions with the right strategic fit and returns and returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. 
We remain very confident in achieving our 2017 earnings per share target of $1.80 that we set at our Investor Day last year. Our operational execution, coupled with our strengthened balance sheet and strong liquidity position, provides us with multiple levers to continue to drive shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. So I'll throw it back to you, Jonathan."

Are they systematic? Are they based on the approaches that we're driving in the Masco Operating System? And quite frankly, we look at the people and we look at the teams, and we evaluate how those teams are successfully implementing our operating systems and the nature of the improvements that they're driving. So when we look at sustained performance improvement, we look at how it's come to us and we look at the people that are driving it and the confidence that we have in those teams. Those things altogether have said we're comfortable in taking our margins up to the high teens in Plumbing, which is a very, very solid business, and taking them up in Cabinets, as we described."

Among -- we're very pleased with the performance of this segment this quarter and the progress that we've made. But as we've talked about historically, we'll be investing in this business over the long term to help grow gallons. I think there's a couple or 3 things that may influence the margin pressure down. First is commodities. We have been experiencing some mild commodity cost inflation from a major supplier's titanium dioxide. And as I think everyone is aware, they have announced further price increases for later this year. The second is investments. As we've talked about historically, we are trying to grow this business and grow gallons in conjunction with our channel partner, The Home Depot. And so we're investing heavily to grow our Pro business. In fact, we are investing here in the back half of 2015 (sic) [ 2016 ]. Part of the $30 million investment that I outlined in my prepared remarks really goes to growing our hub stores. We have 100 new hub stores where we'll be employing people to help grow our paint business in The Home Depot. And finally, mix. As I think we've mentioned very clearly over the course of last couple of quarters, our Pro business does not have or come at the same margin profile as our core DIY business. So I think those are the 3 elements that, over time, will drive the margins closer to the high teens range from where we're at and from where we stand today in the 22% range."

I think home price appreciation has a good -- is a good driver for that. And there has been some deferral in investing in big-ticket items that folks have put into their homes for a number of years, and that's coming off the sideline. As we talk to the various dealer and constituents around our business, we're hearing about good foot traffic and continued good spend. In the Cabinet and window business, which both of those have a very strong component of R&R in that, we are seeing improved mix as well. Now a part of that is driven by productive changes we've made to our assortment and how we're managing the business, but it's also a general uptick in mix in terms of the market. I think your great indicators are lock and spa business. We set another -- as John said, we set another sales record there this quarter. And when you consider the discretionary nature of this product and its high price point, it really reflects on the consumer's appetite to reinvest in their homes. So we're seeing the consumers utilize credit more with larger-ticket purchases such as spas. So I think the consumer is feeling confident. That's a direct reflection on demand in R&R and then, of course, home price appreciation and new housing turnover, all of which are continuing to grow, which continue to feed that. With regards to your second question, Eric, around the incremental payback on the Pro initiative, it's an outstanding payback for us. I'm -- it's very profitable. While it doesn't have necessarily the margin of our core DIY business, it has outstanding returns for us. And I think importantly, the fact that we are so -- trying strategically with Home Depot, that this is a very positive revenue source for us for quite a while. We're very confident in Pro and paint."

So looking into 3Q -- and I know you don't get too granular here, but given that I wouldn't expect the full 500, 600 bps to hit because of the lesser amount of promotional expense, should it kind of return to that high teens type of number that you're looking at longer term?

Our pipeline is growing in terms of absolute size, and we're seeing accelerated movement of targets through our pipeline as we develop them, develop relationships and start to understand better how we could add value. We're being prudent, I would say, careful in making sure that our acquisition targets and a deal, should we do it, would bring good value. We're very disciplined in looking for the appropriate return on our investment and the ability for us to bring synergies to it. So no real change to our capital allocation or our M&A strategy, anything that's significantly different from what we've talked about for the better part of 1.5 years or so.

It's reflected in both channels of distribution. So the biggest change in margin from a cost-out perspective is really shared between the channels. When you look at where we're having the most margin productivity in terms of price, if you will, I'd point to the dealer side where we're getting mix, and that's been very helpful. We've come out now sometime ago with the KraftMaid Vantage program, which really gives some differentiation to the dealers, and we're seeing that be very productive, and that continues to raise in terms of the percentage of mix of our overall sell. And so I'd look at our margin as a combination. Of course, there are factory and shop floor improvements that are shared by both segments. And then particularly in dealer, the mix-up is helping us. And I'll tell you we're excited about the new products. We've got -- John talked about and I summarized about the investments that we have in the back half around new products for both KraftMaid as well as our Quality brands.

And zinc actually has risen pretty nicely over the course of last several of quarters. It's been off of its bottoms consistently. If you take a look at copper, copper really fell pretty dramatically in the November time frame last year and really stable now through kind of mid-January. And then it started to tick up from there. And as we've said in the past, it takes about 2 quarters for that -- those impacts to flow through and hit our P&L, which is about the second quarter when that -- when we'd feel a lot of that impact. So I feel good about that. Looking around to our other product categories, though, not seeing a ton of inflation in our wood products at all. We see a little bit of inflation but not much. TiO2, we've already spoken about. Petroleum has been up and down a little bit. The one area that we did see a little bit of inflation, and we called this out in our first quarter call, was glass out in the Western United States, where a glass factory had gone down. And so we had implemented price to offset that price increase that we incurred. That said, we are working hard on our continuous improvement through our Masco Operating System to try to offset any of this inflation that we are incurring to continue to drive our margins even higher."

Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased to report that the momentum we built in 2015 and carried forward into the first quarter of 2016 has continued year-to-date. We had a great second quarter as strength in our underlying markets, combined with solid execution, translated into excellent financial results. 
Looking specifically at the quarter, our top line increased by 4%. Notably, our adjusted operating margin increased 260 basis points to 17.1%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage, a favorable price/commodity environment and our culture of continuous cost improvement. This represents our best second quarter operating margin since 2002. 
Our adjusted EPS grew 21% to $0.46 per share, which includes the $40 million additional interest expense we incurred during the quarter due to the early retirement of a portion of our debt. 
These results reflect our ability to capitalize on improving end-market dynamics and our ability to generate robust consumer demand from our industry-leading brands. 
I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments' performance. Let's begin with Plumbing. 
Our portfolio of Plumbing businesses continued its strong performance and grew sales in North America by 9% and grew sales internationally by 11% in local currency. This segment's strong growth was broad based with Delta, Hansgrohe and BrassCraft Manufacturing, our rough plumbing business, each having record quarters for both sales and operating profit. The Delta and Brizo brands continue to resonate with the consumer and drive sales growth in both the retail and wholesale channels in North America, while the Hansgrohe and Axor brands continue to gain share internationally. Watkins Manufacturing, our premier wellness and spa business within our Plumbing segment, also achieved a record sales quarter, a good sign that consumer confidence continues to build, as exemplified by these big-ticket purchases. 
Our Decorative Architectural segment delivered a solid quarter despite being up against a tough comp, as we pointed out on our last quarterly earnings call. We continued our strong Pro paint sales growth as a result of our mutual efforts with The Home Depot to grow and capture share in this channel. 
And BEHR MARQUEE, a high-price-point DIY product, continued to post exceptional year-over-year comps. Behr was once again acknowledged as the quality leader by achieving a #1 ranking from a leading consumer-testing organization for its BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA exterior paint. Our Behr products have now held the #1 ranking for interior and exterior paint as well as exterior stains for 4 years running, demonstrating our commitment to customer focused, award-winning, high-quality products. Our investments in paint are paying off, and we intend to continue to reinvest in this segment to drive profitable volume growth along with our partner. 
Turning to Cabinets. The team delivered yet another strong quarter, growing our leadership position at retail and continuing to optimize sales mix by exiting low-margin, direct-to-builder business, as we described on our first quarter earnings call. 
Moving to Windows and Other Specialty Products. Our sales grew by 3%, but we did not meet our operating profit expectations. We're working diligently to address this underperformance and remain confident in our long-term operating margin expectations of 10% to 13% for this segment that we outlined at our Investor Day. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter operating performance. 
Additionally, we continued progress against our key capital allocation initiatives, including: finalizing our debt transactions and paying down $400 million in debt; repurchasing approximately 2.8 million shares, bringing our total shares repurchased to date to 28 million against our 50 million repurchase authorization; and lastly, our Board of Directors announcing its intention to increase our annual dividend by $0.02 per share beginning in the fourth quarter, expressing confidence in our future outlook. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?"

As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges. 
Our focused execution continued as we delivered strong top and bottom line growth in North America and internationally. The second quarter of 2016 was our 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth. 
Sales increased 4% for the quarter. The impact of foreign currency translation softened in the second quarter and negatively impacted our revenue by approximately $6 million. 
North American sales were up 3% in the quarter. We continued to experience strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as consumers are trading up to our better and best product offerings. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales. 
International sales increased 9% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international Plumbing and window businesses. 
Gross margins expanded 220 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year to 35.2%. And our track record of SG&A improvement continued in the second quarter as SG&A as a percent of sales improved 40 basis points, driven by focused cost control and productivity improvement throughout the organization. 
We delivered very strong bottom line performance as operating profit increased 22% to $342 million with operating margins expanding 260 basis points to 17.1%, our highest second quarter margin in 14 years. 
Our EPS was $0.46 in the quarter, an improvement of $0.08 or 21% compared to the second quarter of 2015. These results include the $40 million of onetime interest payment we noted in last quarter's earnings call to complete the retirement of debt maturities. This negatively impacted our EPS. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment had a terrific second quarter. Segment sales increased 10%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $5 million in the quarter. Our North American sales grew 9% in the second quarter. 
We experienced strong demand for our innovative Delta and Brizo brands with both our wholesale and large retail customers as we gained share in the quarter. Our second quarter sales also benefited by approximately $10 million due to load-in sales associated with a recent retail program win. 
Our international Plumbing sales increased 11% in local currency. Hansgrohe continues to outperform as it delivered its highest quarterly sales and operating profit in the company's history, breaking the record they set last quarter. We experienced sales growth around the globe with particular strength in Central and Northern Europe, the Americas and Asia. Additionally, our mix improved as our premium price point Axor brand grew double digits in the quarter. 
Operating profit for this segment increased 39% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume, productivity improvements and a favorable price/commodity relationship, particularly in Europe. This segment also benefited from a positive year-over-year commodity hedge impact of approximately $5 million. 
In the second half of 2016, we anticipate investing approximately $10 million in advertising and displays to support new product launches at both Delta and Brizo. Given this segment's sustained performance improvement but also taking into account further investments to grow the business, we are raising our long-term operating margin expectations for this segment from 16% to 17% to the high teens. 
Turning to Slide 8. In the Decorative Architectural segment, sales matched the second quarter of 2015. We experienced solid performance of our BEHR MARQUEE Interior products and continued strong growth across our Behr Pro business. However, as I mentioned on the first quarter call, this segment faced a difficult comp in Q2 as the second quarter of 2015 was a record sales quarter for Behr. In the second quarter of 2016, the timing and amount of incremental promotional expense for the Memorial Day and July 4th promotional events negatively impacted our revenues. You may recall last year's July 4th event was entirely in Q3, while this year's event straddled Q2 and Q3. Additionally, sales were negatively impacted by an in-store inventory drawdown late in the second quarter of 2016. 
Liberty Hardware had another solid quarter due to continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. We are also pleased that Liberty was recently awarded a final portion of a nationwide shower door program at The Home Depot. We will be refitting the remaining 800-plus stores with this innovative program in the fourth quarter. 
Operating profit increased $6 million in the second quarter principally due to operating leverage on higher volume at Behr and Liberty. While we have experienced solid margins in the first half of the year, we will invest to grow gallons in the second half of 2016. At this time, we expect the amount of this investment to be approximately $30 million, the majority of which will be spent in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are extremely pleased with our Cabinet segment's improved performance in Q2. Segment sales declined 3% due to the deliberate exit of certain lower-margin business within the builder direct channel in the United States and at select low-margin accounts in our U.K. Cabinet business. This decline was partially offset by KraftMaid's strong performance in the retail channel, resulting in double-digit growth and year-over-year share gains. In the dealer channel, we drove single-digit growth through increased volume and a favorable mix as both our Merillat offerings and our dealer-exclusive KraftMaid Vantage program continued to resonate with our dealer base and consumers. Segment profitability in the second quarter improved $22 million or 147% over 2015. 
Our strong second quarter margin of 14.2% was driven by cost-savings initiatives as well as an improved mix as we reduced our exposure to lower-margin builder-direct business and enjoyed continued growth of our higher-price-point, semi-custom KraftMaid offering. For the balance of 2016, we believe the revenue impact of our decision to exit select builder-direct business and our retail kitchen countertop business will negatively impact sales by approximately $15 million in both Q3 and Q4. 
In addition, through the second half of 2016, we will be launching new products under the KraftMaid and Quality brands and anticipate approximately $10 million of expense associated with these new product introductions. 
Finally, given this segment's sustained performance improvement, we are raising the long -- our long-term expectations for operating margins from 8% to 9% to a low to mid-teens. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our windows segment sales increased 3%, driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard's continued growth was driven by a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing. 
Excluding the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 10% as this segment continues to benefit from share gains through the strong performance of our premium-price-point window and door offerings. This segment's operating profit decline was due to ERP expenses at Milgard of approximately $6 million which we previously disclosed, and an adjustment to Milgard's warranty reserve of approximately $10 million. In addition, we experienced approximately $8 million of incremental labor costs and inefficiencies as Milgard continues to grow. Despite this quarter's results, we continue to believe this segment will achieve 10% to 13% operating margins long term. 
Turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, we took additional action to further strengthen our balance sheet and unlock shareholder value. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of balance sheet liquidity. 
As we mentioned last quarter, in March, we issued $900 million of new notes. Then in mid-April, we used the proceeds from these debt issuances, together with cash on hand, to repay in order to retire all of our $1 billion notes due in October 2016 and all of our $300 million notes, which were due in March of 2017. 
To complete the retirement of these 2 debt maturities, we incurred approximately $40 million in a onetime interest payment during the quarter, which increased our interest expense to $87 million for the second quarter. However, the results of these transactions will generate an annual interest expense savings of nearly $45 million. Starting with our third quarter of 2016, our quarterly interest expense will be approximately $44 million. 
With these refinancing transactions, we have delivered on our long-term commitment to strengthen our balance sheet. Due to our strong cash flow and this recent debt retirement, we have greatly enhanced our financial flexibility as our net debt-to-EBITDA now stands at approximately 1.6x. 
From a working capital perspective, we delivered another strong quarter of performance with working capital as a percent of sales improving 70 basis points versus the prior year to 13.3%. 
Finally, as Keith mentioned, we continued our share repurchase activities. And during the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares valued at approximately $88 million. 
So with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

Our results reflect the strength of our powerful brands and our rigorous focus on operational excellence. Due to our continued success in these areas, we are raising our long-term margin expectations for our Plumbing segment to the high teens and for our Cabinet segment to the low to mid-teens. 
The fundamentals driving our business continue to accelerate. Home prices continue to appreciate, which is a driver for larger-ticket items such as cabinets and windows. Housing turnover continues to increase, which is a leading indicator of repair and remodel spend. And as you recall, repair and remodel is 83% of our business. And homes remain affordable, with improving access to credit, as well as lower mortgage rates, stimulating housing and home improvement activity. Consumers continue to gain confidence to reinvest in their homes, and we are well positioned to benefit from those positive trends. 
The strategies that we laid out last year are working. Going forward, we remain committed to: investing behind our brands for growth; developing innovative, award-winning products to ensure we maintain our must-have position with our customers; focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the Masco Operating System; and finally, balancing our capital allocation between investing for growth, acquisitions with the right strategic fit and returns and returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. 
We remain very confident in achieving our 2017 earnings per share target of $1.80 that we set at our Investor Day last year. Our operational execution, coupled with our strengthened balance sheet and strong liquidity position, provides us with multiple levers to continue to drive shareholder value.

Although we're very pleased with the performance of this segment this quarter and the progress that we've made, but as we've talked about historically, we'll be investing in this business over the long term to help grow gallons. I think there's a couple or 3 things that may influence the margin pressure down. First is commodities. We have been experiencing some mild commodity cost inflation from a major supplier's titanium dioxide. And as I think everyone is aware, they have announced further price increases for later this year. The second is investments. As we've talked about historically, we are trying to grow this business and grow gallons in conjunction with our channel partner, The Home Depot. And so we're investing heavily to grow our Pro business. In fact, we are investing here in the back half of 2015 (sic) [2016]. Part of the $30 million investment that I outlined in my prepared remarks really goes to growing our hub stores. We have 100 new hub stores where we'll be employing people to help grow our paint business in The Home Depot. And finally, mix. As I think we've mentioned very clearly over the course of the last couple of quarters, our Pro business does not have or come at the same margin profile as our core DIY business. So I think those are the 3 elements that, over time, will drive the margins closer to that high-teens range from where we're at and from where we stand today in the 22% range."

And there has been some deferral in investing in big-ticket items that folks have put into their homes for a number of years, and that's coming off the sideline. As we talk to the various dealer and constituents around our business, we're hearing about good foot traffic and continued good spend. In the Cabinet and window business, which both of those have a very strong component of R&R in that, we are seeing improved mix as well. Now a part of that is driven by productive changes we've made to our assortment and how we're managing the business, but it's also a general uptick in mix in terms of the market. I think your great indicators are lock and spa business. We set another -- as John said, we set another sales record there this quarter. And when you consider the discretionary nature of this product and its high price point, it really reflects on the consumers' appetite to reinvest in their homes. So we're seeing the consumers utilize credit more with larger-ticket purchases such as spas. So I think the consumer is feeling confident. That's a direct reflection on demand in R&R and then, of course, home price appreciation and new housing turnover, all of which are continuing to grow, which continue to feed that. With regards to your second question, Eric, around the incremental payback on the Pro initiative, it's an outstanding payback for us. I mean it's very profitable. While it doesn't have necessarily the margin of our core DIY business, it has outstanding returns for us.

So looking into 3Q, and I know you don't get too granular here, but given that I wouldn't expect the full 500, 600 bps to hit because of the lesser amount of promotional expense, should it kind of return to that high teens type of number that you're looking at longer term?

Across the kind of main Delta portfolio, what were you seeing in terms of what sorts of products were driving that very strong sales gains? Obviously, we saw a lot of design improvements at the trade shows early this year. So what are you seeing there? And what has been driving that, that very strong sales growth?"

In our core business and through both wholesale distribution and repair and remodeling, we're seeing nice unit volume. And that Delta brand is very well known for those customers that are in that price point. And we're very pleased with the performance of our showroom brands, which would be the higher end. We mentioned our Brizo brand, which is the high-end brand underneath Delta Faucet Company. That's double-digit growth and running very well. You look at our Axor brand, which is a high-end brand within the Hansgrohe organization. That had double-digit growth. And then within the Hansgrohe continuum of product, the higher end is continuing to drive. So I'm happy with our channel focus and the work that our sales folks are doing in the showroom. That's very productive for us. But the bread and butter or the core is doing well as well in terms of unit volume."

And zinc actually has risen pretty nicely over the course of the last several of quarters. It's been up off its bottoms consistently. If you take a look at copper, copper really fell pretty dramatically in the November time frame last year and really stayed low through kind of mid-January. And then it started to tick up from there. And as we've said in the past, it takes about 2 quarters for that -- those impacts to flow through and hit our P&L, which is about the second quarter when that would -- when we'd feel a lot of that impact. So I feel good about that. Looking around to our other product categories, though, not seeing a ton of inflation in our wood products at all. We see a little bit of inflation but not much. TiO2, we've already spoken about. Petroleum has been up and down a little bit. The one area that we did see a little bit of inflation, and we called this out in our first quarter call, was glass out in the Western United States, where a glass factory had gone down. And so we had implemented price to offset that price increase that we incurred. That said, we are working hard on our continuous improvement through our Masco Operating System to try to offset any of this inflation that we are incurring to continue to drive our margins even higher."

In terms of inventory from a supply chain perspective, we look at and are constantly developing and improving our methodologies for identifying minimum order quantities and working with our suppliers so that we could get shorter supply chains. So it's a combination of a lot of work that we're doing. Quite frankly, Susan, I didn't expect us to be able to continue to improve to this degree. If you look at where we are, it's pretty darn good.

Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased to report that the momentum we built in 2015 and carried forward into the first quarter of 2016 has continued year-to-date. We had a great second quarter as strength in our underlying markets, combined with solid execution, translated into excellent financial results. 
Looking specifically at the quarter, our top line increased by 4%. Notably, our adjusted operating margin increased 260 basis points to 17.1%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage, a favorable price/commodity environment and our culture of continuous cost improvement. This represents our best second quarter operating margin since 2002. 
Our adjusted EPS grew 21% to $0.46 per share, which includes the $40 million additional interest expense we incurred during the quarter due to the early retirement of a portion of our debt. 
These results reflect our ability to capitalize on improving end-market dynamics and our ability to generate robust consumer demand from our industry-leading brands. 
I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments' performance. Let's begin with Plumbing. 
Our portfolio of Plumbing businesses continued its strong performance and grew sales in North America by 9% and grew sales internationally by 11% in local currency. This segment's strong growth was broad based with Delta, Hansgrohe and BrassCraft Manufacturing, our rough plumbing business, each having record quarters for both sales and operating profit. The Delta and Brizo brands continue to resonate with the consumer and drive sales growth in both the retail and wholesale channels in North America, while the Hansgrohe and Axor brands continue to gain share internationally. Watkins Manufacturing, our premier wellness and spa business within our Plumbing segment, also achieved a record sales quarter, a good sign that consumer confidence continues to build, as exemplified by these big-ticket purchases. 
Our Decorative Architectural segment delivered a solid quarter despite being up against a tough comp, as we pointed out on our last quarterly earnings call. We continued our strong Pro paint sales growth as a result of our mutual efforts with The Home Depot to grow and capture share in this channel. 
And BEHR MARQUEE, a high-price-point DIY product, continued to post exceptional year-over-year comps. Behr was once again acknowledged as the quality leader by achieving a #1 ranking from a leading consumer-testing organization for its BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA exterior paint. Our Behr products have now held the #1 ranking for interior and exterior paint as well as exterior stains for 4 years running, demonstrating our commitment to customer focused, award-winning, high-quality products. Our investments in paint are paying off, and we intend to continue to reinvest in this segment to drive profitable volume growth along with our partner. 
Turning to Cabinets. The team delivered yet another strong quarter, growing our leadership position at retail and continuing to optimize sales mix by exiting low-margin, direct-to-builder business, as we described on our first quarter earnings call. 
Moving to Windows and Other Specialty Products. Our sales grew by 3%, but we did not meet our operating profit expectations. We're working diligently to address this underperformance and remain confident in our long-term operating margin expectations of 10% to 13% for this segment that we outlined at our Investor Day. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter operating performance. 
Additionally, we continued progress against our key capital allocation initiatives, including: finalizing our debt transactions and paying down $400 million in debt; repurchasing approximately 2.8 million shares, bringing our total shares repurchased to date to 28 million against our 50 million repurchase authorization; and lastly, our Board of Directors announcing its intention to increase our annual dividend by $0.02 per share beginning in the fourth quarter, expressing confidence in our future outlook. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over our operational and financial performance in detail. John?"

As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime charges. 
Our focused execution continued as we delivered strong top and bottom line growth in North America and internationally. The second quarter of 2016 was our 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth. 
Sales increased 4% for the quarter. The impact of foreign currency translation softened in the second quarter and negatively impacted our revenue by approximately $6 million. 
North American sales were up 3% in the quarter. We continued to experience strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as consumers are trading up to our better and best product offerings. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales. 
International sales increased 9% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international Plumbing and window businesses. 
Gross margins expanded 220 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year to 35.2%. And our track record of SG&A improvement continued in the second quarter as SG&A as a percent of sales improved 40 basis points, driven by focused cost control and productivity improvement throughout the organization. 
We delivered very strong bottom line performance as operating profit increased 22% to $342 million with operating margins expanding 260 basis points to 17.1%, our highest second quarter margin in 14 years. 
Our EPS was $0.46 in the quarter, an improvement of $0.08 or 21% compared to the second quarter of 2015. These results include the $40 million of onetime interest payment we noted in last quarter's earnings call to complete the retirement of debt maturities. This negatively impacted our EPS. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment had a terrific second quarter. Segment sales increased 10%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers, spas and rough plumbing products. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $5 million in the quarter. Our North American sales grew 9% in the second quarter. 
We experienced strong demand for our innovative Delta and Brizo brands with both our wholesale and large retail customers as we gained share in the quarter. Our second quarter sales also benefited by approximately $10 million due to load-in sales associated with a recent retail program win. 
Our international Plumbing sales increased 11% in local currency. Hansgrohe continues to outperform as it delivered its highest quarterly sales and operating profit in the company's history, breaking the record they set last quarter. We experienced sales growth around the globe with particular strength in Central and Northern Europe, the Americas and Asia. Additionally, our mix improved as our premium price point Axor brand grew double digits in the quarter. 
Operating profit for this segment increased 39% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume, productivity improvements and a favorable price/commodity relationship, particularly in Europe. This segment also benefited from a positive year-over-year commodity hedge impact of approximately $5 million. 
In the second half of 2016, we anticipate investing approximately $10 million in advertising and displays to support new product launches at both Delta and Brizo. Given this segment's sustained performance improvement but also taking into account further investments to grow the business, we are raising our long-term operating margin expectations for this segment from 16% to 17% to the high teens. 
Turning to Slide 8. In the Decorative Architectural segment, sales matched the second quarter of 2015. We experienced solid performance of our BEHR MARQUEE Interior products and continued strong growth across our Behr Pro business. However, as I mentioned on the first quarter call, this segment faced a difficult comp in Q2 as the second quarter of 2015 was a record sales quarter for Behr. In the second quarter of 2016, the timing and amount of incremental promotional expense for the Memorial Day and July 4th promotional events negatively impacted our revenues. You may recall last year's July 4th event was entirely in Q3, while this year's event straddled Q2 and Q3. Additionally, sales were negatively impacted by an in-store inventory drawdown late in the second quarter of 2016. 
Liberty Hardware had another solid quarter due to continued share gains from successful new product introductions and program wins in the retail channel. We are also pleased that Liberty was recently awarded a final portion of a nationwide shower door program at The Home Depot. We will be refitting the remaining 800-plus stores with this innovative program in the fourth quarter. 
Operating profit increased $6 million in the second quarter principally due to operating leverage on higher volume at Behr and Liberty. While we have experienced solid margins in the first half of the year, we will invest to grow gallons in the second half of 2016. At this time, we expect the amount of this investment to be approximately $30 million, the majority of which will be spent in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are extremely pleased with our Cabinet segment's improved performance in Q2. Segment sales declined 3% due to the deliberate exit of certain lower-margin business within the builder direct channel in the United States and at select low-margin accounts in our U.K. Cabinet business. This decline was partially offset by KraftMaid's strong performance in the retail channel, resulting in double-digit growth and year-over-year share gains. In the dealer channel, we drove single-digit growth through increased volume and a favorable mix as both our Merillat offerings and our dealer-exclusive KraftMaid Vantage program continued to resonate with our dealer base and consumers. Segment profitability in the second quarter improved $22 million or 147% over 2015. 
Our strong second quarter margin of 14.2% was driven by cost-savings initiatives as well as an improved mix as we reduced our exposure to lower-margin builder-direct business and enjoyed continued growth of our higher-price-point, semi-custom KraftMaid offering. For the balance of 2016, we believe the revenue impact of our decision to exit select builder-direct business and our retail kitchen countertop business will negatively impact sales by approximately $15 million in both Q3 and Q4. 
In addition, through the second half of 2016, we will be launching new products under the KraftMaid and Quality brands and anticipate approximately $10 million of expense associated with these new product introductions. 
Finally, given this segment's sustained performance improvement, we are raising the long -- our long-term expectations for operating margins from 8% to 9% to a low to mid-teens. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our windows segment sales increased 3%, driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard's continued growth was driven by a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing. 
Excluding the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 10% as this segment continues to benefit from share gains through the strong performance of our premium-price-point window and door offerings. This segment's operating profit decline was due to ERP expenses at Milgard of approximately $6 million which we previously disclosed, and an adjustment to Milgard's warranty reserve of approximately $10 million. In addition, we experienced approximately $8 million of incremental labor costs and inefficiencies as Milgard continues to grow. Despite this quarter's results, we continue to believe this segment will achieve 10% to 13% operating margins long term. 
Turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, we took additional action to further strengthen our balance sheet and unlock shareholder value. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of balance sheet liquidity. 
As we mentioned last quarter, in March, we issued $900 million of new notes. Then in mid-April, we used the proceeds from these debt issuances, together with cash on hand, to repay in order to retire all of our $1 billion notes due in October 2016 and all of our $300 million notes, which were due in March of 2017. 
To complete the retirement of these 2 debt maturities, we incurred approximately $40 million in a onetime interest payment during the quarter, which increased our interest expense to $87 million for the second quarter. However, the results of these transactions will generate an annual interest expense savings of nearly $45 million. Starting with our third quarter of 2016, our quarterly interest expense will be approximately $44 million. 
With these refinancing transactions, we have delivered on our long-term commitment to strengthen our balance sheet. Due to our strong cash flow and this recent debt retirement, we have greatly enhanced our financial flexibility as our net debt-to-EBITDA now stands at approximately 1.6x. 
From a working capital perspective, we delivered another strong quarter of performance with working capital as a percent of sales improving 70 basis points versus the prior year to 13.3%. 
Finally, as Keith mentioned, we continued our share repurchase activities. And during the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares valued at approximately $88 million. 
So with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

Our results reflect the strength of our powerful brands and our rigorous focus on operational excellence. Due to our continued success in these areas, we are raising our long-term margin expectations for our Plumbing segment to the high teens and for our Cabinet segment to the low to mid-teens. 
The fundamentals driving our business continue to accelerate. Home prices continue to appreciate, which is a driver for larger-ticket items such as cabinets and windows. Housing turnover continues to increase, which is a leading indicator of repair and remodel spend. And as you recall, repair and remodel is 83% of our business. And homes remain affordable, with improving access to credit, as well as lower mortgage rates, stimulating housing and home improvement activity. Consumers continue to gain confidence to reinvest in their homes, and we are well positioned to benefit from those positive trends. 
The strategies that we laid out last year are working. Going forward, we remain committed to: investing behind our brands for growth; developing innovative, award-winning products to ensure we maintain our must-have position with our customers; focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the Masco Operating System; and finally, balancing our capital allocation between investing for growth, acquisitions with the right strategic fit and returns and returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. 
We remain very confident in achieving our 2017 earnings per share target of $1.80 that we set at our Investor Day last year. Our operational execution, coupled with our strengthened balance sheet and strong liquidity position, provides us with multiple levers to continue to drive shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. So I'll throw it back to you, Jonathan."

Although we're very pleased with the performance of this segment this quarter and the progress that we've made, but as we've talked about historically, we'll be investing in this business over the long term to help grow gallons. I think there's a couple or 3 things that may influence the margin pressure down. First is commodities. We have been experiencing some mild commodity cost inflation from a major supplier's titanium dioxide. And as I think everyone is aware, they have announced further price increases for later this year. The second is investments. As we've talked about historically, we are trying to grow this business and grow gallons in conjunction with our channel partner, The Home Depot. And so we're investing heavily to grow our Pro business. In fact, we are investing here in the back half of 2015 (sic) [2016]. Part of the $30 million investment that I outlined in my prepared remarks really goes to growing our hub stores. We have 100 new hub stores where we'll be employing people to help grow our paint business in The Home Depot. And finally, mix. As I think we've mentioned very clearly over the course of the last couple of quarters, our Pro business does not have or come at the same margin profile as our core DIY business. So I think those are the 3 elements that, over time, will drive the margins closer to that high-teens range from where we're at and from where we stand today in the 22% range."

I think home price appreciation has a good -- is a good driver for that. And there has been some deferral in investing in big-ticket items that folks have put into their homes for a number of years, and that's coming off the sideline. As we talk to the various dealer and constituents around our business, we're hearing about good foot traffic and continued good spend. In the Cabinet and window business, which both of those have a very strong component of R&R in that, we are seeing improved mix as well. Now a part of that is driven by productive changes we've made to our assortment and how we're managing the business, but it's also a general uptick in mix in terms of the market. I think your great indicators are lock and spa business. We set another -- as John said, we set another sales record there this quarter. And when you consider the discretionary nature of this product and its high price point, it really reflects on the consumers' appetite to reinvest in their homes. So we're seeing the consumers utilize credit more with larger-ticket purchases such as spas. So I think the consumer is feeling confident. That's a direct reflection on demand in R&R and then, of course, home price appreciation and new housing turnover, all of which are continuing to grow, which continue to feed that. With regards to your second question, Eric, around the incremental payback on the Pro initiative, it's an outstanding payback for us. I mean it's very profitable. While it doesn't have necessarily the margin of our core DIY business, it has outstanding returns for us. And I think importantly, the fact that we are so intertwined strategically with Home Depot, that this is a very positive revenue source for us for quite a while.

Our capital expense, our CapEx, is a relatively light touch. We've been averaging around 2%, just under 2% of sales the last several years. A little bit more than that this year as we complete a couple of investments that we're making. But after this year, we do expect that to migrate that back down to kind of that 2% of sales range. So don't feel like there's significant investment to be poured back into the business as we continue to grow. So that should really enhance our free cash flow in the next several years."

Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased with our performance in third quarter of 2016. We continue to successfully execute our strategic initiatives to grow both our top and bottom lines as evidenced by the fact that this quarter is our 20th consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth. 
Our end markets, both in North America and internationally, remain strong, and we continue to leverage this underlying market strength by introducing new products, improving our sales mix, penetrating new markets and gaining share with our industry-leading brands. 
For the third quarter, our top line increased by 2%, 3% in local currency. Our adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 14.7%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage and a favorable price commodity environment. 
Our adjusted earnings per share grew 21% to $0.41 per share. Notably, this adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share includes the negative impact of a $21 million increase to our warranty reserve in our Windows and Other Specialty Products segment. John will provide you with more details about this charge in his commentary. 
Turning to our segments. I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segment's performance. Our Plumbing business continued their outstanding performance by growing revenues 6% in local currency, led again by the continued strength of our Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins businesses.
In early October, Delta was once again honored by the Environmental Protection Agency, earning the EPA Water Sense Sustained Excellence Award for 2016. This is the second consecutive year Delta has won this award, an award which recognizes Delta's efforts to promote water efficiency through its innovative, water-efficient products such as Touch20 faucets and H2O kinetic [ph] showerheads. Delta was also honored as the best overall vendor in e-commerce and is the best overall plumbing vendor in the show room and builder segment by Ferguson Enterprises, our nation's largest plumbing wholesaler. Congratulations to the entire Delta team for its ability to bring innovative, environmentally friendly products to market and for its ability to successfully focus, understand and deliver the needs of its customers.
Moving on to our Decorative Architectural segment. We once again delivered a solid quarter. Our Pro Paint initiative with The Home Depot continued to drive double-digit sales growth in the quarter. And BEHR MARQUEE, our highest price point DIY product, continued to post exceptional year-over-year comps. During the quarter, to further accelerate our Pro business, we began staffing an additional 100 Pro hub stores. This will bring our total store count to over 200 by year-end. We're excited by the results of the initial hub store investment, and we believe that these additional hub stores will provide us, along with our partner, The Home Depot, with the exceptional foundation to continue penetrating the Pro paint market. 
In our Cabinet business, we continue to execute against our plan to optimize our sales mix by exiting certain low-margin direct-to-builder business. Our retail Cabinet business was particularly strong this quarter as we partnered with our customers to offer highly effective, exclusive promotions for KraftMaid, the most recognized brand in the industry.
Our brand recognition, coupled with these promotions, drove foot traffic into their stores and demand for our products. Additionally, based on the success of our KraftMaid momentum product at Lowe's, we're expanding the product offering to an additional 250 stores, taking the total store count to 500 stores across the United States.
KraftMaid momentum is a product line that extends the KraftMaid brand into the value semi-custom price point. This further rollout is a testament to our focus on the customer, our product development capability and our efforts to gain greater share of wallet at retail. 
Our Cabinetry team also completed significant product launches for both the KraftMaid and Quality brands during the quarter. These launches included trend-forward finishes to capitalize on the growing demand for great paints, new door styles, decorative accessories and functional SKUs.
Moving to Windows and Other Specialty Products. Our sales grew by 2%, excluding the effect of foreign currency. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to work through some operational issues in our Milgard window business unit related to labor turnover and other inefficiencies. The organization and I are keenly focused on fixing these issues. We've reorganized Milgard's management team, brought in top operational resources from across the company and together with the Milgard team, are actively working through these issues. It's going to take some time, but I'm confident that we have the appropriate focus and urgency. While we currently have some challenges in our window segment, overall, I'm pleased with our third quarter performance and the continued execution of our long-term strategies.
Our Plumbing businesses continue to produce outstanding top and bottom line results. Our Pro paint initiative continues to post double-digit growth as we further penetrate this market segment and gain share. And our Cabinet business has improved its year-to-date profitability by approximately $50 million through cost reductions, improved mix and strong growth in the retail and dealer channels. Our results are indicative of the solid execution of our strategies. 
Additionally, we took further action in the quarter to create shareholder value through our capital allocation strategies. We repurchased 2.3 million shares, bringing our total shares repurchased to 31 million against our 50 million share repurchase authorization, and we increased our annual dividend by $0.02 per share to $0.40 annually. This is the third year in a row that we have increased our dividend. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over operational and financial performance in detail. John?"

As Keith mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization and another onetime charges. Our focused execution continued as we delivered top and bottom line growth in North America and internationally. As Keith mentioned, the third quarter of 2016 was our 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth.
Sales increased 2% for the quarter and 3% in local currencies. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the quarter by approximately $17 million, principally due to a weaker pound compared to the U.S. dollar. North American sales were up 2% in the quarter.
We continue to experience strong demand for repair and remodel products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum. Consumers are trading up to our better and best product offering. As a reminder, repair and remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales. 
International sales increased 6% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international plumbing and window businesses. Gross margins expanded approximately 100 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year to 32.9%. This includes the negative effect of Milgard's warranty adjustment.
Our SG&A as a percentage of sales increased this quarter by 40 basis points due to the strategic investment in several of our businesses in order to drive top and bottom line growth. Our teams continued to be focused on cost control and productivity improvement.
We delivered strong bottom line performance once again as operating income increased 7% to $275 million with operating margins expanding 70 basis points to 14.7%.
Our EPS in the quarter was $0.41, an improvement of $0.07 or 21% compared to the third quarter of last year. EPS was unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the increase in Milgard's warranty reserve.
Turning to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment delivered another strong quarter of growth, driven by a terrific performance by Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins. Segment sales increased 6%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers and spas. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $9 million in the quarter.
Our North American sales grew 6% in the third quarter as we experienced strong, consumer-driven demand for our innovative brands at both our wholesale and large retail customers. Our spa business is outperforming the competition as Watkins continues to leverage its strong dealer network, innovative new products and industry-leading brands. Our international plumbing sales increased 7% in local currency. We experienced sales growth around the globe with particular strength in Asia and Northern Europe. Additionally, our sales mix continues to improve with our premium price point Axor brand grew double digits this quarter.
Operating profit for this segment increased 30% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume and a favorable price commodity relationship. This segment also benefited from a positive year-over-year commodity hedge impact of approximately $10 million. This benefit was partially offset by approximately a $5 million of incremental advertising and display expense in support of new product introductions as we previously discussed in our second quarter earnings call.
Turning to Slide 8. The Decorative Architectural segment grew 2% as we continue to experience strong growth across our Behr Pro business and solid performance of our BEHR MARQUEE interior products. This growth was partially offset by the timing and amount of incremental promotional expense that we had previously discussed on our second quarter earnings call.
Liberty Hardware also contributed to the top and bottom line growth.
Operating profit increased 9% in the third quarter, principally due to operating leverage and a higher volume. As we mentioned in the second quarter call, we intend to invest $30 million in promotion and advertising in the second half of 2016 to grow this business. The third quarter we incurred approximately $10 million of this promotion and advertising expense. We expect to incur an additional $15 million to $20 million of investment in the fourth quarter, which includes $5 million of reset cost for Liberty shower door program win at The Home Depot.
Turning to Slide 9. We continue to be pleased with our Cabinet segment performance. Segment sales declined 6% due to the deliberate exit of certain lower-margin business within the builder-to-direct channel in the United States and select low-margin accounts in the U.K. Cabinet business. These actions, in aggregate, reduced segment sales by approximately $25 million. This decline was partially offset by KraftMaid's strong performance in the retail channel, resulting in double-digit growth and year-over-year share gains. In the dealer channel, we drove single-digit growth through increased volume and a favorable mix at both our KraftMaid and Merillat offerings continue to resonate with dealer base and consumers.
Segment profitability in the third quarter improved 5% over 2015, driven by our continued execution of cost savings initiatives as well as improved mix as we reduced our exposure to lower-margin builder to direct business continue to grow our higher price point semi-custom KraftMaid offering.
As we mentioned on the second quarter call, this growth is partially offset by approximately $5 million of incremental spend, which include expenses associated with new product launches in the retail and dealer channels under the KraftMaid and Quality brands.
We expect to incur an additional $5 million of product launch cost in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to report these new products are driving strong foot traffic at our dealer customers and favorable end consumer reactions.
For the fourth quarter, we continue to believe the revenue impact of our decision to exit select builder direct business and our kitchen countertop business will negatively impact sales by between $15 million and $20 million. This impact will continue through the first quarter of 2017.
Turning to Slide 10. Our window segment sales increased 2% in local currency, driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard's continued growth was driven by a positive mix shift to premium window indoor product line and favorable pricing. Excluding the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 2%, driven by volume and share gains. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $8 million in the quarter.
This segment's operating profit decline was primarily due to the additional warranty reserve of approximately $21 million at our Milgard business, $6 million of incremental labor cost and inefficiencies in ERP expenses of approximately $3 million.
Let's go into margin detail on the warranty adjustment and ERP expenses. You may recall, Milgard recorded a $10 million warranty adjustment in the second quarter. During Q2, we initiated an analysis based on enhanced historical warranty claims data that became available in the quarter. And in accordance with GAAP, booked the $10 million adjustment. In the third quarter, we completed our analysis, and we recorded an additional $21 million adjustment, which was reviewed by multiple third parties.
Moving to ERP. As we had previously disclosed, we anticipated approximately $3 million of expenses per quarter related to ERP into 2017. We have recently made a decision to deliberately slow down the rollout of ERP so that we can implement a system during seasonally slower periods. This decision will take the implementation through 2019. We are doing this to protect the customer and minimize disruption to the business.
And turning to Slide 11. We ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion of balance sheet liquidity. We delivered another strong quarter of working capital performance. Working capital as a percent of sales improved 20 basis points versus the prior year to 12.9%. 
As we approach the end of 2016, we are on track to generate close to $500 million of free cash flow again this year. We also continued our initiatives to create shareholder value. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares valued at approximately $78 million. Finally, we increased our annual dividend by $0.02 per share to $0.40 per common share. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

We used those learnings and experience, and our plan is now to methodically rollout our systems across all the other plans but to do it in a way that avoids the peak periods, which is really Q2 and Q3. So we've eliminated those quarters from our implementation plan, and we're only going to be implementing ERP systems in the slow periods that protects our customer, it's right thing to do. And thirdly, due to combination of strong demand for our products, particular around paint and vinyl and fiberglass, coupled with a tight labor market in the Northwest that we have, we're dealing with some labor efficiencies. We've mobilized our best talent and operational teams. We have the Senior Vice President of Operations from Delta Faucet working with the Milgard team. We have the Masco Operating System group working with the team, and together I'm pleased with the initial success that we have. So we're turning it around.

With respect to the margins, again, I hope you guys recall we said in our second quarter call that the margins we posted there are unusually high because we really had a very clean quarter with no unusual expenses or some typical investments that we may have in advertising catalogs and displays and things like that. So it was a very light quarter for all that activity in the second quarter. So that was more the anomaly. So the way I look at it, Keith, is that if you factor out the $5 million of expense and with the $25 million of business that we walk away from while it was indeed low margin, it wasn't at [ph] 0 margin. And so there were some loss of profit on the business that we did but walk away from.

Home prices continued to appreciate, household formations that is increase and the demographics of the millennial as they go on an average age from say 25 to 29 or 30, that's going to bode well for new household formations. Existing home sales rebounded nicely. They're up to, I think, close to $5.5 million. And the affordability is favorable. So we're not only seeing good fundamental and foot traffic, but we're continuing to see good moves in terms of our mix. So our higher price point products, like our high-end Delta, our Brizo brand, our Axor brand, our spa business, things like that and our Cabinet business which is big ticket item which is good positive mix, but we're seeing good growth down in our entry-level products, which dampens down mix benefit a bit admittedly.

I think that's a balancing act we have to call on a regular basis depending on how we see the markets develop. And then periodically, we will continue to reevaluate our dividends. As both Keith and I talked about the call we increased the dividend for the third year in a row here in the fourth quarter."

I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter of 2016. We continue to successfully execute our strategic initiatives to grow both our top and bottom lines as evidenced by the fact that this quarter is our 20th consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth. 
Our end markets, both in North America and internationally, remain strong, and we continue to leverage this underlying market strength by introducing new products, improving our sales mix, penetrating new markets and gaining share with our industry-leading brands. 
For the third quarter, our top line increased by 2%, 3% in local currency. Our adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 14.7%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage and a favorable price commodity environment. 
Our adjusted earnings per share grew 21% to $0.41 per share. Notably, this adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share includes the negative impact of a $21 million increase to our warranty reserve in our Windows and Other Specialty Products segment. John will provide you with more details about this charge in his commentary. 
Turning to our segments. I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segment's performance. Our Plumbing businesses continued their outstanding performance by growing revenue 6% in local currency, led again by the continued strength of our Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins businesses.
In early October, Delta was once again honored by the Environmental Protection Agency, earning the EPA Water Sense Sustained Excellence Award for 2016. This is the second consecutive year Delta has won this award, an award which recognizes Delta's efforts to promote water efficiency through its innovative, water-efficient products such as Touch20 faucets and H2Okinetic showerheads. Delta was also honored as the best overall vendor in e-commerce and is the best overall plumbing vendor in the show room and builder segment by Ferguson Enterprises, our nation's largest plumbing wholesaler. Congratulations to the entire Delta team for its ability to bring innovative, environmentally friendly products to market and for its ability to successfully focus, understand and deliver on the needs of its customers.
Moving on to our Decorative Architectural segment. We once again delivered a solid quarter. Our Pro Paint initiative with The Home Depot continued to drive double-digit sales growth in the quarter. And BEHR MARQUEE, our highest price point DIY product, continued to post exceptional year-over-year comps. During the quarter, to further accelerate our Pro business, we began staffing an additional 100 Pro hub stores. This will bring our total store count to over 200 by year-end. We're excited by the results of the initial hub store investment, and we believe that these additional hub stores will provide us, along with our partner, The Home Depot, with an exceptional foundation to continue penetrating the Pro paint market. 
In our Cabinets business, we continue to execute against our plan to optimize our sales mix by exiting certain low-margin direct-to-builder business. Our retail Cabinet business was particularly strong this quarter as we partnered with our customers to offer highly effective, exclusive promotions for KraftMaid, most recognized brand in the industry.
Our brand recognition, coupled with these promotions, drove foot traffic into their stores and demand for our products. Additionally, based on the success of our KraftMaid momentum product at Lowe's, we're expanding the product offering to an additional 250 stores, taking the total store count to 500 stores across the United States.
KraftMaid momentum is a product line that extends the KraftMaid brand into the value semi-custom price point. This further rollout is a testament to our focus on the customer, our product development capability and our efforts to gain greater share of wallet at retail. 
Our Cabinetry team also completed significant product launches for both the KraftMaid and Quality brands during the quarter. These launches included trend-forward finishes to capitalize on the growing demand for great paints, new door styles, decorative accessories and functional SKUs.
Moving to Windows and Other Specialty Products. Our sales grew by 2%, excluding the effect of foreign currency. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to work through some operational issues in our Milgard window business unit related to labor turnover and other inefficiencies. The organization and I are keenly focused on fixing these issues. We've reorganized Milgard's management team, brought in top operational resources from across the company and together with the Milgard team, are actively working through these issues. It's going to take some time, but I'm confident that we have the appropriate focus and urgency. While we currently have some challenges in our window segment, overall, I'm pleased with our third quarter performance and the continued execution of our long-term strategies.
Our Plumbing businesses continue to produce outstanding top and bottom line results. Our Pro paint initiative continues to post double-digit growth as we further penetrate this market segment and gain share. And our Cabinet business has improved its year-to-date profitability by approximately $50 million through cost reductions, improved mix and strong growth in the retail and dealer channels. Our results are indicative of the solid execution of our strategies. 
Additionally, we took further action in the quarter to create shareholder value through our capital allocation strategy. We repurchased 2.3 million shares, bringing our total shares repurchased to 31 million against our 50 million share repurchase authorization, and we increased our annual dividend by $0.02 per share to $0.40 annually. This is the third year in a row that we have increased our dividend. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over operational and financial performance in detail. John?"

As Keith mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization and another onetime charges. Our focused execution continued as we delivered top and bottom line growth in North America and internationally. As Keith mentioned, the third quarter of 2016 was our 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth.
Sales increased 2% for the quarter and 3% in local currencies. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the quarter by approximately $17 million, principally due to a weaker pound compared to the U.S. dollar.
North American sales were up 2% in the quarter.
We continued to experience strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as consumers are trading up to our better and best product offering. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales.
International sales increased 6% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international plumbing and window businesses.
Gross margins expanded approximately 100 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year to 32.9%. This includes the negative effect of Milgard's warranty adjustment.
Our SG&A as a percentage of sales increased this quarter by 40 basis points due to the strategic investment in several of our businesses in order to drive top and bottom line growth. Our teams continued to be focused on cost control and productivity improvement.
We delivered strong bottom line performance once again as operating income increased 7% to $275 million with operating margins expanding 70 basis points to 14.7%.
Our EPS in the quarter was $0.41, an improvement of $0.07 or 21% compared to the third quarter of last year. EPS was unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the increase in Milgard's warranty reserve.
Turning to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment delivered another strong quarter of growth, driven by  terrific performance by Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins. Segment sales increased 6%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers and spas. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $9 million in the quarter.
Our North American sales grew 6% in the third quarter as we experienced strong, consumer-driven demand for our innovative brands at both our wholesale and large retail customers. Our spa business is outperforming the competition as Watkins continues to leverage its strong dealer network, innovative new products and industry-leading brands. Our international plumbing sales increased 7% in local currency. We experienced sales growth around the globe with particular strength in Asia and Northern Europe. Additionally, our sales mix continues to improve with our premium price point Axor brand grew double digits this quarter.
Operating profit for this segment increased 30% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume and a favorable price commodity relationship. This segment also benefited from a positive year-over-year commodity hedge impact of approximately $10 million. This benefit was partially offset by approximately a $5 million of incremental advertising and display expense in support of new product introductions as we previously discussed in our second quarter earnings call.
Turning to Slide 8. The Decorative Architectural segment grew 2% as we continue to experience strong growth across our Behr Pro business and solid performance of our BEHR MARQUEE interior products. This growth was partially offset by the timing and amount of incremental promotional expense that we had previously discussed on our second quarter earnings call.
Liberty Hardware also contributed to the top and bottom line growth.
Operating profit increased 9% in the third quarter, principally due to operating leverage on higher volume. As we mentioned in the second quarter call, we intend to invest $30 million in promotion and advertising in the second half of 2016 to grow this business. In the third quarter, we incurred approximately $10 million of just promotion and advertising expense. And we expect to incur an additional $15 million to $20 million of investment in the fourth quarter, which includes $5 million of reset cost for Liberty Shower Door program win at The Home Depot.
Turning to Slide 9. We continue to be pleased with our Cabinet segment performance. Segment sales declined 6% due to the deliberate exit of certain lower-margin business within the builder-direct channel in the United States and at select low-margin accounts in the U.K. Cabinet business. These actions, in aggregate, reduced segment sales by approximately $25 million. This decline was partially offset by KraftMaid's strong performance in the retail channel, resulting in double-digit growth and year-over-year share gains. In the dealer channel, we drove single-digit growth through increased volume and a favorable mix as both our KraftMaid and Merillat offerings continued to resonate with dealer base and consumers.
Segment profitability in the third quarter improved 5% over 2015, driven by our continued execution of cost savings initiatives as well as improved mix as we reduced our exposure to lower-margin builder-direct business, continue to grow our higher-price-point, semi-custom KraftMaid offering.
As we mentioned on the second quarter call, this growth is partially offset by approximately $5 million of incremental spend, which included expenses associated with our new product launches in the retail and dealer channels under the KraftMaid and Quality brands.
We expect to incur an additional $5 million of product launch cost in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to report these new products are driving strong foot traffic at our dealer customers and favorable end consumer reactions.
For the fourth quarter, we continue to believe the revenue impact of our decision to exit select-builder direct business and our kitchen countertop business will negatively impact sales by between $15 million and $20 million. This impact will continue through the first quarter of 2017.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Windows segment sales increased 2% in local currency, driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard's continued growth was driven by a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product line and favorable pricing. Excluding the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 2%, driven by volume and share gains. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $8 million in the quarter.
This segment's operating profit decline was primarily due to the additional warranty reserve of approximately $21 million at our Milgard business, $6 million of incremental labor cost and inefficiencies in ERP expenses of approximately $3 million.
Let's go into margin detail on the warranty adjustment and ERP expenses. You may recall, Milgard recorded a $10 million warranty adjustment in the second quarter. During Q2, we initiated an analysis based on enhanced historical warranty claims data that became available in the quarter. And in accordance with GAAP, booked a $10 million adjustment. In the third quarter, we completed our analysis, and we recorded an additional $21 million adjustment, which was reviewed by multiple third parties.
Moving to ERP. As we had previously disclosed, we anticipated approximately $3 million of expenses per quarter related to ERP into 2017. We have recently made the decision to deliberately slow down the rollout of ERP so that we can implement a system during seasonally slower periods. This decision will take the implementation through 2019. We are doing this to protect the customer and minimize disruption to the business.
And turning to Slide 11. We ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion of balance sheet liquidity. We delivered another strong quarter of working capital performance. Working capital as a percent of sales improved 20 basis points versus the prior year to 12.9%.
As we approach the end of 2016, we are on track to generate close to $500 million of free cash flow again this year. We also continued our initiatives to create shareholder value. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares valued at approximately $78 million. Finally, we increased our annual dividend by $0.02 per share to $0.40 per common share.
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

We used those learnings and experience, and our plan is now to methodically rollout our systems across all the other plans but to do it in a way that avoids the peak periods, which is really Q2 and Q3. So we've eliminated those quarters from our implementation plan, and we're only going to be implementing ERP systems in the slow periods that protects our customer, it's a right thing to do. And thirdly, due to the combination of strong demand for our products, particularly around paint and vinyl and fiberglass, coupled with a tight labor market in the Northwest that we have, we're dealing with some labor efficiencies. We've mobilized our best talent and operational teams. We have the Senior Vice President of Operations from Delta Faucet working with the Milgard team. We have the Masco Operating System group working with the team, and together, I'm pleased with the initial success that we have. So we're turning it around. So those are 3 distinct issues that we're doing with. In terms, Susan, of your specific question going forward, I think our guidance that we talked about in terms of long-term growth is going to be a little dampened due to some of the short-term issues that we're facing.

So it was a very light quarter for all the type of activity in the second quarter. So that was more of the anomaly. So the way I look at it, Keith, is that if you factor out the $5 million of expense and with the $25 million of business that we walk away from a while, it was indeed low margin, it wasn't 0 margin. And so there were some loss of profit on the business that we did but walk away from.

Home prices continue to appreciate, household formations continue to increase and the demographics of the millennials as they go on an average age from, say, 25 to 29 or 30, that's going to bode well for new household formations. Existing home sales rebounded nicely. They're up to, I think, close to $5.5 million, and the affordability is still very favorable. So we're not only seeing good fundamentals and good traffic, but we're continuing to see good moves in terms of our mix. So our higher price point products, like our high-end Delta, our Brizo brand, our Axor brand, our spa business, things like that and our Cabinet business, which is a big ticket item. So we're seeing good positive mix, but we're also seeing good growth down in our entry-level products, which dampens down the mix benefit a bit admittedly.

So that growth hasn't been as fast as we'd like it to see, as we'd like it be, but it's improving. And this new product launch is going to help. And of course Merillat, we're continuing to drive growth to those dealers. So in terms of your overall question with regards to the plan for this business, it's to drive growth. Now I talked couple calls ago about pivoting more towards the forecast of growth, and we're doing that and we're seeing some good results.

Just in general, Bob, good foot traffic and smiles on their faces, not only for our new launches, but also, in general, how the business was going. I was at a meeting with 15 or 20 CEOs of building builders -- big builders, and they were all robust about how the overall builder market was going. So I wouldn't say any more robust about the macros than I've been in the past.

Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter of 2016.

I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter of 2016. We continue to successfully execute our strategic initiatives to grow both our top and bottom lines, as evidenced by the fact that this quarter is our 20th consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth. 
Our end markets, both in North America and internationally, remain strong, and we continue to leverage this underlying market strength by introducing new products, improving our sales mix, penetrating new markets and gaining share with our industry-leading brands. 
For the third quarter, our top line increased by 2%, 3% in local currency. Our adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 14.7%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage and a favorable price commodity environment. 
Our adjusted earnings per share grew 21% to $0.41 per share. Notably, this adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share includes the negative impact of a $21 million increase to our warranty reserve in our Windows and Other Specialty Products segment. John will provide you with more details about this charge in his commentary. 
Turning to our segments. I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments' performance. Our Plumbing businesses continued their outstanding performance by growing revenue 6% in local currency, led again by the continued strength of our Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins businesses.
In early October, Delta was once again honored by the Environmental Protection Agency, earning the EPA Water Sense Sustained Excellence Award for 2016. This is the second consecutive year Delta has won this award, an award which recognizes Delta's efforts to promote water efficiency through its innovative, water-efficient products such as Touch20 faucets and H2Okinetic showerheads. Delta was also honored as the best overall vendor in e-commerce and as the best overall plumbing vendor in the showroom and builder segment by Ferguson Enterprises, our nation's largest plumbing wholesaler. Congratulations to the entire Delta team for its ability to bring innovative, environmentally friendly products to the market and for its ability to successfully focus, understand and deliver on the needs of its customers.
Moving on to our Decorative Architectural segment. We once again delivered a solid quarter. Our Pro Paint initiative with The Home Depot continued to drive double-digit sales growth in the quarter. And BEHR MARQUEE, our highest price point DIY product, continued to post exceptional year-over-year comps. During the quarter, to further accelerate our Pro business, we began staffing an additional 100 Pro hub stores. This will bring our total store count to over 200 by year-end. We're excited by the results of the initial hub store investment, and we believe that these additional hub stores will provide us, along with our partner, The Home Depot, with an exceptional foundation to continue penetrating the Pro paint market. 
In our Cabinets business, we continue to execute against our plan to optimize our sales mix by exiting certain low-margin direct-to-builder business. Our retail Cabinet business was particularly strong this quarter as we partnered with our customers to offer highly effective, exclusive promotions for KraftMaid, the most recognized brand in the industry.
Our brand recognition, coupled with these promotions, drove foot traffic into their stores and demand for our products. Additionally, based on the success of our KraftMaid momentum product at Lowe's, we're expanding the product offering to an additional 250 stores, taking the total store count to 500 stores across the United States.
KraftMaid momentum is a product line that extends the KraftMaid brand into the value semi-custom price point. This further rollout is a testament to our focus on the customer, our product development capability and our efforts to gain greater share of wallet at retail. 
Our Cabinetry team also completed significant product launches for both the KraftMaid and Quality brands during the quarter. These launches included trend-forward finishes to capitalize on the growing demand for great paints, new door styles, decorative accessories and functional SKUs.
Moving to Windows and Other Specialty Products. Our sales grew by 2%, excluding the effect of foreign currency. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to work through some operational issues in our Milgard window business unit related to labor turnover and other inefficiencies. The organization and I are keenly focused on fixing these issues. We've reorganized Milgard's management team, brought in top operational resources from across the company and together with the Milgard team, are actively working through these issues. It's going to take some time, but I'm confident that we have the appropriate focus and urgency. While we currently have some challenges in our window segment, overall, I'm pleased with our third quarter performance and the continued execution of our long-term strategies.
Our Plumbing businesses continue to produce outstanding top and bottom line results. Our Pro paint initiative continues to post double-digit growth as we further penetrate this market segment and gain share. And our Cabinet business has improved its year-to-date profitability by approximately $50 million through cost reductions, improved mix and strong growth in the retail and dealer channels. Our results are indicative of the solid execution of our strategies. 
Additionally, we took further action in the quarter to create shareholder value through our capital allocation strategy. We repurchased 2.3 million shares, bringing our total shares repurchased to 31 million against our 50 million share repurchase authorization, and we increased our annual dividend by $0.02 per share to $0.40 annually. This is the third year in a row that we have increased our dividend. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over operational and financial performance in detail. John?"

As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and another onetime charges. Our focused execution continued as we delivered top and bottom line growth in North America and internationally. As Keith mentioned, the third quarter of 2016 was our 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth.
Sales increased 2% for the quarter and 3% in local currencies. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the quarter by approximately $17 million, principally due to a weaker pound compared to the U.S. dollar.
North American sales were up 2% in the quarter.
We continued to experience strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as consumers are trading up to our better and best product offering. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales.
International sales increased 6% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international plumbing and window businesses.
Gross margins expanded approximately 100 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year to 32.9%. This includes the negative effect of Milgard's warranty adjustment.
Our SG&A as a percentage of sales increased this quarter by 40 basis points due to the strategic investment in several of our businesses in order to drive top and bottom line growth. Our teams continued to be focused on cost control and productivity improvement.
We delivered strong bottom line performance once again as operating income increased 7% to $275 million with operating margins expanding 70 basis points to 14.7%.
Our EPS in the quarter was $0.41, an improvement of $0.07 or 21% compared to the third quarter of last year. EPS was unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the increase in Milgard's warranty reserve.
Turning to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment delivered another strong quarter of growth, driven by  terrific performance at Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins. Segment sales increased 6%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers and spas. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $9 million in the quarter.
Our North American sales grew 6% in the third quarter as we experienced strong, consumer-driven demand for our innovative brands at both our wholesale and large retail customers. Our spa business is outperforming the competition as Watkins continues to leverage its strong dealer network, innovative new products and industry-leading brands. Our international plumbing sales increased 7% in local currency. We experienced sales growth around the globe with particular strength in Asia and Northern Europe. Additionally, our sales mix continues to improve, as our premium price point Axor brand grew double digits this quarter.
Operating profit for this segment increased 30% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume and a favorable price commodity relationship. This segment also benefited from a positive year-over-year commodity hedge impact of approximately $10 million. This benefit was partially offset by approximately a $5 million of incremental advertising and display expense in support of new product introductions as we previously discussed in our second quarter earnings call.
Turning to Slide 8. The Decorative Architectural segment grew 2% as we continue to experience strong growth across our Behr Pro business and solid performance of our BEHR MARQUEE interior products. This growth was partially offset by the timing and amount of incremental promotional expense that we had previously discussed on our second quarter earnings call.
Liberty Hardware also contributed to the top and bottom line growth.
Operating profit increased 9% in the third quarter, principally due to operating leverage on higher volume. As we mentioned in the second quarter call, we intend to invest $30 million in promotion and advertising in the second half of 2016 to grow this business. In the third quarter, we incurred approximately $10 million of this promotion and advertising expense. And we expect to incur an additional $15 million to $20 million of investment in the fourth quarter, which includes $5 million of reset cost for the Liberty Shower Door program win at The Home Depot.
Turning to Slide 9. We continue to be pleased with our Cabinet segment performance. Segment sales declined 6% due to the deliberate exit of certain lower-margin business within the builder-direct channel in the United States and at select low-margin accounts in our U.K. Cabinet business. These actions, in aggregate, reduced segment sales by approximately $25 million. This decline was partially offset by KraftMaid's strong performance in the retail channel, resulting in double-digit growth and year-over-year share gains. In the dealer channel, we drove single-digit growth through increased volume and a favorable mix as both our KraftMaid and Merillat offerings continued to resonate with dealer base and consumers.
Segment profitability in the third quarter improved 5% over 2015, driven by our continued execution of cost savings initiatives as well as improved mix as we reduced our exposure to lower-margin builder-direct business and continued to grow our higher-price-point, semi-custom KraftMaid offering.
As we mentioned on the second quarter call, this growth is partially offset by approximately $5 million of incremental spend, which included expenses associated with our new product launches in the retail and dealer channels under the KraftMaid and Quality brands.
We expect to incur an additional $5 million of product launch cost in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to report these new products are driving strong foot traffic at our dealer customers and favorable end consumer reactions.
For the fourth quarter, we continue to believe the revenue impact of our decision to exit select-builder direct business and our kitchen countertop business will negatively impact sales by between $15 million and $20 million. This impact will continue through the first quarter of 2017.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Windows segment sales increased 2% in local currency, driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard's continued growth was driven by a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing. Excluding the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 2%, driven by volume and share gains. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $8 million in the quarter.
This segment's operating profit decline was primarily due to the additional warranty reserve of approximately $21 million at our Milgard business, $6 million of incremental labor cost and inefficiencies in ERP expenses of approximately $3 million.
Let's go into more detail on the warranty adjustment and ERP expenses. You may recall, Milgard recorded a $10 million warranty adjustment in the second quarter. During Q2, we initiated an analysis based on enhanced historical warranty claims data that became available in the quarter and, in accordance with GAAP, booked a $10 million adjustment. In the third quarter, we completed our analysis, and we recorded an additional $21 million adjustment, which was reviewed by multiple third parties.
Moving to ERP. As we had previously disclosed, we anticipated approximately $3 million of expenses per quarter related to ERP into 2017. We have recently made the decision to deliberately slow down the rollout of ERP so that we can implement a system during seasonally slower periods. This decision will take the implementation through 2019. We are doing this to protect the customer and minimize disruption to the business.
And turning to Slide 11. We ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion of balance sheet liquidity. We delivered another strong quarter of working capital performance. Working capital as a percent of sales improved 20 basis points versus the prior year to 12.9%.
As we approach the end of 2016, we are on track to generate close to $500 million of free cash flow again this year. We also continued our initiatives to create shareholder value. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares valued at approximately $78 million. Finally, we increased our annual dividend by $0.02 per share to $0.40 per common share.
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

We put that analysis -- we completed the analysis, that's behind us. Second, as you know, we are implementing an ERP system. We completed the first plan successfully. We used those learnings and experience, and our plan is now to methodically roll out our systems across all the other plans but to do it in a way that avoids the peak periods, which is really Q2 and Q3. So we've eliminated those quarters from our implementation plan, and we're only going to be implementing ERP systems in the slow periods; that protects our customer, it's the right thing to do. And thirdly, due to the combination of strong demand for our products, particularly around paint and vinyl and fiberglass, coupled with a tight labor market in the Northwest that we have, we're dealing with some labor efficiencies. We've mobilized our best talent and operational teams. We have the Senior Vice President of Operations from Delta Faucet working with the Milgard team. We have the Masco Operating System group working with the team, and together, I'm pleased with the initial success that we have. So we're turning it around. So those are 3 distinct issues that we're doing with. In terms, Susan, of your specific question going forward, I think our guidance that we talked about in terms of long-term growth is going to be a little dampened due to some of the short-term issues that we're facing. When you think about the long-term margins of this business, we haven't changed our point of view on that, and we're seeing that right in that 10% to 13% range. So long term, nothing has changed.

You may recall that we started this in the third quarter of last year, but you may also recall that in the first quarter conference call, we announced that we had chosen to exit our kitchen countertop business as well as some other business on the eastern seaboard. And so as a result that has elevated some of the exits that we've seen over the course of the last couple quarters.

We've launched in both the KraftMaid as well as Quality, so really kind of both ends of the price spectrum for us. KraftMaid being our premium price point offering and Quality being our low price point or opening price point offering. So -- that's it. With respect to the margins, again, I hope you guys recall earlier in the call -- recall the fact that we said on our second quarter call that the margins that we posted there were unusually high because we really had a very clean quarter with no unusual expenses or some typical investments that we may have in advertising catalogs and displays, things like that. So it was a very light quarter for all the type of activity in the second quarter. So that was more of the anomaly. So the way I look at it, Keith, is that if you factor out the $5 million of expense and with the $25 million of business that we walked away from, while it was indeed low margin, it wasn't 0 margin. And so there were some loss of profit on the business that we did walk away from. So net-net as you look into that -- as I look at it, it looks like, to me about a 10% quarter to me for the Cabinet segment."

So yes, there was a little bit of choppiness here but fundamentally, the demand drivers and the foot traffic that we're seeing, particularly in repair and remodeling, which is over 80% of our business, are strong. Home prices continue to appreciate, household formations continue to increase and the demographics of the millennials as they go on an average age from, say, 25 to 29 or 30, that's going to bode well for new household formations. Existing home sales rebounded nicely. They're up to, I think, close to $5.5 million, and the affordability is still very favorable. So we're not only seeing good fundamentals and good traffic, but we're continuing to see good moves in terms of our mix. So our higher price point products, like our high-end Delta, our Brizo brand, our Axor brand, our spa business, things like that and our Cabinet business, which is a big ticket item. So we're seeing good positive mix, but we're also seeing good growth down in our entry-level products, which dampens down the mix benefit a bit admittedly. But I think -- fundamentally, it's a good sign for the nature of the recovery when you're seeing that kind of growth, both in the, call it the household formation stage and the opening price point as well as the mix up in the higher mix.

It looks like the total exit from our builder-direct business, Stephen, will be in the order of magnitude about $75 million here in 2016. Sorry about that. Yes, in regards to commodities and paint, we have seen a little bit -- very modest inflation in titanium dioxide. We are starting to see a little bit of inflation, which we think might be temporary in some of the input costs that into the engineered resins. We'll see how that plays out over the course of the next several months. So overall, relatively modest commodity headwinds here so far in the first part of 2016."

And so we've seen deflation in copper over the course of last year and so that increased the favorability and the hedge vis-à-vis last year. Alternatively, we've seen some inflation in zinc over the same period. So that's how it all plays through. Thinking about our hedge position more broadly. Because of the volatility of what we've seen, we've actually started to reduce our hedge position on our metals in terms of having contracts out there, and we're doing -- we're taking a different form of negotiating with our vendors as opposed to choosing wrong in the financial markets for those -- that benefit."

I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter of 2016. We continue to successfully execute our strategic initiatives to grow both our top and bottom lines, as evidenced by the fact that this quarter is our 20th consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth. 
Our end markets, both in North America and internationally, remain strong, and we continue to leverage this underlying market strength by introducing new products, improving our sales mix, penetrating new markets and gaining share with our industry-leading brands. 
For the third quarter, our top line increased by 2%, 3% in local currency. Our adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 14.7%, reflecting our portfolio's strong operating leverage and a favorable price commodity environment. 
Our adjusted earnings per share grew 21% to $0.41 per share. Notably, this adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share includes the negative impact of a $21 million increase to our warranty reserve in our Windows and Other Specialty Products segment. John will provide you with more details about this charge in his commentary. 
Turning to our segments. I'd like to provide you with some additional insight into the drivers behind each of our segments' performance. Our Plumbing businesses continued their outstanding performance by growing revenue 6% in local currency, led again by the continued strength of our Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins businesses.
In early October, Delta was once again honored by the Environmental Protection Agency, earning the EPA Water Sense Sustained Excellence Award for 2016. This is the second consecutive year Delta has won this award, an award which recognizes Delta's efforts to promote water efficiency through its innovative, water-efficient products such as Touch20 faucets and H2Okinetic showerheads. Delta was also honored as the best overall vendor in e-commerce and as the best overall plumbing vendor in the showroom and builder segment by Ferguson Enterprises, our nation's largest plumbing wholesaler. Congratulations to the entire Delta team for its ability to bring innovative, environmentally friendly products to the market and for its ability to successfully focus, understand and deliver on the needs of its customers.
Moving on to our Decorative Architectural segment. We once again delivered a solid quarter. Our Pro Paint initiative with The Home Depot continued to drive double-digit sales growth in the quarter. And BEHR MARQUEE, our highest price point DIY product, continued to post exceptional year-over-year comps. During the quarter, to further accelerate our Pro business, we began staffing an additional 100 Pro hub stores. This will bring our total store count to over 200 by year-end. We're excited by the results of the initial hub store investment, and we believe that these additional hub stores will provide us, along with our partner, The Home Depot, with an exceptional foundation to continue penetrating the Pro paint market. 
In our Cabinets business, we continue to execute against our plan to optimize our sales mix by exiting certain low-margin direct-to-builder business. Our retail Cabinet business was particularly strong this quarter as we partnered with our customers to offer highly effective, exclusive promotions for KraftMaid, the most recognized brand in the industry.
Our brand recognition, coupled with these promotions, drove foot traffic into their stores and demand for our products. Additionally, based on the success of our KraftMaid momentum product at Lowe's, we're expanding the product offering to an additional 250 stores, taking the total store count to 500 stores across the United States.
KraftMaid momentum is a product line that extends the KraftMaid brand into the value semi-custom price point. This further rollout is a testament to our focus on the customer, our product development capability and our efforts to gain greater share of wallet at retail. 
Our Cabinetry team also completed significant product launches for both the KraftMaid and Quality brands during the quarter. These launches included trend-forward finishes to capitalize on the growing demand for great paints, new door styles, decorative accessories and functional SKUs.
Moving to Windows and Other Specialty Products. Our sales grew by 2%, excluding the effect of foreign currency. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to work through some operational issues in our Milgard window business unit related to labor turnover and other inefficiencies. The organization and I are keenly focused on fixing these issues. We've reorganized Milgard's management team, brought in top operational resources from across the company and together with the Milgard team, are actively working through these issues. It's going to take some time, but I'm confident that we have the appropriate focus and urgency. While we currently have some challenges in our window segment, overall, I'm pleased with our third quarter performance and the continued execution of our long-term strategies.
Our Plumbing businesses continue to produce outstanding top and bottom line results. Our Pro paint initiative continues to post double-digit growth as we further penetrate this market segment and gain share. And our Cabinet business has improved its year-to-date profitability by approximately $50 million through cost reductions, improved mix and strong growth in the retail and dealer channels. Our results are indicative of the solid execution of our strategies. 
Additionally, we took further action in the quarter to create shareholder value through our capital allocation strategy. We repurchased 2.3 million shares, bringing our total shares repurchased to 31 million against our 50 million share repurchase authorization, and we increased our annual dividend by $0.02 per share to $0.40 annually. This is the third year in a row that we have increased our dividend. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John, who will go over operational and financial performance in detail. John?"

As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and another onetime charges. Our focused execution continued as we delivered top and bottom line growth in North America and internationally. As Keith mentioned, the third quarter of 2016 was our 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth.
Sales increased 2% for the quarter and 3% in local currencies. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our sales in the quarter by approximately $17 million, principally due to a weaker pound compared to the U.S. dollar.
North American sales were up 2% in the quarter. We continued to experience strong demand for our repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price continuum as consumers are trading up to our better and best product offering. As a reminder, repair/remodel activity accounts for approximately 83% of our total sales.
International sales increased 6% in local currency in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in our international plumbing and window businesses.
Gross margins expanded approximately 100 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year to 32.9%. This includes the negative effect of Milgard's warranty adjustment.
Our SG&A as a percentage of sales increased this quarter by 40 basis points due to the strategic investment in several of our businesses in order to drive top and bottom line growth. Our teams continued to be focused on cost control and productivity improvement.
We delivered strong bottom line performance once again as operating income increased 7% to $275 million with operating margins expanding 70 basis points to 14.7%.
Our EPS in the quarter was $0.41, an improvement of $0.07 or 21% compared to the third quarter of last year. EPS was unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the increase in Milgard's warranty reserve.
Turning to Slide 7. Our Plumbing segment delivered another strong quarter of growth, driven by terrific performance at Delta, Hansgrohe and Watkins. Segment sales increased 6%, excluding the impact of currency, driven by growth in our faucets, showers and spas. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $9 million in the quarter.
Our North American sales grew 6% in the third quarter as we experienced strong, consumer-driven demand for our innovative brands at both our wholesale and large retail customers. Our spa business is outperforming the competition as Watkins continues to leverage its strong dealer network, innovative new products and industry-leading brands. Our international plumbing sales increased 7% in local currency. We experienced sales growth around the globe with particular strength in Asia and Northern Europe. Additionally, our sales mix continues to improve, as our premium price point Axor brand grew double digits this quarter.
Operating profit for this segment increased 30% in the quarter, driven by incremental volume and a favorable price commodity relationship. This segment also benefited from a positive year-over-year commodity hedge impact of approximately $10 million. This benefit was partially offset by approximately a $5 million of incremental advertising and display expense in support of new product introductions as we previously discussed in our second quarter earnings call.
Turning to Slide 8. The Decorative Architectural segment grew 2% as we continue to experience strong growth across our Behr Pro business and solid performance of our BEHR MARQUEE interior products. This growth was partially offset by the timing and amount of incremental promotional expense that we had previously discussed on our second quarter earnings call.
Liberty Hardware also contributed to the top and bottom line growth.
Operating profit increased 9% in the third quarter, principally due to operating leverage on higher volume. As we mentioned in the second quarter call, we intend to invest $30 million in promotion and advertising in the second half of 2016 to grow this business. In the third quarter, we incurred approximately $10 million of this promotion and advertising expense. And we expect to incur an additional $15 million to $20 million of investment in the fourth quarter, which includes $5 million of reset cost for the Liberty Shower Door program win at The Home Depot.
Turning to Slide 9. We continue to be pleased with our Cabinet segment performance. Segment sales declined 6% due to the deliberate exit of certain lower-margin business within the builder-direct channel in the United States and at select low-margin accounts in our U.K. Cabinet business. These actions, in aggregate, reduced segment sales by approximately $25 million. This decline was partially offset by KraftMaid's strong performance in the retail channel, resulting in double-digit growth and year-over-year share gains. In the dealer channel, we drove single-digit growth through increased volume and a favorable mix as both our KraftMaid and Merillat offerings continued to resonate with dealer base and consumers.
Segment profitability in the third quarter improved 5% over 2015, driven by our continued execution of cost savings initiatives as well as improved mix as we reduced our exposure to lower-margin builder-direct business and continued to grow our higher-price-point, semi-custom KraftMaid offering.
As we mentioned on the second quarter call, this growth is partially offset by approximately $5 million of incremental spend, which included expenses associated with our new product launches in the retail and dealer channels under the KraftMaid and Quality brands.
We expect to incur an additional $5 million of product launch cost in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to report these new products are driving strong foot traffic at our dealer customers and favorable end consumer reactions.
For the fourth quarter, we continue to believe the revenue impact of our decision to exit select-builder direct business and our kitchen countertop business will negatively impact sales by between $15 million and $20 million. This impact will continue through the first quarter of 2017.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Windows segment sales increased 2% in local currency, driven by growth in Milgard, our leading Western U.S. window business. Milgard's continued growth was driven by a positive mix shift toward our premium window and door product lines and favorable pricing. Excluding the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, our European window sales increased 2%, driven by volume and share gains. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted this segment's sales by approximately $8 million in the quarter.
This segment's operating profit decline was primarily due to the additional warranty reserve of approximately $21 million at our Milgard business, $6 million of incremental labor cost and inefficiencies in ERP expenses of approximately $3 million.
Let's go into more detail on the warranty adjustment and ERP expenses. You may recall, Milgard recorded a $10 million warranty adjustment in the second quarter. During Q2, we initiated an analysis based on enhanced historical warranty claims data that became available in the quarter and, in accordance with GAAP, booked a $10 million adjustment. In the third quarter, we completed our analysis, and we recorded an additional $21 million adjustment, which was reviewed by multiple third parties.
Moving to ERP. As we had previously disclosed, we anticipated approximately $3 million of expenses per quarter related to ERP into 2017. We have recently made the decision to deliberately slow down the rollout of ERP so that we can implement a system during seasonally slower periods. This decision will take the implementation through 2019. We are doing this to protect the customer and minimize disruption to the business.
And turning to Slide 11. We ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion of balance sheet liquidity. We delivered another strong quarter of working capital performance. Working capital as a percent of sales improved 20 basis points versus the prior year to 12.9%.
As we approach the end of 2016, we are on track to generate close to $500 million of free cash flow again this year. We also continued our initiatives to create shareholder value. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares valued at approximately $78 million. Finally, we increased our annual dividend by $0.02 per share to $0.40 per common share.
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

We put that analysis -- we completed the analysis, that's behind us. Second, as you know, we are implementing an ERP system. We completed the first plan successfully. We used those learnings and experience, and our plan is now to methodically roll out our systems across all the other plans but to do it in a way that avoids the peak periods, which is really Q2 and Q3. So we've eliminated those quarters from our implementation plan, and we're only going to be implementing ERP systems in the slow periods; that protects our customer, it's the right thing to do. And thirdly, due to the combination of strong demand for our products, particularly around paint and vinyl and fiberglass, coupled with a tight labor market in the Northwest that we have, we're dealing with some labor efficiencies. We've mobilized our best talent and operational teams. We have the Senior Vice President of Operations from Delta Faucet working with the Milgard team. We have the Masco Operating System group working with the team, and together, I'm pleased with the initial success that we have. So we're turning it around. So those are 3 distinct issues that we're doing with. In terms, Susan, of your specific question going forward, I think our guidance that we talked about in terms of long-term growth is going to be a little dampened due to some of the short-term issues that we're facing. When you think about the long-term margins of this business, we haven't changed our point of view on that, and we're seeing that right in that 10% to 13% range. So long term, nothing has changed. We're dealing with some short-term issues, and we're making progress."

You may recall that we started this in the third quarter of last year, but you may also recall that in the first quarter conference call, we announced that we had chosen to exit our kitchen countertop business as well as some other business on the eastern seaboard. And so as a result that has elevated some of the exits that we've seen over the course of the last couple quarters.

With respect to the margins, again, I hope you guys recall earlier in the call -- recall the fact that we said on our second quarter call that the margins that we posted there were unusually high because we really had a very clean quarter with no unusual expenses or some typical investments that we may have in advertising catalogs and displays, things like that. So it was a very light quarter for all the type of activity in the second quarter. So that was more of the anomaly. So the way I look at it, Keith, is that if you factor out the $5 million of expense and with the $25 million of business that we walked away from, while it was indeed low margin, it wasn't 0 margin. And so there were some loss of profit on the business that we did walk away from.

Home prices continue to appreciate, household formations continue to increase and the demographics of the millennials as they go on an average age from, say, 25 to 29 or 30, that's going to bode well for new household formations. Existing home sales rebounded nicely. They're up to, I think, close to $5.5 million, and the affordability is still very favorable. So we're not only seeing good fundamentals and good traffic, but we're continuing to see good moves in terms of our mix. So our higher price point products, like our high-end Delta, our Brizo brand, our Axor brand, our spa business, things like that and our Cabinet business, which is a big ticket item. So we're seeing good positive mix, but we're also seeing good growth down in our entry-level products, which dampens down the mix benefit a bit admittedly. But I think -- fundamentally, it's a good sign for the nature of the recovery when you're seeing that kind of growth, both in the, call it the household formation stage and the opening price point as well as the mix up in the higher mix.

I spent some time out in Boston and New York this past quarter with some dealers out there in plumbing, and they talked about very robust foot traffic. And while there was a little bit of choppiness earlier in the quarter, they're talking about how it's picked up and they feel good about it. I spent some time in the Midwest with cabinet dealers, same story. Just in general, Bob, good foot traffic and smiles on their faces, not only for our new launches, but also, in general, how the business was going. I was at a meeting with 15 or 20 CEOs of building -- builders -- big builders, and they were all robust about how the overall builder market was going. So I wouldn't say I'm any more robust about the macros than I've been in the past. We've liked where they've been, and we think that our brands and our price points and our channel penetration is positioned to take advantage of it. So yes, fundamentally, my view really hasn't changed. It's good macros."
