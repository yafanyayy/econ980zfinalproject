265621,321831219,920733,"Danaher Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter, in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging econ",2253,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter, in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially oriented markets, we continue to build our competitive advantage and drove share gains across a number of our businesses. As always, the Danaher Business System is the foundation for our team's outstanding execution. 
We also made meaningful progress toward establishing a new industrial growth company, Fortive, which will be spun out of Danaher later this year. At our year-end investor meeting, we announced Fortive name, branding, future operating structure and additional leadership position. We also achieved an important milestone in December, filing Fortive Form 10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are confident that Fortive will launch with a strong foundation and will be poised for success upon completion of the separation in the third quarter of 2016. 
For the full year, our investments in organic growth initiatives helped drive solid 3% core revenue growth. With the addition of our recent acquisitions and other portfolio moves, our total annual revenues are now over $20 billion. 
From an M&A perspective, 2015 was a historic year for Danaher. Including Pall, we announced and closed 14 acquisitions for nearly $14.5 billion, expanding our capabilities across the portfolio. Looking forward, our funnels at both Danaher and Fortive are strong, and we'll continue to focus on small and midsized transactions throughout the separation process.
In 2015, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow, including over $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio in 2015 was 123%, representing the 24th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. We recognize the importance of this metric, particularly in a more challenging macroenvironment as strong free cash flow is a fuel used to fund both our organic and inorganic growth initiatives. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Sales grew 12.5% to $5.9 billion, while core revenue was roughly flat. Core revenue growth, particularly for our consumables businesses, was negatively impacted by 4 fewer selling days in the quarter. In addition, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 17.5%.
In a weakening global macroenvironment, the Danaher Business System helped protect and expand many of our market-leading positions, driving share gains at Hach, ChemTreat, Matco, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX and Videojet. 
In the high-growth markets, declines in Latin America, Russia and the Middle East were more than offset by double-digit growth in India and high single-digit growth in China. Notably, annual revenues in China exceeded $2 billion for the first time, and we remain well positioned in the most attractive sectors in the market. 
In the developed markets, revenues were down slightly due to incremental softness in the U.S. and Western Europe.
Gross margin for the quarter was 51.2%. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.3% and our gross profit increased by almost $900 million. In the quarter, core operating margin increased 120 basis points, with all 5 segments improving by 60 basis points or better. Our reported operating margin was flat at 16.6%, negatively affected by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and acquisition-related transaction costs.
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.27, which represents an increase of 13.5% over last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $4.30, up 8.5% from 2014.
Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues decreased 9%, while core revenues were down 5%. Core operating margin increased 110 basis points, primarily due to new product introductions and good cost management. Core revenue in our Instruments platform decreased at a high single-digit rate, with declines across most major geographies. Food core revenues were down high single digits as industrial markets continued to weaken in North America, Latin America and the Middle East. In December, Fluke acquired Pacific Laser Systems, a leader in handheld laser alignment tools, to enhance its product offerings for professional contractors, electricians and general maintenance customers. At Tektronix, core sales declined high single digits. Declines in North America, Latin America and the Middle East more than offset growth in China that resulted from solid execution by our local sales team. The team's continued investments in innovation placed Tek in a position of technology leadership within its industry. This quarter, Tek launched the MDO 4000C, a Mixed Domain Oscilloscope that combines up to 6 instruments in 1 unit. The new MDO 4000C is completely customizable and upgradable, allowing engineers to start with a high-performance oscilloscope and add functionality over time as needs change or budgets allow. 
Matco, a business that will be a significant contributor to Fortive's results, delivered its third consecutive year of double-digit core growth in 2015. Even after 3 decades as part of the Danaher portfolio, Matco continues to find new ways to improve using DBS. By deploying such DBS tools as web marketing, Accelerated Product Development and lean conversion, the team continues to expand its franchise distribution network, gain market share and expand margins.
Turning now to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 1%, with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points, and reported operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 21.8%. Water Quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, a combination of fewer selling days and forward demand from our more Industrial customers in the developed markets resulted in essentially flat core growth at Hach, while ChemTreat grew slightly. Trojan had another very good quarter driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American Muni market. Hach delivered another impressive year in 2015. In addition to mid single-digit organic growth, Hach continued its healthy cadence of bolt-on acquisitions. The team has done a terrific job implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses to help improve sales and drive innovation. One such example is BioTector, which was acquired in 2014 and had double-digit growth in the quarter. BioTector provides online total organic carbon analyzers that help our customers monitor water quality in real time and reduce waste.  BioTector's early and effective application of DBS tools such as lean conversion and pharma management led to more than 200 basis points of margin expansion, significant inventory reductions and market share gains in the chemical and dairy segments. 
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew high single digits, with strength across the platform. In the U.S, point-of-sale solutions and dispensers increased over 20% as our customers continued to upgrade their payment systems to comply with EMV security requirements. We expect EMV-related demand to continue to accelerate for the next several years. Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics, core revenues grew 2% with reported revenues up 34.5%,  largely due to our recent Pall, Microscan and Devicor acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis points. 
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single digits, with growth in the high-growth markets, partially offset by slight declines in developed markets. As previously mentioned, fewer selling days in the quarter negatively impact our recurring revenue streams across the platform. 
At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, led by our immunoassay and urinalysis solutions. Utilization rates in Asia remain healthy, leading to high single-digit growth across the region. In Europe, we celebrated our first orders with the commercial launch of our Veris molecular diagnostic system. Veris is streamlined sample in result out workflow offers breakthrough ease-of-use in a market that is experiencing a shortage of skilled technicians. In short, it's helping our lab customers process more tests, reduce training requirements and save money. And thus far, customer feedback has been extremely positive.
Radiometer's core revenues grew up slightly, a deceleration from previous quarters due to the effect of fewer selling days and a difficult comparison in Instrument sales. Geographically, we saw healthy growth in China and Japan, while Latin America and the Middle East declined. 
Leica Biosystems had a good finish to the year, delivering low single-digit core growth as strong demand across most major product lines was partially offset by the impact of -- from fewer selling days. Notably, the team delivered a record year of placements for our BOND advanced staining instrument. 
Last December, we closed the acquisition of Devicor, a leading provider of breast biopsy devices and markers that move Leica further upstream in the anatomical workflow. Devicor continues to track well and has exceeded our expectations, posting high single-digit core growth or better in each quarter since acquisition. 
Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up low single digits with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits, with continued strength in our clinical and applied end markets. 2015  marked the fifth year since our acquisition of SCIEX. Since then, SCIEX has proven to be a remarkable example of how thoughtful application of DBS principles can drive tremendous financial results. The team has taken the business that was growing below market rates to mid to high single-digit growth and share gains. We've seen significant improvements on the cost side as well, which has enabled SCIEX to invest those savings into higher impact growth initiatives. Progress at SCIEX continues today, and 2015 marked one of the most important product innovation years in SCIEX's history, with the launch of its X series mass spectrometry platform. The X series introduced an entirely new design, easy-to-use software and custom models for targeted applications in routine food, environmental and forensic testing labs.
Leica Microsystems core revenues were essentially flat as strong performance in China and Japan was offset by declines in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.
Turning now to Dental. Segment revenues increased 17%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core revenues were up slightly. Core operating margins increased by over 500 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to consistent DBS implementation across a number of operational areas. Reported operating margins were 15.8%.
Revenues in our consumables business were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter, but our team continued to execute well and saw strong demand for several product lines throughout the year. In particular, our investment in innovation have provided us with truly differentiated technologies such as SonicFill, TF Adaptive and elementsfree, which all launched in 2014. In Dental technology, we saw our first quarter of positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2014. Top line results continue to be impacted by destocking within our U.S. distribution channels, but to a much lesser degree than in previous quarters. 
December marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Nobel Biocare. The team has quickly embraced growth, lean and leadership tools of DBS, helping to not only accelerate growth but also improve operating margins by over 300 basis points since the acquisition.
Moving to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 8.5%, while core revenues were down 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 80 basis points, and reported operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.6%. Automation core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to weakening in industrial markets in China and North America. Despite the challenging market and revenue decline, the team continues to identify cost saving opportunities and delivered solid core margin expansion in the quarter. 
Core revenues in our Product Identification platform were up slightly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to extend our reach into new Product ID adjacencies with the acquisition of Laetus, a leading supplier of track and trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. Increasingly, pharmaceutical tracking is becoming a regulatory and public safety concern and Laetus gives us exposure to this important vertical. I'm more excited to welcome Laetus to the Danaher team. 
At Videojet, core revenues were up low single digits as strong performance in Europe and North America was somewhat offset by weakness in the high-growth markets. Results were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter. Throughout the full year, Videojet has placed a major focus on digital investments, driving key innovations in areas such as network monitoring remote service-enabled printers and predictive maintenance. As a result, we achieved record new equipment vitality of over 40% for the year. These tremendous technology capabilities have not only certified Videojet's leadership position in the market, they've also meaningfully improved our customers' experiences.
So to wrap up. We are pleased with our record fourth quarter results. During the quarter, the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, significantly expanded core operating margins, generated record free cash flow and announced several bolt-on acquisitions. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially oriented markets, we continue to execute well. 
Looking back, 2015 was a remarkable year for Danaher. We completed the largest acquisition in our history with Pall, announced our pending separation into 2 independent publicly traded companies with Fortive and drove excellent overall financial results. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, we believe we'll continue to deliver earnings outperformance and create long-term shareholder value in 2016 and for years to come. 
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.04, which assumes approximately flat core revenue growth. As we announced at our annual investor event in December, we continue to expect full-year 2016 core revenue growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.95, which would represent a 12% to 15% increase year-on-year."

I think, Scott, what we're assuming is that what we saw was some of the slowing in December is essentially the environment that we're going to see in the near term here. It's clearly impacting our more industrial businesses more than our other businesses. So we are not immune to this slowdown. But I think we took some appropriate actions in the fourth quarter. Those actions are going to pay off here certainly from a margin standpoint. But I think the other thing to keep in mind is that the portfolio that we have today truly does differentiate us. And I think when we look at the opportunities that we have in our Life Science businesses, our Diagnostic businesses, some improvement that we're seeing here in our Dental businesses, continued good progress at GVR, while we remain cautious in some respects around the macroenvironment and are not assuming things get materially better there, we are playing offense in a number of areas that I think will bode well. So I don't think there's anything particularly optimistic in our outlook around the macro, but I think some of the things that we're doing from an investment standpoint and across our growth initiatives should continue to position a very good portfolio and a differentiated portfolio and continue to move it into an even better place."

Starting with the team that we have in place, a terrific team, both the Pall leadership team, many of whom have taken on added responsibilities. But in addition, the added resources that we put in place and the leadership that we have brought to bear in the business, I think, together, that team is off to a terrific start. We'll talk to the $0.40 and the cost opportunities that we have here in just a minute. But coming to the growth side of the house, about what we expected, continued very good progress and growth rates on the Life Science side, keeping in mind that, that business has an exceptional position in the biopharma market in Life Science. So we're seeing continued good growth there. We're also seeing outstanding growth in single use technologies, which are a key part and a key growth driver of the biopharma segment of Life Science business as time goes on. On the industrial side, again, what we would have expected, which is a slowing on that side of the house, we've seen that those businesses impacted far more than obviously on the more Life Science-oriented side of the house. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that, that business is also strongly skewed towards consumables. In total, the portfolio is about 70% aftermarket consumables primarily. And so that's a strong foundation and I think continues to give us confidence that while we'll have some segments that are challenged, the business overall will continue to perform quite well. Relative to the cost side of the house, again, off to a very good start. You heard us in December, take the 2016 number up to $100 million because we've gotten off to an earlier start. We're getting the kinds of cost reductions that you would expect us to get out of a public company in the early going. The public company costs, beginning to get after some of the indirect cost leverage that we get and some of the procurement cost leverage that we get by consolidating procurement across our other businesses where appropriate. And over time, we'll see some of the benefits coming from -- on the gross margin side as we look to the operational footprint, but that will obviously take a little bit more time."

I've mentioned a couple of times that we've had outstanding relationships with our distribution partners. We work in a collaborative way with them on channel inventories throughout the course of the year. That was obviously somewhat of a painful process to go through in a sense that the impact on core growth. But net-net, a very good process in terms of positioning the channel efficiently.

And so really making sure that we understand opportunity funnels and are not overly optimistic about the timing within which funding will be released as in many cases that funding has some governmental influence to it is really important. It is easy to have a sales team get overly optimistic that the timing of funding release is going to be the same as it was a year ago or 2 years ago when the reality is, things may have slowed down and tenders may be being let at a much slower pace. So being diligent about how we pressure test those funnels is key."

265621,321831219,920905,"Danaher Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter, in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging econ",2253,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter, in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially oriented markets, we continue to build our competitive advantage and drove share gains across a number of our businesses. As always, the Danaher Business System is the foundation for our team's outstanding execution. 
We also made meaningful progress toward establishing a new industrial growth company, Fortive, which will be spun out of Danaher later this year. At our year-end investor meeting, we announced Fortive's name, branding, future operating structure and additional leadership positions. We also achieved an important milestone in December, filing Fortive's Form 10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are confident that Fortive will launch with a strong foundation and will be poised for success upon completion of the separation in the third quarter of 2016. 
For the full year, our investments in organic growth initiatives helped to drive solid 3% core revenue growth. With the addition of our recent acquisitions and other portfolio moves, our total annual revenues are now over $20 billion. 
From an M&A perspective, 2015 was a historic year for Danaher. Including Pall, we announced and closed 14 acquisitions for nearly $14.5 billion, expanding our capabilities across the portfolio. Looking forward, our funnels at both Danaher and Fortive are strong, and we'll continue to focus on small and midsized transactions throughout the separation process.
In 2015, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow, including over $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio in 2015 was 123%, representing the 24th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. We recognize the importance of this metric, particularly in a more challenging macro environment, as strong free cash flow is the fuel used to fund both our organic and inorganic growth initiatives. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Sales grew 12.5% to $5.9 billion, while core revenue was roughly flat. Core revenue growth, particularly for our consumables businesses, was negatively impacted by 4 fewer selling days in the quarter. In addition, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 17.5%.
In a weakening global macro environment, the Danaher Business System helped to protect and expand many of our market-leading positions, driving share gains at Hach, ChemTreat, Matco, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX and Videojet. In the high-growth markets, declines in Latin America, Russia and the Middle East were more than offset by double-digit growth in India and high single-digit growth in China. Notably, annual revenues in China exceeded $2 billion for the first time, and we remain well-positioned in the most attractive sectors in the market. In the developed markets, revenues were down slightly due to incremental softness in the U.S. and Western Europe.
Gross margin for the quarter was 51.2%. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.3%, and our gross profit increased by almost $900 million. In the quarter, core operating margin increased 120 basis points, with all 5 segments improving by 60 basis points or better. Our reported operating margin was flat at 16.6%, negatively affected by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and acquisition-related transaction costs.
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.27, which represents an increase of 13.5% over last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $4.30, up 8.5% from 2014.
Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues decreased 9%, while core revenues were down 5%. Core operating margin increased 110 basis points, primarily due to new product introductions and good cost management. Core revenue in our Instruments platform decreased at a high single-digit rate, with declines across most major geographies. Fluke core revenues were down high single digits as industrial markets continued to weaken in North America, Latin America and the Middle East. In December, Fluke acquired Pacific Laser Systems, a leader in handheld laser alignment tools, to enhance its product offerings for professional contractors, electricians and general maintenance customers. 
At Tektronix, core sales declined high single digits. Declines in North America, Latin America and the Middle East more than offset growth in China that resulted from solid execution by our local sales team. The team's continued investments in innovation placed Tek in a position of technology leadership within its industry. This quarter, Tek launched the MDO4000C, a Mixed Domain Oscilloscope that combines up to 6 instruments in 1 unit. The new MDO4000C is completely customizable and upgradable, allowing engineers to start with a high-performance oscilloscope and add functionality over time as needs change or budgets allow. 
Matco, a business that will be a significant contributor to Fortive's results, delivered its third consecutive year of double-digit core growth in 2015. Even after 3 decades as part of the Danaher portfolio, Matco continues to find new ways to improve using DBS. By deploying such DBS tools as web marketing, accelerated product development and lean conversion, the team continues to expand its franchise distribution network, gain market share and expand margins.
Turning now to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 1%, with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points, and reported operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 21.8%. Water Quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, a combination of fewer selling days and slower demand from our more industrial customers in the developed markets resulted in essentially flat core growth at Hach, while ChemTreat grew slightly. Trojan had another very good quarter, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American muni market. 
Hach delivered another impressive year in 2015. In addition to mid-single digit organic growth, Hach continued its healthy cadence of bolt-on acquisitions. The team has done a terrific job implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses to help improve sales and drive innovation. One such example is BioTector, which was acquired in 2014 and had double-digit growth in the quarter. BioTector provides online total organic carbon analyzers that help our customers monitor water quality in real time and reduce waste. BioTector's early and effective application of DBS tools such as lean conversion and pharma management led to more than 200 basis points of margin expansion, significant inventory reductions and market share gains in the chemical and dairy segments. 
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew high single digits, with strength across the platform. In the U.S, point-of-sale solutions and dispensers increased over 20%, as our customers continued to upgrade their payment systems to comply with EMV security requirements. We expect EMV-related demand to continue to accelerate for the next several years. 
Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics, core revenues grew 2%, with reported revenues up 34.5%, largely due to our recent Pall, Microscan and Devicor acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis points. 
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single digits, with growth in the high-growth markets, partially offset by slight declines in developed markets. As previously mentioned, fewer selling days in the quarter negatively impact our recurring revenue streams across the platform. 
At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, led by our immunoassay and urinalysis solutions. Utilization rates in Asia remain healthy, leading to high single-digit growth across the region. 
In Europe, we celebrated our first orders with the commercial launch of our Veris molecular diagnostic system. Veris is streamlined sample-in result-out workflow, offers breakthrough ease of use in a market that is experiencing a shortage of skilled technicians. In short, it's helping our lab customers process more tests, reduce training requirements and save money. And thus far, customer feedback has been extremely positive.
Radiometer's core revenues grew up slightly, a deceleration from previous quarters due to the effect of fewer selling days and a difficult comparison in Instrument sales. Geographically, we saw healthy growth in China and Japan, while Latin America and the Middle East declined. 
Leica Biosystems had a good finish to the year, delivering low single-digit core growth as strong demand across most major product lines was partially offset by the impact of -- from fewer selling days. Notably, the team delivered a record year of placements for our BOND advanced staining instrument. 
Last December, we closed the acquisition of Devicor, a leading provider of breast biopsy devices and markers. That move Leica further upstream in the anatomical pedagogy workflow. Devicor continues to track well and has exceeded our expectations, posting high single-digit core growth or better in each quarter since acquisition. 
Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up low single digits with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits, with continued strength in our clinical and applied end markets. 2015 marked the fifth year since our acquisition of SCIEX. Since then, SCIEX has proven to be a remarkable example of how thoughtful application of DBS principles can drive tremendous financial results. The team has taken the business that was growing below market rates to mid to high single-digit growth and share gains. We've seen significant improvements on the cost side as well, which has enabled SCIEX to invest those savings into higher impact growth initiatives. Progress at SCIEX continues today, and 2015 marked one of the most important product innovation years in SCIEX's history, with the launch of its X-Series mass spectrometry platform. The X-Series introduced an entirely new design, easy-to-use software and custom models for targeted applications in routine food, environmental and forensic testing labs.
Leica Microsystems core revenues were essentially flat as strong performance in China and Japan was offset by declines in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.
Turning now to Dental. Segment revenues increased 17%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core revenues were up slightly. Core operating margins increased by over 500 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to consistent DBS implementation across a number of operational areas. Reported operating margins were 15.8%.
Revenues in our consumables business were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter, but our team continued to execute well and saw strong demand for several product lines throughout the year. In particular, our investments in innovation have provided us with truly differentiated technologies such as SonicFill, TF Adaptive and elementsfree, which all launched in 2014. In Dental technology, we saw our first quarter of positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2014. Top line results continue to be impacted by destocking within our U.S. distribution channels, but to a much lesser degree than in previous quarters. 
December marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Nobel Biocare. The team has quickly embraced growth, lean and leadership tools of DBS, helping to not only accelerate growth but also improve operating margins by over 300 basis points since the acquisition.
Moving to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 8.5%, while core revenues were down 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 80 basis points, and reported operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.6%. Automation core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to weakening in industrial markets in China and North America. Despite the challenging market and revenue decline, the team continues to identify cost-savings opportunities and delivered solid core margin expansion in the quarter. 
Core revenues in our Product Identification platform were up slightly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to extend our reach into new Product ID adjacencies with the acquisition of Laetus, a leading supplier of track and trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. Increasingly, pharmaceutical tracking is becoming a regulatory and public safety concern, and Laetus gives us exposure to this important vertical. I'm more excited to welcome Laetus to the Danaher team. 
At Videojet, core revenues were up low single digits as strong performance in Europe and North America was somewhat offset by weakness in the high-growth markets. Results were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter. Throughout the full year, Videojet has placed a major focus on digital investments, driving key innovations in areas such as network monitoring, remote service-enabled printers and predictive maintenance. As a result, we achieved record new equipment vitality of over 40% for the year. These tremendous technology capabilities have not only certified Videojet's leadership position in the market, they've also meaningfully improved our customers' experiences.
So to wrap up. We are pleased with our record fourth quarter results. During the quarter, the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, significantly expanded core operating margins, generated record free cash flow and announced several bolt-on acquisitions. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially oriented markets, we continue to execute well. 
Looking back, 2015 was a remarkable year for Danaher. We completed the largest acquisition in our history with Pall, announced our pending separation into 2 independent publicly traded companies with Fortive and drove excellent overall financial results. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, we believe we'll continue to deliver earnings outperformance and create long-term shareholder value in 2016 and for years to come. 
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.04, which assumes approximately flat core revenue growth. As we announced at our annual investor event in December, we continue to expect full year 2016 core revenue growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.95, which would represent a 12% to 15% increase year-on-year."

I think, Scott, we're -- what we're assuming is that what we saw was some of the slowing in December is essentially the environment that we're going to see in the near term here. It's clearly impacting our more industrial businesses more than our other businesses. So we are not immune to this slowdown. But I think we took some appropriate actions in the fourth quarter. Those actions are going to pay off here certainly from a margin standpoint. But I think the other thing to keep in mind is that the portfolio that we have today truly does differentiate us. And I think when we look at the opportunities that we have in our Life Science businesses, our Diagnostic businesses, some improvement that we're seeing here in our Dental businesses, continued good progress at GVR. While we remain cautious in some respects around the macro environment and are not assuming things get materially better there, we are playing offense in a number of areas that, I think, will bode well. So I don't think there's anything particularly optimistic in our outlook around the macro, but I think some of the things that we're doing from an investment standpoint and across our growth initiatives should continue to position a very good portfolio and a differentiated portfolio and continue to move it into an even better place."

Starting with the team that we have in place, a terrific team, both the Pall leadership team, many of whom have taken on added responsibilities. But in addition, the added resources that we put in place and the leadership that we have brought to bear in the business, I think, together, that team is off to a terrific start. We'll talk to the $0.40 and the cost opportunities we have here in just a minute. But coming to the growth side of the house, about what we expected, continued very good progress and growth rates on the Life Science side, keeping in mind that, that business has an exceptional position in the biopharma market in Life Science. So we're seeing continued good growth there. We're also seeing outstanding growth in single-use technologies, which are a key part and a key growth driver of the biopharma segment of Life Science business as time goes on. On the industrial side, again, what you -- what we would have expected, which is a slowing on that side of the house, we've seen that those businesses impacted far more than, obviously, on the more Life Science-oriented side of the house. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that, that business is also strongly skewed towards consumables. In total, the portfolio is about 70% aftermarket consumables, primarily. And so that's a strong foundation, and I think continues to give us confidence that while we'll have some segments that are challenged, the business overall will continue to perform quite well. Relative to the cost side of the house, again, off to a very good start. You heard us in December, take the 2016 number up to $100 million because we had gotten off to an earlier start. We're getting the kinds of cost reductions that you would expect us to get out of a public company in the early going. The public company costs beginning to get after some of the indirect cost leverage that we get and some of the procurement cost leverage that we get by consolidating procurement across our other businesses where appropriate. And over time, we'll see some of the benefits coming from -- on the gross margin side as we look at the operational footprint, but that will obviously take a little bit more time."

It's -- Shannon, it is the real testament to those businesses given the challenging environment they're in from a core growth perspective. That they are getting the operating margin lift that they're getting without the benefit of the top line dropping that through. I think, it is a testament to the strength of the Danaher Business System, the tools that we use not just in newly acquired businesses, but in businesses with long histories with Danaher that have gotten a lot done using DBS in the past and are still getting it done. If you think about some of the businesses in T&M, be it Fluke and the associated acquisitions around Fluke that have been done quite a number of years ago, think about other businesses like Qualitrol, like some of the businesses in our automation Sensors and Controls areas, those guys are using DBS, whether those are lean tools specifically in the plants or deploying those tools into -- in areas of SG&A, they are just demonstrating that those tools are still highly effective in businesses with long histories with Danaher. So it's kudos to those guys, and they continue to get her done."

It's probably in the 80% neighborhood of consumables, so the days impact was fairly significant there. They also had a challenging comp in the fourth quarter on the Instrumentation side. Couple of big orders that had some impact there. So I think Radiometer is in as good a shape today as it's ever been, no meaningful shift in the competitive dynamics there. So we still feel very good about it. I think, if there was anything there, Shannon, would be unique to Radiometer, it's simply the fact that some of the growth that we've seen in the high-growth markets, while still strong in places like China and India, are still now very weak in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle East.

And so really making sure that we understand opportunity funnels and are not overly optimistic about the timing within which funding will be released, as in many cases that funding has some governmental influence to it, is really important. It is easy to have a sales team get overly optimistic that the timing of funding release is going to be the same as it was 1 year ago or 2 years ago when the reality is, things may have slowed down and tenders may be being let at a much slower pace.

We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter, in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging econ",2250,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter, in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially oriented markets, we continued to build our competitive advantage and drove share gains across a number of our businesses. As always, the Danaher Business System is the foundation for our team's outstanding execution. 
We also made meaningful progress toward establishing a new industrial growth company, Fortive, which will be spun out of Danaher later this year. At our year-end investor meeting, we announced Fortive's name, branding, future operating structure and additional leadership positions. We also achieved an important milestone in December, filing Fortive's Form 10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are confident that Fortive will launch with a strong foundation and will be poised for success upon completion of the separation in the third quarter of 2016. 
For the full year, our investments in organic growth initiatives helped drive solid 3% core revenue growth. With the addition of our recent acquisitions and other portfolio moves, our total annual revenues are now over $20 billion. 
From an M&A perspective, 2015 was a historic year for Danaher. Including Pall, we announced or closed 14 acquisitions for nearly $14.5 billion, expanding our capabilities across the portfolio. Looking forward, our funnels at both Danaher and Fortive are strong, and we'll continue to focus on small and midsized transactions throughout the separation process.
In 2015, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow, including over $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio in 2015 was 123%, representing the 24th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. We recognize the importance of this metric, particularly in a more challenging macro environment, as strong free cash flow is the fuel used to fund both our organic and inorganic growth initiatives. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Sales grew 12.5% to $5.9 billion, while core revenue was roughly flat. Core revenue growth, particularly for our consumables businesses, was negatively impacted by 4 fewer selling days in the quarter. In addition, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 17.5%.
In a weakening global macro environment, the Danaher Business System helped protect and expand many of our market-leading positions, driving share gains at Hach, ChemTreat, Matco, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX and Videojet. In the high-growth markets, declines in Latin America, Russia and the Middle East were more than offset by double-digit growth in India and high single-digit growth in China. Notably, annual revenues in China exceeded $2 billion for the first time, and we remain well-positioned in the most attractive sectors in the market. In the developed markets, revenues were down slightly due to incremental softness in the U.S. and Western Europe.
Gross margin for the quarter was 51.2%. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.3%, and our gross profit increased by almost $900 million. In the quarter, core operating margin increased 120 basis points, with all 5 segments improving by 60 basis points or better. Our reported operating margin was flat at 16.6%, negatively affected by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and acquisition-related transaction costs.
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.27, which represents an increase of 13.5% over last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $4.30, up 8.5% from 2014.
Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues decreased 9%, while core revenues were down 5%. Core operating margin increased 110 basis points, primarily due to new product introductions and good cost management. Core revenue in our Instruments platform decreased at a high single-digit rate, with declines across most major geographies. Fluke core revenues were down high single digits as industrial markets continued to weaken in North America, Latin America and the Middle East. In December, Fluke acquired Pacific Laser Systems, a leader in handheld laser alignment tools, to enhance its product offerings for professional contractors, electricians and general maintenance customers. 
At Tektronix, core sales declined high single digits. Declines in North America, Latin America and the Middle East more than offset growth in China that resulted from solid execution by our local sales team. The team's continued investments in innovation placed Tek in a position of technology leadership within its industry. This quarter, Tek launched the MDO4000C, a Mixed Domain Oscilloscope that combines up to 6 instruments in 1 unit. The new MDO4000C is completely customizable and upgradable, allowing engineers to start with a high-performance oscilloscope and add functionality over time as needs change or budgets allow. 
Matco, a business that will be a significant contributor to Fortive's results, delivered its third consecutive year of double-digit core growth in 2015. Even after 3 decades as part of the Danaher portfolio, Matco continues to find new ways to improve using DBS. By deploying such DBS tools as web marketing, accelerated product development and lean conversion, the team continues to expand its franchise distribution network, gain market share and expand margins.
Turning now to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 1%, with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points, and reported operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 21.8%. Water Quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, a combination of fewer selling days and slower demand from our more industrial customers in the developed markets resulted in essentially flat core growth at Hach, while ChemTreat grew slightly. Trojan had another very good quarter, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American muni market. 
Hach delivered another impressive year in 2015. In addition to mid-single digit organic growth, Hach continued its healthy cadence of bolt-on acquisitions. The team has done a terrific job implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses to help improve sales and drive innovation. One such example is BioTector, which was acquired in 2014 and had double-digit growth in the quarter. BioTector provides online total organic carbon analyzers that help our customers monitor water quality in real time and reduce waste. BioTector's early and effective application of DBS tools such as lean conversion and funnel management led to more than 200 basis points of margin expansion, significant inventory reductions and market share gains in the chemical and dairy segments. 
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew high single digits, with strength across the platform. In the U.S, point-of-sale solutions and dispensers increased over 20%, as our customers continued to upgrade their payment systems to comply with EMV security requirements. We expect EMV-related demand to continue to accelerate for the next several years. 
Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics, core revenues grew 2%, with reported revenues up 34.5%, largely due to our recent Pall, Microscan and Devicor acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis points. 
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single digits, with growth in the high-growth markets, partially offset by slight declines in developed markets. As previously mentioned, fewer selling days in the quarter negatively impact our recurring revenue streams across the platform. 
At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, led by our immunoassay and urinalysis solutions. Utilization rates in Asia remain healthy, leading to high single-digit growth across the region. 
In Europe, we celebrated our first orders with the commercial launch of our Veris molecular diagnostic system. Veris' streamlined sample-in result-out workflow, offers breakthrough ease of use in a market that is experiencing a shortage of skilled technicians. In short, it's helping our lab customers process more tests, reduce training requirements and save money. And thus far, customer feedback has been extremely positive.
Radiometer's core revenues were up slightly, a deceleration from previous quarters due to the effect of fewer selling days and a difficult comparison in Instrument sales. Geographically, we saw healthy growth in China and Japan, while Latin America and the Middle East declined. 
Leica Biosystems had a good finish to the year, delivering low single-digit core growth as strong demand across most major product lines was partially offset by the impact from fewer selling days. Notably, the team delivered a record year of placements for our BOND advanced staining instrument. 
Last December, we closed the acquisition of Devicor, a leading provider of breast biopsy devices and markers. That move Leica further upstream in the anatomical pedology workflow. Devicor continues to track well and has exceeded our expectations, posting high single-digit core growth or better in each quarter since acquisition. 
Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up low single digits with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits, with continued strength in our clinical and applied end markets. 2015 marked the fifth year since our acquisition of SCIEX. Since then, SCIEX has proven to be a remarkable example of how thoughtful application of DBS principles can drive tremendous financial results. The team has taken a business that was growing below market rates to mid- to high single-digit growth and share gains. We've seen significant improvement on the cost side as well, which has enabled SCIEX to invest those savings into higher impact growth initiatives. Progress at SCIEX continues today, and 2015 marked one of the most important product innovation years in SCIEX's history, with the launch of its X-Series mass spectrometry platform. The X-Series introduces an entirely new design, easy-to-use software and custom models for targeted application in routine food, environmental and forensic testing labs.
Leica Microsystems core revenues were essentially flat as strong performance in China and Japan was offset by declines in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.
Turning now to Dental. Segment revenues increased 17%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core revenues were up slightly. Core operating margins increased by over 500 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to consistent DBS implementation across a number of operational areas. Reported operating margins were 15.8%.
Revenues in our consumables business were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter, but our team continued to execute well and saw strong demand for several product lines throughout the year. In particular, our investments in innovation have provided us with truly differentiated technologies such as SonicFill, TF Adaptive and elementsfree, which all launched in 2014. In Dental technology, we saw our first quarter of positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2014. Top line results continued to be impacted by destocking within our U.S. distribution channels, but to a much lesser degree than in previous quarters. 
December marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Nobel Biocare. The team has quickly embraced growth, lean and leadership tools of DBS, helping to not only accelerate growth but also improve operating margins by over 300 basis points since the acquisition.
Moving to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 8.5%, while core revenues were down 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 80 basis points, and reported operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.6%. Automation core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to weakening in the industrial markets in China and North America. Despite the challenging market and revenue decline, the team continues to identify cost-savings opportunities and delivered solid core margin expansion in the quarter. 
Core revenues in our Product Identification platform were up slightly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to extend our reach into new Product ID adjacencies with the acquisition of Laetus, a leading supplier of track and trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. Increasingly, pharmaceutical tracking is becoming a regulatory and public safety concern, and Laetus gives us exposure to this important vertical. And we're excited to welcome Laetus to the Danaher team. 
At Videojet, core revenues were up low single digits as strong performance in Europe and North America was somewhat offset by weakness in the high-growth markets. Results were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter. Throughout the full year, Videojet has placed a major focus on digital investments, driving key innovations in areas such as network monitoring, remote service-enabled printers and predictive maintenance. As a result, we achieved record new equipment vitality of over 40% for the year. These tremendous technology capabilities have not only solidified Videojet's leadership position in the market, they have also meaningfully improved our customers' experiences.
So to wrap up. We are pleased with our record fourth quarter results. During the quarter, the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, significantly expanded core operating margins, generated record free cash flow and announced several bolt-on acquisitions. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially oriented markets, we continue to execute well. 
Looking back, 2015 was a remarkable year for Danaher. We completed the largest acquisition in our history with Pall, announced our pending separation into 2 independent publicly traded companies with Fortive and drove excellent overall financial results. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, we believe we'll continue to deliver earnings outperformance and create long-term shareholder value in 2016 and for years to come. 
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.04, which assumes approximately flat core revenue growth. As we announced at our annual investor event in December, we continue to expect full year 2016 core revenue growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.95, which would represent a 12% to 15% increase year-on-year."

I think, Scott, we're -- what we're assuming is that what we saw with some of the slowing in December is essentially the environment that we're going to see in the near term here. It's clearly impacting our more industrial businesses more than our other businesses. So we're not immune to the slowdown. But I think we took some appropriate actions in the fourth quarter. Those actions are going to pay off here certainly from a margin standpoint. But I think the other thing to keep in mind is that the portfolio that we have today truly does differentiate us. And I think when we look at the opportunities that we have in our Life Science businesses, our Diagnostic businesses, some improvement that we're seeing here in our Dental businesses, continued good progress at GVR. While we remain cautious in some respects around the macro environment and are not assuming things get materially better there, we are playing offense in a number of areas that, I think, will bode well. So I don't think there's anything particularly optimistic in our outlook around the macro, but I think some of the things that we're doing from an investment standpoint and across our growth initiatives should continue to position a very good portfolio and a differentiated portfolio and continue to move it into an even better place."

Starting with the team that we have in place, a terrific team, both the Pall leadership team, many of whom have taken on added responsibilities. But in addition, the added resources that we put in place and the leadership that we have brought to bear in the business, I think, together, that team is off to a terrific start. We'll talk to the $0.40 and the cost opportunities that we have here in just a minute. But coming to the growth side of the house, about what we expected, continued very good progress and growth rates on the Life Science side, keeping in mind that, that business has an exceptional position in the biopharma market in Life Science. So we're seeing continued good growth there. We're also seeing outstanding growth in single-use technologies, which are a key part and a key growth driver of the biopharma segment of the Life Science business as time goes on. On the industrial side, again, what you -- what we would have expected, which is a slowing on that side of the house, we've seen that -- those businesses impacted far more than, obviously, on the more Life Science-oriented side of the house. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that, that business is also strongly skewed towards consumables. In total, the portfolio is about 70% aftermarket consumables, primarily. And so that's a strong foundation, and I think continues to give us confidence that while we'll have some segments that are challenged, the business overall will continue to perform quite well. Relative to the cost side of the house, again, off to a very good start. You heard us in December, take the 2016 number up to $100 million because we had gotten off to an earlier start. We're getting the kinds of cost reductions that you would expect us to get out of a public company in the early going. The public company costs beginning to get after some of the indirect cost leverage that we get and some of the procurement cost leverage that we get by consolidating procurement across our other businesses where appropriate. And over time, we'll see some of the benefits coming from -- on the gross margin side as we look at the operational footprint, but that will obviously take a little bit more time."

And now as that goes core to the Dental platform, we'll see some impact to that to the good. On the business that existed prior to 2015, I think, again, 2015 was a year of a lot of progress. I've mentioned a couple of times that we've had outstanding relationships with our distribution partners. We worked in a collaborative way with them on channel inventories throughout the course of the year. That was, obviously, somewhat of a painful process to go through in the sense of the impact on core growth, but net-net a very good process in terms of positioning the channel efficiently. So we are pleased that the vast majority of that's behind us. There can always be a little bit of a tail to that of stuff we're still moving out in slower moving inventories but, again I think, a ton of progress. We've also got a very good leadership team in place on our -- in our Dental platform today, with some new players in place that, I think, are doing some wonderful things in terms of driving innovation.

If you think about some of the businesses in T&M, be it Fluke and the associated acquisitions around Fluke that have been done quite a number of years ago, think about other businesses like Qualitrol, like some of the businesses in our automation and Sensors and Controls areas, those guys are using DBS, whether those are lean tools specifically in the plants or deploying those tools into -- in areas of SG&A, they are just demonstrating that those tools are still highly effective in businesses with long histories with Danaher.

Couple of big orders that had some impact there. So I think Radiometer is in as good a shape today as it's ever been, no meaningful shift in the competitive dynamics there. So we still feel very good about it. I think, if there was anything there, Shannon, and it wouldn't be unique to Radiometer, it's simply the fact that some of the growth that we have seen in the high-growth markets, while still strong in places like China and India, are still now very weak in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle East.

265621,321831219,921165,"Danaher Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter, in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging econ",2250,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter, in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially oriented markets, we continued to build our competitive advantage and drove share gains across a number of our businesses. As always, the Danaher Business System is the foundation for our team's outstanding execution. 
We also made meaningful progress toward establishing a new industrial growth company, Fortive, which will be spun out of Danaher later this year. At our year-end investor meeting, we announced Fortive's name, branding, future operating structure and additional leadership positions. We also achieved an important milestone in December, filing Fortive's Form 10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are confident that Fortive will launch with a strong foundation and will be poised for success upon completion of the separation in the third quarter of 2016. 
For the full year, our investments in organic growth initiatives helped drive solid 3% core revenue growth. With the addition of our recent acquisitions and other portfolio moves, our total annual revenues are now over $20 billion. 
From an M&A perspective, 2015 was a historic year for Danaher. Including Pall, we announced or closed 14 acquisitions for nearly $14.5 billion, expanding our capabilities across the portfolio. Looking forward, our funnels at both Danaher and Fortive are strong, and we'll continue to focus on small and midsized transactions throughout the separation process.
In 2015, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow, including over $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio in 2015 was 123%, representing the 24th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. We recognize the importance of this metric, particularly in a more challenging macro environment, as strong free cash flow is the fuel used to fund both our organic and inorganic growth initiatives. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Sales grew 12.5% to $5.9 billion, while core revenue was roughly flat. Core revenue growth, particularly for our consumables businesses, was negatively impacted by 4 fewer selling days in the quarter. In addition, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 17.5%.
In a weakening global macro environment, the Danaher Business System helped protect and expand many of our market-leading positions, driving share gains at Hach, ChemTreat, Matco, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX and Videojet. In the high-growth markets, declines in Latin America, Russia and the Middle East were more than offset by double-digit growth in India and high single-digit growth in China. Notably, annual revenues in China exceeded $2 billion for the first time, and we remain well-positioned in the most attractive sectors in the market. In the developed markets, revenues were down slightly due to incremental softness in the U.S. and Western Europe.
Gross margin for the quarter was 51.2%. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.3%, and our gross profit increased by almost $900 million. In the quarter, core operating margin increased 120 basis points, with all 5 segments improving by 60 basis points or better. Our reported operating margin was flat at 16.6%, negatively affected by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and acquisition-related transaction costs.
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.27, which represents an increase of 13.5% over last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $4.30, up 8.5% from 2014.
Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues decreased 9%, while core revenues were down 5%. Core operating margin increased 110 basis points, primarily due to new product introductions and good cost management. Core revenue in our Instruments platform decreased at a high single-digit rate, with declines across most major geographies. Fluke core revenues were down high single digits as industrial markets continued to weaken in North America, Latin America and the Middle East. In December, Fluke acquired Pacific Laser Systems, a leader in handheld laser alignment tools, to enhance its product offerings for professional contractors, electricians and general maintenance customers. 
At Tektronix, core sales declined high single digits. Declines in North America, Latin America and the Middle East more than offset growth in China that resulted from solid execution by our local sales team. The team's continued investments in innovation placed Tek in a position of technology leadership within its industry. This quarter, Tek launched the MDO4000C, a Mixed Domain Oscilloscope that combines up to 6 instruments in 1 unit. The new MDO4000C is completely customizable and upgradable, allowing engineers to start with a high-performance oscilloscope and add functionality over time as needs change or budgets allow. 
Matco, a business that will be a significant contributor to Fortive's results, delivered its third consecutive year of double-digit core growth in 2015. Even after 3 decades as part of the Danaher portfolio, Matco continues to find new ways to improve using DBS. By deploying such DBS tools as web marketing, accelerated product development and lean conversion, the team continues to expand its franchise distribution network, gain market share and expand margins.
Turning now to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 1%, with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points, and reported operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 21.8%. Water Quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, a combination of fewer selling days and slower demand from our more industrial customers in the developed markets resulted in essentially flat core growth at Hach, while ChemTreat grew slightly. Trojan had another very good quarter, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American muni market. 
Hach delivered another impressive year in 2015. In addition to mid-single digit organic growth, Hach continued its healthy cadence of bolt-on acquisitions. The team has done a terrific job implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses to help improve sales and drive innovation. One such example is BioTector, which was acquired in 2014 and had double-digit growth in the quarter. BioTector provides online total organic carbon analyzers that help our customers monitor water quality in real time and reduce waste. BioTector's early and effective application of DBS tools such as lean conversion and funnel management led to more than 200 basis points of margin expansion, significant inventory reductions and market share gains in the chemical and dairy segments. 
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew high single digits, with strength across the platform. In the U.S, point-of-sale solutions and dispensers increased over 20%, as our customers continued to upgrade their payment systems to comply with EMV security requirements. We expect EMV-related demand to continue to accelerate for the next several years. 
Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics, core revenues grew 2%, with reported revenues up 34.5%, largely due to our recent Pall, Microscan and Devicor acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis points. 
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single digits, with growth in the high-growth markets, partially offset by slight declines in developed markets. As previously mentioned, fewer selling days in the quarter negatively impact our recurring revenue streams across the platform. 
At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, led by our immunoassay and urinalysis solutions. Utilization rates in Asia remain healthy, leading to high single-digit growth across the region. 
In Europe, we celebrated our first orders with the commercial launch of our Veris molecular diagnostic system. Veris' streamlined sample-in result-out workflow, offers breakthrough ease of use in a market that is experiencing a shortage of skilled technicians. In short, it's helping our lab customers process more tests, reduce training requirements and save money. And thus far, customer feedback has been extremely positive.
Radiometer's core revenues were up slightly, a deceleration from previous quarters due to the effect of fewer selling days and a difficult comparison in Instrument sales. Geographically, we saw healthy growth in China and Japan, while Latin America and the Middle East declined. 
Leica Biosystems had a good finish to the year, delivering low single-digit core growth as strong demand across most major product lines was partially offset by the impact from fewer selling days. Notably, the team delivered a record year of placements for our BOND advanced staining instrument. 
Last December, we closed the acquisition of Devicor, a leading provider of breast biopsy devices and markers. That move Leica further upstream in the anatomical pathology workflow. Devicor continues to track well and has exceeded our expectations, posting high single-digit core growth or better in each quarter since acquisition. 
Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up low single digits with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits, with continued strength in our clinical and applied end markets. 2015 marked the fifth year since our acquisition of SCIEX. Since then, SCIEX has proven to be a remarkable example of how thoughtful application of DBS principles can drive tremendous financial results. The team has taken a business that was growing below market rates to mid- to high single-digit growth and share gains. We've seen significant improvement on the cost side as well, which has enabled SCIEX to invest those savings into higher impact growth initiatives. Progress at SCIEX continues today, and 2015 marked one of the most important product innovation years in SCIEX's history, with the launch of its X-Series mass spectrometry platform. The X-Series introduces an entirely new design, easy-to-use software and custom models for targeted application in routine food, environmental and forensic testing labs.
Leica Microsystems core revenues were essentially flat as strong performance in China and Japan was offset by declines in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.
Turning now to Dental. Segment revenues increased 17%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core revenues were up slightly. Core operating margins increased by over 500 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to consistent DBS implementation across a number of operational areas. Reported operating margins were 15.8%.
Revenues in our consumables business were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter, but our team continued to execute well and saw strong demand for several product lines throughout the year. In particular, our investments in innovation have provided us with truly differentiated technologies such as SonicFill, TF Adaptive and elementsfree, which all launched in 2014. In Dental technology, we saw our first quarter of positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2014. Top line results continued to be impacted by destocking within our U.S. distribution channels, but to a much lesser degree than in previous quarters. 
December marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Nobel Biocare. The team has quickly embraced growth, lean and leadership tools of DBS, helping to not only accelerate growth but also improve operating margins by over 300 basis points since the acquisition.
Moving to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 8.5%, while core revenues were down 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 80 basis points, and reported operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.6%. Automation core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to weakening in the industrial markets in China and North America. Despite the challenging market and revenue decline, the team continues to identify cost-savings opportunities and delivered solid core margin expansion in the quarter. 
Core revenues in our Product Identification platform were up slightly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to extend our reach into new Product ID adjacencies with the acquisition of Laetus, a leading supplier of track and trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. Increasingly, pharmaceutical tracking is becoming a regulatory and public safety concern, and Laetus gives us exposure to this important vertical. And we're excited to welcome Laetus to the Danaher team. 
At Videojet, core revenues were up low single digits as strong performance in Europe and North America was somewhat offset by weakness in the high-growth markets. Results were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter. Throughout the full year, Videojet has placed a major focus on digital investments, driving key innovations in areas such as network monitoring, remote service-enabled printers and predictive maintenance. As a result, we achieved record new equipment vitality of over 40% for the year. These tremendous technology capabilities have not only solidified Videojet's leadership position in the market, they have also meaningfully improved our customers' experiences.
So to wrap up. We are pleased with our record fourth quarter results. During the quarter, the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, significantly expanded core operating margins, generated record free cash flow and announced several bolt-on acquisitions. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially oriented markets, we continue to execute well. 
Looking back, 2015 was a remarkable year for Danaher. We completed the largest acquisition in our history with Pall, announced our pending separation into 2 independent publicly traded companies with Fortive and drove excellent overall financial results. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, we believe we'll continue to deliver earnings outperformance and create long-term shareholder value in 2016 and for years to come. 
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.04, which assumes approximately flat core revenue growth. As we announced at our annual investor event in December, we continue to expect full year 2016 core revenue growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.95, which would represent a 12% to 15% increase year-on-year."

I think, Scott, we're -- what we're assuming is that what we saw with some of the slowing in December is essentially the environment that we're going to see in the near term here. It's clearly impacting our more industrial businesses more than our other businesses. So we're not immune to the slowdown. But I think we took some appropriate actions in the fourth quarter. Those actions are going to pay off here certainly from a margin standpoint. But I think the other thing to keep in mind is that the portfolio that we have today truly does differentiate us. And I think when we look at the opportunities that we have in our Life Science businesses, our Diagnostic businesses, some improvement that we're seeing here in our Dental businesses, continued good progress at GVR. While we remain cautious in some respects around the macro environment and are not assuming things get materially better there, we are playing offense in a number of areas that, I think, will bode well. So I don't think there's anything particularly optimistic in our outlook around the macro, but I think some of the things that we're doing from an investment standpoint and across our growth initiatives should continue to position a very good portfolio and a differentiated portfolio and continue to move it into an even better place."

Starting with the team that we have in place, a terrific team, both the Pall leadership team, many of whom have taken on added responsibilities. But in addition, the added resources that we put in place and the leadership that we have brought to bear in the business, I think, together, that team is off to a terrific start. We'll talk to the $0.40 and the cost opportunities that we have here in just a minute. But coming to the growth side of the house, about what we expected, continued very good progress and growth rates on the Life Science side, keeping in mind that, that business has an exceptional position in the biopharma market in Life Science. So we're seeing continued good growth there. We're also seeing outstanding growth in single-use technologies, which are a key part and a key growth driver of the biopharma segment of the Life Science business as time goes on. On the industrial side, again, what you -- what we would have expected, which is a slowing on that side of the house, we've seen that -- those businesses impacted far more than, obviously, on the more Life Science-oriented side of the house. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that, that business is also strongly skewed towards consumables. In total, the portfolio is about 70% aftermarket consumables, primarily. And so that's a strong foundation, and I think continues to give us confidence that while we'll have some segments that are challenged, the business overall will continue to perform quite well. Relative to the cost side of the house, again, off to a very good start. You heard us in December, take the 2016 number up to $100 million because we had gotten off to an earlier start. We're getting the kinds of cost reductions that you would expect us to get out of a public company in the early going. The public company costs beginning to get after some of the indirect cost leverage that we get and some of the procurement cost leverage that we get by consolidating procurement across our other businesses where appropriate. And over time, we'll see some of the benefits coming from -- on the gross margin side as we look at the operational footprint, but that will obviously take a little bit more time."

So I think, one of the things that -- although, we don't have all the numbers right now for full transparency on what happened to channel inventories, it's a pretty good hypothesis right now based on some early data we have that would suggest that there was some inventory control that went on in the channel that certainly would have had some impact as well.

But having gone through all -- most of the business here in the first couple weeks here, the tone in Europe is still decent, and -- so it doesn't feel like the step-down that our numbers in Q4 would suggest. And we think we'll get back to sort of modest growth here pretty quickly in 2016. Watching that carefully because it probably caught us a little bit by surprise here in the fourth quarter, but again the tone still seems pretty good."

The key thing about markets like the Middle East is, particularly in the businesses like ours, you have a fairly high level of project or tender-related business, and we saw on the equipment side. And so really making sure that we understand opportunity funnels and are not overly optimistic about the timing within which funding will be released, as in many cases that funding has some governmental influence to it, is really important. It is easy to have a sales team get overly optimistic that the timing of funding release is going to be the same as it was 1 year ago or 2 years ago when the reality is, things may have slowed down and tenders may be being let at a much slower pace.

We're pleased with our results for the fourth quarter, in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially oriented markets, we continued to build our competitive advantage and drove share gains across a number of our businesses. As always, the Danaher Business System is the foundation for our team's outstanding execution. 
We also made meaningful progress toward establishing a new industrial growth company, Fortive, which will be spun out of Danaher later this year. At our year-end investor meeting, we announced Fortive's name, branding, future operating structure and additional leadership positions. We also achieved an important milestone in December, filing Fortive's Form 10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are confident that Fortive will launch with a strong foundation and will be poised for success upon completion of the separation in the third quarter of 2016. For the full year, our investments in organic growth initiatives helped drive solid 3% core revenue growth. With the addition of our recent acquisitions and other portfolio moves, our total annual revenues are now over $20 billion. 
From an M&A perspective, 2015 was a historic year for Danaher. Including Pall, we announced or closed 14 acquisitions for nearly $14.5 billion, expanding our capabilities across the portfolio. Looking forward, our funnels at both Danaher and Fortive are strong, and we'll continue to focus on small and mid-sized transactions throughout the separation process.
In 2015, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow, including over $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio in 2015 was 123%, representing the 24th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. We recognize the importance of this metric, particularly in a more challenging macro environment, as strong free cash flow is the fuel used to fund both our organic and inorganic growth initiatives. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Sales grew 12.5% to $5.9 billion, while core revenue was roughly flat. Core revenue growth, particularly for our consumables businesses, was negatively impacted by 4 fewer selling days in the quarter. In addition, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 17.5%.
In a weakening global macro environment, the Danaher Business System helped protect and expand many of our market-leading positions, driving share gains at Hach, ChemTreat, Matco, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX and Videojet. In the high growth markets, declines in Latin America, Russia and the Middle East were more than offset by double-digit growth in India and high single-digit growth in China. Notably, annual revenues in China exceeded $2 billion for the first time, and we remain well positioned in the most attractive sectors in the market. In the developed markets, revenues were down slightly due to incremental softness in the U.S. and Western Europe.
Gross margin for the quarter was 51.2%. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.3%, and our gross profit increased by almost $900 million. In the quarter, core operating margin increased 120 basis points, with all 5 segments improving by 60 basis points or better. Our reported operating margin was flat at 16.6%, negatively affected by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and acquisition related transaction costs.
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.27, which represents an increase of 13.5% over last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $4.30, up 8.5% from 2014.
Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues decreased 9%, while core revenues were down 5%. Core operating margin increased 110 basis points, primarily due to new product introductions and good cost management. Core revenue in our Instruments platform decreased at a high single-digit rate, with declines across most major geographies. Fluke core revenues were down high single digits as industrial markets continued to weaken in North America, Latin America and the Middle East. In December, Fluke acquired Pacific Laser Systems, a leader in handheld laser alignment tools, to enhance its product offerings for professional contractors, electricians and general maintenance customers. 
At Tektronix, core sales declined high single digits. Declines in North America, Latin America and the Middle East more than offset growth in China that resulted from solid execution by our local sales team. The team's continued investments in innovation placed Tek in a position of technology leadership within its industry. This quarter, Tek launched the MDO4000C, a Mixed Domain Oscilloscope that combines up to 6 instruments in 1 unit. The new MDO4000C is completely customizable and upgradable, allowing engineers to start with a high performance oscilloscope and add functionality over time as needs change or budgets allow. 
Matco, a business that will be a significant contributor to Fortive's results, delivered its third consecutive year of double-digit core growth in 2015. Even after 3 decades as part of the Danaher portfolio, Matco continues to find new ways to improve using DBS. By deploying such DBS tools as web marketing, accelerated product development and lean conversion, the team continues to expand its franchise distribution network, gain market share and expand margins.
Turning now to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 1%, with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points, and reported operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 21.8%. Water Quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, a combination of fewer selling days and slower demand from our more industrial customers in the developed markets resulted in essentially flat core growth at Hach, while ChemTreat grew slightly. Trojan had another very good quarter, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American muni market. 
Hach delivered another impressive year in 2015. In addition to mid-single-digit organic growth, Hach continued its healthy cadence of bolt-on acquisitions. The team has done a terrific job implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses to help improve sales and drive innovation. One such example is BioTector, which was acquired in 2014 and had double-digit growth in the quarter. BioTector provides online total organic carbon analyzers that help our customers monitor water quality in real time and reduce waste. BioTector's early and effective application of DBS tools such as lean conversion and funnel management led to more than 200 basis points of margin expansion, significant inventory reductions and market share gains in the chemical and dairy segments. 
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew high single digits, with strength across the platform. In the U.S., point-of-sale solutions and dispensers increased over 20% as our customers continued to upgrade their payment systems to comply with EMV security requirements. We expect EMV related demand to continue to accelerate for the next several years. 
Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics. Core revenues grew 2%, with reported revenues up 34.5%, largely due to our recent Pall, Microscan and Devicor acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis points. 
Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single digits, with growth in the high growth markets, partially offset by slight declines in developed markets. As previously mentioned, fewer selling days in the quarter negatively impact our recurring revenue streams across the platform. 
At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, led by our immunoassay and urinalysis solutions. Utilization rates in Asia remain healthy, leading to high single-digit growth across the region. 
In Europe, we celebrated our first orders with the commercial launch of our Veris molecular diagnostic system. Veris' streamlined sample-in result-out workflow offers breakthrough ease of use in a market that is experiencing a shortage of skilled technicians. In short, it's helping our lab customers process more tests, reduce training requirements and save money. And thus far, customer feedback has been extremely positive.
Radiometer's core revenues were up slightly, a deceleration from previous quarters due to the effect of fewer selling days and a difficult comparison in Instrument sales. Geographically, we saw healthy growth in China and Japan, while Latin America and the Middle East declined. 
Leica Biosystems had a good finish to the year, delivering low single-digit core growth as strong demand across most major product lines was partially offset by the impact from fewer selling days. Notably, the team delivered a record year of placements for our BOND advanced staining instrument. 
Last December, we closed the acquisition of Devicor, a leading provider of breast biopsy devices and markers that move Leica further upstream in the anatomical pathology workflow. Devicor continues to track well and has exceeded our expectations, posting high single-digit core growth or better in each quarter since acquisition. 
Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up low single digits, with growth in both developed and high growth markets. SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits, with continued strength in our clinical and applied end markets. 2015 marked the fifth year since our acquisition of SCIEX. Since then, SCIEX has proven to be a remarkable example of how thoughtful application of DBS principles can drive tremendous financial results. The team has taken a business that was growing below market rates to mid- to high single-digit growth and share gains. 
We've seen significant improvement on the cost side as well, which has enabled SCIEX to invest those savings into higher impact growth initiatives. Progress at SCIEX continues today, and 2015 marked one of the most important product innovation years in SCIEX's history, with the launch of its X-Series mass spectrometry platform. The X-Series introduces an entirely new design, easy-to-use software and custom models for targeted application in routine food, environmental and forensic testing labs.
Leica Microsystems core revenues were essentially flat as strong performance in China and Japan was offset by declines in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.
Turning now to Dental. Segment revenues increased 17%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core revenues were up slightly. Core operating margins increased by over 500 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to consistent DBS implementation across a number of operational areas. Reported operating margins were 15.8%.
Revenues in our consumables business were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter, but our team continued to execute well and saw strong demand for several product lines throughout the year. In particular, our investments in innovation have provided us with truly differentiated technologies such as SonicFill, TF Adaptive and elementsfree, which all launched in 2014. In Dental technology, we saw our first quarter of positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2014. Top line results continued to be impacted by destocking within our U.S. distribution channels, but to a much lesser degree than in previous quarters. 
December marked the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of Nobel Biocare. The team has quickly embraced growth, lean and leadership tools of DBS, helping to not only accelerate growth but also improve operating margins by over 300 basis points since the acquisition.
Moving to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 8.5%, while core revenues were down 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 80 basis points, and reported operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.6%. Automation core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to weakening in industrial markets in China and North America. Despite the challenging market and revenue decline, the team continues to identify cost savings opportunities and delivered solid core margin expansion in the quarter. 
Core revenues in our Product Identification platform were up slightly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to extend our reach into new Product ID adjacencies with the acquisition of Laetus, a leading supplier of track and trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. Increasingly, pharmaceutical tracking is becoming a regulatory and public safety concern, and Laetus gives us exposure to this important vertical. And we're excited to welcome Laetus to the Danaher team. 
At Videojet, core revenues were up low single digits as strong performance in Europe and North America was somewhat offset by weakness in the high growth markets. Results were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter. Throughout the full year, Videojet has placed a major focus on digital investments, driving key innovations in areas such as network monitoring, remote service enabled printers and predictive maintenance. As a result, we achieved record new equipment vitality of over 40% for the year. These tremendous technology capabilities have not only solidified Videojet's leadership position in the market, they have also meaningfully improved our customers' experiences.
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our record fourth quarter results. During the quarter, the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, significantly expanded core operating margins, generated record free cash flow and announced several bolt-on acquisitions. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially oriented markets, we continue to execute well. 
Looking back, 2015 was a remarkable year for Danaher. We completed the largest acquisition in our history with Pall, announced our pending separation into 2 independent publicly traded companies with Fortive and drove excellent overall financial results. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, we believe we'll continue to deliver earnings outperformance and create long-term shareholder value in 2016 and for years to come. 
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.04, which assumes approximately flat core revenue growth. As we announced at our annual investor event in December, we continue to expect full year 2016 core revenue growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.95, which would represent a 12% to 15% increase year-on-year."

I think, Scott, we're -- what we're assuming is that what we saw with some of the slowing in December is essentially the environment that we're going to see in the near term here. It's clearly impacting our more industrial businesses more than our other businesses, so we're not immune to the slowdown. But I think we took some appropriate actions in the fourth quarter. Those actions are going to pay off here certainly from a margin standpoint. But I think the other thing to keep in mind is that the portfolio that we have today truly does differentiate us. And I think when we look at the opportunities that we have in our Life Science businesses, our Diagnostic businesses, some improvement that we're seeing here in our Dental businesses, continued good progress at GVR. While we remain cautious in some respects around the macro environment and are not assuming things get materially better there, we're playing offense in a number of areas that I think will bode well. So I don't think there's anything particularly optimistic in our outlook around the macro, but I think some of the things that we're doing from an investment standpoint and across our growth initiatives should continue to position a very good portfolio and a differentiated portfolio and continue to move it into an even better place."

Starting with the team that we have in place, a terrific team, both the Pall leadership team, many of whom have taken on added responsibilities. But in addition, the added resources that we put in place and the leadership that we have brought to bear in the business. I think together that team is off to a terrific start. We'll talk to the $0.40 and the cost opportunities that we have here in just a minute. But coming to the growth side of the house, about what we expected, continued very good progress and growth rates on the Life Science side, keeping in mind that, that business has an exceptional position in the biopharma market in Life Science, so we're seeing continued good growth there. We're also seeing outstanding growth in single-use technologies, which are a key part and a key growth driver of the biopharma segment of the Life Science business as time goes on. On the industrial side, again, what you -- what we would have expected, which is a slowing on that side of the house. We've seen that -- those businesses impacted far more than, obviously, on the more Life Science oriented side of the house. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that, that business is also strongly skewed towards consumables. In total, the portfolio is about 70% aftermarket consumables primarily. And so that's a strong foundation, and I think continues to give us confidence that while we'll have some segments that are challenged, the business overall will continue to perform quite well. Relative to the cost side of the house, again, off to a very good start. You heard us in December, take the 2016 number up to $100 million because we had gotten off to an earlier start. We're getting the kinds of cost reductions that you would expect us to get out of a public company in the early going. The public company costs beginning to get after some of the indirect cost leverage that we get and some of the procurement cost leverage that we get by consolidating procurement across our other businesses where appropriate. And over time, we'll see some of the benefits coming from -- on the gross margin side as we look at the operational footprint, but that will obviously take a little bit more time."

We worked in a collaborative way with them on channel inventories throughout the course of the year.

It was a very good year of new product introductions, and I think we'll see the benefit of that as core growth improves this year. So we know we still have work to do there, but good news is that there's opportunities for value creation as we go on here."

And by the way, a couple -- 2 or 3 of those deals were Fortive related. I mentioned Pacific Laser Systems in my earlier comments, but there were a couple other smaller situations that we were able to complete during the quarter for Fortive's benefit along with a couple on the Danaher side. So I think the fourth quarter was indicative perhaps of some things opening up a bit. I think the environment is generally a favorable one for businesses like ours with a balance sheet that's ready to deploy into small and mid-size situations. And I think to your question, there are some folks who are perhaps a bit more on the sidelines right now than in previous days."

That they are getting the operating margin lifted, they're getting without the benefit of the top line dropping that through. I think it is a testament to the strength of the Danaher Business System, the tools that we use, not just in newly acquired businesses, but in businesses with long histories with Danaher that have gotten a lot done using DBS in the past and are still getting it done. If you think about some of the businesses in T&M, be it Fluke and the associated acquisitions around Fluke that have been done quite a number of years ago, think about other businesses like Qualitrol, like some of the businesses in our automation and Sensors and Controls areas, those guys are using DBS, whether those are lean tools specifically in the plants or deploying those tools into -- in areas of SG&A, they're just demonstrating that those tools are still highly effective in businesses with long histories with Danaher.

It's probably in the 80% neighborhood of consumables, so the days impact was fairly significant there. They also had a challenging comp in the fourth quarter on the Instrumentation side, a couple big orders that had some impact there. So I think Radiometer is in as good a shape today as it's ever been, no meaningful shift in the competitive dynamics there, so we still feel very good about it. I think if there was anything there, Shannon, it wouldn't be unique to Radiometer, it's simply the fact that some of the growth that we have seen in the high growth markets, while still strong in places like China and India, are still now very weak in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle East, and so even our best businesses are probably going to feel a little bit of impact there."

And so really making sure that we understand opportunity funnels and are not overly optimistic about the timing within which funding will be released, as in many cases, that funding has some governmental influence to it, is really important. It is easy to have a sales team get overly optimistic that the timing of funding release is going to be the same as it was a year ago or 2 years ago when the reality is things may have slowed down and tenders may be being let at a much slower pace.

We are pleased with our start to 2016 as our team continued to outperform in the face of uncertain and challenging economic conditions. In the quarter, we delivered high teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and free cash flow that was up over 50% year-on-year. The Danaher Business System remained the driving force behind our performance, equipping our team with the tools to strengthen our competitive position, the focus to invest in higher impact growth opportunities and the flexibility to position our businesses for long-term success. 
This will be an exciting year as we anticipate the upcoming launch of Fortive Corporation, which we expect to spin out of Danaher in the third quarter. Since our last update in January, we continue to build a highly experienced leadership team that named additional members to Fortive's Board of Directors. The team has also made great progress solidifying Fortive's financial, legal and organizational structures. This separation is a unique opportunity for Danaher and Fortive to optimize our respective portfolios and build long-term shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more information with you at our investor and analyst event in May at Gilbarco Veeder-Root.
Now turning to the details of the quarter. Adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.08, an increase of 18.5% over last year. Sales grew 15% to $5.4 billion, and core revenue increased 50 basis points as the number of our businesses were negatively impacted by tough prior-year comparisons and 1 less selling day. 
Clearly, the economic environment remains challenging in many verticals and geographies, but we were encouraged by signs of sales and order stabilization through the quarter. Our team's focus on portfolio optimization and diligent execution using DBS helped improve and sustain many of our market-leading positions. Finally, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 2%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 16.5%.
Geographically, the developed markets grew slightly with stability in the U.S. and Europe. High-growth markets were up low single digits as continued growth in India was offset by declines in Latin America and Russia. In China, our teams are well-positioned to compete in several attractive markets and delivered mid-single-digit core growth in the quarter.
Gross margin for the first quarter was 53.1%, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Along with the productivity initiatives undertaken in 2015, our gross margin expansion has enabled us to sustain and expand our growth investments in new product development and sales and marketing.
Core operating margin expanded 45 basis points, with reported operating margin at 16.4%. 
Free cash flow is one of the most important metrics at Danaher as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We had a strong quarter on this front, generating $622 million of free cash flow, a significant increase over last year.
Coming off a historic year of M&A, we closed 6 bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, deploying over $100 million in capital. These deals will strengthen our capabilities across many of our businesses. Both Danaher and Fortive have strong and active funnels, and we'll continue to focus on small and midsized transactions for both companies through the separation process.
Now let's take a look at our 5 operating segments, starting with Test & Measurement. Revenues decreased 5.5%, with core revenues down 5%. Core operating margin decreased 135 basis points, with reported operating margin coming in at 20.9%. Core revenues for our Instruments platform declined high single digits as we continue to face a challenging global market environment. All major geographies saw declines except for China and India. Fluke core revenues decreased mid-single digits due to declines in the U.S., Western Europe and Latin America, partially offset by increases in China. 
While still a difficult environment, we did see some signs of stabilization in certain geographies and industrial end markets during the quarter. A few weeks ago, Fluke announced the launch of the Fluke 279 FC thermal multimeter, the world's first test tool that integrates a full-featured digital multimeter with a thermal camera in 1 device. This combination enables technicians to check for hotspots on high-voltage equipment and analyze problems at a safe distance. By combining these important test tools into one, Fluke is helping our customers troubleshoot electrical issues more quickly, safely and thoroughly.
At Tektronix, core revenues declined low double digits as growth in China and India was more than offset by declines in all other major geographies. The Matco team continued to execute well, delivering high single-digit core growth in the quarter. Notably, Matco has posted mid-single-digit growth or better for 23 of the last 25 quarters and continues to improve its market position. In February, Matco hosted its Annual Tool Expo in Las Vegas. The expo provides Matco franchisees with an opportunity to see new products, attend training sessions and stock their businesses for the upcoming year. This year, almost 3/4 of Matco's franchisees participated, resulting in record attendance and event-driven sales.
Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 4%, with core revenues up 3.5%. Reported operating margin declined 220 basis points to 17.3%. Core operating margin declined 155 basis points and was negatively impacted by incremental investments, including EMV-related spend at Gilbarco Veeder-Root. We anticipate segment margins to return to more normalized levels in the second quarter. 
The Water Quality platform's core revenues grew slightly as 1 less selling day and a tough prior-year comparison had a negative impact. 
At Hach, positive momentum in the U.S. municipal market continued, but softness in high-growth markets resulted in flat core growth for the quarter. 
Trojan also saw strong municipal demand globally and delivered another good quarter. 
Finally, at ChemTreat, the team grew revenue slightly in the quarter despite headwinds in its industrial- and commodity-oriented markets. 
One of the ways that we continue to augment growth, build our capabilities and better serve our customers is through M&A. Our Water Quality platform has acquired more than 40 businesses since 1996 and continued its healthy cadence of bolt-on this quarter, with the Hach's acquisition of Loopmess [ph] in January. Loop's long-standing precision centers, long-lasting precision centers are a key part of weather-measuring networks along roads, railways and airports and enable us to deliver value to a wider range of customers around the world. The Hach team does an exceptional job of implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses, and this is well underway already at Loop. DBS lean and growth tools are helping us drive more efficient production, strengthen key account relationships and improve funnel management.
At Gilbarco Veeder-Root, core revenue grew high single digits for the third consecutive quarter. EMV-related demand in the U.S. drove double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispenser systems, and we believe we continue to gain share on both fronts. Many of our customers are still in the process of upgrading indoor payment systems for last October's credit card liability shift. Additionally, we are well-positioned to benefit from the upcoming outdoor liability shift, and the Gilbarco team is already collaborating with a number of customers to phase in outdoor upgrades. You'll hear more about EMV and GVR's other opportunities at our investor and analyst event next month.
Moving now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Core revenues grew 2.5%, with reported revenues up 42%, largely due to our recent Pall and Microscan acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 205 basis points, thanks to the team's solid execution using DBS. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single digits, led by healthy demand in high-growth markets. At Beckman Coulter, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. We saw strong demand for our immunoassay solutions and use our well-established installed base to help drive increased sales in India and China. Our consumable streams remain solid, and we're seeing healthy utilization rates globally. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems both increased core revenues in the quarter, with growth in China and India offset by declines in other high-growth markets. 
Our team is focused on improving our customers' experience every day and shows that commitment by expanding our product offering through both innovation and adjacent bolt-on acquisitions. Beckman Coulter's first major bolt-on, IRIS, closed in 2012 and extended our footprint beyond blood testing in the urinalysis. Since then, IRIS has delivered double-digit growth and expanded operating margins over 1,000 basis points. More recently, the acquisition of Microscan expanded Beckman's already strong presence in hospital and reference labs into the microbiology space. It has been 1 year since we closed the deal, and we achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Both IRIS and Microscan are helping us serve our customers better, and we believe that adjacent acquisitions, combined with our consistent application of DBS, will continue to enhance our comprehensive workflow solutions across our diagnostic businesses. 
In our Life Science platform, core revenue was up low single digits, with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. Leica Microsystems core revenues were up low single digits as strong performance in North America and China was offset by declines in Japan and Latin America.
At SCIEX, core revenues grew low single digits, driven by demand in China and the Middle East. We also saw healthy sales growth in certain applied end markets and our service business. The SCIEX team has placed a strong focus on improving our customer's experience by pairing service contracts with instrument sales. This has driven record contract capture rates, including over 500 basis points of improvement in year-over-year attachment rates in the first quarter alone. 
SCIEX is a great example of how we use new products to help our customers' most critical challenges. In the quarter, we launched the x500R, the first model within our X-Series product family, which was the SCIEX team's largest ever development project. The x500R is a robust instrument that was specifically designed to serve customers in food and environmental testing labs to the fastest growing end markets in mass spectrometry. Going forward, we expect this to be a significant contributor to our future growth.
Turning to Pall. We are very pleased with our early progress. This quarter, the Pall team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by double-digit growth in our Life Science business due to demand for our biopharmaceutical solutions, including single-use technologies. Our Industrial business was down low single digits as we face challenging market conditions. The team's enthusiastic application of DBS, including over 100 kaizen events since closed, has led to meaningful process improvements and several new product introduction across Pall's Life Sciences and Industrial businesses. As a result of our growth and productivity initiatives, year-on-year operating margins were up over 250 basis points. 
As we move on to Dental, core revenues increased by 0.5% due to strong demand for consumables and implants in North America and the high-growth markets as well as healthy orthodontic sales in China. These gains were negatively impacted by 1 less selling day.  Over the last several quarters, the Dental team's focus on execution and a disciplined spending has paid off in margin expansion. This quarter, the team grew core operating margins by 250 basis points and reported operating margins by over 500 basis points to 14.5%. Our continued investments in innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated product offerings for our Dental customers. At the Chicago Midwinter Dental Show in February, we launched over 15 [ph] new products, including [indiscernible], a revolutionary new cement for dental restoration that changes color to indicate the correct time for a dentist to remove any excess material. The first-in-class color indicator simplifies the dentist's procedure and reduces clinical risk.
At Nobel Biocare, the team drove mid-single-digit average daily sales of implant systems this quarter. Since the acquisition closed, Nobel has achieved over 400 basis points of operating margin improvement and is focused on reinvesting those savings into future growth opportunities.
Moving now to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 1.5%, while core revenues were also down 1.5%. Despite the revenue decline, core operating margin expanded 25 basis points, while reported operating margin declined 30 basis points to 24.3%. The Automation platform's core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to the weakness in global industrial markets and a difficult prior-year comparison. While we expect this dynamic to largely persist in the near term, we were encouraged by signs of stabilization in the quarter. 
Product Identification core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate as increased demand for marking and coding [ph] was offset by softer demand for the businesses packaging and color solutions. 
Videojet's core revenues increased mid-single digits, driven by what we believe to be continuing share gains in North America and Europe, while high-growth markets remain softer. The Videojet team has delivered mid-single-digit growth or better for 9 of the past 10 quarters.
Last quarter, we announced the acquisition of Laetus [ph] which extends our Product ID offerings into track and trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. We're off to a good start with Laetus. The team's early adoption of DBS tools is already driving key process improvements as quicker service deployment and improved on-time delivery are ensuring that our customers receive the best possible support.
So to wrap up, our team executed well in the face of challenging economic conditions, and we are pleased with our start to 2016. The Danaher Business System remained the driving force behind our performance this quarter, helping to deliver high teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and 50% year-on-year free cash flow growth. We are also off to a great start at Pall, where the team drove meaningful process improvements and delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to make progress preparing for the launch of Fortive Corporation, which remains on track to close in the third quarter. Our teams are excited about the unique opportunity to continue developing 2 separate portfolios of market-leading businesses that we believe will create shareholder value for years to come.
We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.19 and $1.23, which assumes approximately 2% core revenue growth. We are increasing our full-year adjusted EPS guidance from $4.80 to $4.95 to $4.85 to $4.98, which would represent a 13% to 16% increase from 2015 adjusted EPS."

China, unquestionably, remains a very good market for us despite much of the headlines that certainly suggest that there's slowing in various areas. We're very pleased with the performance in China. And I think it was relatively broad based. If you looked at Danaher versus Fortive, let's say, Danaher was up high single digits in China and Fortive was up mid-single digits in China. So I think a number of good examples where China remains a very attractive market for us. Relative to your specific question on Fluke, Fluke is just an exceptional business overall. We've had -- it's probably one of our most advanced businesses in terms of both go-to market as well as local production and product development in China. And while there's clearly still some softness around various industrial segments in the Chinese market, Fluke is a very strong brand in that market and has very strong share position. So I think we're encouraged by some of the stabilization we see in some of the markets. And in other of those markets, we just continue to see very strong growth. Our Dental business continues to perform exceptionally well in China. Life Sciences & Diagnostics broadly continuing to perform well there. So again, while clearly the headlines would show that, that market has pulled back a little bit in the aggregate, it's still a very good place to be."

In addition to this, we are getting favorable mix giving the Life Science business is more profitable, and we really saw that play out exceedingly well in the first quarter.

I think we've mentioned this maybe once before, but if you think back to the playbook that we ran post the Beckman acquisition, I think the playbook here at Pall is very similar, which is, there's a number of opportunities to get cost out of the business broadly defined and we are working on those obviously, start to see the margins coming up. But the playbook is to then redeploy some of that cost takeout into investments in sales and marketing and R&D. You see us do that broadly across Danaher with gross margins going up and sales and marketing and R&D on the quarter for the Danaher in total, up 30 basis points. We did that at Beckman, R&D lifted over time, we started to get the innovation engine going. Innovation at Pall has always been a strong suit there, but we think we can take it up another level. So some of those cost takeouts will ultimately translate into either higher spending or potentially more efficient spending as we find opportunities to do a better job innovating at the same cost rate.

The reference to investment spend is specific to what we need to do to build the capacity to step up to the demand associated with EMV. And so we see that specifically in our GVR business. And those are investments that clearly will pay off as we continue to ramp our capabilities. And as we go into the second quarter and beyond, we would expect those margins overall in the segment to return closer to normal levels. Obviously, some continued investment there, but we expect Water Quality to come up a bit. So overall, I think there were just a couple of unique factors here in the first quarter."

They set their sights on specific margin improvements over time. There was some outstanding execution, some disciplined cost control. But similar to the comments I made earlier around the playbook, I made reference to the Beckman playbook and how that applies to Pall, while we'll continue to drive margin improvement at Dental, one of the team's leadership, we'll also take some of that improvement and continue to invest in sales and marketing and in R&D because we do have opportunities for improvement in terms of our innovation cadence. You saw some modest improvement there in our core growth and the platform during the quarter. But we know there's opportunities to continue to improve that. We expect it to continue to step up.

So we really look at it sort of operating company by operating company. Our track record is a great one, and it will continue of taking R&D up year-on-year pretty consistently. We've used our operating margin expansion, that's been driven by improvements in gross margin, to put some of that back into not only R&D, but into sales and marketing as well.

And the combination of the solutions that they've had for a number of years along with the newer products and single-use technologies, continue to drive the exceptional growth that we see there. That growth, as I think many of you know, Ross, and others know, is really driven by this move, the growth and the transition from small molecule drugs to large molecule drugs.

We have good transparency with our distribution partners and we are encouraged by that. The Nobel implant systems business, mid-single-digit average daily sales growth in the quarter, we are pleased with that. The Armco business, the orthodontic business continues to do well and we are continuing to see on a geographic basis, as I mentioned, a couple of the high-growth markets, specifically our business in China, continuing to do well.

We're pleased with our start to 2016, as our team continued to outperform in the face of uncertain and challenging economic conditions. In the quarter, we delivered high teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and free cash flow that was up over 50% year-on-year. The Danaher Business System remained the driving force behind our performance, equipping our team with the tools to strengthen our competitive position, the focus to invest in high-impact growth opportunities and the flexibility to position our businesses for long-term success. 
This will be an exciting year as we anticipate the upcoming launch of Fortive Corporation, which we expect to spin out of Danaher in the third quarter. Since our last update in January, we continue to build a highly experienced leadership team that named additional members to Fortive's Board of Directors. The team has also made great progress solidifying Fortive's financial, legal and organizational structures. This separation is a unique opportunity for Danaher and Fortive to optimize our respective portfolios and build long-term shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more information with you at our investor and analyst event in May at Gilbarco Veeder-Root.
Now turning to the details of the quarter. Adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.08, an increase of 18.5% over last year. Sales grew 15% to $5.4 billion, and core revenue increased 50 basis points, as the number of our businesses were negatively impacted by tough prior year comparisons and 1 less selling day. 
Clearly, the economic environment remains challenging in many verticals and geographies, but we were encouraged by signs of sales and order stabilization through the quarter. Our team's focus on portfolio optimization and diligent execution using DBS helped improve and sustain many of our market-leading positions. Finally, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 2%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 16.5%.
Geographically, the developed markets grew slightly, with stability in the U.S. and Europe. High-growth markets were up low single digits, as continued growth in India was offset by declines in Latin America and Russia. In China, our teams are well positioned to compete in several attractive markets and delivered mid-single-digit core growth in the quarter.
Gross margin for the first quarter was 53.1%, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Along with the productivity initiatives undertaken in 2015, our gross margin expansion has enabled us to sustain and expand our growth investments in new product development and sales and marketing.
Core operating margin expanded 45 basis points, with reported operating margin at 16.4%. 
Free cash flow is one of the most important metrics at Danaher, as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We had a strong quarter on this front, generated -- generating $622 million of free cash flow, a significant increase over last year.
Coming off a historic year of M&A, we closed 6 bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, deploying over $100 million in capital. These deals will strengthen our capabilities across many of our businesses. Both Danaher and Fortive have strong and active funnels, and we'll continue to focus on small and midsize transactions for both companies through the separation process.
Now let's take a look at our 5 operating segments, starting with Test & Measurement. Revenues decreased 5.5%, with core revenues down 5%. Core operating margin decreased 135 basis points, with reported operating margin coming in at 20.9%. Core revenues for our Instruments platform declined high single digits as we continue to face a challenging global market environment. All major geographies saw declines, except for China and India. Fluke core revenues decreased mid-single digits due to declines in the U.S., Western Europe and Latin America, partially offset by increases in China. 
While still a difficult environment, we did see some signs of stabilization in certain geographies and industrial end markets during the quarter. A few weeks ago, Fluke announced the launch of the Fluke 279 FC Thermal Multimeter, the world's first test tool that integrates a full-featured digital multimeter with a thermal camera in one device. This combination enables technicians to check for hotspots on high-voltage equipment and analyze problems at a safe distance. By combining these important test tools into one, Fluke is helping our customers troubleshoot electrical issues more quickly, safely and thoroughly.
At Tektronix, core revenues declined low double digits, as growth in China and India was more than offset by declines in all other major geographies. 
The Matco team continued to execute well, delivering high single-digit core growth in the quarter. Notably, Matco has posted mid-single-digit growth or better for 23 of the last 25 quarters and continues to improve its market position. In February, Matco hosted its annual tool expo in Las Vegas. The expo provides Matco franchisees with an opportunity to see new products, attend training sessions and stock their businesses for the upcoming year. This year, almost 3/4 of Matco's franchisees participated, resulting in record attendance and event-driven sales.
Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 4%, with core revenues up 3.5%. Reported operating margin declined 220 basis points to 17.3%. Core operating margin declined 155 basis points and was negatively impacted by incremental investments, including EMV-related spend at Gilbarco Veeder-Root. We anticipate segment margins to return to more normalized levels in the second quarter. 
The Water Quality platform's core revenues grew slightly, as 1 less selling day and a tough prior year comparison had a negative impact. 
At Hach, positive momentum in the U.S. municipal market continued, but softness in high-growth markets resulted in flat core growth for the quarter. 
Trojan also saw strong municipal demand globally and delivered another good quarter. 
Finally, at ChemTreat, the team grew revenue slightly in the quarter despite headwinds in its industrial- and commodity-oriented markets. 
One of the ways that we continue to augment growth, build our capabilities and better serve our customers is through M&A. Our Water Quality platform has acquired more than 40 businesses since 1996 and continued its healthy cadence of bolt-ons this quarter, with Hach's acquisition of Lufft Mess in January. Lufft's long-standing precision centers -- long-lasting precision centers are a key part of weather-measuring networks along roads, railways and airports and enable us to deliver value to a wider range of customers around the world. The Hach team does an exceptional job of implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses, and this is well underway already at Lufft. DBS lean and growth tools are helping us drive more efficient production, strengthen key account relationships and improve funnel management.
At Gilbarco Veeder-Root, core revenue grew high single digits for the third consecutive quarter. EMV-related demand in the U.S. drove double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispenser systems, and we believe we continue to gain share on both fronts. Many of our customers are still in the process of upgrading indoor payment systems for last October's credit card liability shift. Additionally, we're well positioned to benefit from the upcoming outdoor liability shift, and the Gilbarco team is already collaborating with a number of customers to phase in outdoor upgrades. You'll hear more about EMV and GVR's other opportunities at our investor and analyst event next month.
Moving now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Core revenues grew 2.5%, with reported revenues up 42%, largely due to our recent Pall and Microscan acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 205 basis points, thanks to the team's solid execution using DBS. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single digits, led by healthy demand in high-growth markets. 
At Beckman Coulter, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. We saw strong demand for our immunoassay solutions and used our well-established installed base to help drive increased sales in India and China. 
Our consumable streams remain solid, and we're seeing healthy utilization rates globally. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems both increased core revenues in the quarter, with growth in China and India offset by declines in other high-growth markets. 
Our team is focused on improving our customers' experience every day and shows that commitment by expanding our product offering through both innovation and adjacent bolt-on acquisitions. Beckman Coulter's first major bolt-on, Iris, closed in 2012 and extended our footprint beyond blood testing in the urinalysis. Since then, Iris has delivered double-digit growth and expanded operating margins over 1,000 basis points. More recently, the acquisition of Microscan expanded Beckman's already strong presence in hospital and reference labs into the microbiology space. It has been 1 year since we closed the deal, and we achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Both Iris and Microscan are helping us serve our customers better, and we believe that adjacent acquisitions, combined with our consistent application of DBS, will continue to enhance our comprehensive workflow solutions across our diagnostic businesses. 
In our Life Science platform, core revenue was up low single digits, with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. Leica Microsystems core revenues were up low single digits, as strong performance in North America and China was offset by declines in Japan and Latin America.
At SCIEX, core revenues grew low single digits, driven by demand in China and the Middle East. We also saw healthy sales growth in certain applied end markets and our service business. The SCIEX team has placed a strong focus on improving our customers' experience by pairing service contracts with instrument sales. This has driven record contract capture rates, including over 500 basis points of improvement in year-over-year attachment rates in the first quarter alone. 
SCIEX is a great example of how we use new products to help our customers' most critical challenges. In the quarter, we launched the x500R, the first model within our X-Series product family, which was the SCIEX team's largest ever development project. The x500R is a robust instrument that was specifically designed to serve customers in food and environmental testing labs, 2 of the fastest-growing end markets in mass spectrometry. Going forward, we expect this to be a significant contributor to our future growth.
Turning to Pall. We are very pleased with our early progress. This quarter, the Pall team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth led by double-digit growth in our Life Science business due to demand for our biopharmaceutical solutions, including single-use technologies. Our Industrial business was down low single digits as we faced challenging market conditions. The team's enthusiastic application of DBS, including over 100 kaizen events since close, has led to meaningful process improvements and several new product introduction across Pall's Life Sciences and Industrial businesses. As a result of our growth and productivity initiatives, year-on-year operating margins were up over 250 basis points. 
As we move on to Dental, core revenues increased by 0.5% due to strong demand for consumables and implants in North America and the high-growth markets as well as healthy orthodontic sales in China. These gains were negatively impacted by 1 less selling day. Over the last several quarters, the Dental team's focus on execution and disciplined spending has paid off in margin expansion. This quarter, the team grew core operating margins by 250 basis points and reported operating margins by over 500 basis points to 14.5%. Our continued investments in innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated product offerings for our Dental customers. At the Chicago Midwinter Dental Show in February, we launched over 15 new products, including Maxcem Elite Chroma, a revolutionary new cement for dental restoration that changes color to indicate the correct time for a dentist to remove any excess material. The first-in-class color indicator simplifies the dentist's procedure and reduces clinical risk.
At Nobel Biocare, the team drove mid-single-digit average daily sales of implant systems this quarter. Since the acquisition closed, Nobel has achieved over 400 basis points of operating margin improvement and is focused on reinvesting those savings into future growth opportunities.
Moving now to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 1.5%, while core revenues were also down 1.5%. Despite the revenue decline, core operating margin expanded 25 basis points, while reported operating margin declined 30 basis points to 24.3%. The Automation platform's core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to the weakness in global industrial markets and a difficult prior year comparison. While we expect this dynamic to largely persist in the near term, we were encouraged by signs of stabilization in the quarter. 
Product Identification core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate, as increased demand for marking and coding was offset by softer demand for the businesses packaging and color solutions. 
Videojet's core revenues increased mid-single digits, driven by what we believe to be continuing share gains in North America and Europe, while high-growth markets remain softer. The Videojet team has delivered mid-single-digit growth or better for 9 of the past 10 quarters.
Last quarter, we announced the acquisition of Laetus, which extends our Product ID offerings into track and trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. We're off to a good start with Laetus. The team's early adoption of DBS tools is already driving key process improvements, as quicker service deployment and improved on-time delivery are ensuring that our customers receive the best possible support.
So to wrap up, our team executed well in the face of challenging economic conditions, and we're pleased with our start to 2016. The Danaher Business System remained the driving force behind our performance this quarter, helping to deliver high teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and 50% year-on-year free cash flow growth. We're also off to a great start at Pall, where the team drove meaningful process improvements and delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to make progress preparing for the launch of Fortive Corporation, which remains on track to close in the third quarter. Our teams are excited about the unique opportunity to continue developing 2 separate portfolios of market-leading businesses that we believe will create shareholder value for years to come.
We're initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.19 and $1.23, which assumes approximately 2% core revenue growth. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $4.80 to $4.95 to $4.85 to $4.98, which would represent a 13% to 16% increase from 2015 adjusted EPS."

China, unquestionably, is -- remains a very good market for us. Despite much of the headlines that would certainly suggest that they're slowing in various areas, we were very pleased with the performance in China. And I think it was relatively broad based. If you looked at Danaher versus Fortive, let's say, Danaher was up high single digits in China, and Fortive was up mid-single digits in China. So I think a number of good examples where China remains a very attractive market for us. Relative to your specific question on Fluke, Fluke is just -- is an exceptional business overall. We've had a -- it's probably one of our most advanced businesses in terms of both go-to market as well as local production and product development in China. And while there's clearly still some softness around various industrial segments in the Chinese market, Fluke is a very strong brand in that market and has a very strong share position. So I think we're encouraged by some of the stabilization we see in some of the markets. And in other of those markets, we just continue to see very strong growth.

We talked about north of $100 million of benefit here this year on the margin side, continue to track very well to the ultimate target of $300 million. In addition to this, we are getting favorable mix, given the Life Science business is more profitable, and we really saw that play out exceedingly well in the first quarter.

But the playbook is to then redeploy some of that cost takeout into investments in sales and marketing and R&D. You see us do that broadly across Danaher with gross margins going up and sales and marketing and R&D on the quarter for the Danaher in total up 30 basis points. We did that at Pall -- at Beckman. R&D lifted over time. We started to get the innovation engine going. Innovation at Pall has always been a strong suit there, but we think we can take it up another level. And so some of those cost takeouts will ultimately translate into either higher spending or potentially more efficient spending as we find opportunities to do a better job innovating at the same cost rate. We'll see."

And while we wouldn't call it an upward trajectory, we would call those a bit more stable than we had seen in the trajectory of the fourth quarter and maybe at the very opening of the year. You mentioned Tektronix. I wouldn't necessarily put Tektronix quite in that category yet. It had one of the more challenging quarters. It's in one of the tougher markets probably that we face today.

No, absolutely right. Yes, thanks, Nigel. That's -- you're right on. If you look at Environmental, which, as all of you know, both has our GVR business as well as our Water Quality businesses, GVR had stronger growth during the course of the quarter, very encouraging signs of the EMV dynamic taking hold. And GVR comes through that with a lower margin mix relative to our Water Quality platform, which has higher margins and specifically, Hach. So a little bit softer Hach business, a little bit stronger GVR business during the course of the quarter together causes some of that headwind that you saw on the margin line there. The reference to investment spend is specific to what we need to do to build the capacity to step up to the demand associated with EMV. And so we see that in -- specifically in our GVR business. And those are investments that clearly will pay off as we continue to ramp our capabilities. And as we go into the second quarter and beyond, we would expect those margins overall in the segment to return closer to normal levels. Obviously, some continued investment there, but we expect Water Quality to come up a bit. So overall, I think there were just a couple of unique factors here in the first quarter."

Yes, no question, the pharma market is an important driver of our growth across the Life Science portfolio. And we have exposure to that growing market across virtually every one of our Life Science businesses. Pall, specific to your question around biotech and small and midsize, continues to perform exceptionally well across the biotech market. Just to go back and talk about a few things about what's going on in that market, Pall has a $1 billion business today that's oriented toward biopharmaceuticals. And the combination of the solutions that they've had for a number of years, along with the newer products and single-use technologies, continue to drive the exceptional growth that we see there. That growth, as I think many of you know, Ross, and others know, is really driven by this move, the growth and the transition from small molecule drugs to large molecule drugs. And not only are those the fastest-growing segment of the market, but they're also the drugs that are most significantly represented in the pipelines of both small as well as large pharmaceutical companies today. So we remain optimistic and bullish on that market. And I think there's every reason to believe that we'll continue to see good growth not only from Pall, but from our other Life Science business that have exposure to that market."

We're pleased with our start to 2016, as our team continued to outperform in the face of uncertain and challenging economic conditions. In the quarter, we delivered high teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and free cash flow that was up over 50% year-on-year. The Danaher Business System remains the driving force behind our performance, equipping our team with the tools to strengthen our competitive position, the focus to invest in high-impact growth opportunities and the flexibility to position our businesses for long-term success. 
 
 This will be an exciting year as we anticipate the upcoming launch of Fortive Corporation, which we expect to spin out of Danaher in the third quarter. Since our last update in January, we've continued to build a highly experienced leadership team that named additional members to Fortive's Board of Directors. The team has also made great progress solidifying Fortive's financial, legal and organizational structures. This separation is a unique opportunity for Danaher and Fortive to optimize our respective portfolios and build long-term shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more information with you at our investor and analyst event in May at Gilbarco Veeder-Root.
 
 Now turning to the details of the quarter. Adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.08, an increase of 18.5% over last year. Sales grew 15% to $5.4 billion, and core revenue increased 50 basis points, as a number of our businesses were negatively impacted by tough prior year comparisons and 1 less selling day. 
 
 Clearly, the economic environment remains challenging in many verticals and geographies, but we were encouraged by signs of sales and order stabilization through the quarter. Our team's focus on portfolio optimization and diligent execution using DBS helped improve and sustain many of our market-leading positions. Finally, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 2%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 16.5%.
 
 Geographically, the developed markets grew slightly, with stability in the U.S. and Europe. High-growth markets were up low single digits, as continued growth in India was offset by declines in Latin America and Russia. In China, our teams are well positioned to compete in several attractive markets and delivered mid-single-digit core growth in the quarter.
 
 Gross margin for the first quarter was 53.1%, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Along with the productivity initiatives undertaken in 2015, our gross margin expansion has enabled us to sustain and expand our growth investments in new product development and sales and marketing.
 
 Core operating margin expanded 45 basis points, with reported operating margin at 16.4%. 
 
 Free cash flow is one of the most important metrics at Danaher, as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We had a strong quarter on this front, generated -- generating $622 million of free cash flow, a significant increase over last year.
 
 Coming off a historic year of M&A, we closed 6 bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, deploying over $100 million in capital. These deals will strengthen our capabilities across many of our businesses. Both Danaher and Fortive have strong and active funnels, and we'll continue to focus on small and midsize transactions for both companies through the separation process.
 
 Now let's take a look at our 5 operating segments, starting with Test & Measurement. Revenues decreased 5.5%, with core revenues down 5%. Core operating margin decreased 135 basis points, with reported operating margin coming in at 20.9%. Core revenues for our Instruments platform declined high single digits as we continue to face a challenging global market environment. All major geographies saw declines, except for China and India. Fluke core revenues decreased mid-single digits due to declines in the U.S., Western Europe and Latin America, partially offset by increases in China. 
 
 While still a difficult environment, we did see some signs of stabilization in certain geographies and industrial end markets during the quarter. A few weeks ago, Fluke announced the launch of the Fluke 279 FC Thermal Multimeter, the world's first test tool that integrates a full-featured digital multimeter with a thermal camera in one device. This combination enables technicians to check for hotspots on high-voltage equipment and analyze problems at a safe distance. By combining these important test tools into one, Fluke is helping our customers troubleshoot electrical issues more quickly, safely and thoroughly.
 
 At Tektronix, core revenues declined low double digits, as growth in China and India was more than offset by declines in all other major geographies. 
 
 The Matco team continued to execute well, delivering high single-digit core growth in the quarter. Notably, Matco has posted mid-single-digit growth or better for 23 of the last 25 quarters and continues to improve its market position. In February, Matco hosted its annual tool expo in Las Vegas. The expo provides Matco franchisees with an opportunity to see new products, attend training sessions and stock their businesses for the upcoming year. This year, almost 3/4 of Matco's franchisees participated, resulting in record attendance and event-driven sales.
 
 Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 4%, with core revenues up 3.5%. Reported operating margin declined 220 basis points to 17.3%. Core operating margin declined 155 basis points and was negatively impacted by incremental investments, including EMV-related spend at Gilbarco Veeder-Root. We anticipate segment margins to return to more normalized levels in the second quarter. 
 
 The Water Quality platform's core revenues grew slightly, as 1 less selling day and a tough prior year comparison had a negative impact. 
 
 At Hach, positive momentum in the U.S. municipal market continued, but softness in high-growth markets resulted in flat core growth for the quarter. 
 
 Trojan also saw strong municipal demand globally and delivered another good quarter. 
 
 Finally, at ChemTreat, the team grew revenue slightly in the quarter despite headwinds in its industrial- and commodity-oriented markets. 
 
 One of the ways that we continue to augment growth, build our capabilities and better serve our customers is through M&A. Our Water Quality platform has acquired more than 40 businesses since 1996 and continued its healthy cadence of bolt-ons this quarter, with Hach's acquisition of Lufft Mess in January. Lufft's long-standing precision sensors -- long-lasting precision sensors are a key part of weather-measuring networks along roads, railways and airports and enable us to deliver value to a wider range of customers around the world. The Hach team does an exceptional job of implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses, and this is well underway already at Lufft. DBS lean and growth tools are helping us drive more efficient production, strengthen key account relationships and improve funnel management.
 
 At Gilbarco Veeder-Root, core revenue grew high single digits for the third consecutive quarter. EMV-related demand in the U.S. drove double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispenser systems, and we believe we continue to gain share on both fronts. Many of our customers are still in the process of upgrading indoor payment systems for last October's credit card liability shift. Additionally, we're well positioned to benefit from the upcoming outdoor liability shift, and the Gilbarco team is already collaborating with a number of customers to phase in outdoor upgrades. You'll hear more about EMV and GVR's other opportunities at our investor and analyst event next month.
 
 Moving now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Core revenues grew 2.5%, with reported revenues up 42%, largely due to our recent Pall and Microscan acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 205 basis points, thanks to the team's solid execution using DBS. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single digits, led by healthy demand in high-growth markets. 
 
 At Beckman Coulter, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. We saw strong demand for our immunoassay solutions and used our well-established installed base to help drive increased sales in India and China. 
 
 Our consumable streams remain solid, and we're seeing healthy utilization rates globally. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems both increased core revenues in the quarter, with growth in China and India offset by declines in other high-growth markets. 
 
 Our team is focused on improving our customers' experience every day and shows that commitment by expanding our product offering through both innovation and adjacent bolt-on acquisitions. Beckman Coulter's first major bolt-on, Iris, closed in 2012 and extended our footprint beyond blood testing into urinalysis. Since then, Iris has delivered double-digit growth and expanded operating margins over 1,000 basis points. More recently, the acquisition of Microscan expanded Beckman's already strong presence in hospital and reference labs into the microbiology space. It has been 1 year since we closed the deal, and we achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Both Iris and Microscan are helping us serve our customers better, and we believe that adjacent acquisitions, combined with our consistent application of DBS, will continue to enhance our comprehensive workflow solutions across our diagnostic businesses. 
 
 In our Life Science platform, core revenue was up low single digits, with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. Leica Microsystems core revenues were up low single digits, as strong performance in North America and China was offset by declines in Japan and Latin America.
 
 At SCIEX, core revenues grew low single digits, driven by demand in China and the Middle East. We also saw healthy sales growth in certain applied end markets and our service business. The SCIEX team has placed a strong focus on improving our customers' experience by pairing service contracts with instrument sales. This has driven record contract capture rates, including over 500 basis points of improvement in year-over-year attachment rates in the first quarter alone. 
 
 SCIEX is a great example of how we use new products to help our customers' most critical challenges. In the quarter, we launched the x500R, the first model within our X-Series product family, which was the SCIEX team's largest ever development project. The x500R is a robust instrument that was specifically designed to serve customers in food and environmental testing labs, 2 of the fastest-growing end markets in mass spectrometry. Going forward, we expect this to be a significant contributor to our future growth.
 
 Turning to Pall. We are very pleased with our early progress. This quarter, the Pall team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by double-digit growth in our Life Science business due to demand for our biopharmaceutical solutions, including single-use technologies. Our Industrial business was down low single digits as we faced challenging market conditions. The team's enthusiastic application of DBS, including over 100 kaizen events since close, has led to meaningful process improvements and several new product introductions across Pall's Life Sciences and Industrial businesses. As a result of our growth and productivity initiatives, year-on-year operating margins were up over 250 basis points. 
 
 As we move on to Dental, core revenues increased by 0.5% due to strong demand for consumables and implants in North America and the high-growth markets as well as healthy orthodontic sales in China. These gains were negatively impacted by 1 less selling day. Over the last several quarters, the Dental team's focus on execution and disciplined spending has paid off in margin expansion. This quarter, the team grew core operating margins by 250 basis points and reported operating margins by over 500 basis points to 14.5%. Our continued investments in innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated product offerings for our Dental customers. At the Chicago Midwinter Dental Show in February, we launched over 15 new products, including Maxcem Elite Chroma, a revolutionary new cement for dental restoration that changes color to indicate the correct time for a dentist to remove any excess material. The first-in-class color indicator simplifies the dentist's procedure and reduces clinical risk.
 
 At Nobel Biocare, the team drove mid-single-digit average daily sales of implant systems this quarter. Since the acquisition closed, Nobel has achieved over 400 basis points of operating margin improvement and is focused on reinvesting those savings into future growth opportunities.
 
 Moving now to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 1.5%, while core revenues were also down 1.5%. Despite the revenue decline, core operating margin expanded 25 basis points, while reported operating margin declined 30 basis points to 24.3%. The Automation platform's core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to the weakness in global industrial markets and a difficult prior year comparison. While we expect this dynamic to largely persist in the near term, we were encouraged by signs of stabilization in the quarter. 
 
 Product Identification core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate, as increased demand for marking and coding was offset by softer demand for the business's packaging and color solutions. 
 
 Videojet's core revenues increased mid-single digits, driven by what we believe to be continuing share gains in North America and Europe, while high-growth markets remain softer. The Videojet team has delivered mid-single-digit growth or better for 9 of the past 10 quarters.
 
 Last quarter, we announced the acquisition of Laetus, which extends our Product ID offerings into track-and-trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. We're off to a good start with Laetus. The team's early adoption of DBS tools is already driving key process improvements, as quicker service deployment and improved on-time delivery are ensuring that our customers receive the best possible support.
 
 So to wrap up, our team executed well in the face of challenging economic conditions, and we're pleased with our start to 2016. The Danaher Business System remained the driving force behind our performance this quarter, helping to deliver high teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and 50% year-on-year free cash flow growth. We're also off to a great start at Pall, where the team drove meaningful process improvements and delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to make progress preparing for the launch of Fortive Corporation, which remains on track to close in the third quarter. Our teams are excited about the unique opportunity to continue developing 2 separate portfolios of market-leading businesses that we believe will create shareholder value for years to come.
 
 We're initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.19 and $1.23, which assumes approximately 2% core revenue growth. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $4.80 to $4.95, to $4.85 to $4.98, which would represent a 13% to 16% increase from 2015 adjusted EPS."

China, unquestionably, is -- remains a very good market for us. Despite much of the headlines that would certainly suggest that they're slowing in various areas, we were very pleased with the performance in China. And I think it was relatively broad based. If you looked at Danaher versus Fortive, let's say, Danaher was up high single digits in China, and Fortive was up mid-single digits in China. So I think a number of good examples where China remains a very attractive market for us. Relative to your specific question on Fluke, Fluke is just -- is an exceptional business overall. We've had a -- it's probably one of our most advanced businesses in terms of both go-to market as well as local production and product development in China. And while there's clearly still some softness around various industrial segments in the Chinese market, Fluke is a very strong brand in that market and has a very strong share position. So I think we're encouraged by some of the stabilization we see in some of the markets. And in other of those markets, we just continue to see very strong growth. Our Dental business continues to perform exceptionally well in China. Life Sciences & Diagnostics, broadly continuing to perform well there. So again, while clearly the headlines would show that, that market has pulled back a little bit in the aggregate, it's still a very good place to be."

Clearly, that would have been a contributor to our overall organic growth at Danaher. From a margin perspective, we are ahead of schedule. We talked about north of $100 million of benefit here this year on the margin side, continue to track very well to the ultimate target of $300 million. In addition to this, we are getting favorable mix, given the Life Science business is more profitable, and we really saw that play out exceedingly well in the first quarter. It'll likely create some opportunities, where we'll be able to accelerate some investments here at Pall during this year, given we're tracking so well."

You heard me mention about the 100 kaizens that have gone on. Those have gone on literally around the world. And it's just one indication of the rapid rate at which the Pall team has adopted the tools of DBS. And really, that has truly contributed to not only the growth dynamics that we're seeing, but certainly has assisted in us getting ahead on the cost takeouts in the margin side."

But if you think back to the playbook that we ran post the Beckman acquisition, I think the playbook here at Pall is very similar, which is there's a number of opportunities to get cost out of the business broadly defined, and we're working on those obviously, start to see the margins coming up. But the playbook is to then redeploy some of that cost takeout into investments in sales and marketing and R&D. You see us do that broadly across Danaher, with gross margins going up and sales and marketing and R&D on the quarter for the Danaher in total up 30 basis points. We did that at Pall -- at Beckman. R&D lifted over time. We started to get the innovation engine going. Innovation at Pall has always been a strong suit there, but we think we can take it up another level. And so some of those cost takeouts will ultimately translate into either higher spending or potentially more efficient spending if we find opportunities to do a better job innovating at the same cost rate. We'll see."

Our comments about stability were not exclusively associated with Fluke. In fact, I think there are some pockets, even around the Fluke business, where we've seen stability, but we've also seen still some real headwinds. But I think we have seen stability in some other areas. You asked specifically about -- on the Industrial Tech side. The Automation businesses, our Sensors and Controls businesses, as we looked at those throughout the course of the quarter, February and March, we saw indications of stability. We saw those order rates kind of firm up a little bit. And while we wouldn't call it an upward trajectory, we would call those a bit more stable than we had seen in the trajectory of the fourth quarter and maybe at the very opening of the year. You mentioned Tektronix. I wouldn't necessarily put Tektronix quite in that category yet. It had one of the more challenging quarters. It's in one of the tougher markets probably that we face today. And so I think while we're very encouraged by the new product flow at Tektronix and we expect to see that -- those new products drive some improved performance in the back half of the year, Tek remains in a pretty challenging environment."

No, absolutely right. Yes, thanks, Nigel. That's -- you're right on. If you look at Environmental, which, as all of you know, both has our GVR business as well as our Water Quality businesses, GVR had stronger growth during the course of the quarter, very encouraging signs of the EMV dynamic taking hold. And GVR comes through that with a lower-margin mix relative to our Water Quality platform, which has higher margins and specifically, Hach. So a little bit softer Hach business, a little bit stronger GVR business during the course of the quarter together causes some of that headwind that you saw on the margin line there. The reference to investment spend is specific to what we need to do to build the capacity to step up to the demand associated with EMV. And so we see that in -- specifically in our GVR business. And those are investments that clearly will pay off as we continue to ramp our capabilities. And as we go into the second quarter and beyond, we would expect those margins overall in the segment to return closer to normal levels. Obviously, some continued investment there, but we expect Water Quality to come up a bit. So overall, I think there were just a couple of unique factors here in the first quarter."

They've set their sights on specific margin improvements over time. There was some outstanding execution, some disciplined cost control. But similar to the comments I made earlier around the playbook, I made reference to the Beckman playbook and how that applies to Pall, while we'll continue to drive margin improvement at Dental under the team's leadership, we'll also take some of that improvement and continue to invest in sales and marketing and in R&D because we do have opportunities for improvement in terms of our innovation cadence. We saw some modest improvement there in our core growth in the platform during the quarter, but we know there's opportunities to continue to improve that. We expect it to continue to step up.

So we really look at it sort of operating company by operating company. Our track record is a great one, and it will continue, of taking R&D up year-on-year pretty consistently. We've used our operating margin expansion that's been driven by improvements in gross margin to put some of that back into not only R&D, but into sales and marketing as well.

One of our 5 core values is Innovation Defines Our Future, and we represent that in our metrics by continuing to see that percent of R&D go up year-on-year.

And the combination of the solutions that they've had for a number of years, along with the newer products in single-use technologies, continue to drive the exceptional growth that we see there. That growth, as I think many of you know, Ross, and others know, is really driven by this move, the growth and the transition from small-molecule drugs to large-molecule drugs. And not only are those the fastest-growing segment of the market, but they're also the drugs that are most significantly represented in the pipelines of both small as well as large pharmaceutical companies today. So we remain optimistic and bullish on that market.

We're pleased with our start to 2016, as our team continued to outperform in the face of uncertain and challenging economic conditions. In the quarter, we delivered high teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and free cash flow that was up over 50% year-on-year. The Danaher Business System remains the driving force behind our performance, equipping our team with the tools to strengthen our competitive position, the focus to invest in high-impact growth opportunities and the flexibility to position our businesses for long-term success. 
This will be an exciting year as we anticipate the upcoming launch of Fortive Corporation, which we expect to spin out of Danaher in the third quarter. Since our last update in January, we've continued to build a highly experienced leadership team that named additional members to Fortive's Board of Directors. The team has also made great progress solidifying Fortive's financial, legal and organizational structures. This separation is a unique opportunity for Danaher and Fortive to optimize our respective portfolios and build long-term shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more information with you at our investor and analyst event in May at Gilbarco Veeder-Root.
Now turning to the details of the quarter. Adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.08, an increase of 18.5% over last year. Sales grew 15% to $5.4 billion, and core revenue increased 50 basis points, as a number of our businesses were negatively impacted by tough prior year comparisons and 1 less selling day. 
Clearly, the economic environment remains challenging in many verticals and geographies, but we were encouraged by signs of sales and order stabilization through the quarter. Our team's focus on portfolio optimization and diligent execution using DBS helped improve and sustain many of our market-leading positions. Finally, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 2%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 16.5%.
Geographically, the developed markets grew slightly, with stability in the U.S. and Europe. High-growth markets were up low single digits, as continued growth in India was offset by declines in Latin America and Russia. In China, our teams are well positioned to compete in several attractive markets and delivered mid-single-digit core growth in the quarter.
Gross margin for the first quarter was 53.1%, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Along with the productivity initiatives undertaken in 2015, our gross margin expansion has enabled us to sustain and expand our growth investments in new product development and sales and marketing.
Core operating margin expanded 45 basis points, with reported operating margin at 16.4%. 
Free cash flow is one of the most important metrics at Danaher, as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We had a strong quarter on this front, generated -- generating $622 million of free cash flow, a significant increase over last year.
Coming off a historic year of M&A, we closed 6 bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, deploying over $100 million in capital. These deals will strengthen our capabilities across many of our businesses. Both Danaher and Fortive have strong and active funnels, and we'll continue to focus on small and midsize transactions for both companies through the separation process.
Now let's take a look at our 5 operating segments, starting with Test & Measurement. Revenues decreased 5.5%, with core revenues down 5%. Core operating margin decreased 135 basis points, with reported operating margin coming in at 20.9%. Core revenues for our Instruments platform declined high single digits as we continue to face a challenging global market environment. All major geographies saw declines, except for China and India. Fluke core revenues decreased mid-single digits due to declines in the U.S., Western Europe and Latin America, partially offset by increases in China. 
While still a difficult environment, we did see some signs of stabilization in certain geographies and industrial end markets during the quarter. A few weeks ago, Fluke announced the launch of the Fluke 279 FC Thermal Multimeter, the world's first test tool that integrates a full-featured digital multimeter with a thermal camera in one device. This combination enables technicians to check for hotspots on high-voltage equipment and analyze problems at a safe distance. By combining these important test tools into one, Fluke is helping our customers troubleshoot electrical issues more quickly, safely and thoroughly.
At Tektronix, core revenues declined low double digits, as growth in China and India was more than offset by declines in all other major geographies. 
The Matco team continued to execute well, delivering high single-digit core growth in the quarter. Notably, Matco has posted mid-single-digit growth or better for 23 of the last 25 quarters and continues to improve its market position. In February, Matco hosted its annual tool expo in Las Vegas. The expo provides Matco franchisees with an opportunity to see new products, attend training sessions and stock their businesses for the upcoming year. This year, almost 3/4 of Matco's franchisees participated, resulting in record attendance and event-driven sales.
Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues grew 4%, with core revenues up 3.5%. Reported operating margin declined 220 basis points to 17.3%. Core operating margin declined 155 basis points and was negatively impacted by incremental investments, including EMV-related spend at Gilbarco Veeder-Root. We anticipate segment margins to return to more normalized levels in the second quarter. 
The Water Quality platform's core revenues grew slightly, as 1 less selling day and a tough prior year comparison had a negative impact. 
At Hach, positive momentum in the U.S. municipal market continued, but softness in high-growth markets resulted in flat core growth for the quarter. 
Trojan also saw strong municipal demand globally and delivered another good quarter. 
Finally, at ChemTreat, the team grew revenue slightly in the quarter despite headwinds in its industrial- and commodity-oriented markets. 
One of the ways that we continue to augment growth, build our capabilities and better serve our customers is through M&A. Our Water Quality platform has acquired more than 40 businesses since 1996 and continued its healthy cadence of bolt-ons this quarter, with Hach's acquisition of Lufft Mess in January. Lufft's long-standing precision sensors -- long-lasting precision sensors are a key part of weather-measuring networks along roads, railways and airports and enable us to deliver value to a wider range of customers around the world. The Hach team does an exceptional job of implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses, and this is well underway already at Lufft. DBS lean and growth tools are helping us drive more efficient production, strengthen key account relationships and improve funnel management.
At Gilbarco Veeder-Root, core revenue grew high single digits for the third consecutive quarter. EMV-related demand in the U.S. drove double-digit growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispenser systems, and we believe we continue to gain share on both fronts. Many of our customers are still in the process of upgrading indoor payment systems for last October's credit card liability shift. Additionally, we're well positioned to benefit from the upcoming outdoor liability shift, and the Gilbarco team is already collaborating with a number of customers to phase in outdoor upgrades. You'll hear more about EMV and GVR's other opportunities at our investor and analyst event next month.
Moving now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Core revenues grew 2.5%, with reported revenues up 42%, largely due to our recent Pall and Microscan acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 205 basis points, thanks to the team's solid execution using DBS. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single digits, led by healthy demand in high-growth markets. 
At Beckman Coulter, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. We saw strong demand for our immunoassay solutions and used our well-established installed base to help drive increased sales in India and China. 
Our consumable streams remain solid, and we're seeing healthy utilization rates globally. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems both increased core revenues in the quarter, with growth in China and India offset by declines in other high-growth markets. 
Our team is focused on improving our customers' experience every day and shows that commitment by expanding our product offering through both innovation and adjacent bolt-on acquisitions. Beckman Coulter's first major bolt-on, Iris, closed in 2012 and extended our footprint beyond blood testing into urinalysis. Since then, Iris has delivered double-digit growth and expanded operating margins over 1,000 basis points. More recently, the acquisition of Microscan expanded Beckman's already strong presence in hospital and reference labs into the microbiology space. It has been 1 year since we closed the deal, and we achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Both Iris and Microscan are helping us serve our customers better, and we believe that adjacent acquisitions, combined with our consistent application of DBS, will continue to enhance our comprehensive workflow solutions across our diagnostic businesses. 
In our Life Science platform, core revenue was up low single digits, with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. Leica Microsystems core revenues were up low single digits, as strong performance in North America and China was offset by declines in Japan and Latin America.
At SCIEX, core revenues grew low single digits, driven by demand in China and the Middle East. We also saw healthy sales growth in certain applied end markets and our service business. The SCIEX team has placed a strong focus on improving our customers' experience by pairing service contracts with instrument sales. This has driven record contract capture rates, including over 500 basis points of improvement in year-over-year attachment rates in the first quarter alone. 
SCIEX is a great example of how we use new products to help our customers' most critical challenges. In the quarter, we launched the x500R, the first model within our X-Series product family, which was the SCIEX team's largest ever development project. The x500R is a robust instrument that was specifically designed to serve customers in food and environmental testing labs, 2 of the fastest-growing end markets in mass spectrometry. Going forward, we expect this to be a significant contributor to our future growth.
Turning to Pall. We are very pleased with our early progress. This quarter, the Pall team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by double-digit growth in our Life Science business due to demand for our biopharmaceutical solutions, including single-use technologies. Our Industrial business was down low single digits as we faced challenging market conditions. The team's enthusiastic application of DBS, including over 100 kaizen events since close, has led to meaningful process improvements and several new product introductions across Pall's Life Sciences and Industrial businesses. As a result of our growth and productivity initiatives, year-on-year operating margins were up over 250 basis points. 
As we move on to Dental, core revenues increased by 0.5% due to strong demand for consumables and implants in North America and the high-growth markets as well as healthy orthodontic sales in China. These gains were negatively impacted by 1 less selling day. Over the last several quarters, the Dental team's focus on execution and disciplined spending has paid off in margin expansion. This quarter, the team grew core operating margins by 250 basis points and reported operating margins by over 500 basis points to 14.5%. Our continued investments in innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated product offerings for our Dental customers. At the Chicago Midwinter Dental Show in February, we launched over 15 new products, including Maxcem Elite Chroma, a revolutionary new cement for dental restoration that changes color to indicate the correct time for a dentist to remove any excess material. The first-in-class color indicator simplifies the dentist's procedure and reduces clinical risk.
At Nobel Biocare, the team drove mid-single-digit average daily sales of implant systems this quarter. Since the acquisition closed, Nobel has achieved over 400 basis points of operating margin improvement and is focused on reinvesting those savings into future growth opportunities.
Moving now to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 1.5%, while core revenues were also down 1.5%. Despite the revenue decline, core operating margin expanded 25 basis points, while reported operating margin declined 30 basis points to 24.3%. The Automation platform's core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to the weakness in global industrial markets and a difficult prior year comparison. While we expect this dynamic to largely persist in the near term, we were encouraged by signs of stabilization in the quarter. 
Product Identification core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate, as increased demand for marking and coding was offset by softer demand for the business's packaging and color solutions. 
Videojet's core revenues increased mid-single digits, driven by what we believe to be continuing share gains in North America and Europe, while high-growth markets remain softer. The Videojet team has delivered mid-single-digit growth or better for 9 of the past 10 quarters.
Last quarter, we announced the acquisition of Laetus, which extends our Product ID offerings into track-and-trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. We're off to a good start with Laetus. The team's early adoption of DBS tools is already driving key process improvements, as quicker service deployment and improved on-time delivery are ensuring that our customers receive the best possible support.
So to wrap up, our team executed well in the face of challenging economic conditions, and we're pleased with our start to 2016. The Danaher Business System remained the driving force behind our performance this quarter, helping to deliver high teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and 50% year-on-year free cash flow growth. We're also off to a great start at Pall, where the team drove meaningful process improvements and delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to make progress preparing for the launch of Fortive Corporation, which remains on track to close in the third quarter. Our teams are excited about the unique opportunity to continue developing 2 separate portfolios of market-leading businesses that we believe will create shareholder value for years to come.
We're initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.19 and $1.23, which assumes approximately 2% core revenue growth. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $4.80 to $4.95, to $4.85 to $4.98, which would represent a 13% to 16% increase from 2015 adjusted EPS."

China, unquestionably, is -- remains a very good market for us. Despite much of the headlines that would certainly suggest that they're slowing in various areas, we were very pleased with the performance in China. And I think it was relatively broad based. If you looked at Danaher versus Fortive, let's say, Danaher was up high single digits in China, and Fortive was up mid-single digits in China. So I think a number of good examples where China remains a very attractive market for us. Relative to your specific question on Fluke, Fluke is just -- is an exceptional business overall. We've had a -- it's probably one of our most advanced businesses in terms of both go-to market as well as local production and product development in China. And while there's clearly still some softness around various industrial segments in the Chinese market, Fluke is a very strong brand in that market and has a very strong share position. So I think we're encouraged by some of the stabilization we see in some of the markets. And in other of those markets, we just continue to see very strong growth. Our Dental business continues to perform exceptionally well in China. Life Sciences & Diagnostics, broadly continuing to perform well there. So again, while clearly the headlines would show that, that market has pulled back a little bit in the aggregate, it's still a very good place to be."

But the playbook is to then redeploy some of that cost takeout into investments in sales and marketing and R&D. You see us do that broadly across Danaher, with gross margins going up and sales and marketing and R&D on the quarter for the Danaher in total up 30 basis points. We did that at Pall -- at Beckman. R&D lifted over time. We started to get the innovation engine going. Innovation at Pall has always been a strong suit there, but we think we can take it up another level. And so some of those cost takeouts will ultimately translate into either higher spending or potentially more efficient spending if we find opportunities to do a better job innovating at the same cost rate. We'll see."

And GVR comes through that with a lower-margin mix relative to our Water Quality platform, which has higher margins and specifically, Hach. So a little bit softer Hach business, a little bit stronger GVR business during the course of the quarter together causes some of that headwind that you saw on the margin line there. The reference to investment spend is specific to what we need to do to build the capacity to step up to the demand associated with EMV. And so we see that in -- specifically in our GVR business. And those are investments that clearly will pay off as we continue to ramp our capabilities. And as we go into the second quarter and beyond, we would expect those margins overall in the segment to return closer to normal levels.

I've said for a long time, I've always believed that there's no magic number for a business with the diverse portfolio that we have today. We really look at continuing to invest in R&D to certain levels, specifically at an operating company level. And that's obviously relevant for what -- relative to what's important to those markets, what's important for our competitiveness, what yields the greatest levels of competitive advantage from an innovation perspective. So we really look at it sort of operating company by operating company. Our track record is a great one, and it will continue, of taking R&D up year-on-year pretty consistently. We've used our operating margin expansion that's been driven by improvements in gross margin to put some of that back into not only R&D, but into sales and marketing as well. And again, we've done that very consistently. I would expect that we will continue to do that. One of our 5 core values is Innovation Defines Our Future, and we represent that in our metrics by continuing to see that percent of R&D go up year-on-year. So again, it'll vary in terms of the number that we achieve year-on-year by operating company or even by platform, but using innovation to drive competitiveness is key to our strategy."

Pall, specific to your question around biotech and small and midsize, continues to perform exceptionally well across the biotech market. Just to go back and talk about a few things about what's going on in that market, Pall has a $1 billion business today that's oriented toward biopharmaceuticals. And the combination of the solutions that they've had for a number of years, along with the newer products in single-use technologies, continue to drive the exceptional growth that we see there. That growth, as I think many of you know, Ross, and others know, is really driven by this move, the growth and the transition from small-molecule drugs to large-molecule drugs. And not only are those the fastest-growing segment of the market, but they're also the drugs that are most significantly represented in the pipelines of both small as well as large pharmaceutical companies today. So we remain optimistic and bullish on that market. And I think there's every reason to believe that we'll continue to see good growth not only from Pall, but from our other Life Science business that have exposure to that market."

On the flip side, on the equipment side, we have seen some challenges in Europe actually, and a couple in those high-growth markets, where the equipment side has been held back a little bit more significantly. So I think as we annualize over some of those more challenging comps, we'll continue to see that growth improve during the course of this year."

The second quarter was a busy and exciting one for Danaher.

The second quarter was a busy and exciting one for Danaher. Despite challenging economic conditions, we are pleased with our performance as the team's consistent focus on execution helped deliver solid core revenue growth, high-teens adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow performance. 
On July 2, we successfully completed the spin-off of Fortive Corporation, a new industrial growth company. The earlier-than-expected completion of the separation is a testament to our process orientation, execution focus and exceptional teamwork. We continue to believe that the separation will provide significant opportunities for both Danaher and Fortive to independently build even greater shareholder value in the years ahead. Since we owned Fortive through the end of the quarter, will start with financial highlights that reflect the combined Danaher and Fortive results.  We'll then provide detail for the businesses remaining with Danaher, outline our planned new putting segments and provide guidance for Danaher's continuing operations, excluding Fortive, for the third quarter and the full year. Since the Fortive team will be reporting their second quarter results separately next week, we ask that you please save any questions about the Fortive businesses until then. 
Now, turning to the details of the second quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.25, an increase of 17% over last year and our third consecutive quarter of mid-teens or better adjusted EPS growth. Sales grew 16.5% to $5.8 billion, and core revenue increased 2%. The impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 0.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 15%. Danaher remainco [ph] core revenue was up 3%, while Fortive core revenue was down slightly. 
Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up mid-single digits, led by double-digit growth in China and India. We saw better sequential performance in Latin America and Russia, in part because of easier prior-year comparisons. Developed market core revenues were up low single-digits led by growth in Western Europe. The U.S. remained roughly flat, and we saw a decline in Japan during the quarter. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 54.4%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year. Reported operating margins were 17.9%, with core operating margins down 30 basis points. More than 80 basis points of core margin improvement were -- we had more than 80 basis points of core margin improvement at both Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics. This was offset by declines in Test & Measurement and Environmental segments. 
Free cash flow continues to be one of our most important financial metrics, enabling us to pursue organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter, up 14%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%. 
Now let's take a look at more detailed results across the Danaher portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenue increased mid-single digits led by strength in high-growth markets in Western Europe. At Beckman Life Sciences, we continued to outperform high-single digit core growth in the quarter was driven by strong demand in flow cytometry, particularly in North America and China. The robust growth in flow cytometry was largely driven by demand for our new Cytoflex [ph] product based on the breakthrough technology which we acquired as part of the Cytogen acquisition in 2014. This bolt-on acquisition has been a tremendous success, and this is a great example of how we incorporate novel technology into our portfolio to enhance our offering and expand our customer base. Cytoflex has been a significant contributor to recent share gains in our flow cytometry business. 
At Leica Microsystems, we saw improved results versus previous quarters, as recent new product introductions helped drive low single-digit core revenue growth. Two such new product introductions included our Leica DVM [ph] digital microscope launched at the end of 2015 and our new Leica M530 neurosurgery microscope, which is off to a great start in China after successful launches in Europe and North America last year. The M530 is a standout combination of our high-resolution optics technology with improved ergonomics, helping neurosurgeons stay focused during their demanding high precision procedures. 
Core revenues at SCIEX were up mid-single digits as we saw continued strength in pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. We had another very strong quarter in China, as new regulations from the Chinese Food Drug & Administration help drive increased demand around drug testing and food safety. 
In June, SCIEX announced a number of new workflow solutions at ASMS, the American Society of Mass Spectrometry Annual Meeting. These solutions are geared toward fast-growing markets such as biologics, [indiscernible], food and environmental testing. We showcased the latest Qtrap [ph] 6500 plus mass spectrometer that provides enhance sensitivity and selectivity to create a powerful workflow solution for biologics analysis. 
We also rolled out Biopharmaview Software 2.0, which accelerates automated data processing and simplifies reporting, enabling biopharma researchers to make better decisions faster. 
At Pall, core revenues were up mid single digits for the quarter compared to last year as a standalone company. Continued strong demand in biopharma, particularly single-use technologies, led to double-digit core revenue growth in Pall life sciences. In Pall industrial, revenues were down low single-digits, but we're continuing to see some signs of stabilization in those end markets. 
Pall continues to ramp exceedingly well across a number of key metrics. The team's commitment to the Danaher Business System has resulted in on-time delivery improving by more than 1,500 basis points with greater productivity and quality, driving improved customer satisfaction. Since acquisition, faster-than-expected cost savings and meaningful operational gains have contributed to sizable growth and operating margin improvements. As a result of the team's impressive start, we've been able to redirect some of that benefit into R&D and sales and marketing investments. By pursuing these combination of margin enhancement and growth opportunities, we believe we can continue to drive innovation and improve Pall's competitive advantage. 
The Pall team showcased a number of innovations such as acoustic wave separation and our new single-use bioreactor at the Interfax biomanufacturing tradeshow in April. Our expanded single-use product offering has enhanced our competitive position as pharmaceutical companies look to shift from traditional large infrastructure stainless steel systems to more efficient production processes. Pall's bioprocessing solutions help our customers save significant time, energy and money while greatly reducing cross-contamination risk, which provides the flexibility to easily and safely make multiple products in one facility. 
Moving now to Diagnostics. Core revenues increased low single-digits, with double-digit gains in China and India partially offset by weakness in the Middle East and the Americas. At Beckman Coulter, core revenues were up low single-digits driven primarily by strength in high-growth markets. This past June  marked the fifth anniversary of the Beckman acquisition. We made tremendous progress since then, significantly improving quality, delivery and our overall customer experience, while using productivity gains to help fund new product development and add feet on the street. Another quarter of good execution by the Beckman team contributed to healthy core operating margin expansion, and we continue to reinvest in high-impact growth opportunities. New menu additions are gaining traction, including our vitamin D and AMH fertility tests in our immunoassay business. 
Our recently launched molecular diagnostic platform, Veris, continues to gain early traction in Europe. New product developments like these, combined with opportunities at recent bolt-on acquisitions like Microscan, will continue to help build meaningful runway for growth at Beckman going forward. 
Radiometer achieved mid-single digit revenue growth, with healthy performance in Western Europe and China, partially offset by weakness in Latin America and the Middle East. Our growing installed base of blood gas instrument and ATT analyzers contributed to solid consumable sales in the quarter. The Radiometer team also recently launched the TCM 5 flex, a new transcutaneous monitor design. This noninvasive monitor measures ventilation for patients in critical condition, and the TCM 5 updated design is easy to use and reliable, providing nurses and doctors with improved usability while maintaining accuracy and precision. 
At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid-single digits. Results were driven by a combination of strength in high-growth markets and continued growth of instrument placements in advanced staining and core histology. 
Moving now over to our Dental segment. Core revenues were up mid-single digits, with growth across consumables, equipment and implants. We saw particular strength in our restorative and [indiscernible] product lines. Geographically, China had another strong quarter, with double-digit growth, and we maintain positive momentum in North America and Western Europe. 
Nobel had another good quarter, with mid-single-digit core revenue growth. We've improved operating margins at Nobel by more than 500 basis points since acquisition, enabling us to direct some of our savings into expanded product offerings and accelerate its sales and marketing efforts. This is similar to what you've seen as achieved at other large acquisitions like Beckman and Pall, where operational improvements helped fuel renewed focus on new product development and go-to-market initiatives. 
The Nobel team has launched more than 20 new products since acquisition and featured a number of these recent innovations at the Nobel Biocare Global Symposium in June. Nobel's new On one implant-based remains in position during the entire restorative workflow, from implant placement to finalization and for the lifetime of the restoration. This helps simplify the dental surgeons' workflow and allows for an improved patient experience. 
And our new Nobel parallel CC implant is a straightforward highly versatile implant system, providing an efficient treatment flow that can be used in a wide variety of implant cases. Both of these new innovations help us serve our customers with better solutions to improve their patients' experience and treatment. 
Turning to Product Identification. Core revenues increased low single-digits. We saw increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies, partially offset by softness in some of our packaging and color solutions offerings. 
Videojet's substantial and growing installed base contributed to mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strong market performance in North America, Latin America and Western Europe offset softness in certain high-growth markets. Videojet recently introduced a new service offering that enables our technicians to remotely gather data from a printer that's experiencing a fault or a failure condition. This helps our customers return to normal operations much faster, often without a site visit. With our range of comprehensive, preventive services, we're able to improve end-user productivity over the course of the printer's lifespan, ultimately reduce operating costs and enhancing customer satisfaction. 
In June, Esko successfully launched a number of new products and innovations at DRUBA [ph] , the world's largest printing equipment exhibition, which is held every 4 year in Germany. This is the most important tradeshow in the industry. Esco introduced more than a dozen significant hardware and software innovations at DRUBA this year, including a suite of powerful new software tool that help customers simplify, automate and integrate their complex packaging and label production workflows. We originated a record number of leads and orders at DRUB A, which we expect to help drive improved growth at Esko and across the product ID platform in the second half of the year. 
Lastly, turning to Water Quality. Core revenues grew low single-digits with strength in Western Europe, India and China partially offset by lower demand in Japan and Eastern Europe. Hach had a solid quarter with mid-single-digit core revenue growth. Results were driven by strength in U.S. municipal markets and Western Europe. We saw improved growth in China as Hach continues to benefit from ongoing regulations around water quality monitoring and analysis in the region. 
Hach's online water monitoring solutions are in place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for next month's Summer Olympics. Our solutions are installed at the majority of event's sites, including the largest soccer stadium in the world. We'll apply our expertise to monitor water quality in order to help Brazil execute a successful Olympic Games. After the events wrap up, Hach systems will be transferred to municipal water plants across the country, benefiting local communities for many years to come. 
At Trojan, high-single digit core revenue growth in the quarter was a result of a number of project wins in North America, Western Europe and Australia, as well as robust demand in municipal markets. 
And finally, at ChemTreat, core revenues grew low single-digits, despite exposure to weaker industrial and commodity-oriented end markets. 
So to wrap up, the Danaher team executed well in a challenging macro environment. The thoughtful application of DBS continued to drive results, with meaningful process improvements enabling reinvestment in high-impact growth initiatives. Danaher's core values is innovation defines our future, and the successful new product launches we've seen across the portfolio demonstrates our commitment to providing customers with truly differentiated technology to strengthen our collective competitive advantage. 
Following the launch of Fortive, Danaher will be a diversified multi-industry science and technology company, united by common business models and the power of DBS. We remain focused on improving growth, margins and cash flow, and we'll continue to pursue meaningful organic and inorganic opportunities to strengthen our market-leading portfolio of businesses. 
Going forward, Danaher's businesses will be organized across 4 segments:  Life sciences, including all of Pall; Diagnostics; Dental; and Environmental and Applied Solutions, which includes our Water Quality and Product Identification businesses. For further details, please refer to the supplemental information that we posted on our website this morning. 
This marks the start of an exciting new chapter for Danaher, and we look forward to the exciting opportunities we see in the years ahead. We are initiating third quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $0.80 to $0.84. We are assuming third quarter core revenue growth of 3% or better. For the full year 2016, we are anticipating adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.60, which at the midpoint would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015. Both our third quarter and full year guidance exclude the impact of Fortive."

And the high-growth market is still challenging for sure, but we are rounding around some easier comps. You heard me talk about good solid performance at Nobel. That continued. That said, relative to your question about any impact, there may have been a little bit of pull forward of revenues just based on the nature of the calendar and the way that calendar worked on the end of the quarter. But in general, I think we are very pleased with the performance. Given seasonality, we could see some moderation in the Q3 growth rates at low single-digits, that's typically a function of more European exposure and the summer tends to be a little bit slower. So we won't necessarily see a straight line to the improved performance, but we were very, very pleased with execution of the second quarter, and we think we got a very good trajectory behind us to -- that bodes well, I think, for the quarters to come."

Obviously, the life science part of the Pall portfolio is the larger part of the portfolio. There's commonality internally at Danaher from a reporting standpoint in terms of both businesses, both sides of the business reporting into Pall as well as EVP, overseeing all of Life Sciences. There's also commonality across R&D and supply chain and operations. So there's a lot of reasons operationally to keep the businesses together and, therefore, somewhat from a reporting standpoint as well. I mean, realistically, we probably could have split them up, but I think we would probably reevaluate that over time and see how we might run the businesses in the years to come. But I think for right now, this is probably, probably the best approach to keep them together. In terms of Environmental and PID, I think those businesses do share some commonality in terms of serving some different applied end markets. We could have kept them separately, they would have been far smaller segments. So I think we felt that those kind of went together and provided some flexibility for us as we defined ourselves to remain with the industry company their obviously is some flexibility maintain in terms of how we might add to that segment over time."

I think in some cases when we put investment directly into say feet on the street, in either a developed market or a high-growth market, we tend to see those investments pay off in just a quarter or 2. If we're talking about investments that go into new product development, those tend to have much more of a lag time, as projects get kicked off into early business case-oriented tollgates, you could have several quarters to it, at times even a couple of years, before you might see the impacts of the new product investment, again depending on how early or late stage an existing project might be in the pipeline. So it's varied. I think in the case of Nobel, just to talk to one of the businesses, we've seen those investments pay off relatively quickly. You've seen that in core revenue growth consistently in that business. They have relatively shorter cycle times in terms of new product development. In businesses like Beckman, for example, and at Pall, product development cycles are longer, certainly significantly longer at a place like Beckman, where oftentimes we'll have clinical trials and/or regulatory clearances.

The second quarter was a busy and exciting one for Danaher. Despite challenging economic conditions, we're pleased with our performance as the team's consistent focus on execution helped deliver solid core revenue",2340,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was a busy and exciting one for Danaher. Despite challenging economic conditions, we're pleased with our performance as the team's consistent focus on execution helped deliver solid core revenue growth, high-teens adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow performance. 
On July 2, we successfully completed the spin-off of Fortive Corporation, a new industrial growth company. The earlier-than-expected completion of the separation is a testament to our process orientation, execution focus and exceptional teamwork. We continue to believe that the separation will provide significant opportunities for both Danaher and Fortive to independently build even greater shareholder value in the years ahead. Since we owned Fortive through the end of the second quarter, we will start with financial highlights that reflect the combined Danaher and Fortive results. We'll then provide detail for the businesses remaining with Danaher, outline our planned new reporting segments and provide guidance for Danaher's continuing operations, excluding Fortive, for the third quarter and the full year. Since the Fortive team will be reporting their second quarter results separately next week, we'd ask that you please save any questions about the Fortive businesses until then. 
Now turning to the details of the second quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.25, an increase of 17% over last year and our third consecutive quarter of mid-teens or better adjusted EPS growth. Sales grew 16.5% to $5.8 billion, and core revenue increased 2%. The impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 0.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 15%. Danaher RemainCo core revenue was up 3%, while Fortive core revenue was down slightly. 
Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up mid-single digits, led by double-digit growth in China and India. We saw better sequential performance in Latin America and Russia, in part because of easier prior-year comparisons. Developed market core revenues were up low single digits, led by growth in Western Europe. The U.S. remained roughly flat, and we saw declines in Japan during the quarter. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 54.4%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year. Reported operating margins were 17.9%, with core operating margins down 30 basis points. More than 80 basis points of core margin improvement were -- we had more than 80 basis points of core margin improvement at both Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics, which was offset by declines in Test & Measurement and Environmental segments. 
Free cash flow continues to be one of our most important financial metrics, enabling us to pursue organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter, up 14%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%. 
Now let's take a look at more detailed results across the Danaher portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenue increased mid-single digits, led by strength in high-growth markets and Western Europe. At Beckman Life Sciences, we continued to outperform. High-single digit core growth in the quarter was driven by strong demand in flow cytometry, particularly in North America and China. The robust growth in flow cytometry was largely driven by demand for our new CytoFLEX product based on the breakthrough technology, which we acquired as part of the Xitogen acquisition in 2014. This bolt-on acquisition has been a tremendous success and is a great example of how we incorporate novel technology into our portfolio to enhance our offering and expand our customer base. CytoFLEX has been a significant contributor to recent share gains in our flow cytometry business. 
At Leica Microsystems, we saw improved results versus previous quarters, as recent new product introductions helped drive low single-digit core revenue growth. Two such new product introductions included our Leica DVM6 digital microscope launched at the end of 2015 and our new Leica M530 neurosurgery microscope, which is off to a great start in China after successful launches in Europe and North America last year. The M530 is a standout combination of our high-resolution optics technology with improved ergonomics, helping neurosurgeons stay focused during their demanding high-precision procedures. 
Core revenues at SCIEX were up mid-single digits as we saw continued strength in pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. We had another very strong quarter in China as new regulations from the Chinese Food Drug and Administration helped drive increased demand around drug testing and food safety. 
In June, SCIEX announced a number of new workflow solutions at ASMS, the American Society of Mass Spectrometry Annual Meeting. These solutions are geared toward fast-growing markets such as biologics, proteomics, food and environmental testing. We showcased the latest QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer that provides enhanced sensitivity and selectivity to create a powerful workflow solution for biologics analysis. 
We also rolled out BioPharmaView Software 2.0, which accelerates automated data processing and simplifies reporting, enabling biopharma researchers to make better decisions faster. 
At Pall, core revenues were up mid-single digits for the quarter compared to last year as a stand-alone company. Continued strong demand in biopharma, particularly single-use technologies, led to double-digit core revenue growth in Pall Life Sciences. In Pall Industrial, revenues were down low single digits, but we're continuing to see some signs of stabilization in those end markets. 
Pall continues to ramp exceedingly well across a number of key metrics. The team's commitment to the Danaher Business System has resulted in on-time delivery improving by more than 1,500 basis points with greater productivity and quality, driving improved customer satisfaction. Since acquisition, faster-than-expected cost savings and meaningful operational gains have contributed to sizable growth and operating margin improvements. As a result of the team's impressive start, we've been able to redirect some of that benefit into R&D and sales and marketing investments. By pursuing this combination of margin enhancement and growth opportunities, we believe we can continue to drive innovation and improve Pall's competitive advantage. 
The Pall team showcased a number of innovations, such as acoustic wave separation and our new single-use bioreactor at the Interfax biomanufacturing trade show in April. Our expanded single-use product offering has enhanced our competitive position, as pharmaceutical companies look to shift from traditional large infrastructure stainless steel systems to more efficient production processes. Pall's bioprocessing solutions help our customers save significant time, energy and money while greatly reducing cross-contamination risk, which provides the flexibility to easily and safely make multiple products in one facility. 
Moving now to Diagnostics. Core revenues increased low single digits, with double-digit gains in China and India partially offset by weakness in the Middle East and the Americas. At Beckman Coulter, core revenues were up low single digits, driven primarily by strength in high-growth markets. This past June marked the fifth anniversary of the Beckman acquisition. We'd made tremendous progress since then, significantly improving quality, delivery and our overall customer experience while using productivity gains to help fund new product development and add feet on the street. Another quarter of good execution by the Beckman team contributed to healthy core operating margin expansion, and we continue to reinvest in high-impact growth opportunities. New menu additions are gaining traction, including our vitamin D and AMH fertility tests in our immunoassay business. 
Our recently launched molecular diagnostic platform, Veris, continues to gain early traction in Europe. New product developments like these, combined with opportunities at recent bolt-on acquisitions like Microscan, will continue to help build meaningful runway for growth at Beckman going forward. 
Radiometer achieved mid-single-digit revenue growth, with healthy performance in Western Europe and China partially offset by weakness in Latin America and the Middle East. Our growing installed base of blood gas instruments and AQT analyzers contributed to solid consumable sales in the quarter. The Radiometer team also recently launched the TCM5 FLEX, a new transcutaneous monitor design. This noninvasive monitor measures ventilation for patients in critical condition. And the TCM5's updated design is easy to use and reliable, providing nurses and doctors with improved usability while maintaining accuracy and precision. 
At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid-single digits. Results were driven by a combination of strength in high-growth markets and continued growth of instrument placements in advanced staining and core histology. 
Moving now over to our Dental segment. Core revenues were up mid-single digits, with growth across consumables, equipment and implants. We saw particular strength in our restorative and Ormco product lines. Geographically, China had another strong quarter with double-digit growth, and we maintain positive momentum in North America and Western Europe. 
Nobel had another good quarter with mid-single-digit core revenue growth. We've improved operating margins at Nobel by more than 500 basis points since acquisition, enabling us to direct some of our savings into expanded product offerings and accelerated sales and marketing efforts. This is similar to what you've seen us achieve at other large acquisitions like Beckman and Pall, where operational improvements helped fuel renewed focus on new product development and go-to-market initiatives. 
The Nobel team has launched more than 20 new products since acquisition and featured a number of these recent innovations at the Nobel Biocare Global Symposium in June. Nobel's new On1 implant base remains in position during the entire restorative workflow, from implant placement to finalization and for the lifetime of the restoration. This helps simplify the dental surgeon's workflow and allows for an improved patient experience. 
And our new NobelParallel CC implant is a straightforward highly versatile implant system, providing an efficient treatment flow that can be used in a wide variety of implant cases. Both of these new innovations help us serve our customers with better solutions to improve their patients' experience and treatment. 
Turning to Product Identification. Core revenues increased low single digits. We saw increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies, partially offset by softness in some of our packaging and color solutions offerings. 
Videojet's substantial and growing installed base contributed to mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strong market performance in North America, Latin America and Western Europe offset softness in certain high-growth markets. Videojet recently introduced a new service offering that enables our technicians to remotely gather data from a printer that's experiencing a fault or a failure condition. This helps our customers return to normal operation much faster, often without a site visit. With our range of comprehensive preventive services, we're able to improve end user productivity over the course of a printers' life span, ultimately reducing operating costs and enhancing customer satisfaction. 
In June, Esko successfully launched a number of new products and innovations at drupa, the world's largest printing equipment exhibition, which is held every 4 years in Germany. This is the most important trade show in the industry. Esko introduced more than a dozen significant hardware and software innovations at drupa this year, including a suite of powerful new software tools that help customers simplify, automate and integrate their complex packaging and label production workflows. We originated a record number of leads and orders at drupa, which we expect to help drive improved growth at Esko and across the product ID platform in the second half of the year. 
Lastly, turning to Water Quality. Core revenues grew low single digits, with strength in Western Europe India and China partially offset by lower demand in Japan and Eastern Europe. Hach had a solid quarter with mid-single-digit core revenue growth. Results were driven by strength in U.S. municipal markets and Western Europe. We saw improved growth in China as Hach continues to benefit from ongoing regulations around water quality monitoring and analysis in the region. 
Hach's online water monitoring solutions are in place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for next month's Summer Olympics. Our solutions are installed at the majority of event sites, including the largest soccer stadium in the world. We'll apply our expertise to monitor water quality in order to help Brazil execute a successful Olympic Games. After the events wrap up, the Hach systems will be transferred to municipal water plants across the country, benefiting local communities for many years to come. 
At Trojan, high-single digit core revenue growth in the quarter was a result of a number of project wins in North America, Western Europe and Australia as well as robust demand in municipal markets. 
And finally, at ChemTreat, core revenues grew low single digits despite exposure to weaker industrial- and commodity-oriented end markets. 
So to wrap up, the Danaher team executed well in a challenging macro environment. The thoughtful application of DBS continue to drive results, with meaningful process improvements enabling reinvestment in high-impact growth initiatives. One of Danaher's core values is innovation defines our future, and the successful new product launches we've seen across the portfolio demonstrate our commitment to providing customers with truly differentiated technology to strengthen our collective competitive advantage. 
Following the launch of Fortive, Danaher will be a diversified multi-industry science and technology company united by common business models and the power of DBS. We remain focused on improving growth, margins and cash flow, and we'll continue to pursue meaningful organic and inorganic opportunities to strengthen our market-leading portfolio of businesses. 
Going forward, Danaher's businesses will be organized across 4 segments: Life Sciences, including all of Pall; Diagnostics; Dental; and Environmental & Applied Solutions, which includes our Water Quality and Product Identification businesses. For further details, please refer to the supplemental information that we posted on our website this morning. 
This marks the start of an exciting new chapter for Danaher, and we look forward to the exciting opportunities we see in the years ahead. We are initiating third quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $0.80 to $0.84. We are assuming third quarter core revenue growth of 3% or better. For the full year 2016, we're anticipating adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.60, which, at the midpoint, would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015. Both our third quarter and full year guidance exclude the impact of Fortive."

You've heard us talk to double-digit growth in China, and we saw that continuing. U.S. and EU, getting a little bit better. And the high-growth market is still challenging, for sure, but we are rounding around some easier comps. You heard me talk about good solid performance at Nobel. That continued. That said, relative to your question about any impact, there may have been a little bit of pull forward on some revenues just based on the nature of the calendar and the way the calendar worked on the end of the quarter. But in general, I think we're very pleased with the performance. Given seasonality, we could see some moderation in the Q3 growth rates at low single digits. That's typically a function of more European exposure, and the summer tends to be a little bit slower. So we won't necessarily see a straight line to the improved performance, but we were very, very pleased with the execution in the second quarter. And we think we've got a very good trajectory behind us to -- that bodes well for, I think, the quarters to come."

Obviously, the life science part of the Pall portfolio is the larger part of the portfolio. There's commonality internally at Danaher from a reporting standpoint, both -- in terms of both businesses -- both sides of the business reporting into a president at Pall as well as an EVP overseeing all of Life Sciences. There's also commonality across R&D and supply chain and operations. So there's a lot of reasons operationally to keep the businesses together and therefore, somewhat from a reporting standpoint as well. I mean, realistically, we probably could have split them up, but I think we would probably reevaluate that over time and see how we might run the businesses in the years to come. But I think for right now, that's -- probably the best approach is to keep them together. In terms of Environmental and PID, I think those businesses do share some commonality in terms of serving some different applied end markets. We could have kept them separately. They would have been far smaller segments. So I think we felt that those kind of went together and provided some flexibility for us. As we defined ourselves as remaining a multi-industry company, there obviously is some flexibility to maintain in terms of how we might add to that segment over time."

I think, in some cases, when we put investment directly into, say, feet on the street, in either a developed market or a high-growth market, we tend to see those investments pay off in just a quarter or 2. If we're talking about investments that go into new product development, those tend to have much more of a lag time. As projects get kicked off into early business case-oriented tollgates, you could have several quarters to it, at times even a couple of years, before you might see the impact of a new product investment, again, depending on how early or late-stage an existing project might be in the pipeline. So it's varied. I think in the case of Nobel, just to talk to one of the businesses, we've seen those investments pay off relatively quickly. You've seen it in core revenue growth consistently in that business. They have relatively shorter cycle times in terms of new product development. In businesses like Beckman, for example, and at Pall, the product development cycles are longer, certainly significantly longer at a place like Beckman, where, oftentimes, we'll have clinical trials and/or regulatory clearances.

I'd have to do some follow-up to get you some detail on anything to do with the generics or the CROs, specifically. But clearly, in the aggregate, these markets are doing quite well. Pall, as you mentioned, we've talked about the growth that we're seeing in the life science side, specifically around our single-use technology product offering, where we're seeing continued double-digit growth rates in that area. And that clearly is associated with the growth in biopharmaceuticals, specifically the growth in large-molecule drugs."

The Diagnostics business is inherently that way, typically, and you've seen us buy businesses with those same characteristics, strong brands, significant installed bases and strong recurring revenue and consumable streams. I think you'd see us continue to do that. We think there is certainly room to continue to expand our Diagnostic product offering and provide hospitals with broader bundles of product. Today, we provide products, obviously, to the central laboratory, the core clinical laboratory, as well as the anatomical pathology and to the acute care areas of the hospital.

During the first year of a significant new product introduction like that, the first of its kind by Beckman Coulter, it does take a while to build the funnel, but we've been very happy with how that funnel has built, the sales opportunity funnel in the last year. The installations that we have thus far are running very well. We have 4 assays in the market right now, but the 4 assays really are just the beginning. There's a significant road map of assay development ahead that will ultimately be commercialized, both in Europe as well as in the U.S. That product will need to go through regulatory clearance in the U.S., so it'll be some time before we see the volumes ramp beyond the early days here in Europe.

The second quarter was a busy and exciting one for Danaher. Despite challenging economic conditions, we were pleased with our performance as the team's consistent focus on execution helped deliver solid core revenue growth, high-teens adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow performance. 
On July 2, we successfully completed the spin-off of Fortive Corporation, a new industrial growth company. The earlier-than-expected completion of the separation is a testament to our process orientation, execution focus and exceptional teamwork. We continue to believe that the separation will provide significant opportunities for both Danaher and Fortive to independently build even greater shareholder value in the years ahead. Since we owned Fortive through the end of the second quarter, we will start with financial highlights that reflect the combined Danaher and Fortive results. We'll then provide detail for the businesses remaining with Danaher, outline our planned new reporting segments and provide guidance for Danaher's continuing operations, excluding Fortive, for the third quarter and the full year. Since the Fortive team will be reporting their second quarter results separately next week, we'd ask that you please save any questions about the Fortive businesses until then. 
Now turning to the details of the second quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.25, an increase of 17% over last year and our third consecutive quarter of mid-teens or better adjusted EPS growth. Sales grew 16.5% to $5.8 billion, and core revenue increased 2%. The impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 0.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 15%. Danaher RemainCo core revenue was up 3%, while Fortive core revenue was down slightly. 
Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up mid-single digits, led by double-digit growth in China and India. We saw better sequential performance in Latin America and Russia, in part because of easier prior-year comparisons. Developed market core revenues were up low single digits, led by growth in Western Europe. The U.S. remained roughly flat, and we saw declines in Japan during the quarter. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 54.4%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year. Reported operating margins were 17.9%, with core operating margins down 30 basis points. More than 80 basis points of core margin improvement were -- we had more than 80 basis points of core margin improvement at both Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics, which was offset by declines in Test & Measurement and Environmental segments. 
Free cash flow continues to be one of our most important financial metrics, enabling us to pursue organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter, up 14%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%. 
Now let's take a look at more detailed results across the Danaher portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenue increased mid-single digits, led by strength in high-growth markets and Western Europe. At Beckman Life Sciences, we continued to outperform. High-single digit core growth in the quarter was driven by strong demand in flow cytometry, particularly in North America and China. The robust growth in flow cytometry was largely driven by demand for our new CytoFLEX product based on the breakthrough technology, which we acquired as part of the Xitogen acquisition in 2014. This bolt-on acquisition has been a tremendous success and is a great example of how we incorporate novel technology into our portfolio to enhance our offering and expand our customer base. CytoFLEX has been a significant contributor to recent share gains in our flow cytometry business. 
At Leica Microsystems, we saw improved results versus previous quarters, as recent new product introductions helped drive low single-digit core revenue growth. Two such new product introductions included our Leica DVM6 digital microscope launched at the end of 2015 and our new Leica M530 neurosurgery microscope, which is off to a great start in China after successful launches in Europe and North America last year. The M530 is a standout combination of our high-resolution optics technology with improved ergonomics, helping neurosurgeons stay focused during their demanding high-precision procedures. 
Core revenues at SCIEX were up mid-single digits as we saw continued strength in pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. We had another very strong quarter in China as new regulations from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration helped drive increased demand around drug testing and food safety. 
In June, SCIEX announced a number of new workflow solutions at ASMS, the American Society of Mass Spectrometry Annual Meeting. These solutions are geared toward fast-growing markets such as biologics, proteomics, food and environmental testing. We showcased the latest QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer that provides enhanced sensitivity and selectivity to create a powerful workflow solution for biologics analysis. 
We also rolled out BioPharmaView Software 2.0, which accelerates automated data processing and simplifies reporting, enabling biopharma researchers to make better decisions faster. 
At Pall, core revenues were up mid-single digits for the quarter compared to last year as a stand-alone company. Continued strong demand in biopharma, particularly single-use technologies, led to double-digit core revenue growth in Pall Life Sciences. In Pall Industrial, revenues were down low single digits, but we're continuing to see some signs of stabilization in those end markets. 
Pall continues to ramp exceedingly well across a number of key metrics. The team's commitment to the Danaher Business System has resulted in on-time delivery improving by more than 1,500 basis points with greater productivity and quality, driving improved customer satisfaction. Since acquisition, faster-than-expected cost savings and meaningful operational gains have contributed to sizable gross and operating margin improvements. As a result of the team's impressive start, we've been able to redirect some of that benefit into R&D and sales and marketing investments. By pursuing this combination of margin enhancement and growth opportunities, we believe we can continue to drive innovation and improve Pall's competitive advantage. 
The Pall team showcased a number of innovations, such as acoustic wave separation and our new single-use bioreactor at the Interfax biomanufacturing trade show in April. Our expanded single-use product offering has enhanced our competitive position, as pharmaceutical companies look to shift from traditional large infrastructure stainless steel systems to more efficient production processes. Pall's bioprocessing solutions help our customers save significant time, energy and money while greatly reducing cross-contamination risk, which provides the flexibility to easily and safely make multiple products in one facility. 
Moving now to Diagnostics. Core revenues increased low single digits, with double-digit gains in China and India partially offset by weakness in the Middle East and the Americas. At Beckman Coulter, core revenues were up low single digits, driven primarily by strength in high-growth markets. This past June marked the fifth anniversary of the Beckman acquisition. We've made tremendous progress since then, significantly improving quality, delivery and our overall customer experience while using productivity gains to help fund new product development and add feet on the street. Another quarter of good execution by the Beckman team contributed to healthy core operating margin expansion, and we continued to reinvest in high-impact growth opportunities. New menu additions are gaining traction, including our vitamin D and AMH fertility tests in our immunoassay business. 
Our recently launched molecular diagnostic platform, Veris, continues to gain early traction in Europe. New product developments like these, combined with opportunities at recent bolt-on acquisitions like Microscan, will continue to help build meaningful runway for growth at Beckman going forward. 
Radiometer achieved mid-single-digit revenue growth, with healthy performance in Western Europe and China partially offset by weakness in Latin America and the Middle East. Our growing installed base of blood gas instruments and AQT analyzers contributed to solid consumable sales in the quarter. The Radiometer team also recently launched the TCM5 FLEX, a new transcutaneous monitor design. This noninvasive monitor measures ventilation for patients in critical condition. And the TCM5's updated design is easy to use and reliable, providing nurses and doctors with improved usability while maintaining accuracy and precision. 
At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid-single digits. Results were driven by a combination of strength in high-growth markets and continued growth of instrument placements in advanced staining and core histology. 
Moving now over to our Dental segment. Core revenues were up mid-single digits, with growth across consumables, equipment and implants. We saw particular strength in our restorative and Ormco product lines. Geographically, China had another strong quarter with double-digit growth, and we maintain positive momentum in North America and Western Europe. 
Nobel had another good quarter with mid-single-digit core revenue growth. We've improved operating margins at Nobel by more than 500 basis points since acquisition, enabling us to direct some of our savings into expanded product offerings and accelerated sales and marketing efforts. This is similar to what you've seen us achieve at other large acquisitions like Beckman and Pall, where operational improvements helped fuel a renewed focus on new product development and go-to-market initiatives. 
The Nobel team has launched more than 20 new products since acquisition and featured a number of these recent innovations at the Nobel Biocare Global Symposium in June. Nobel's new On1 implant base remains in position during the entire restorative workflow, from implant placement to finalization and for the lifetime of the restoration. This helps simplify the dental surgeon's workflow and allows for an improved patient experience. 
And our new NobelParallel CC implant is a straightforward highly versatile implant system, providing an efficient treatment flow that can be used in a wide variety of implant cases. Both of these new innovations help us serve our customers with better solutions to improve their patients' experience and treatment. 
Turning to Product Identification. Core revenues increased low single digits. We saw increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies, partially offset by softness in some of our packaging and color solutions offerings. 
Videojet's substantial and growing installed base contributed to mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strong market performance in North America, Latin America and Western Europe offset softness in certain high-growth markets. Videojet recently introduced a new service offering that enables our technicians to remotely gather data from a printer that's experiencing a fault or a failure condition. This helps our customers return to normal operation much faster, often without a site visit. With our range of comprehensive preventive services, we're able to improve end user productivity over the course of a printers' life span, ultimately reducing operating costs and enhancing customer satisfaction. 
In June, Esko successfully launched a number of new products and innovations at drupa, the world's largest printing equipment exhibition, which is held every 4 years in Germany. This is the most important trade show in the industry. Esko introduced more than a dozen significant hardware and software innovations at drupa this year, including a suite of powerful new software tools that help customers simplify, automate and integrate their complex packaging and label production workflows. We originated a record number of leads and orders at drupa, which we expect to help drive improved growth at Esko and across the product ID platform in the second half of the year. 
Lastly, turning to Water Quality. Core revenues grew low single digits, with strength in Western Europe, India and China partially offset by lower demand in Japan and Eastern Europe. Hach had a solid quarter with mid-single-digit core revenue growth. Results were driven by strength in U.S. municipal markets and Western Europe. We saw improved growth in China as Hach continues to benefit from ongoing regulations around water quality monitoring and analysis in the region. 
Hach's online water monitoring solutions are in place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for next month's Summer Olympics. Our solutions are installed at the majority of event sites, including the largest soccer stadium in the world. We'll apply our expertise to monitor water quality in order to help Brazil execute a successful Olympic Games. After the events wrap up, the Hach systems will be transferred to municipal water plants across the country, benefiting local communities for many years to come. 
At Trojan, high-single digit core revenue growth in the quarter was a result of a number of project wins in North America, Western Europe and Australia as well as robust demand in municipal markets. 
And finally, at ChemTreat, core revenues grew low single digits despite exposure to weaker industrial- and commodity-oriented end markets. 
So to wrap up, the Danaher team executed well in a challenging macro environment. The thoughtful application of DBS continued to drive results, with meaningful process improvements enabling reinvestment in high-impact growth initiatives. One of Danaher's core values is innovation defines our future, and the successful new product launches we've seen across the portfolio demonstrate our commitment to providing customers with truly differentiated technology to strengthen our collective competitive advantage. 
Following the launch of Fortive, Danaher will be a diversified multi-industry science and technology company united by common business models and the power of DBS. We remain focused on improving growth, margins and cash flow, and we'll continue to pursue meaningful organic and inorganic opportunities to strengthen our market-leading portfolio of businesses. 
Going forward, Danaher's businesses will be organized across 4 segments: Life Sciences, including all of Pall; Diagnostics; Dental; and Environmental & Applied Solutions, which includes our Water Quality and Product Identification businesses. For further details, please refer to the supplemental information that we posted on our website this morning. 
This marks the start of an exciting new chapter for Danaher, and we look forward to the exciting opportunities we see in the years ahead. We are initiating third quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $0.80 to $0.84. We are assuming third quarter core revenue growth of 3% or better. For the full year 2016, we are anticipating adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.60, which, at the midpoint, would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015. Both our third quarter and full year guidance exclude the impact of Fortive."

And the high-growth markets, still challenging, for sure, but we are rounding around some easier comps. You heard me talk about good solid performance at Nobel. That continued. That said, relative to your question about any impact, there may have been a little bit of pull forward on some revenues just based on the nature of the calendar and the way the calendar worked on the end of the quarter. But in general, I think we were very pleased with the performance. Given seasonality, we could see some moderation in the Q3 growth rates at low single digits. That's typically a function of more European exposure, and the summer tends to be a little bit slower. So we won't necessarily see a straight line to the improved performance, but we were very, very pleased with the execution in the second quarter. And we think we've got a very good trajectory behind us to -- that bodes well for, I think, the quarters to come."

There's commonality internally at Danaher from a reporting standpoint, both -- in terms of both businesses -- both sides of the business reporting into a president at Pall as well as an EVP overseeing all of Life Sciences. There's also commonality across R&D and supply chain and operations. So there's a lot of reasons operationally to keep the businesses together and therefore, somewhat from a reporting standpoint as well. I mean, realistically, we probably could have split them up, but I think we would probably reevaluate that over time and see how we might run the businesses in the years to come. But I think for right now, that's probably the best approach is to keep them together. In terms of Environmental and PID, I think those businesses do share some commonality in terms of serving some different applied end markets. We could have kept them separately. They would have been far smaller segments. So I think we felt that those kind of went together and provided some flexibility for us. As we've defined ourselves as remaining a multi-industry company, there obviously is some flexibility to maintain in terms of how we might add to that segment over time."

I think, in some cases, when we put investment directly into, say, feet on the street, in either a developed market or a high-growth market, we tend to see those investments pay off in just a quarter or 2. If we're talking about investments that go into new product development, those tend to have much more of a lag time. As projects get kicked off into early business case-oriented tollgates, you could have several quarters to it, at times even a couple of years, before you might see the impact of a new product investment, again, depending on how early or late-stage an existing project might be in the pipeline. So it's varied. I think in the case of Nobel, just to talk to one of the businesses, we've seen those investments pay off relatively quickly. You've seen it in good core revenue growth consistently in that business. They have relatively shorter cycle times in terms of new product development.

The installations that we have thus far are running very well. We have 4 assays in the market right now, but the 4 assays really are just the beginning. There's a significant road map of assay development ahead that will ultimately be commercialized, both in Europe as well as in the U.S. That product will need to go through regulatory clearance in the U.S., so it'll be some time before we see the volumes ramp beyond the early days here in Europe.

The second quarter was a busy and exciting one for Danaher. Despite challenging economic conditions, we were pleased with our performance as the team's consistent focus on execution helped deliver solid core revenue growth, high-teens adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow performance. 
On July 2, we successfully completed the spin-off of Fortive Corporation, a new industrial growth company. The earlier-than-expected completion of the separation is a testament to our process orientation, execution focus and exceptional teamwork. We continue to believe that the separation will provide significant opportunities for both Danaher and Fortive to independently build even greater shareholder value in the years ahead. Since we owned Fortive through the end of the second quarter, we will start with financial highlights that reflect the combined Danaher and Fortive results. We'll then provide detail for the businesses remaining with Danaher, outline our planned new reporting segments and provide guidance for Danaher's continuing operations, excluding Fortive, for the third quarter and the full year. Since the Fortive team will be reporting their second quarter results separately next week, we'd ask that you please save any questions about the Fortive businesses until then. 
Now turning to the details of the second quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.25, an increase of 17% over last year and our third consecutive quarter of mid-teens or better adjusted EPS growth. Sales grew 16.5% to $5.8 billion, and core revenue increased 2%. The impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 0.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 15%. Danaher RemainCo core revenue was up 3%, while Fortive core revenue was down slightly. 
Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up mid-single digits, led by double-digit growth in China and India. We saw better sequential performance in Latin America and Russia, in part because of easier prior year comparisons. Developed market core revenues were up low single digits, led by growth in Western Europe. The U.S. remained roughly flat, and we saw declines in Japan during the quarter. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 54.4%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year. Reported operating margins were 17.9%, with core operating margins down 30 basis points. More than 80 basis points of core margin improvement were -- we had more than 80 basis points of core margin improvement at both Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics, which was offset by declines in Test & Measurement and Environmental segments. 
Free cash flow continues to be one of our most important financial metrics, enabling us to pursue organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter, up 14%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%. 
Now let's take a look at more detailed results across the Danaher portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenue increased mid-single digits, led by strength in high-growth markets and Western Europe. At Beckman Life Sciences, we continued to outperform. High-single digit core growth in the quarter was driven by strong demand in flow cytometry, particularly in North America and China. The robust growth in flow cytometry was largely driven by demand for our new CytoFLEX product based on the breakthrough technology, which we acquired as part of the Xitogen acquisition in 2014. This bolt-on acquisition has been a tremendous success and is a great example of how we incorporate novel technology into our portfolio to enhance our offering and expand our customer base. CytoFLEX has been a significant contributor to recent share gains in our flow cytometry business. 
At Leica Microsystems, we saw improved results versus previous quarters, as recent new product introductions helped drive low single-digit core revenue growth. Two such new product introductions included our Leica DVM6 digital microscope launched at the end of 2015 and our new Leica M530 neurosurgery microscope, which is off to a great start in China after successful launches in Europe and North America last year. The M530 is a standout combination of our high-resolution optics technology with improved ergonomics, helping neurosurgeons stay focused during their demanding high-precision procedures. 
Core revenues at SCIEX were up mid-single digits as we saw continued strength in pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. We had another very strong quarter in China as new regulations from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration helped drive increased demand around drug testing and food safety. 
In June, SCIEX announced a number of new workflow solutions at ASMS, the American Society of Mass Spectrometry Annual Meeting. These solutions are geared toward fast-growing markets such as biologics, proteomics, food and environmental testing. We showcased the latest QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer that provides enhanced sensitivity and selectivity to create a powerful workflow solution for biologics analysis. 
We also rolled out BioPharmaView Software 2.0, which accelerates automated data processing and simplifies reporting, enabling biopharma researchers to make better decisions faster. 
At Pall, core revenues were up mid-single digits for the quarter compared to last year as a stand-alone company. Continued strong demand in biopharma, particularly single-use technologies, led to double-digit core revenue growth in Pall Life Sciences. In Pall Industrial, revenues were down low single digits, but we're continuing to see some signs of stabilization in those end markets. 
Pall continues to ramp exceedingly well across a number of key metrics. The team's commitment to the Danaher Business System has resulted in on-time delivery improving by more than 1,500 basis points with greater productivity and quality, driving improved customer satisfaction. Since acquisition, faster-than-expected cost savings and meaningful operational gains have contributed to sizable gross and operating margin improvements. As a result of the team's impressive start, we've been able to redirect some of that benefit into R&D and sales and marketing investments. By pursuing this combination of margin enhancement and growth opportunities, we believe we can continue to drive innovation and improve Pall's competitive advantage. 
The Pall team showcased a number of innovations, such as acoustic wave separation and our new single-use bioreactor at the Interfax biomanufacturing trade show in April. Our expanded single-use product offering has enhanced our competitive position, as pharmaceutical companies look to shift from traditional large infrastructure stainless steel systems to more efficient production processes. Pall's bioprocessing solutions help our customers save significant time, energy and money while greatly reducing cross-contamination risk, which provides the flexibility to easily and safely make multiple products in one facility. 
Moving now to Diagnostics. Core revenues increased low single digits, with double-digit gains in China and India partially offset by weakness in the Middle East and the Americas. At Beckman Coulter, core revenues were up low single digits, driven primarily by strength in high-growth markets. This past June marked the fifth anniversary of the Beckman acquisition. We've made tremendous progress since then, significantly improving quality, delivery and our overall customer experience while using productivity gains to help fund new product development and add feet on the street. Another quarter of good execution by the Beckman team contributed to healthy core operating margin expansion, and we continued to reinvest in high-impact growth opportunities. New menu additions are gaining traction, including our vitamin D and AMH fertility tests in our immunoassay business. 
Our recently launched molecular diagnostic platform, Veris, continues to gain early traction in Europe. New product developments like these, combined with opportunities at recent bolt-on acquisitions like Microscan, will continue to help build meaningful runway for growth at Beckman going forward. 
Radiometer achieved mid-single-digit revenue growth, with healthy performance in Western Europe and China partially offset by weakness in Latin America and the Middle East. Our growing installed base of blood gas instruments and AQT analyzers contributed to solid consumable sales in the quarter. The Radiometer team also recently launched the TCM5 FLEX, a new transcutaneous monitor design. This noninvasive monitor measures ventilation for patients in critical condition. And the TCM5's updated design is easy to use and reliable, providing nurses and doctors with improved usability while maintaining accuracy and precision. 
At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid-single digits. Results were driven by a combination of strength in high-growth markets and continued growth of instrument placements in advanced staining and core histology. 
Moving now over to our Dental segment. Core revenues were up mid-single digits, with growth across consumables, equipment and implants. We saw particular strength in our restorative and Ormco product lines. Geographically, China had another strong quarter with double-digit growth, and we maintain positive momentum in North America and Western Europe. 
Nobel had another good quarter with mid-single-digit core revenue growth. We've improved operating margins at Nobel by more than 500 basis points since acquisition, enabling us to direct some of our savings into expanded product offerings and accelerated sales and marketing efforts. This is similar to what you've seen us achieve at other large acquisitions like Beckman and Pall, where operational improvements helped fuel a renewed focus on new product development and go-to-market initiatives. 
The Nobel team has launched more than 20 new products since acquisition and featured a number of these recent innovations at the Nobel Biocare Global Symposium in June. Nobel's new On1 implant base remains in position during the entire restorative workflow, from implant placement to finalization and for the lifetime of the restoration. This helps simplify the dental surgeon's workflow and allows for an improved patient experience. 
And our new NobelParallel CC implant is a straightforward highly versatile implant system, providing an efficient treatment flow that can be used in a wide variety of implant cases. Both of these new innovations help us serve our customers with better solutions to improve their patients' experience and treatment. 
Turning to Product Identification. Core revenues increased low single digits. We saw increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies, partially offset by softness in some of our packaging and color solutions offerings. 
Videojet's substantial and growing installed base contributed to mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strong market performance in North America, Latin America and Western Europe offset softness in certain high-growth markets. Videojet recently introduced a new service offering that enables our technicians to remotely gather data from a printer that's experiencing a fault or a failure condition. This helps our customers return to normal operation much faster, often without a site visit. With our range of comprehensive preventive services, we're able to improve end user productivity over the course of a printers' life span, ultimately reducing operating costs and enhancing customer satisfaction. 
In June, Esko successfully launched a number of new products and innovations at drupa, the world's largest printing equipment exhibition, which is held every 4 years in Germany. This is the most important trade show in the industry. Esko introduced more than a dozen significant hardware and software innovations at drupa this year, including a suite of powerful new software tools that help customers simplify, automate and integrate their complex packaging and label production workflows. We originated a record number of leads and orders at drupa, which we expect to help drive improved growth at Esko and across the product ID platform in the second half of the year. 
Lastly, turning to Water Quality. Core revenues grew low single digits, with strength in Western Europe, India and China partially offset by lower demand in Japan and Eastern Europe. Hach had a solid quarter with mid-single-digit core revenue growth. Results were driven by strength in U.S. municipal markets and Western Europe. We saw improved growth in China as Hach continues to benefit from ongoing regulations around water quality monitoring and analysis in the region. 
Hach's online water monitoring solutions are in place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for next month's Summer Olympics. Our solutions are installed at the majority of event sites, including the largest soccer stadium in the world. We'll apply our expertise to monitor water quality in order to help Brazil execute a successful Olympic Games. After the events wrap up, the Hach systems will be transferred to municipal water plants across the country, benefiting local communities for many years to come. 
At Trojan, high-single digit core revenue growth in the quarter was a result of a number of project wins in North America, Western Europe and Australia as well as robust demand in municipal markets. 
And finally, at ChemTreat, core revenues grew low single digits despite exposure to weaker industrial- and commodity-oriented end markets. 
So to wrap up, the Danaher team executed well in a challenging macro environment. The thoughtful application of DBS continued to drive results, with meaningful process improvements enabling reinvestment in high-impact growth initiatives. One of Danaher's core values is innovation defines our future, and the successful new product launches we've seen across the portfolio demonstrate our commitment to providing customers with truly differentiated technology to strengthen our collective competitive advantage. 
Following the launch of Fortive, Danaher will be a diversified multi-industry science and technology company united by common business models and the power of DBS. We remain focused on improving growth, margins and cash flow, and we'll continue to pursue meaningful organic and inorganic opportunities to strengthen our market-leading portfolio of businesses. 
Going forward, Danaher's businesses will be organized across 4 segments: Life Sciences, including all of Pall; Diagnostics; Dental; and Environmental & Applied Solutions, which includes our Water Quality and Product Identification businesses. For further details, please refer to the supplemental information that we posted on our website this morning. 
This marks the start of an exciting new chapter for Danaher, and we look forward to the exciting opportunities we see in the years ahead. We are initiating third quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $0.80 to $0.84. We are assuming third quarter core revenue growth of 3% or better. For the full year 2016, we are anticipating adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.60, which, at the midpoint, would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015. Both our third quarter and full year guidance exclude the impact of Fortive."

And the high-growth markets, still challenging, for sure, but we are rounding around some easier comps. You heard me talk about good solid performance at Nobel. That continued. That said, relative to your question about any impact, there may have been a little bit of pull forward on some revenues just based on the nature of the calendar and the way the calendar worked on the end of the quarter. But in general, I think we were very pleased with the performance. Given seasonality, we could see some moderation in the Q3 growth rates at low single digits. That's typically a function of more European exposure, and the summer tends to be a little bit slower. So we won't necessarily see a straight line to the improved performance, but we were very, very pleased with the execution in the second quarter. And we think we've got a very good trajectory behind us to -- that bodes well for, I think, the quarters to come."

Obviously, the life science part of the Pall portfolio is the larger part of the portfolio. There's commonality internally at Danaher from a reporting standpoint, both -- in terms of both businesses -- both sides of the business reporting into a president at Pall as well as an EVP overseeing all of Life Sciences. There's also commonality across R&D and supply chain and operations. So there's a lot of reasons operationally to keep the businesses together and therefore, somewhat from a reporting standpoint as well. I mean, realistically, we probably could have split them up, but I think we would probably reevaluate that over time and see how we might run the businesses in the years to come. But I think for right now, that's probably the best approach is to keep them together. In terms of Environmental and PID, I think those businesses do share some commonality in terms of serving some different applied end markets. We could have kept them separately. They would have been far smaller segments. So I think we felt that those kind of went together and provided some flexibility for us. As we've defined ourselves as remaining a multi-industry company, there obviously is some flexibility to maintain in terms of how we might add to that segment over time."

I think, in some cases, when we put investment directly into, say, feet on the street, in either a developed market or a high-growth market, we tend to see those investments pay off in just a quarter or 2. If we're talking about investments that go into new product development, those tend to have much more of a lag time. As projects get kicked off into early business case-oriented tollgates, you could have several quarters to it, at times even a couple of years, before you might see the impact of a new product investment, again, depending on how early or late-stage an existing project might be in the pipeline. So it's varied. I think in the case of Nobel, just to talk to one of the businesses, we've seen those investments pay off relatively quickly. You've seen it in good core revenue growth consistently in that business. They have relatively shorter cycle times in terms of new product development. In businesses like Beckman, for example, and at Pall, the product development cycles are longer, certainly significantly longer at a place like Beckman, where, oftentimes, we'll have clinical trials and/or regulatory clearances.

I think if -- to the extent that there's good news there, I think it would be that we've seen some stability found in those markets. We continue to make some excellent progress in terms of our go-to-market initiatives. We've done over 40 growth-related kaizens at Pall since we acquired the business. And a number of those kaizens have been going on in the industrial markets. And that involves installing DBS tools, such as funnel management and transformative marketing that we think is improving our execution in those markets. So I think the combination of seeing some stability across each one of those end markets, in combination with the application of DBS tools, I think, has gotten us to a pretty good place. So I would hope to see some incrementally better performance late this year and certainly, entering next year. But I think, in general, we're pleased that things have stabilized."

We're pleased with our third quarter results as our team continued to execute well despite the macroeconomic environment.

We're pleased with our third quarter results as our team continued to execute well despite the macroeconomic environment. We delivered solid core revenue growth with very strong adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow performance. The diversity and strength of our businesses has served us well in this modest growth environment. The recent separation of Fortive was an important step towards optimizing our portfolio, and we continue to strategically position Danaher for strong long-term growth through M&A. 
Since July, we have announced over $4.8 billion of acquisitions that will strengthen our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. In September, we announced the acquisition of Cepheid, a global leader in molecular diagnostics, and we recently announced the acquisition of Phenomenex, an outstanding chromatography consumables business that will be highly complementary to our Life Sciences portfolio. Combined with the execution benefits of DBS, we believe these exciting strategic additions will contribute to Danaher's growth trajectory and superior returns. We look forward to welcoming the Cepheid and Phenomenex teams to Danaher. 
With that as a backdrop, let's turn to the details of the third quarter. This morning, we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.87, an increase of more than 20% over last year. Sales grew 17.5% to $4.1 billion, with core revenue increasing 3%. Core growth was consistent across the portfolio, as each of our 4 reporting segments achieved at least 3% core revenue growth in the quarter. Currency translation had minimal impact while acquisitions increased revenues by 14.5%. 
Geographically, the high-growth markets led the way, driven by high single-digit growth in China and high-teens growth in India. Developed market core revenues were up low single digits. Modest growth in the U.S. and Western Europe was partially offset by declines in Japan. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was 55.3%, an increase of 140 basis points from last year. This increase in gross profit enabled us to increase our sales and marketing and R&D spend meaningfully in the quarter. Core operating margins were up 155 basis points in the quarter and 90 basis points year-to-date. This strong margin expansion helped to drive double-digit adjusted net earnings growth in the third quarter. During the quarter, we generated approximately $700 million of free cash flow from continuing operations, up 35%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%. 
Now let's take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenues were up 3% and reported revenues grew over 60%, largely due to the Pall acquisition. Core operating margin increased 180 basis points, and the reported operating profit margin increased to 15.4%. 
At Beckman Life Sciences, low single-digit core growth in the quarter was driven by momentum in China while developed markets were essentially flat. The backdrop of government investment in health care in China, coupled with Beckman's strong execution, contributed to double-digit gains in that region.  Beckman's particle counting and characterization business had another good quarter, with double-digit growth driven by global biopharmaceutical demand. 
The team also launched a new product that supports drug discovery and development. The Vi-CELL MetaFLEX is a biochemistry analyzer that resulted from a collaboration with one of our Diagnostic businesses, Radiometer. Beckman incorporated the technology behind Radiometer's blood gas analyzer to create the Vi-CELL MetaFLEX, which analyzes cell cultures, a crucial component in biotherapy production. This cross-pollination between Beckman and Radiometer is a powerful example of the unique opportunities we have at Danaher to bring greater value to customers by collaborating across the portfolio. 
Leica Microsystems core revenue declined in the quarter. Growth was impacted by weakness in the academic and industrial end markets, particularly in North America and Western Europe. This was partially offset by double-digit gains in the high-growth markets as China continued to be a bright spot, particularly for our confocal business. 
SCIEX posted another quarter of mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by global strength in pharmaceuticals and food as well as environmental testing. Geographically, we saw declines in Japan and in Europe, where academic weakness impacted results. In the high-growth markets, China and India each maintained strong double-digit growth. Our service offering continues to be a differentiator at SCIEX as the team drove further improvements in contract renewals and attachment rates in the quarter. 
As I mentioned at the start of the call, we recently announced our acquisition of Phenomenex, a leading player in chromatography consumables that supports a variety of analytical testing applications in the health, research and environmental segments. Phenomenex is 100% consumables, a high-margin business in an attractive mid-single-digit growth industry that is adjacent to where SCIEX participates. We expect to achieve a double-digit return on our investment in less than 5 years and believe that Phenomenex will help us to continue creating long-term value as part of our Life Sciences portfolio. 
Pall delivered another quarter of good growth and execution. Continued strength in biopharmaceutical end markets and demand for single-use technologies underpinned strong growth at Pall Life Sciences. Pall's market-leading solutions are at the forefront of the biopharma evolution, and 9 of the 12 new biologic drugs cleared by the FDA last year specified Pall products in their processes. This is a tremendous testament to the quality and reliability that Pall provides to its customers every day. 
Pall Industrial revenue was down in the quarter with solid gains in aerospace and microelectronics offset by declines in energy and machinery as heavy industrial end markets remained challenging. August marked the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of Pall Corporation, and the team's exceptional implementation of DBS has been a critical driver of what we've been able to accomplish thus far. Since the beginning of the year, Pall has achieved more than 150 basis points of gross margin expansion and improved operating margins by over 350 basis points. 
At the same time, we've been able to put some of that benefit back into sales and marketing and R&D. This reinvestment, combined with the team's thoughtful use of DBS growth tools, like accelerated product development and [indiscernible], has resulted in a number of key new products launching ahead of schedule this year. By delivering these impactful new solutions to the market sooner, we can deliver greater value to our customers and further enhance Pall's growth trajectory. 
Moving now to Diagnostics. Both reported and core revenues increased 3%. The team's solid execution generated 250 basis points of core operating margin expansion, and reported operating margins increased to 16%. Sustained strength in China and India was complemented by modest growth in the developed markets. 
Core revenue at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up low single digits, with growth in emerging markets partially offset by softer demand in North America and Europe. Recent installed base growth in China contributed to strong immunoassay performance in the quarter, with the business achieving double-digit recurring revenue in the region. 
One of our 5 core values at Danaher is: Customers talk, we listen. And Beckman Diagnostics recognizes the importance of helping customers drive performance across multiple labs with different needs and different test volumes. One of the ways we differentiate our offering is to partner with customers and help them integrate Danaher Business System tools and processes into their labs and workflows. The result can be tremendously impactful: better speed to results, operational efficiency and ultimately improved clinician workflows. 
The effectiveness of one such collaboration was recently highlighted by a customer that operates one of the largest regional lab networks in the Midwestern United States. Within 6 months, Beckman helped them implement over 180 analyzers and 4 automation lines at 30 different hospitals and lab locations without any patient disruption. This customer was recently awarded a prestigious ADVANCE Laboratory of the Year award for 2016 and has mentioned their partnership with Beckman and the adoption of DBS tools as a key factor in their labs' transformational success. 
Radiometer achieved mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by continued double-digit growth in both China and India and solid performance in the developed markets. We saw robust demand for consumables across our portfolio of acute care diagnostic instruments. 
At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter, led by high single-digit growth in North America. An expanding installed base and strong consumable sales contributed to double-digit growth in our advanced staining business. 
Back in September, we announced our acquisition of Cepheid, a leading molecular diagnostics innovator in the fastest-growing segment of diagnostics. Cepheid has the largest global installed base of molecular diagnostics instruments, combined with the broadest test menu available. We expect this highly complementary addition to our Diagnostics portfolio to accelerate our growth strategy and further differentiate Danaher's diagnostics offering. We also foresee tremendous opportunities with the application of DBS at Cepheid, which we believe will help drive better top and bottom line performance. 
Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported revenues increased 3.5%, and reported operating margin increased slightly to 15%, with 20 basis points of core margin expansion. Core revenues were up 3%, driven by our equipment, implant and orthodontic product lines, while we saw softer demand for consumables in the quarter. Positive gains in North America were offset by weakness in Western Europe. Strength in high-growth markets was supported by another quarter of double-digit growth in China across all of our major dental product lines. 
Since 2010, we've grown our Dental revenues in China from $15 million to over $150 million today, and we're now positioned as one of the leading players in the region. We've evolved our business model as well in China to position ourselves as more of a localized player by expanding our R&D teams, increasing local commercial coverage and establishing manufacturing capabilities in the region. This approach, combined with our comprehensive product suite, enables us to provide a full service China-centric offering that enhances our customers' experiences and positions us well for continued growth in this market. 
Let's turn to Nobel Biocare. Nobel Biocare's core revenue grew at a low single-digit rate, with demand for implant systems and regeneratives driven by recently launched new products that have quickly gained traction with customers. Similar to what we saw across our other Dental businesses in the quarter, sales in Western Europe softened at Nobel while China continued to do well. The benefit of the team's operational and cost improvements using DBS continues to help fuel Nobel's new product and innovation engine. 
Turning to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Core revenues grew 3.5% with reported revenues up 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points, and reported operating margin was down slightly at 24.3%. 
In Product Identification, core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, and we saw strong demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our packaging and color solutions offerings improved sequentially and was led primarily by increased demand in the U.S. and Latin America. 
Videojet showed solid growth performance, delivering mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strength in developed markets and Latin America was modestly offset by declines in China, primarily due to industrial end market weakness. Videojet continued to grow the number of connected printers in the market, expanding our remote solutions offering for customers and driving high single-digit service revenue growth. 
Core revenue grew low single digits at Esko, led by increased demand at MediaBeacon, which we acquired in 2015. As a reminder, MediaBeacon provide digital asset management software that brand owners and packaging managers use to ensure accuracy and compliance. With the help of DBS tools like funnel management and transformative marketing, MediaBeacon has generated greater market awareness and demand for our integrated solutions, which support customers across their full brand and packaging workflows. At X-Rite, core revenue grew low single digits, with strong performance in North America and China partially offset by the rest of Asia. 
Lastly, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue growth for the platform increased at a low single-digit rate. Hach's core revenue declined slightly in the quarter as industrial end market weakness contributed to softer demand in North America and China. We saw similarly lackluster activity in Eastern Europe as constrained government funding and political instability affected municipal projects. We anticipate better core growth at Hach in the fourth quarter. 
ChemTreat core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate as the team delivered solid commercial execution and expanded their customer base in the U.S. Strength in North America and the food and beverage end markets was partially offset by lower demand in Latin America, particularly in the more commodity-oriented markets. 
At Trojan, core revenue increased double digits, driven by consistent municipal demand across developed and emerging markets. Our increased municipal systems' installed base contributed to strong replacement growth, and bidding activity was up low single digits globally. A few key municipal project wins materialized in Asia as ultraviolet water treatment solutions have gained interest in the region. 
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our performance in the current macroeconomic environment. We believe that the steps we've taken to reshape our portfolio positions us well for stronger growth and value creation. The diversity and strength of our businesses, combined with our team's focused execution using the Danaher Business System, is what sustains our competitive advantage. We believe that this combination will continue to serve both our customers and our shareholders as well. 
We are initiating fourth quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes fourth quarter core revenue growth comparable to the third quarter of 2016. For the full year 2016, we're raising our adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations guidance to $3.57 to $3.61, which, at the midpoint, would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015."

The combination of those 2 teams has gotten the business off to a tremendous start in the first year. DBS has played a huge role in the progress that we've made there. As you might recall, that team had sort of began the journey before we arrived on the scene, but the combination of the Danaher team that's gone in, in the Pall team have really accelerated the pace of progress. There have been over 350 kaizens that have been completed both on operational side as well as on the commercial side. We've seen the tremendous lift in core operating margins in that business. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we're now seeing the investment in some of the sales and marketing and the new product areas start to make a real difference in terms of getting new products not only launched but commercialized on time and effectively. So we're off to a good start. You know we took the improvements from a cost standpoint up from $60 million in the first year to $100 million. So we're a little bit ahead of schedule in that respect. And I think, obviously, that lifts the returns here in the near term. Relative to where we'll end up on a 4-, 5-year basis and beyond, I think, again, we're off to a very good start. I think we have a lot of opportunity to lift those returns, but it's still early days. And there's a lot of hard work to be done in the months and quarters and years ahead, but a great start."

And so as those businesses begin to improve both from the standpoint of our execution, and DBS is playing a role there from a new product execution standpoint and a commercialization perspective, when those improvements kick in and we get some lift from the macro, I think the big benefit you're going to see is in terms of the core growth of that business and the readthrough on an operating margin basis from that core growth. I don't know that it necessarily changes trajectory from a cost-out perspective.

And I think now with a portfolio where greater than 60% of the revenues are in the aftermarket and where there's some stability in these markets but not necessarily anything positive to write home about macroeconomically, I think there is cause for some degree of caution in the outlook. You're reading the same macroeconomic news that everybody else is and, certainly, that we are. There's a number of sources of uncertainty in the market today, whether that's the election uncertainty in the U.S.; the Brexit uncertainty throughout Europe; the questions around turns in some of the high-growth markets or previously known as high-growth markets, as I sometimes say, around places like Latin America, the Middle East, Russia, and particularly those markets with a good deal of commodity exposure and certainly those with a high degree of industrial exposure. So it's hard not to be appropriately concerned with some of that sources of uncertainty. But that being said, we think we've got an incredibly resilient portfolio right now, again, underpinned by that level of aftermarket position and a portfolio we think that will continue to perform well despite those uncertainties."

And so -- and that obviously for us is very typical for a large bolt-on or a midsize adjacency deal and really opens up a number of other possibilities. Jeff, this is a business, to your point about installed base versus consumables, where Phenomenex is -- has become the leader they are largely because they actually are equipment-agnostic, and they focus on specific applications and workflows that address unique customer problems, and therefore, create unique customer value. We've got a partnership with Phenomenex at SCIEX for a number of years, and it's been a very successful one. But as some of you may recall, we are also consumables-agnostic in the sense of chromatography columns at SCIEX. And so what this allows us to do essentially is bring a greater variety, a broader set of solutions to our customers without necessarily having to have those consumables be captive by that installed base. Obviously, that can be very attractive strategically when you have it, but in the particular case of the Life Science world, being able to customize solutions for these unique applications customer challenges is a real competitive advantage."

Relative to the specific portions of the business that you mentioned, we are seeing strength in our equipment business, up mid-single digits and, yes, the consumable business, up more like low single-digits. And really, I think that have to do with a couple of different factors. We are executing well in the equipment side. We have new product initiatives that are making a difference there. And overall, I think we're well positioned from a portfolio perspective. You've heard the narrative from a number of different folks in the market around some softness during the course of July and August. I think, we, as the quarter came to a close in September, we started to certainly see some of that play through, and I think that absolutely varies by geography as well. I mentioned double-digit growth in places like China and India, but the U.S., much slower, and certainly we're seeing some softness in Europe as well as Latin America and the Middle East. So definitely a tale of 2 cities. You asked also about the equipment -- the implant side. Nobel continues to perform very well. They've got a number of new products in the market right now, which are helping in that growth rate. And they're executing well just on a commercial basis day in and day out. And some of that obviously has been a function of the implementation of DBS on the cost side where we've been able to reallocate some of those funds into investments in sales and marketing as well as in R&D.

And you've heard me mention a number of times, the strength that we have seen in India, which has been very consistent level strength over the last couple of years. And with those 2 markets being what they are, both the scale of those markets, the inherent growth rates in those markets and the strength of our positions, those are really where a great deal of our investment are going. We're largely doubling down in the markets where we have the greatest opportunities for growth in the near term. We -- what improvement we've seen, and that's been very modest in places like Latin America, Brazil specifically and Russia, are really more about easier comps than materially improved market conditions. And the Middle East continues to be weak. And so while we've sustained our positions there in terms of our feet on the street and our investments in commercializing new products in those markets, those have not been markets where we are significantly accelerating our investments today. Instead, the biggest incremental investments are going into those markets where we are seeing continued strength."

We're pleased with our third quarter results as our team continued to execute well despite the macroeconomic environment. We delivered solid core revenue growth with very strong adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow performance. The diversity and strength of our businesses has served us well in this modest growth environment. The recent separation of Fortive was an important step towards optimizing our portfolio, and we continue to strategically position Danaher for strong long-term growth through M&A. 
Since July, we have announced over $4.8 billion of acquisitions that will strengthen our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. In September, we announced the acquisition of Cepheid, a global leader in molecular diagnostics, and we recently announced the acquisition of Phenomenex, an outstanding chromatography consumables business that will be highly complementary to our Life Sciences portfolio. Combined with the execution benefits of DBS, we believe these exciting strategic additions will contribute to Danaher's growth trajectory and superior returns. We look forward to welcoming the Cepheid and Phenomenex teams to Danaher. 
With that as a backdrop, let's turn to the details of the third quarter. This morning, we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.87, an increase of more than 20% over last year. Sales grew 17.5% to $4.1 billion, with core revenue increasing 3%. Core growth was consistent across the portfolio, as each of our 4 reporting segments achieved at least 3% core revenue growth in the quarter. Currency translation had minimal impact while acquisitions increased revenues by 14.5%. 
Geographically, the high-growth markets led the way, driven by high single-digit growth in China and high-teens growth in India. Developed market core revenues were up low single digits. Modest growth in the U.S. and Western Europe was partially offset by declines in Japan. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was 55.3%, an increase of 140 basis points from last year. This increase in gross profit enabled us to increase our sales and marketing and R&D spend meaningfully in the quarter. Core operating margins were up 155 basis points in the quarter and 90 basis points year-to-date. This strong margin expansion helped to drive double-digit adjusted net earnings growth in the third quarter. During the quarter, we generated approximately $700 million of free cash flow from continuing operations, up 35%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%. 
Now let's take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenues were up 3% and reported revenues grew over 60%, largely due to the Pall acquisition. Core operating margin increased 180 basis points, and the reported operating profit margin increased to 15.4%. 
At Beckman Life Sciences, low single-digit core growth in the quarter was driven by momentum in China while developed markets were essentially flat. The backdrop of government investment in health care in China, coupled with Beckman's strong execution, contributed to double-digit gains in that region.  Beckman's particle counting and characterization business had another good quarter, with double-digit growth driven by global biopharmaceutical demand. 
The team also launched a new product that supports drug discovery and development. The Vi-CELL MetaFLEX is a biochemistry analyzer that resulted from a collaboration with one of our Diagnostic businesses, Radiometer. Beckman incorporated the technology behind Radiometer's blood gas analyzer to create the Vi-CELL MetaFLEX, which analyzes cell cultures, a crucial component in biotherapy production. This cross-pollination between Beckman and Radiometer is a powerful example of the unique opportunities we have at Danaher to bring greater value to customers by collaborating across the portfolio. 
Leica Microsystems core revenue declined in the quarter. Growth was impacted by weakness in the academic and industrial end markets, particularly in North America and Western Europe. This was partially offset by double-digit gains in the high-growth markets as China continued to be a bright spot, particularly for our confocal business. 
SCIEX posted another quarter of mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by global strength in pharmaceuticals and food as well as environmental testing. Geographically, we saw declines in Japan and in Europe, where academic weakness impacted results. In the high-growth markets, China and India each maintained strong double-digit growth. Our service offering continues to be a differentiator at SCIEX as the team drove further improvements in contract renewals and attachment rates in the quarter. 
As I mentioned at the start of the call, we recently announced our acquisition of Phenomenex, a leading player in chromatography consumables that supports a variety of analytical testing applications in the health, research and environmental segments. Phenomenex is 100% consumables, a high-margin business in an attractive mid-single-digit growth industry that is adjacent to where SCIEX participates. We expect to achieve a double-digit return on our investment in less than 5 years and believe that Phenomenex will help us to continue creating long-term value as part of our Life Sciences portfolio. 
Pall delivered another quarter of good growth and execution. Continued strength in biopharmaceutical end markets and demand for single-use technologies underpinned strong growth at Pall Life Sciences. Pall's market-leading solutions are at the forefront of the biopharma evolution, and 9 of the 12 new biologic drugs cleared by the FDA last year specified Pall products in their processes. This is a tremendous testament to the quality and reliability that Pall provides to its customers every day. 
Pall Industrial revenue was down in the quarter with solid gains in aerospace and microelectronics offset by declines in energy and machinery as heavy industrial end markets remained challenging. August marked the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of Pall Corporation, and the team's exceptional implementation of DBS has been a critical driver of what we've been able to accomplish thus far. Since the beginning of the year, Pall has achieved more than 150 basis points of gross margin expansion and improved operating margins by over 350 basis points. 
At the same time, we've been able to put some of that benefit back into sales and marketing and R&D. This reinvestment, combined with the team's thoughtful use of DBS growth tools, like accelerated product development and [indiscernible], has resulted in a number of key new products launching ahead of schedule this year. By delivering these impactful new solutions to the market sooner, we can deliver greater value to our customers and further enhance Pall's growth trajectory. 
Moving now to Diagnostics. Both reported and core revenues increased 3%. The team's solid execution generated 250 basis points of core operating margin expansion, and reported operating margins increased to 16%. Sustained strength in China and India was complemented by modest growth in the developed markets. 
Core revenue at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up low single digits, with growth in emerging markets partially offset by softer demand in North America and Europe. Recent installed base growth in China contributed to strong immunoassay performance in the quarter, with the business achieving double-digit recurring revenue in the region. 
One of our 5 core values at Danaher is: Customers talk, we listen. And Beckman Diagnostics recognizes the importance of helping customers drive performance across multiple labs with different needs and different test volumes. One of the ways we differentiate our offering is to partner with customers and help them integrate Danaher Business System tools and processes into their labs and workflows. The result can be tremendously impactful: better speed to results, operational efficiency and ultimately improved clinician workflows. 
The effectiveness of one such collaboration was recently highlighted by a customer that operates one of the largest regional lab networks in the Midwestern United States. Within 6 months, Beckman helped them implement over 180 analyzers and 4 automation lines at 30 different hospitals and lab locations without any patient disruption. This customer was recently awarded a prestigious ADVANCE Laboratory of the Year award for 2016 and has mentioned their partnership with Beckman and the adoption of DBS tools as a key factor in their labs' transformational success. 
Radiometer achieved mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by continued double-digit growth in both China and India and solid performance in the developed markets. We saw robust demand for consumables across our portfolio of acute care diagnostic instruments. 
At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter, led by high single-digit growth in North America. An expanding installed base and strong consumable sales contributed to double-digit growth in our advanced staining business. 
Back in September, we announced our acquisition of Cepheid, a leading molecular diagnostics innovator in the fastest-growing segment of diagnostics. Cepheid has the largest global installed base of molecular diagnostics instruments, combined with the broadest test menu available. We expect this highly complementary addition to our Diagnostics portfolio to accelerate our growth strategy and further differentiate Danaher's diagnostics offering. We also foresee tremendous opportunities with the application of DBS at Cepheid, which we believe will help drive better top and bottom line performance. 
Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported revenues increased 3.5%, and reported operating margin increased slightly to 15%, with 20 basis points of core margin expansion. Core revenues were up 3%, driven by our equipment, implant and orthodontic product lines, while we saw softer demand for consumables in the quarter. Positive gains in North America were offset by weakness in Western Europe. Strength in high-growth markets was supported by another quarter of double-digit growth in China across all of our major dental product lines. 
Since 2010, we've grown our Dental revenues in China from $15 million to over $150 million today, and we're now positioned as one of the leading players in the region. We've evolved our business model as well in China to position ourselves as more of a localized player by expanding our R&D teams, increasing local commercial coverage and establishing manufacturing capabilities in the region. This approach, combined with our comprehensive product suite, enables us to provide a full service China-centric offering that enhances our customers' experiences and positions us well for continued growth in this market. 
Let's turn to Nobel Biocare. Nobel Biocare's core revenue grew at a low single-digit rate, with demand for implant systems and regeneratives driven by recently launched new products that have quickly gained traction with customers. Similar to what we saw across our other Dental businesses in the quarter, sales in Western Europe softened at Nobel while China continued to do well. The benefit of the team's operational and cost improvements using DBS continues to help fuel Nobel's new product and innovation engine. 
Turning to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Core revenues grew 3.5% with reported revenues up 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points, and reported operating margin was down slightly at 24.3%. 
In Product Identification, core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, and we saw strong demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our packaging and color solutions offerings improved sequentially and was led primarily by increased demand in the U.S. and Latin America. 
Videojet showed solid growth performance, delivering mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strength in developed markets and Latin America was modestly offset by declines in China, primarily due to industrial end market weakness. Videojet continued to grow the number of connected printers in the market, expanding our remote solutions offering for customers and driving high single-digit service revenue growth. 
Core revenue grew low single digits at Esko, led by increased demand at MediaBeacon, which we acquired in 2015. As a reminder, MediaBeacon provide digital asset management software that brand owners and packaging managers use to ensure accuracy and compliance. With the help of DBS tools like funnel management and transformative marketing, MediaBeacon has generated greater market awareness and demand for our integrated solutions, which support customers across their full brand and packaging workflows. At X-Rite, core revenue grew low single digits, with strong performance in North America and China partially offset by the rest of Asia. 
Lastly, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue growth for the platform increased at a low single-digit rate. Hach's core revenue declined slightly in the quarter as industrial end market weakness contributed to softer demand in North America and China. We saw similarly lackluster activity in Eastern Europe as constrained government funding and political instability affected municipal projects. We anticipate better core growth at Hach in the fourth quarter. 
ChemTreat core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate as the team delivered solid commercial execution and expanded their customer base in the U.S. Strength in North America and the food and beverage end markets was partially offset by lower demand in Latin America, particularly in the more commodity-oriented markets. 
At Trojan, core revenue increased double digits, driven by consistent municipal demand across developed and emerging markets. Our increased municipal systems' installed base contributed to strong replacement growth, and bidding activity was up low single digits globally. A few key municipal project wins materialized in Asia as ultraviolet water treatment solutions have gained interest in the region. 
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our performance in the current macroeconomic environment. We believe that the steps we've taken to reshape our portfolio positions us well for stronger growth and value creation. The diversity and strength of our businesses, combined with our team's focused execution using the Danaher Business System, is what sustains our competitive advantage. We believe that this combination will continue to serve both our customers and our shareholders as well. 
We are initiating fourth quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes fourth quarter core revenue growth comparable to the third quarter of 2016. For the full year 2016, we're raising our adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations guidance to $3.57 to $3.61, which, at the midpoint, would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015."

As you might recall, that team had sort of began the journey before we arrived on the scene, but the combination of the Danaher team that's gone in, in the Pall team have really accelerated the pace of progress. There have been over 350 kaizens that have been completed both on operational side as well as on the commercial side. We've seen the tremendous lift in core operating margins in that business. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we're now seeing the investment in some of the sales and marketing and the new product areas start to make a real difference in terms of getting new products not only launched but commercialized on time and effectively. So we're off to a good start. You know we took the improvements from a cost standpoint up from $60 million in the first year to $100 million. So we're a little bit ahead of schedule in that respect. And I think, obviously, that lifts the returns here in the near term. Relative to where we'll end up on a 4-, 5-year basis and beyond, I think, again, we're off to a very good start. I think we have a lot of opportunity to lift those returns, but it's still early days. And there's a lot of hard work to be done in the months and quarters and years ahead, but a great start."

And so as those businesses begin to improve both from the standpoint of our execution, and DBS is playing a role there from a new product execution standpoint and a commercialization perspective, when those improvements kick in and we get some lift from the macro, I think the big benefit you're going to see is in terms of the core growth of that business and the readthrough on an operating margin basis from that core growth. I don't know that it necessarily changes trajectory from a cost-out perspective. We're working on the cost structures, both on the Life Science side and on the industrial side as well as across the horizontal components of G&A.

I mean it starts with how pleased we are with the performance at this point in the third quarter, with all 4 segments driving at least 3% core growth. And I think now with a portfolio where greater than 60% of the revenues are in the aftermarket and where there's some stability in these markets but not necessarily anything positive to write home about macroeconomically, I think there is cause for some degree of caution in the outlook. You're reading the same macroeconomic news that everybody else is and, certainly, that we are. There's a number of sources of uncertainty in the market today, whether that's the election uncertainty in the U.S.; the Brexit uncertainty throughout Europe; the questions around turns in some of the high-growth markets or previously known as high-growth markets, as I sometimes say, around places like Latin America, the Middle East, Russia, and particularly those markets with a good deal of commodity exposure and certainly those with a high degree of industrial exposure. So it's hard not to be appropriately concerned with some of that sources of uncertainty. But that being said, we think we've got an incredibly resilient portfolio right now, again, underpinned by that level of aftermarket position and a portfolio we think that will continue to perform well despite those uncertainties."

I think on the -- there's a different side of the story though, which is on the municipal business in North America, the day-to-day consumables business is not showing the kind of strength that I just represented at Trojan.

And so -- and that, obviously, for us is very typical for a large bolt-on or a midsize adjacency deal and really opens up a number of other possibilities. Jeff, this is a business, to your point about installed base versus consumables, where Phenomenex is -- has become the leader they are largely because they actually are equipment-agnostic and they focus on specific applications and workflows that address unique customer problems and, therefore, create unique customer value. We've had a partnership with Phenomenex at SCIEX for a number of years, and it's been a very successful one. But as some of you may recall, we're also consumables-agnostic in the sense of chromatography columns at SCIEX. And so what this allows us to do essentially is bring a greater variety, a broader set of solutions to our customers without necessarily having to have those consumables be captive by that installed base. Obviously, that can be very attractive strategically when you have it, but in the particular case of the Life Science world, being able to customize solutions to -- for these unique applications and customer challenges is a real competitive advantage."

We're pleased with how the Dental business, the segment performed in the quarter at up 3%. And there was clearly some better execution on our side in a number of different areas, and you've heard us speak in the past about some of the changes that we've made both organizationally and operationally. We have realigned our investments into some key areas from a new product perspective, and we're seeing the benefits there. Relative to the specific portions of the business that you mentioned, we are seeing strength in our equipment business, up mid-single digits; and, yes, the consumable business, up more like low single digits. And really, I think that had to do with a couple of different factors. We are executing well in the equipment side. We have new product initiatives that are making a difference there. And overall, I think we're well positioned from a portfolio perspective. You've heard the narrative from a number of different folks in the market around some softness during the course of July and August. I think we -- as the quarter came to a close in September, we started to certainly see some of that play through, and I think that absolutely varies by geography as well. I mentioned double-digit growth in places like China and India; but the U.S., much slower. And certainly, we're seeing some softness in Europe as well as Latin America and the Middle East. So definitely, a tale of 2 cities. You asked also about the equipment -- the implant side. Nobel continues to perform very well. They've got a number of new products in the market right now, which are helping in that growth rate, and they're executing well just on a commercial basis day in and day out. And some of that obviously has been a function of the implementation of DBS on the cost side, where we've been able to reallocate some of those funds into investments in sales and marketing as well as in R&D. Particularly in the third quarter, we made some significant investments in sales and marketing, and I think will pay off -- that will continue to pay off at Nobel with even improving growth rates."

Well, Ross, we have gotten quite a bit done here in the last couple of years with the separation that took place with Fortive and getting Fortive off to a great start, but then making some very important and strategic acquisitions to shore up really what were 3 of the most important strategic needs or opportunities that we had: Nobel on the implant and consumable side; as you mentioned, Pall, to enhance our Life Sciences, specifically biopharmaceutical production position; and then Cepheid, to improve our position relative to molecular diagnostics. We've had a focus strategically on the consumable side of Life Science and Phenomenex, to use your term, a crown jewel in the consumable side of Life Science. So I think we feel very good about where we are right now. I wouldn't trade our portfolio, the 4 segments that we have today of Diagnostics, Life Science, Dental and Environmental & Applied Solutions, for any portfolio in the market. And I think the game plan in the years ahead, as it has been in the past, is continue to deploy our free cash flow strategically, with a strong bias towards M&A, into these highly attractive segments. And I think the game plan, at least in the near term here, given the current position of the balance sheet and all that we have to do operationally with these acquisitions, is to focus on probably small or midsize bolt-ons that are strategically important to our position, that hopefully will -- as these have done, will be accretive to our growth rates and improve our growth trajectories. And hopefully, that would be the case certainly on the margin side, if not initially, certainly over time. So I think that's the game going forward, and it's been the plan over the last couple of years."

I think we've -- as we look at the high-growth markets today, I'm not sure we would necessarily say that there was much of a change recently in those markets. We've continued to see strength in China across a number of our businesses, if not all. Business in China is up high single digits, real strength in Life Science, in Dental, in Diagnostics; some softness in Hach and Videojet. Those are businesses where that softness largely comes from equipment and more industrially-oriented end markets. And you've heard me mention a number of times the strength that we've seen in India, which has been very consistent level of strength over the last couple of years. And with those 2 markets being what they are, both the scale of those markets, the inherent growth rates in those markets and the strength of our positions, those are really where a great deal of our investment are going. We're largely doubling down in the markets where we have the greatest opportunities for growth in the near term. We -- what improvement we've seen, and it's been very modest, in places like Latin America, Brazil specifically and Russia are really more about easier comps than materially improved market conditions. And the Middle East continues to be weak. And so while we've sustained our positions there in terms of our feet on the street and our investments in commercializing new products in those markets, those have not been markets where we are significantly accelerating our investments today.

We're pleased with our third quarter results as our team continued to execute well despite the macroeconomic environment. We delivered solid core revenue growth with very strong adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow performance. The diversity and strength of our businesses has served us well in this modest growth environment. The recent separation of Fortive was an important step towards optimizing our portfolio, and we continue to strategically position Danaher for strong long-term growth through M&A. 
Since July, we have announced over $4.8 billion of acquisitions that will strengthen our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. In September, we announced the acquisition of Cepheid, a global leader in molecular diagnostics, and we recently announced the acquisition of Phenomenex, an outstanding chromatography consumables business that will be highly complementary to our Life Sciences portfolio. Combined with the execution benefits of DBS, we believe these exciting strategic additions will contribute to Danaher's growth trajectory and superior returns. We look forward to welcoming the Cepheid and Phenomenex teams to Danaher. 
With that as a backdrop, let's turn to the details of the third quarter. This morning, we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.87, an increase of more than 20% over last year. Sales grew 17.5% to $4.1 billion, with core revenue increasing 3%. Core growth was consistent across the portfolio, as each of our 4 reporting segments achieved at least 3% core revenue growth in the quarter. Currency translation had minimal impact while acquisitions increased revenues by 14.5%. 
Geographically, the high-growth markets led the way, driven by high single-digit growth in China and high-teens growth in India. Developed market core revenues were up low single digits. Modest growth in the U.S. and Western Europe was partially offset by declines in Japan. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was 55.3%, an increase of 140 basis points from last year. This increase in gross profit enabled us to increase our sales and marketing and R&D spend meaningfully in the quarter. Core operating margins were up 155 basis points in the quarter and 90 basis points year-to-date. This strong margin expansion helped to drive double-digit adjusted net earnings growth in the third quarter. During the quarter, we generated approximately $700 million of free cash flow from continuing operations, up 35%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%. 
Now let's take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenues were up 3% and reported revenues grew over 60%, largely due to the Pall acquisition. Core operating margin increased 180 basis points, and the reported operating profit margin increased to 15.4%. 
At Beckman Life Sciences, low single-digit core growth in the quarter was driven by momentum in China while developed markets were essentially flat. The backdrop of government investment in health care in China, coupled with Beckman's strong execution, contributed to double-digit gains in that region.  Beckman's particle counting and characterization business had another good quarter, with double-digit growth driven by global biopharmaceutical demand. 
The team also launched a new product that supports drug discovery and development. The Vi-CELL MetaFLEX is a biochemistry analyzer that resulted from a collaboration with one of our Diagnostic businesses, Radiometer. Beckman incorporated the technology behind Radiometer's blood gas analyzer to create the Vi-CELL MetaFLEX, which analyzes cell cultures, a crucial component in biotherapy production. This cross-pollination between Beckman and Radiometer is a powerful example of the unique opportunities we have at Danaher to bring greater value to customers by collaborating across the portfolio. 
Leica Microsystems core revenue declined in the quarter. Growth was impacted by weakness in the academic and industrial end markets, particularly in North America and Western Europe. This was partially offset by double-digit gains in the high-growth markets as China continued to be a bright spot, particularly for our confocal business. 
SCIEX posted another quarter of mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by global strength in pharmaceuticals and food as well as environmental testing. Geographically, we saw declines in Japan and in Europe, where academic weakness impacted results. In the high-growth markets, China and India each maintained strong double-digit growth. Our service offering continues to be a differentiator at SCIEX as the team drove further improvements in contract renewals and attachment rates in the quarter. 
As I mentioned at the start of the call, we recently announced our acquisition of Phenomenex, a leading player in chromatography consumables that supports a variety of analytical testing applications in the health, research and environmental segments. Phenomenex is 100% consumables, a high-margin business in an attractive mid-single-digit growth industry that is adjacent to where SCIEX participates. We expect to achieve a double-digit return on our investment in less than 5 years and believe that Phenomenex will help us to continue creating long-term value as part of our Life Sciences portfolio. 
Pall delivered another quarter of good growth and execution. Continued strength in biopharmaceutical end markets and demand for single-use technologies underpinned strong growth at Pall Life Sciences. Pall's market-leading solutions are at the forefront of the biopharma evolution, and 9 of the 12 new biologic drugs cleared by the FDA last year specified Pall products in their processes. This is a tremendous testament to the quality and reliability that Pall provides to its customers every day. 
Pall Industrial revenue was down in the quarter with solid gains in aerospace and microelectronics offset by declines in energy and machinery as heavy industrial end markets remained challenging. August marked the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of Pall Corporation, and the team's exceptional implementation of DBS has been a critical driver of what we've been able to accomplish thus far. Since the beginning of the year, Pall has achieved more than 150 basis points of gross margin expansion and improved operating margins by over 350 basis points. 
At the same time, we've been able to put some of that benefit back into sales and marketing and R&D. This reinvestment, combined with the team's thoughtful use of DBS growth tools, like accelerated product development and Obeya Rooms, has resulted in a number of key new products launching ahead of schedule this year. By delivering these impactful new solutions to the market sooner, we can deliver greater value to our customers and further enhance Pall's growth trajectory. 
Moving now to Diagnostics. Both reported and core revenues increased 3%. The team's solid execution generated 250 basis points of core operating margin expansion, and reported operating margins increased to 16%. Sustained strength in China and India was complemented by modest growth in the developed markets. 
Core revenue at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up low single digits, with growth in emerging markets partially offset by softer demand in North America and Europe. Recent installed base growth in China contributed to strong immunoassay performance in the quarter, with the business achieving double-digit recurring revenue in the region. 
One of our 5 core values at Danaher is: Customers talk, we listen. And Beckman Diagnostics recognizes the importance of helping customers drive performance across multiple labs with different needs and different test volumes. One of the ways we differentiate our offering is to partner with customers and help them integrate Danaher Business System tools and processes into their labs and workflows. The result can be tremendously impactful: better speed to results, operational efficiency and ultimately improved clinician workflows. 
The effectiveness of one such collaboration was recently highlighted by a customer that operates one of the largest regional lab networks in the Midwestern United States. Within 6 months, Beckman helped them implement over 180 analyzers and 4 automation lines at 30 different hospitals and lab locations without any patient disruption. This customer was recently awarded the prestigious ADVANCE Laboratory of the Year award for 2016 and has mentioned their partnership with Beckman and the adoption of DBS tools as a key factor in their labs' transformational success. 
Radiometer achieved mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by continued double-digit growth in both China and India and solid performance in the developed markets. We saw robust demand for consumables across our portfolio of acute care diagnostic instruments. 
At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter, led by high single-digit growth in North America. An expanding installed base and strong consumable sales contributed to double-digit growth in our advanced staining business. 
Back in September, we announced our acquisition of Cepheid, a leading molecular diagnostics innovator in the fastest-growing segment of diagnostics. Cepheid has the largest global installed base of molecular diagnostics instruments, combined with the broadest test menu available. We expect this highly complementary addition to our Diagnostics portfolio to accelerate our growth strategy and further differentiate Danaher's diagnostics offering. We also foresee tremendous opportunities with the application of DBS at Cepheid, which we believe will help drive better top and bottom line performance. 
Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported revenues increased 3.5%, and reported operating margin increased slightly to 15%, with 20 basis points of core margin expansion. Core revenues were up 3%, driven by our equipment, implant and orthodontic product lines, while we saw softer demand for consumables in the quarter. Positive gains in North America were offset by weakness in Western Europe. Strength in high-growth markets was supported by another quarter of double-digit growth in China across all of our major dental product lines. 
Since 2010, we've grown our Dental revenues in China from $15 million to over $150 million today, and we're now positioned as one of the leading players in the region. We've evolved our business model as well in China to position ourselves as more of a localized player by expanding our R&D teams, increasing local commercial coverage and establishing manufacturing capabilities in the region. This approach, combined with our comprehensive product suite, enables us to provide a full service China-centric offering that enhances our customers' experiences and positions us well for continued growth in this market. 
Let's turn to Nobel Biocare. Nobel Biocare's core revenue grew at a low single-digit rate, with demand for implant systems and regeneratives driven by recently launched new products that have quickly gained traction with customers. Similar to what we saw across our other Dental businesses in the quarter, sales in Western Europe softened at Nobel while China continued to do well. The benefit of the team's operational and cost improvements using DBS continues to help fuel Nobel's new product and innovation engine. 
Turning to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Core revenues grew 3.5% with reported revenues up 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points, and reported operating margin was down slightly at 24.3%. 
In Product Identification, core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, and we saw strong demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our packaging and color solutions offerings improved sequentially and was led primarily by increased demand in the U.S. and Latin America. 
Videojet showed solid growth performance, delivering mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strength in developed markets and Latin America was modestly offset by declines in China, primarily due to industrial end market weakness. Videojet continued to grow the number of connected printers in the market, expanding our remote solutions offering for customers and driving high single-digit service revenue growth. 
Core revenue grew low single digits at Esko, led by increased demand at MediaBeacon, which we acquired in 2015. As a reminder, MediaBeacon provides digital asset management software that brand owners and packaging managers use to ensure accuracy and compliance. With the help of DBS tools like funnel management and transformative marketing, MediaBeacon has generated greater market awareness and demand for our integrated solutions, which support customers across their full brand and packaging workflows. At X-Rite, core revenue grew low single digits, with strong performance in North America and China partially offset by the rest of Asia. 
Lastly, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue growth for the platform increased at a low single-digit rate. Hach's core revenue declined slightly in the quarter as industrial end market weakness contributed to softer demand in North America and China. We saw similarly lackluster activity in Eastern Europe as constrained government funding and political instability affected municipal projects. We anticipate better core growth at Hach in the fourth quarter. 
ChemTreat core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate as the team delivered solid commercial execution and expanded their customer base in the U.S. Strength in North America and the food and beverage end markets was partially offset by lower demand in Latin America, particularly in the more commodity-oriented markets. 
At Trojan, core revenue increased double digits, driven by consistent municipal demand across developed and emerging markets. Our increased municipal systems installed base contributed to strong replacement growth, and bidding activity was up low single digits globally. A few key municipal project wins materialized in Asia as ultraviolet water treatment solutions have gained interest in the region. 
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our performance in the current macroeconomic environment. We believe that the steps we've taken to reshape our portfolio positions us well for stronger growth and value creation. The diversity and strength of our businesses, combined with our team's focused execution using the Danaher Business System, is what sustains our competitive advantage. We believe that this combination will continue to serve both our customers and our shareholders well. 
We are initiating fourth quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes fourth quarter core revenue growth comparable to the third quarter of 2016. For the full year 2016, we're raising our adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations guidance to $3.57 to $3.61, which, at the midpoint, would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015."

Scott, we're very, very pleased with the performance of the team, both the Danaher team that has joined the team at Pall as well as the legacy Pall associates. The combination of those 2 teams has gotten the business off to a tremendous start in the first year. DBS has played a huge role in the progress that we've made there. As you might recall, that team had sort of begun the journey before we arrived on the scene, but the combination of the Danaher team that's gone in and the Pall team have really accelerated the pace of progress. There have been over 350 kaizens that have been completed both on operational side as well as on the commercial side. We've seen the tremendous lift in core operating margins in that business. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we're now seeing the investment in some of the sales and marketing and the new product areas start to make a real difference in terms of getting new products not only launched but commercialized on time and effectively. So we're off to a good start. You know we took the improvements from a cost standpoint up from $60 million in the first year to $100 million. So we're a little bit ahead of schedule in that respect. And I think, obviously, that lifts the returns here in the near term. Relative to where we'll end up on a 4-, 5-year basis and beyond, I think, again, we're off to a very good start. I think we have a lot of opportunity to lift those returns, but it's still early days. And there's a lot of hard work to be done in the months and quarters and years ahead, but a great start."

In other words, we've seen some stability. The industrial side was still down mid-single digits in the quarter while the Life Science side was up mid-single digits. And so as those businesses begin to improve both from the standpoint of our execution, and DBS is playing a role there from a new product execution standpoint and a commercialization perspective, when those improvements kick in and we get some lift from the macro, I think the big benefit you're going to see is in terms of the core growth of that business and the readthrough on an operating margin basis from that core growth. I don't know that it necessarily changes trajectory from a cost-out perspective. We're working on the cost structures, both on the Life Science side and on the industrial side as well as across the horizontal components of G&A. So I think the real lift comes when we start to see that core growth turn positive and we start to see the readthrough from that growth."

I do think, though, there's a number of considerations that go into how we look at the fourth quarter. I mean it starts with how pleased we are with the performance to this point in the third quarter, with all 4 segments driving at least 3% core growth. And I think now with a portfolio where greater than 60% of the revenues are in the aftermarket and where there's some stability in these markets but not necessarily anything positive to write home about macroeconomically, I think there is cause for some degree of caution in the outlook. You're reading the same macroeconomic news that everybody else is and, certainly, that we are. There's a number of sources of uncertainty in the market today, whether that's the election uncertainty in the U.S.; the Brexit uncertainty throughout Europe; the questions around turns in some of the high-growth markets or previously known as high-growth markets, as I sometimes say, around places like Latin America, the Middle East, Russia, and particularly those markets with a good deal of commodity exposure and certainly those with a high degree of industrial exposure. So it's hard not to be appropriately concerned with some of that -- those sources of uncertainty. But that being said, we think we've got an incredibly resilient portfolio right now, again, underpinned by that level of aftermarket position and a portfolio we think that will continue to perform well despite those uncertainties."

But if you really stand back and you look at us today, I just mentioned the strength of the portfolio and the repositioning and the level of aftermarket that gives us a strong foundation, but I think we're encouraged about the continued improvement in performance at Pall, with the addition of Cepheid and Phenomenex coming into the Life Sciences and Diagnostics portfolio and continuing to help us from -- both from a growth rate standpoint as well as from an operating margin lift.

And so we're -- in a reasonable market right now, I think we're winning share. So I think that's encouraging from an equipment and an infrastructure perspective, and we're seeing that globally. I think on the -- there's a different side of the story though, which is on the municipal business in North America, the day-to-day consumables business is not showing the kind of strength that I just represented at Trojan.

And so -- and that, obviously, for us is very typical for a large bolt-on or a midsize adjacency deal and really opens up a number of other possibilities. Jeff, this is a business, to your point about installed base versus consumables, where Phenomenex is -- has become the leader they are largely because they actually are equipment-agnostic and they focus on specific applications and workflows that address unique customer problems and, therefore, create unique customer value. We've had a partnership with Phenomenex at SCIEX for a number of years, and it's been a very successful one. But as some of you may recall, we're also consumables-agnostic in the sense of chromatography columns at SCIEX. And so what this allows us to do essentially is bring a greater variety, a broader set of solutions to our customers without necessarily having to have those consumables be captive by that install base. Obviously, that can be very attractive strategically when you have it, but in the particular case of the Life Science world, being able to customize solutions to -- for these unique applications and customer challenges is a real competitive advantage."

We have seen weakness in that market. We have not seen any particular cause for optimism in the academic market, particularly in the U.S. Europe has hung in there in pockets.

And there was clearly some better execution on our side in a number of different areas, and you've heard us speak in the past about some of the changes that we've made both organizationally and operationally. We have realigned our investments into some key areas from a new product perspective, and we're seeing the benefits there. Relative to the specific portions of the business that you mentioned, we are seeing strength in our equipment business, up mid-single digits; and, yes, the consumables business, up more like low single digits. And really, I think that has to do with a couple of different factors. We are executing well in the equipment side. We have new product initiatives that are making a difference there. And overall, I think we're well positioned from a portfolio perspective. You've heard the narrative from a number of different folks in the market around some softness during the course of July and August. I think we -- as the quarter came to a close in September, we started to certainly see some of that play through, and I think that absolutely varies by geography as well. I mentioned double-digit growth in places like China and India; but the U.S., much slower. And certainly, we're seeing some softness in Europe as well as Latin America and the Middle East. So definitely, a tale of 2 cities. You asked also about the equipment -- the implant side. Nobel continues to perform very well. They've got a number of new products in the market right now, which are helping in that growth rate, and they're executing well just on a commercial basis day in and day out. And some of that obviously has been a function of the implementation of DBS on the cost side, where we've been able to reallocate some of those funds into investments in sales and marketing as well as in R&D. Particularly in the third quarter, we made some significant investments in sales and marketing, and I think will pay off -- that will continue to pay off at Nobel with even improving growth rates."

Well, Ross, we have gotten quite a bit done here in the last couple of years with the separation that took place with Fortive and getting Fortive off to a great start, but then making some very important and strategic acquisitions to shore up really what were 3 of the most important strategic needs or opportunities that we had: Nobel on the implant and consumable side; as you mentioned, Pall, to enhance our Life Sciences, specifically biopharmaceutical production position; and then Cepheid, to improve our position relative to molecular diagnostics. We've had a focus strategically on the consumable side of Life Science and Phenomenex, to use your term, a crown jewel in the consumable side of Life Science. So I think we feel very good about where we are right now. I wouldn't trade our portfolio, the 4 segments that we have today of Diagnostics, Life Science, Dental and Environmental & Applied Solutions, for any portfolio in the market. And I think the game plan in the years ahead, as it has been in the past, is continue to deploy our free cash flow strategically, with a strong bias towards M&A, into these highly attractive segments. And I think the game plan, at least in the near term here, given the current position of the balance sheet and all that we have to do operationally with these acquisitions, is to focus on probably small or midsize bolt-ons that are strategically important to our position, that hopefully will -- as these have done, will be accretive to our growth rates and improve our growth trajectories. And hopefully, that would be the case certainly on the margin side, if not initially, certainly over time.

Business in China is up high single digits, real strength in Life Science, in Dental, in Diagnostics; some softness in Hach and Videojet. Those are businesses where that softness largely comes from equipment and more industrially-oriented end markets. And you've heard me mention a number of times the strength that we've seen in India, which has been very consistent level of strength over the last couple of years. And with those 2 markets being what they are, both the scale of those markets, the inherent growth rates in those markets and the strength of our positions, those are really where a great deal of our investment are going. We're largely doubling down in the markets where we have the greatest opportunities for growth in the near term. We -- what improvement we've seen, and it's been very modest, in places like Latin America, Brazil specifically and Russia are really more about easier comps than materially improved market conditions. And the Middle East continues to be weak. And so while we've sustained our positions there in terms of our feet on the street and our investments in commercializing new products in those markets, those have not been markets where we are significantly accelerating our investments today.

We're pleased with our third quarter results as our team continued to execute well despite the macroeconomic environment. We delivered solid core revenue growth with very strong adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow performance. The diversity and strength of our businesses has served us well in this modest growth environment. The recent separation of Fortive was an important step towards optimizing our portfolio, and we continue to strategically position Danaher for strong long-term growth through M&A. 
Since July, we have announced over $4.8 billion of acquisitions that will strengthen our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. In September, we announced the acquisition of Cepheid, a global leader in molecular diagnostics, and we recently announced the acquisition of Phenomenex, an outstanding chromatography consumables business that will be highly complementary to our Life Sciences portfolio. Combined with the execution benefits of DBS, we believe these exciting strategic additions will contribute to Danaher's growth trajectory and superior returns. We look forward to welcoming the Cepheid and Phenomenex teams to Danaher. 
With that as a backdrop, let's turn to the details of the third quarter. This morning, we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.87, an increase of more than 20% over last year. Sales grew 17.5% to $4.1 billion, with core revenue increasing 3%. Core growth was consistent across the portfolio, as each of our 4 reporting segments achieved at least 3% core revenue growth in the quarter. Currency translation had minimal impact while acquisitions increased revenues by 14.5%. 
Geographically, the high-growth markets led the way, driven by high single-digit growth in China and high-teens growth in India. Developed market core revenues were up low single digits. Modest growth in the U.S. and Western Europe was partially offset by declines in Japan. 
Gross margin for the third quarter was 55.3%, an increase of 140 basis points from last year. This increase in gross profit enabled us to increase our sales and marketing and R&D spend meaningfully in the quarter. Core operating margins were up 155 basis points in the quarter and 90 basis points year-to-date. This strong margin expansion helped to drive double-digit adjusted net earnings growth in the third quarter. During the quarter, we generated approximately $700 million of free cash flow from continuing operations, up 35%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%. 
Now let's take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenues were up 3% and reported revenues grew over 60%, largely due to the Pall acquisition. Core operating margin increased 180 basis points, and the reported operating profit margin increased to 15.4%. 
At Beckman Life Sciences, low single-digit core growth in the quarter was driven by momentum in China while developed markets were essentially flat. The backdrop of government investment in health care in China, coupled with Beckman's strong execution, contributed to double-digit gains in that region.  Beckman's particle counting and characterization business had another good quarter, with double-digit growth driven by global biopharmaceutical demand. 
The team also launched a new product that supports drug discovery and development. The Vi-CELL MetaFLEX is a biochemistry analyzer that resulted from a collaboration with one of our Diagnostic businesses, Radiometer. Beckman incorporated the technology behind Radiometer's blood gas analyzer to create the Vi-CELL MetaFLEX, which analyzes cell cultures, a crucial component in biotherapy production. This cross-pollination between Beckman and Radiometer is a powerful example of the unique opportunities we have at Danaher to bring greater value to customers by collaborating across the portfolio. 
Leica Microsystems core revenue declined in the quarter. Growth was impacted by weakness in the academic and industrial end markets, particularly in North America and Western Europe. This was partially offset by double-digit gains in the high-growth markets as China continued to be a bright spot, particularly for our confocal business. 
SCIEX posted another quarter of mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by global strength in pharmaceuticals and food as well as environmental testing. Geographically, we saw declines in Japan and in Europe, where academic weakness impacted results. In the high-growth markets, China and India each maintained strong double-digit growth. Our service offering continues to be a differentiator at SCIEX as the team drove further improvements in contract renewals and attachment rates in the quarter. 
As I mentioned at the start of the call, we recently announced our acquisition of Phenomenex, a leading player in chromatography consumables that supports a variety of analytical testing applications in the health, research and environmental segments. Phenomenex is 100% consumables, a high-margin business in an attractive mid-single-digit growth industry that is adjacent to where SCIEX participates. We expect to achieve a double-digit return on our investment in less than 5 years and believe that Phenomenex will help us to continue creating long-term value as part of our Life Sciences portfolio. 
Pall delivered another quarter of good growth and execution. Continued strength in biopharmaceutical end markets and demand for single-use technologies underpinned strong growth at Pall Life Sciences. Pall's market-leading solutions are at the forefront of the biopharma evolution, and 9 of the 12 new biologic drugs cleared by the FDA last year specified Pall products in their processes. This is a tremendous testament to the quality and reliability that Pall provides to its customers every day. 
Pall Industrial revenue was down in the quarter with solid gains in aerospace and microelectronics offset by declines in energy and machinery as heavy industrial end markets remained challenging. August marked the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of Pall Corporation, and the team's exceptional implementation of DBS has been a critical driver of what we've been able to accomplish thus far. Since the beginning of the year, Pall has achieved more than 150 basis points of gross margin expansion and improved operating margins by over 350 basis points. 
At the same time, we've been able to put some of that benefit back into sales and marketing and R&D. This reinvestment, combined with the team's thoughtful use of DBS growth tools, like accelerated product development and Obeya Rooms, has resulted in a number of key new products launching ahead of schedule this year. By delivering these impactful new solutions to the market sooner, we can deliver greater value to our customers and further enhance Pall's growth trajectory. 
Moving now to Diagnostics. Both reported and core revenues increased 3%. The team's solid execution generated 250 basis points of core operating margin expansion, and reported operating margins increased to 16%. Sustained strength in China and India was complemented by modest growth in the developed markets. 
Core revenue at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up low single digits, with growth in emerging markets partially offset by softer demand in North America and Europe. Recent installed base growth in China contributed to strong immunoassay performance in the quarter, with the business achieving double-digit recurring revenue in the region. 
One of our 5 core values at Danaher is: Customers talk, we listen. And Beckman Diagnostics recognizes the importance of helping customers drive performance across multiple labs with different needs and different test volumes. One of the ways we differentiate our offering is to partner with customers and help them integrate Danaher Business System tools and processes into their labs and workflows. The result can be tremendously impactful: better speed to results, operational efficiency and ultimately improved clinician workflows. 
The effectiveness of one such collaboration was recently highlighted by a customer that operates one of the largest regional lab networks in the Midwestern United States. Within 6 months, Beckman helped them implement over 180 analyzers and 4 automation lines at 30 different hospitals and lab locations without any patient disruption. This customer was recently awarded the prestigious ADVANCE Laboratory of the Year award for 2016 and has mentioned their partnership with Beckman and the adoption of DBS tools as a key factor in their labs' transformational success. 
Radiometer achieved mid-single-digit core revenue growth, led by continued double-digit growth in both China and India and solid performance in the developed markets. We saw robust demand for consumables across our portfolio of acute care diagnostic instruments. 
At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter, led by high single-digit growth in North America. An expanding installed base and strong consumable sales contributed to double-digit growth in our advanced staining business. 
Back in September, we announced our acquisition of Cepheid, a leading molecular diagnostics innovator in the fastest-growing segment of diagnostics. Cepheid has the largest global installed base of molecular diagnostics instruments, combined with the broadest test menu available. We expect this highly complementary addition to our Diagnostics portfolio to accelerate our growth strategy and further differentiate Danaher's diagnostics offering. We also foresee tremendous opportunities with the application of DBS at Cepheid, which we believe will help drive better top and bottom line performance. 
Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported revenues increased 3.5%, and reported operating margin increased slightly to 15%, with 20 basis points of core margin expansion. Core revenues were up 3%, driven by our equipment, implant and orthodontic product lines, while we saw softer demand for consumables in the quarter. Positive gains in North America were offset by weakness in Western Europe. Strength in high-growth markets was supported by another quarter of double-digit growth in China across all of our major dental product lines. 
Since 2010, we've grown our Dental revenues in China from $15 million to over $150 million today, and we're now positioned as one of the leading players in the region. We've evolved our business model as well in China to position ourselves as more of a localized player by expanding our R&D teams, increasing local commercial coverage and establishing manufacturing capabilities in the region. This approach, combined with our comprehensive product suite, enables us to provide a full service China-centric offering that enhances our customers' experiences and positions us well for continued growth in this market. 
Let's turn to Nobel Biocare. Nobel Biocare's core revenue grew at a low single-digit rate, with demand for implant systems and regeneratives driven by recently launched new products that have quickly gained traction with customers. Similar to what we saw across our other Dental businesses in the quarter, sales in Western Europe softened at Nobel while China continued to do well. The benefit of the team's operational and cost improvements using DBS continues to help fuel Nobel's new product and innovation engine. 
Turning to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Core revenues grew 3.5% with reported revenues up 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points, and reported operating margin was down slightly at 24.3%. 
In Product Identification, core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, and we saw strong demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our packaging and color solutions offerings improved sequentially and was led primarily by increased demand in the U.S. and Latin America. 
Videojet showed solid growth performance, delivering mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strength in developed markets and Latin America was modestly offset by declines in China, primarily due to industrial end market weakness. Videojet continued to grow the number of connected printers in the market, expanding our remote solutions offering for customers and driving high single-digit service revenue growth. 
Core revenue grew low single digits at Esko, led by increased demand at MediaBeacon, which we acquired in 2015. As a reminder, MediaBeacon provides digital asset management software that brand owners and packaging managers use to ensure accuracy and compliance. With the help of DBS tools like funnel management and transformative marketing, MediaBeacon has generated greater market awareness and demand for our integrated solutions, which support customers across their full brand and packaging workflows. At X-Rite, core revenue grew low single digits, with strong performance in North America and China partially offset by the rest of Asia. 
Lastly, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue growth for the platform increased at a low single-digit rate. Hach's core revenue declined slightly in the quarter as industrial end market weakness contributed to softer demand in North America and China. We saw similarly lackluster activity in Eastern Europe as constrained government funding and political instability affected municipal projects. We anticipate better core growth at Hach in the fourth quarter. 
ChemTreat core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate as the team delivered solid commercial execution and expanded their customer base in the U.S. Strength in North America and the food and beverage end markets was partially offset by lower demand in Latin America, particularly in the more commodity-oriented markets. 
At Trojan, core revenue increased double digits, driven by consistent municipal demand across developed and emerging markets. Our increased municipal systems installed base contributed to strong replacement growth, and bidding activity was up low single digits globally. A few key municipal project wins materialized in Asia as ultraviolet water treatment solutions have gained interest in the region. 
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our performance in the current macroeconomic environment. We believe that the steps we've taken to reshape our portfolio positions us well for stronger growth and value creation. The diversity and strength of our businesses, combined with our team's focused execution using the Danaher Business System, is what sustains our competitive advantage. We believe that this combination will continue to serve both our customers and our shareholders well. 
We are initiating fourth quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes fourth quarter core revenue growth comparable to the third quarter of 2016. For the full year 2016, we're raising our adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations guidance to $3.57 to $3.61, which, at the midpoint, would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015."

Scott, we're very, very pleased with the performance of the team, both the Danaher team that has joined the team at Pall as well as the legacy Pall associates. The combination of those 2 teams has gotten the business off to a tremendous start in the first year. DBS has played a huge role in the progress that we've made there. As you might recall, that team had sort of begun the journey before we arrived on the scene, but the combination of the Danaher team that's gone in and the Pall team have really accelerated the pace of progress. There have been over 350 kaizens that have been completed both on operational side as well as on the commercial side. We've seen the tremendous lift in core operating margins in that business. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we're now seeing the investment in some of the sales and marketing and the new product areas start to make a real difference in terms of getting new products not only launched but commercialized on time and effectively. So we're off to a good start. You know we took the improvements from a cost standpoint up from $60 million in the first year to $100 million. So we're a little bit ahead of schedule in that respect. And I think, obviously, that lifts the returns here in the near term. Relative to where we'll end up on a 4-, 5-year basis and beyond, I think, again, we're off to a very good start. I think we have a lot of opportunity to lift those returns, but it's still early days. And there's a lot of hard work to be done in the months and quarters and years ahead, but a great start."

And so as those businesses begin to improve both from the standpoint of our execution, and DBS is playing a role there from a new product execution standpoint and a commercialization perspective, when those improvements kick in and we get some lift from the macro, I think the big benefit you're going to see is in terms of the core growth of that business and the readthrough on an operating margin basis from that core growth. I don't know that it necessarily changes trajectory from a cost-out perspective. We're working on the cost structures, both on the Life Science side and on the industrial side as well as across the horizontal components of G&A. So I think the real lift comes when we start to see that core growth turn positive and we start to see the readthrough from that growth."

I do think, though, there's a number of considerations that go into how we look at the fourth quarter. I mean it starts with how pleased we are with the performance to this point in the third quarter, with all 4 segments driving at least 3% core growth. And I think now with a portfolio where greater than 60% of the revenues are in the aftermarket and where there's some stability in these markets but not necessarily anything positive to write home about macroeconomically, I think there is cause for some degree of caution in the outlook. You're reading the same macroeconomic news that everybody else is and, certainly, that we are. There's a number of sources of uncertainty in the market today, whether that's the election uncertainty in the U.S.; the Brexit uncertainty throughout Europe; the questions around turns in some of the high-growth markets or previously known as high-growth markets, as I sometimes say, around places like Latin America, the Middle East, Russia, and particularly those markets with a good deal of commodity exposure and certainly those with a high degree of industrial exposure. So it's hard not to be appropriately concerned with some of that -- those sources of uncertainty. But that being said, we think we've got an incredibly resilient portfolio right now, again, underpinned by that level of aftermarket position and a portfolio we think that will continue to perform well despite those uncertainties."

But if you really stand back and you look at us today, I just mentioned the strength of the portfolio and the repositioning and the level of aftermarket that gives us a strong foundation, but I think we're encouraged about the continued improvement in performance at Pall, with the addition of Cepheid and Phenomenex coming into the Life Sciences and Diagnostics portfolio and continuing to help us from -- both from a growth rate standpoint as well as from an operating margin lift. And then as we've mentioned before, we think there's plenty of opportunity for continued improvement in growth in our Diagnostics business, in our Life Science -- in a number of our Life Science businesses as well as in Dental.

But I wouldn't say that, that bidding activity necessarily suggests that, that double-digit growth rate is a sustainable one. This is more of a -- probably a mid-single-digit type of market. But we have been very encouraged by the performance at Trojan. Their competitiveness, I think, is -- has read through in terms of their win rates. And so we're -- in a reasonable market right now, I think we're winning share. So I think that's encouraging from an equipment and an infrastructure perspective, and we're seeing that globally. I think on the -- there's a different side of the story though, which is on the municipal business in North America, the day-to-day consumables business is not showing the kind of strength that I just represented at Trojan. We're seeing low single-digit growth in that market right now. It's still a very good market, and Hach continues to be gaining share there, but not nearly at the rate that we're seeing some of the infrastructure build out in certain markets."

And we're thrilled to be able to acquire this asset. We've admired that business for a long time. We were able to acquire it at an attractive valuation. And I think for those who've asked us about return thresholds in the past, this is clearly a business that we believe we will achieve double-digit return on invested capital in less than 5 years. And so -- and that, obviously, for us is very typical for a large bolt-on or a midsize adjacency deal and really opens up a number of other possibilities. Jeff, this is a business, to your point about installed base versus consumables, where Phenomenex is -- has become the leader they are largely because they actually are equipment-agnostic and they focus on specific applications and workflows that address unique customer problems and, therefore, create unique customer value. We've had a partnership with Phenomenex at SCIEX for a number of years, and it's been a very successful one. But as some of you may recall, we're also consumables-agnostic in the sense of chromatography columns at SCIEX. And so what this allows us to do essentially is bring a greater variety, a broader set of solutions to our customers without necessarily having to have those consumables be captive by that install base. Obviously, that can be very attractive strategically when you have it, but in the particular case of the Life Science world, being able to customize solutions to -- for these unique applications and customer challenges is a real competitive advantage."

We have realigned our investments into some key areas from a new product perspective, and we're seeing the benefits there. Relative to the specific portions of the business that you mentioned, we are seeing strength in our equipment business, up mid-single digits; and, yes, the consumables business, up more like low single digits. And really, I think that has to do with a couple of different factors. We are executing well in the equipment side. We have new product initiatives that are making a difference there. And overall, I think we're well positioned from a portfolio perspective. You've heard the narrative from a number of different folks in the market around some softness during the course of July and August. I think we -- as the quarter came to a close in September, we started to certainly see some of that play through, and I think that absolutely varies by geography as well. I mentioned double-digit growth in places like China and India; but the U.S., much slower. And certainly, we're seeing some softness in Europe as well as Latin America and the Middle East. So definitely, a tale of 2 cities. You asked also about the equipment -- the implant side. Nobel continues to perform very well. They've got a number of new products in the market right now, which are helping in that growth rate, and they're executing well just on a commercial basis day in and day out. And some of that obviously has been a function of the implementation of DBS on the cost side, where we've been able to reallocate some of those funds into investments in sales and marketing as well as in R&D. Particularly in the third quarter, we made some significant investments in sales and marketing, and I think will pay off -- that will continue to pay off at Nobel with even improving growth rates."

Well, Ross, we have gotten quite a bit done here in the last couple of years with the separation that took place with Fortive and getting Fortive off to a great start, but then making some very important and strategic acquisitions to shore up really what were 3 of the most important strategic needs or opportunities that we had: Nobel on the implant and consumable side; as you mentioned, Pall, to enhance our Life Sciences, specifically biopharmaceutical production position; and then Cepheid, to improve our position relative to molecular diagnostics. We've had a focus strategically on the consumable side of Life Science and Phenomenex, to use your term, a crown jewel in the consumable side of Life Science. So I think we feel very good about where we are right now. I wouldn't trade our portfolio, the 4 segments that we have today of Diagnostics, Life Science, Dental and Environmental & Applied Solutions, for any portfolio in the market. And I think the game plan in the years ahead, as it has been in the past, is continue to deploy our free cash flow strategically, with a strong bias towards M&A, into these highly attractive segments. And I think the game plan, at least in the near term here, given the current position of the balance sheet and all that we have to do operationally with these acquisitions, is to focus on probably small or midsize bolt-ons that are strategically important to our position, that hopefully will -- as these have done, will be accretive to our growth rates and improve our growth trajectories.

Beckman, obviously a more recent acquisition, but still, 5 years ago, we've seen great lift in those operating margins to this point. But as I mentioned, Beckman represents a large business. It still has quite a bit of headroom for margin improvement. And so we've seen it at this point, but we think there's more runway ahead."

What we are seeing is a continued increase in the gross margin side, continued leverage on the G&A side while we're also stepping up R&D and sales and marketing.

I would add as a footnote probably seeing some incremental signs of weakness in Western Europe, where our overall numbers in Q3 were pretty comparable to what we had in the first half. Tom alluded to the academic comment, seeing a little bit of that industrial weakness in places like Hach. Not a big change, but probably on the margin, the tone is a little bit cautious in Western Europe. And Japan, we continue to be down low to mid-single digits."
