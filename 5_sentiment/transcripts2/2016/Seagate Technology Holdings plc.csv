Our second fiscal quarter results reflect in line performance in revenues and margins and outperformance on the committed cost control measures. For the December quarter, Seagate ach",1332,"Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 
Our second fiscal quarter results reflect in line performance in revenues and margins and outperformance on the committed cost control measures. For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $3 billion, and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 25.6%, net income of $246 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.82. 
Our HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were 60.6 exabytes, up 10% sequentially. Within this, enterprise exabyte shipments were up 21% sequentially, reflecting strong demand for our high-capacity enterprise products. Average capacity per enterprise drive was a new record of 2.2 terabytes, up 15% year-over-year. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the December quarter were $453 million. On a year-over-year basis, we have reduced our quarterly expense run rate by almost $100 million or 17%, reflecting reductions around the core business, adjacencies, restructuring activities and lower variable compensation. 
Overall inventory levels were down 5% with improved linearity, and capital expenditures were in line with our expectations. 
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $382 million, and free cash flow was $245 million, equating to free cash flow of $0.81 per diluted share. Fiscal year-to-date, we have generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations and forecast cash flow from operations to be approximately $500 million for the March quarter. 
Our capital return to shareholders remains a top priority at Seagate, and we continue to balance the effective investment in our storage technology portfolio with shareholder returns and within an investment-grade framework. There has been no change to our capital allocation policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter works comfortably within our cash flow generation forecast. We have redeemed 23 million shares fiscal year-to-date, and considering the macroeconomic environment and investor sentiment, we view the stock as being attractive at these levels. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 296 million shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is manageable, particularly in light of what other technology companies have done and are planning to do in the public markets. 
Seagate is focused on maximizing our opportunities in the areas of the storage market that will position us to grow our top line, optimize the value of our core technology, continue to generate strong cash flow and create value for shareholders. Our specific areas of near-term activity for Seagate's management team are around our product portfolio monetization, operational efficiencies and continued financial discipline. 
Throughout the decades of storage technology innovation at Seagate, we've maintained a high priority on investing in R&D and acquiring right assets to provide the most reliable, cost-effective and workload-optimized storage products for customers. Market demand for storage is across multiple forms and locations, including on-premise for performance in the cloud for availability and directly on purpose built and market devices. We have many new products designed for these different workloads, including HDDs, Cloud Systems and Flash technology products. 
In the nearline market, we have begun the initial ramp of our 10-terabyte helium product, and we are shipping our 8-terabyte conventional products in high volume. We continue to believe high-capacity enterprise demand will grow in calendar 2016, and our portfolio improvements position us well for full participation in this market. 
Surveillance and video applications are growing rapidly, and we are seeing strong demand for products specifically designed for these workflows. Our retail, gaming and client offerings are continuing to move to higher capacity points and are benefiting from the recent launch of products with industry-leading areal density. 
In October, we acquired Dot Hill Systems to our Cloud Systems business, and later in the quarter, the divestiture sale of EVault was announced. We believe this strategy positions us to leverage a broader storage systems and all-Flash every portfolio across a more focused set of storage OEM customers and channel partners. 
In addition, our ClusterStor high-performance compute end-to-end systems solutions continued to gain traction in high-performance compute markets, and we are excited about several vertical market opportunities we are targeting within our channel partners -- with our channel partners.
We recently announced products at the Supercomputing '15 Show. That included a workload optimization HPC drive, emphasizing our direction to create solutions using all elements of Seagate's portfolio. 
Seagate's Flash technology product portfolio has grown significantly over the last 2 years and includes enterprise, SaaS SSDs, PCIe accelerator cards, SATA controllers, all-Flash arrays and hybrid HDDs. In December, we had a strong quarter in our PCIe business, and we are now sampling our PCIe and BME product set. Our enterprise SaaS SSD qualifications continue to be on track and are in evaluations with multiple customers. 
Combined, we are planning for our cloud storage systems and Silicon business to exit fiscal year '16 at a revenue run rate of over $1 billion a year. This will position us for continued success and profitability in fiscal year '17, as several areas of these markets are projected to grow double digits over the next few years. 
Through the expansion of our HDD portfolio and new business adjacencies, we are having success in broadening our global hyperscale customer base and strengthening our channel partners. To best serve our customers and improve operational efficiencies within our market-facing functions, we announced in January the alignment of our Global Markets and Customer organization under Dave Mosley. We thank Rocky Pimentel for his leadership of our sales and marketing organization, and we will continue to benefit from his strategic insights in his new role as an Executive Vice President. Personally, I'm looking forward to working with our executive team over the next several years as we continue to lead Seagate in serving our global -- growing global customer base, expanding our storage portfolio, strengthening our competitive position and optimizing our business for continued financial performance. 
Turning to our business outlook. In the last several quarters, we have discussed our concerns over global economic conditions, particularly in Europe and China, which have proven accurate and, we believe, will persist at least through June this calendar year. While we are cognizant of the ongoing challenges of the macroeconomic environment, the IT transformational shifts present significant opportunities for us to continue to be a leader in core storage technology and deliver value to shareholders. As we align our storage product portfolio to capitalize upon these market dynamics, our revenue opportunities are shifting with hyperscale customers continuing to drive strong exabyte growth with capital expenditure compounded annual growth rates of 40%. At the same time, our exposure to the traditional PC client market is changing and now represents less than 35% of total revenue. 
In light of these macro conditions and technology shifts, we took purposeful and thoughtful action last year to reduce our operating expenses and evaluated areas where investments were not paying off, resulting in measurable operating expense reduction and cost control implementation across our business. 
Taking into account macroeconomic factors, we believe overall storage market demand will be seasonally down in the March quarter, which has ranged between 5% and 10% over the last 5 years. We are planning for revenues to be approximately $2.7 billion, which reflects the high-end of the seasonal demand trend, and operating expenses to be sequentially flat. We're forecasting cash flow from operations for the March quarter to be sequentially higher at approximately $500 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP gross margins will be sequentially flat in the March quarter and ongoing activities that will improve our profitability, including raising prices in certain markets, aggressive product transitions and internal and external supply chain optimization such as reducing manufacturing capacity. 
Based on these factors and expected growth in the nearline storage market, we still expect that our gross margins will be in our target range of 27% to 32% for the June quarter. 
I would like to thank our customers, suppliers and employees for their continued support as well as our shareholders, and we're now ready for Q&A."

I think, in terms of the macro, macro view on the industry. I think -- I still think the investing world is not quite grasping the transitions around where storage is being stored. It's locale of the storage, not",801,"Well, I guess, a couple of answers, Rich. I think, in terms of the macro, macro view on the industry. I think -- I still think the investing world is not quite grasping the transitions around where storage is being stored. It's locale of the storage, not the amount of what's being stored that's basically shifting. And those have architectural implications and architectural implications are actually enhancing applications, so it's feeding off of one another. But from every source of data that we have, you still have 95% to 98% of your bits are ultimately being stored on a disk drive or more. As you know, cloud infrastructures usually replicate. So even though there is a reduced number of drives being going in the client, the data being generated of that client is ultimately stored on a disk drive. And as it turns out, it's actually stored in a disk drive that is harder to make and takes more absorption in the factories in terms of number of heads and the cost is in those heads and disks, it's quite a bit higher. So from a manufacturer's perspective, it's a good thing if you're getting more absorption. That being said, there is a lot of growth in the Silicon-related pieces of the business, not at the expense of the HDD business per se. And that's an area that we're serious about, obviously. We're building what we think is a very good business, both at the systems level and the device level. And it stands what we do with HDDs as well as how we incorporate various levels of silicon and all-Flash arrays and other devices. So we like the overall storage business, and we particularly like the fact that we think the HDD business itself is going to benefit from the continued trend of more people being more connected, generating richer contents. So I think, to that point, when you look at the competitive aspects, the WD Sandisk transaction is interesting on one level, that it certainly is a huge endorsement of the HDD industry because in order to pay back anywhere from $20 billion to $30 billion over 7 to 10 years just for the debt, that has to come from the HDD business because the Flash business obviously has its own capital means that are becoming more substantial because of the technology shift they're facing. So I think that's a big endorsement of -- if WD can generate $20 million, $30 billion over 10 years just to pay back debt and then you of a few capital and things on top of it, that sounds like a pretty good industry. And that's an industry that you think we are ahead technically, but if you want to save your equal, that's fine. But it's also one that we're entirely focused now and you're not going to be cutting R&D. And so when I look at the transaction, I do think it's tough to pay 40x earnings for a company and finance it all with debt. I do think that the interest expense on that transaction is obviously 2x what it should have been or what is maybe expected to be 6 months ago. And it felt to us like the operating expense reductions side of $1 billion were aggressive, in light of the factors only $4 billion of OpEx to begin with. And we've always viewed WD as a pretty lean organization. So to say that there's $1 billion coming out of that business, that may be true, but then some of it's got to be coming out of R&D. And that's not what we're doing. And so we believe investing your core technology, when at the product level. And then on top of it, there is this technology shift that as it does relate to our Silicon business, we want to make sure that we have access to the best silicon technology. And as we stack up the various players, you have Samsung as the clear leader, both in terms of capital and technology. They've announced this third fab, $17 billion, thank you, in 3D. Hynix is doing great in 3D, and we have good dialogue with them. Micron and Intel, leading with 3D Crosspoint, and 3D Crosspoint, of course, micron is a great technology player as well. So we think our engagement with those companies, which is quite active provides us access to the technology that we need to pursue our silicon strategy. And we do think that the recent shift in Toshiba's position on what they can do with planar does raise questions of how they're going to go be with companies to have 2 to 10x their capital budgets. So we feel pretty good about the industry, and we certainly feel good about our relative position."

But the pricing is like-for-like in certain rate market rise. It's not -- we're not talking mix. We're talking about prices that have addressed the value of the products, and then a lot of the clients is just ridiculous. And I think I've made this statement a year ago that the industry was not serving itself by subsidizing client products by trying to sell more nearline products to stay within the margin range because this day would come that you don't have any room left. And I take now the industry is recognizing it. And whether or not you make a 10 points of margin on the client or 5 points, it's nowhere near 20, which is what some people cited. And it's nowhere near where you need to basically funded technology going forward. So this could have to be a adjustment on the client side to reflect what we do. So that's the price, and I think that goes across certain markets, and it's like-for-like. We show 10% growth sequentially in exabyte shipments for us, up to 60.6 exabytes.

So if you had asked me where was my gauging of that Toshiba being the business in the next 1 to 3 years today versus where was it 6 months or a year ago, I would feel -- I'm much more towards the end that they're not going to be in this business in the next 1 to 3 years just because I don't see how they can be competitively, given where areal density is going and given manufacturing is. And they've given some more bigger corporate issues. I just can't imagine that that's really where they want to spend their R&D expense or, frankly, their cash flow."

Our second fiscal quarter results reflect in line performance in revenues and margins and outperformance on the committed cost control measures. For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $3 billion and, on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 25.6%, net income of $246 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.82. 
Our HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were 60.6 exabytes, up 10% sequentially. Within this, enterprise exabyte shipments were up 21% sequentially, reflecting strong demand for our high-capacity enterprise products. Average capacity per enterprise drive was a new record of 2.2 terabytes, up 15% year-over-year. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the December quarter were $453 million. On a year-over-year basis, we have reduced our quarterly expense run rate by almost $100 million or 17%, reflecting reductions around the core business, adjacencies, restructuring activities and lower variable compensation. 
Overall inventory levels were down 5% with improved linearity, and capital expenditures were in line with our expectations. 
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $382 million. And free cash flow was $245 million, equating to free cash flow of $0.81 per diluted share. Fiscal year-to-date, we have generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations and forecast cash flow from operations to be approximately $500 million for the March quarter. 
Our capital return to shareholders remains a top priority at Seagate, and we continue to balance the effective investment in our storage technology portfolio with shareholder returns and within an investment-grade framework. There has been no change to our capital allocation policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter works comfortably within our cash flow generation forecast. We have redeemed 23 million shares fiscal year-to-date. And considering the macroeconomic environment and investor sentiment, we view the stock as being attractive at these levels. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 296 million shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is manageable, particularly in light of what other technology companies have done and are planning to do in the public markets. 
Seagate is focused on maximizing our opportunities in areas of the storage market that will position us to grow our top line, optimize the value of our core technology, continue to generate strong cash flow and create value for shareholders. Our specific areas of near-term activity for Seagate's management team are around our product portfolio monetization, operational efficiencies and continued financial discipline. 
Throughout the decades of storage technology innovation at Seagate, we've maintained a high priority on investing in R&D and acquiring the right assets to provide the most reliable, cost-effective and workload-optimized storage products for customers. Market demand for storage is across multiple forms and locations, including on-premise for performance, in the cloud for availability and directly on purpose built and market devices. We have many new products designed for these different workloads, including HDDs, Cloud Systems and Flash technology products. 
In the nearline market, we have begun the initial ramp of our 10-terabyte helium product, and we are shipping our 8-terabyte conventional products in high volume. We continue to believe high-capacity enterprise demand will grow in calendar 2016, and our portfolio improvements position us well for full participation in this market. 
Surveillance and video applications are growing rapidly, and we are seeing strong demand for products specifically designed for these workflows. Our retail, gaming and client offerings are continuing to move to higher capacity points and are benefiting from the recent launch of products with industry-leading areal density. 
In October, we acquired Dot Hill Systems to our Cloud Systems business. And later in the quarter, the divestiture sale of EVault was announced. We believe this strategy positions us to leverage a broader storage systems and all-Flash array portfolio across a more focused set of storage OEM customers and channel partners. 
In addition, our ClusterStor high-performance compute end-to-end system solutions continue to gain traction in the high-performance compute market, and we are excited about several vertical market opportunities we are targeting within our channel partners -- with our channel partners.
We recently announced products at the Supercomputing '15 show that included a workload optimization HPC drive, emphasizing our direction to create solutions using all elements of Seagate's portfolio. 
Seagate's Flash technology product portfolio has grown significantly over the last 2 years, and includes enterprise SaaS SSDs, PCIe accelerator cards, SATA controllers, all-Flash arrays and hybrid HDDs. In December, we had a strong quarter in our PCIe business, and we are now sampling our PCIe and VME product set. Our enterprise SaaS SSD qualification activities continue to be on track and are in evaluations with multiple customers. 
Combined, we are planning for our cloud storage systems and silicon business to exit fiscal year '16 at a revenue run rate of over $1 billion a year. This will position us for continued success and profitability in fiscal year '17, as several areas of these markets are projected to grow double digits over the next few years. 
Through the expansion of our HDD portfolio and new business adjacencies, we are having success in broadening our global hyperscale customer base and strengthening our channel partners. To best serve our customers and improve operational efficiencies within our market-facing functions, we announced in January the alignment of our Global Markets and Customer organization under Dave Mosley. We thank Rocky Pimentel for his leadership of our sales and marketing organization, and we will continue to benefit from his strategic insights in his new role as an Executive Vice President. Personally, I'm looking forward to working with our executive team over the next several years as we continue to lead Seagate in serving our global -- growing global customer base, expanding our storage portfolio, strengthening our competitive position and optimizing our business for continued financial performance. 
Turning to our business outlook. In the last several quarters, we have discussed our concerns over global economic conditions, particularly in Europe and China, which have proven accurate, and we believe will persist at least through June this calendar year. While we are cognizant of the ongoing challenges of the macroeconomic environment, the IT transformational shifts present significant opportunities for us to continue to be a leader in core storage technology and deliver value to shareholders. As we align our storage product portfolio to capitalize upon these market dynamics, our revenue opportunities are shifting, with hyperscale customers continuing to drive strong exabyte growth, with capital expenditure compounded annual growth rates of 40%. At the same time, our exposure to the traditional PC client market is changing and now represents less than 35% of total revenue. 
In light of these macro conditions and technology shifts, we took purposeful and thoughtful action last year to reduce our operating expenses and evaluated areas where investments were not paying off, resulting in measurable operating expense reduction and cost control implementation across our business. 
Taking into account macroeconomic factors, we believe overall storage market demand will be seasonally down in the March quarter, which has ranged between 5% and 10% over the last 5 years. We are planning for revenues to be approximately $2.7 billion, which reflects the high end of the seasonal demand trend, and operating expenses to be sequentially flat. We're forecasting cash flow from operations for the March quarter to be sequentially higher at approximately $500 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP gross margins will be sequentially flat in the March quarter and ongoing activities that will improve our profitability, including raising prices in certain markets, aggressive product transitions and internal and external supply chain optimization, such as reducing manufacturing capacity. 
Based on these factors and expected growth in the nearline storage market, we still expect that our gross margins will be in our target range of 27% to 32% for the June quarter. 
I would like to thank our customers, suppliers and employees for their continued support as well as our shareholders, and we're now ready for Q&A."

I think in terms of the macro view on the industry, I think -- I still think the investing world is not quite grasping the transitions around where storage is being stored. It's locale of the storage. It's not the amount of what's being stored that's basically shifting. And those have architectural implications. And architectural implications are actually enhancing the applications, so it's feeding off of one another. But from every source of data that we have, you still have 95% to 98% of your bits are ultimately being stored on a disk drive or more. As you know, cloud infrastructures usually replicate. So even though there is a reduced number of drives being going in the client, the data being generated to that client is still ultimately stored on a disk drive. And as it turns out, it's actually stored in a disk drive that is harder to make and takes more absorption in the factories in terms of number of heads and disks. And the content in those heads and disks is quite a bit higher. So from a manufacturer's perspective, it's a good thing because you're getting more absorption. That being said, there is a lot of growth in the silicon-related pieces of the business, not at the expense of the HDD business per se. And that's an area that we're serious about, obviously. We're building what we think is a very good business, both at the systems level and the device level, and it stands what we do with HDDs as well as how we incorporate various levels of silicon all the way up to all-Flash arrays and other devices. So we like the overall storage business, and we particularly like the fact that we think the HDD business itself is going to benefit from the continued trend of more people being more connected, generating richer content. So I think to that point, when you look at the competitive aspects, the WD SanDisk transaction is interesting on one level, that it certainly is a huge endorsement of the HDD industry because in order to pay back anywhere from $20 billion to $30 billion over 7 to 10 years, just for the debt, that has to come from the HDD business because the Flash business obviously has its own capital means that are becoming more substantial because of the technology shift they're facing. So I think that's a big endorsement of if WD can generate $20 million, $30 billion over 10 years just to pay back debt, and then you have to do capital and things on top of it, that sounds like a pretty good industry. And it's an industry that we think we're ahead technically. But if you want to say we're equal, that's fine. But it's also one that we're entirely focused now, and we're not going to be cutting R&D. And so when I look at the transaction, I do think it's tough to pay 40x earnings for a company and finance it all with debt. I do think that the interest expense on that transaction is obviously 2x what it should have been or what is maybe expected to be 6 months ago. And it felt to us like the operating expense reductions cited of $1 billion were aggressive, in light of the fact there's only $4 billion of OpEx to begin with. And we've always viewed WD as a pretty lean organization. So to say that there's $1 billion coming out of that business, that may be true, but then some of it's got to be coming out of R&D. And that's not what we're doing. And so we believe invest in your core technology, win at the product level. And then on top of it, there is this technology shift that as it does relate to our silicon business, we want to make sure that we have access to the best silicon technology. And as we stack up the various players, you have Samsung as the clear leader, both in terms of capital and technology. They've announced this third fab, $17 billion, thank you, in 3D. Hynix is doing great in 3D, and we have good dialogue with them. Micron and Intel, leading with 3D XPoint. Of course, Micron's a great planar technology company as well. So we think our engagement with those companies, which is quite active, provides us access to the technology that we need to pursue our silicon strategy. And we do think that the recent shift in Toshiba's position on what they can do with planar does raise questions of how are they going to go compete with companies that have 2 to 10x the capital budgets. So we feel pretty good about the industry, and we certainly feel good about our relative position."

And I think now the industry is recognizing it. And whether or not you're making 10 points of margin on the client or 5 points, it's nowhere near 20, which is what some people cited. And it's no more near what you need to basically fund the technology going forward. So there's going to have to be adjustments on the client's side to reflect what we do.

Our second fiscal quarter results reflect in line performance in revenues and margins and outperformance on the committed cost control measures. For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $3 billion and, on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 25.6%, net income of $246 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.82. 
Our HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were 60.6 exabytes, up 10% sequentially. Within this, enterprise exabyte shipments were up 21% sequentially, reflecting strong demand for our high-capacity enterprise products. Average capacity per enterprise drive was a new record of 2.2 terabytes, up 15% year-over-year. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the December quarter were $453 million. On a year-over-year basis, we have reduced our quarterly expense run rate by almost $100 million or 17%, reflecting reductions around the core business, adjacencies, restructuring activities and lower variable compensation. 
Overall inventory levels were down 5% with improved linearity, and capital expenditures were in line with our expectations. 
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $382 million. And free cash flow was $245 million, equating to free cash flow of $0.81 per diluted share. Fiscal year-to-date, we have generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations and forecast cash flow from operations to be approximately $500 million for the March quarter. 
Our capital return to shareholders remains a top priority at Seagate, and we continue to balance the effective investment in our storage technology portfolio with shareholder returns and within an investment-grade framework. There has been no change to our capital allocation policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter works comfortably within our cash flow generation forecast. We have redeemed 23 million shares fiscal year-to-date. And considering the macroeconomic environment and investor sentiment, we view the stock as being attractive at these levels. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 296 million shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is manageable, particularly in light of what other technology companies have done and are planning to do in the public markets. 
Seagate is focused on maximizing our opportunities in areas of the storage market that will position us to grow our top line, optimize the value of our core technology, continue to generate strong cash flow and create value for shareholders. Our specific areas of near-term activity for Seagate's management team are around our product portfolio monetization, operational efficiencies and continued financial discipline. 
Throughout the decades of storage technology innovation at Seagate, we've maintained a high priority on investing in R&D and acquiring the right assets to provide the most reliable, cost-effective and workload-optimized storage products for customers. Market demand for storage is across multiple forms and locations, including on-premise for performance, in the cloud for availability and directly on purpose built and market devices. We have many new products designed for these different workloads, including HDDs, Cloud Systems and Flash technology products. 
In the nearline market, we have begun the initial ramp of our 10-terabyte helium product, and we are shipping our 8-terabyte conventional products in high volume. We continue to believe high-capacity enterprise demand will grow in calendar 2016, and our portfolio improvements position us well for full participation in this market. 
Surveillance and video applications are growing rapidly, and we are seeing strong demand for products specifically designed for these workflows. Our retail, gaming and client offerings are continuing to move to higher capacity points and are benefiting from the recent launch of products with industry-leading areal density. 
In October, we acquired Dot Hill Systems to our Cloud Systems business. And later in the quarter, the divestiture sale of EVault was announced. We believe this strategy positions us to leverage a broader storage systems and all-Flash array portfolio across a more focused set of storage OEM customers and channel partners. 
In addition, our ClusterStor high-performance compute end-to-end system solutions continue to gain traction in the high-performance compute market, and we are excited about several vertical market opportunities we are targeting within our channel partners -- with our channel partners.
We recently announced products at the Supercomputing '15 show that included a workload optimization HPC drive, emphasizing our direction to create solutions using all elements of Seagate's portfolio. 
Seagate's Flash technology product portfolio has grown significantly over the last 2 years, and includes enterprise SaaS SSDs, PCIe accelerator cards, SATA controllers, all-Flash arrays and hybrid HDDs. In December, we had a strong quarter in our PCIe business, and we are now sampling our PCIe and VME product set. Our enterprise SaaS SSD qualification activities continue to be on track and are in evaluations with multiple customers. 
Combined, we are planning for our cloud storage systems and silicon business to exit fiscal year '16 at a revenue run rate of over $1 billion a year. This will position us for continued success and profitability in fiscal year '17, as several areas of these markets are projected to grow double digits over the next few years. 
Through the expansion of our HDD portfolio and new business adjacencies, we are having success in broadening our global hyperscale customer base and strengthening our channel partners. To best serve our customers and improve operational efficiencies within our market-facing functions, we announced in January the alignment of our Global Markets and Customer organization under Dave Mosley. We thank Rocky Pimentel for his leadership of our sales and marketing organization, and we will continue to benefit from his strategic insights in his new role as an Executive Vice President. Personally, I'm looking forward to working with our executive team over the next several years as we continue to lead Seagate in serving our global -- growing global customer base, expanding our storage portfolio, strengthening our competitive position and optimizing our business for continued financial performance. 
Turning to our business outlook. In the last several quarters, we have discussed our concerns over global economic conditions, particularly in Europe and China, which have proven accurate, and we believe will persist at least through June this calendar year. While we are cognizant of the ongoing challenges of the macroeconomic environment, the IT transformational shifts present significant opportunities for us to continue to be a leader in core storage technology and deliver value to shareholders. As we align our storage product portfolio to capitalize upon these market dynamics, our revenue opportunities are shifting, with hyperscale customers continuing to drive strong exabyte growth, with capital expenditure compounded annual growth rates of 40%. At the same time, our exposure to the traditional PC client market is changing and now represents less than 35% of total revenue. 
In light of these macro conditions and technology shifts, we took purposeful and thoughtful action last year to reduce our operating expenses and evaluated areas where investments were not paying off, resulting in measurable operating expense reduction and cost control implementation across our business. 
Taking into account macroeconomic factors, we believe overall storage market demand will be seasonally down in the March quarter, which has ranged between 5% and 10% over the last 5 years. We are planning for revenues to be approximately $2.7 billion, which reflects the high end of the seasonal demand trend, and operating expenses to be sequentially flat. We're forecasting cash flow from operations for the March quarter to be sequentially higher at approximately $500 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP gross margins will be sequentially flat in the March quarter and ongoing activities that will improve our profitability, including raising prices in certain markets, aggressive product transitions and internal and external supply chain optimization, such as reducing manufacturing capacity. 
Based on these factors and expected growth in the nearline storage market, we still expect that our gross margins will be in our target range of 27% to 32% for the June quarter. 
I would like to thank our customers, suppliers and employees for their continued support as well as our shareholders, and we're now ready for Q&A."

I think in terms of the macro, macro view on the industry, I think -- I still think the investing world is not quite grasping the transitions around where storage is being stored.

I think in terms of the macro, macro view on the industry, I think -- I still think the investing world is not quite grasping the transitions around where storage is being stored. It's locale of the storage. It's not the amount of what's being stored that's basically shifting. And those have architectural implications. And architectural implications are actually enhancing the applications, so it's feeding off of one another. But from every source of data that we have, you still have 95% to 98% of your bits are ultimately being stored on a disk drive or more. As you know, cloud infrastructures usually replicate. So even though there is a reduced number of drives being -- going in the client, the data being generated to that client is still ultimately stored on a disk drive. And as it turns out, it's actually stored in a disk drive that is harder to make and takes more absorption in the factories in terms of number of heads and disks. And the content in those heads and disks is quite a bit higher. So from a manufacturer's perspective, it's a good thing because you're getting more absorption. That being said, there is a lot of growth in the silicon-related pieces of the business, not at the expense of the HDD business per se. And that's an area that we're serious about, obviously. We're building what we think is a very good business, both at the systems level and the device level, and it spans what we do with HDDs as well as how we incorporate various levels of silicon all the way up to all-Flash arrays and other devices. So we like the overall storage business, and we particularly like the fact that we think the HDD business itself is going to benefit from the continued trend of more people being more connected, generating richer content. So I think to that point, when you look at the competitive aspects, the WD SanDisk transaction is interesting on one level, that it certainly is a huge endorsement of the HDD industry because in order to pay back anywhere from $20 billion to $30 billion over 7 to 10 years, just for the debt, that has to come from the HDD business because the Flash business obviously has its own capital means that are becoming more substantial because of the technology shift they're facing. So I think that's a big endorsement of if WD can generate $20 million, $30 billion over 10 years just to pay back debt, and then you have to do capital and things on top of it, that sounds like a pretty good industry. And it's an industry that we think we're ahead technically. But if you want to say we're equal, that's fine. But it's also one that we're entirely focused now, and we're not going to be cutting R&D. And so when I look at the transaction, I do think it's tough to pay 40x earnings for a company and finance it all with debt. I do think that the interest expense on that transaction is obviously 2x what it should have been or what was maybe expected to be 6 months ago. And it felt to us like the operating expense reductions cited of $1 billion were aggressive, in light of the fact there's only $4 billion of OpEx to begin with. And we've always viewed WD as a pretty lean organization. So to say that there's $1 billion coming out of that business, that may be true, but then some of it's got to be coming out of R&D. And that's not what we're doing. And so we believe invest in your core technology, win at the product level. And then on top of it, there is this technology shift that, as it does relate to our silicon business, we want to make sure that we have access to the best silicon technology. And as we stack up the various players, you have Samsung as the clear leader, both in terms of capital and technology. They've announced this third fab, $17 billion, thank you, in 3D. Hynix is doing great in 3D, and we have good dialogue with them. Micron and Intel, leading with 3D XPoint. Of course, Micron's a great planar technology company as well. So we think our engagement with those companies, which is quite active, provides us access to the technology that we need to pursue our silicon strategy. And we do think that the recent shift in Toshiba's position on what they can do with planar does raise questions of how are they going to go compete with companies that have 2 to 10x the capital budgets. So we feel pretty good about the industry, and we certainly feel good about our relative position."

And then a lot of the client space, it's just ridiculous. And I think I've made this statement a year ago that the industry was not serving itself by subsidizing client products by trying to sell more nearline products to stay within the margin range because this day would come that you don't have any room left. And I think now the industry is recognizing it. And whether or not you're making 10 points of margin on the client or 5 points, it's nowhere near 20, which is what some people cited. And it's nowhere near what you need to basically fund the technology going forward. So there's going to have to be adjustments on the client side to reflect what we do. So that's the price comment that goes across certain markets, and it's like-for-like. We show 10% growth sequentially in exabyte shipments for us, up to 60.6 exabytes.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In addition to my usual commentary, I've extended the prepared remarks for today's call, and I've asked management team to cover a few important aspects of our business as it relates to the March quarter and the positioning of the company moving forward. We will discuss some of the actions we're taking to align with the near-term market realities and to improve the company's profitability and cash flow.
First, I will cover the higher-level trends we are seeing from customers and provide information as the direction we will be taking with the company with respect to structure and focus. Dave Morton will then walk through certain financial metrics. Dave Mosley will cover the HDD business, particularly with respect to our revolving product portfolio, and I'll close the call with our guidance for the June quarter and our general expectations for the second half of calendar 2016.
For the March quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.6 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 23%, net income of $66 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.22. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter were $439 million, reflecting cost controls and lower variable compensation. Overall inventory levels were down 11% sequentially and ended at the lowest level of finished goods, excluding the floods since June 2010. Capital expenditures of $95 million were in line with our expectations.
We believe Seagate's March quarter results are reflective of a generally weak macroeconomic environment as well as accelerating use of chips of technologies and architectures by end-users. Our HDD shipments for the March quarter were 39.2 million units and 55.6 exabytes, reflecting a seasonally lower TAM than expected overall. Into the March quarter, we initiated targeted pricing increases across our product line, and we were successful in some areas and unsuccessful in others. We continue to believe the industry needs a more stable pricing environment to deliver the higher-level of requirements being placed on our products and to realize the value we are providing to the market. As a result, we will continue to pursue a pricing strategy that reduces and properly reflects the investment in technology the market requires.
We experienced particular weakness in the client desktop markets as well as in the enterprise legacy market with offsetting strength in the enterprise nearline cloud market. Overall, average capacity per drive was 1.4 terabytes, up 30% year-over-year and within this nearline cloud, average capacity per drive was 3.9 terabytes, up 25% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, unit shipments were down 22% while total exabytes shipped were up 2%.
The decrease in the unit TAM in our markets presents challenges for Seagate that will require alignment through our operational footprint, and it pressures the overall HDD supply chain, especially for suppliers that are supplying 1 part per drive. However, we are encouraged by the trend toward significantly higher average capacity per drive applications, which results in greater absorption and in favor of HDD over any other storage device now in the foreseeable future in terms of cost as a function of required performance.
The continued advancement and adaptation of mobile and cloud-based computing architectures is reflected in the revenue shifts we are seeing in our portfolio. Our long-term business leases continues to be that there will be a significant transition in HD market from a historical split -- revenue split of 60% client and 40% enterprise revenue to 40% client and 60% enterprise revenue over the next several years. We also expect that the average capacity per drive will increase in all markets.
Most important to our product positioning and related investments is not just the mix between client enterprise but the mix shift within these markets. In the client space, we expect to continue decline in PC shipments that we anticipate to moderate in the next year. PC HDDs now represent about 56% of Seagate's client revenue and approximately 30% of the total company revenue. While overall PC client HDD revenue is declining, the remaining share is nominated by high-capacity products, which we continue to increase with the new product offerings that we have started to introduce in the June quarter. We are starting to see our client business shift to consumer, surveillance, gaming and DVR markets, which are all high-capacity user environments. We believe over the next several quarters, this growth will result in these combined markets being greater than the traditional PC compute market today. As an example, our consumer business revenues as a percentage of total client revenues have grown 6% in the last 12 months, whereas PC revenues as a percentage of client revenues have declined 6%. This is consistent with our belief that reducing the amounts of storage in certain client devices to another location.
In the enterprise market, revenue mix continues to trend from the legacy mission-critical market to the nearline cloud market. In the March quarter, we experienced unexpected weakness for our legacy mission-critical HDDs, which were approximately 700,000 units below our forecast.
While it's difficult to attribute the weakness in enterprise mission-critical between macroeconomic factors and architectural shifts, we expect further declines in the mission-critical market in June quarter, and then decline should moderate over the quarters thereafter.
This mission-critical market weakness in the March quarter was offset by nearline cloud upside demand of more than 500,000 units, of which we could only deliver 350,000 additional units due to the long lead times required to the bill demand. Importantly, in the March quarter, the average capacity for drive for the mission-critical HDDs that came out of our forecast versus the average capacity of 8 TB, 8 terabytes, for the nearline HDD upside demand we saw reflected a shift in exabytes of almost 6 to 1. Demand signals from our nearline customers has improved over the last few weeks, and we are planning for our fourth consecutive quarter of [indiscernible] with high demand for 8 terabyte portfolio and initial volume shipments of our 10-terabyte helium HDD product. As a result of these trends, as well as from our major cloud customers, we believe that these shifts from legacy to for enterprise applications has accelerated in the last 6 months and is now complementing the demand for cloud storage generated by consumer applications.
As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are aligning the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint, and we are reducing our capital expenditures to maintenance capital requirement levels. Through these actions, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity, and our operating philosophy will shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity. In the March quarter, we began the process of reducing our HDD manufacturing capacity from approximately 55 million to 60 million drives per quarter to approximately 35 million to 40 million drives per quarter. The actions required will be completed within the next 6 to 9 months. At the same time, we are continuing to accelerate the utilization of our own drive factories, internal and media facilities.
For fiscal '16 total, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $535 million, down approximately 28% over fiscal year '15. For fiscal year '17, assuming current outlook on demand, we are targeting an additional reduction in spending, reflecting a very low maintenance capital plan of approximately $400 million. In addition, we will continue to operating expense management actions across the company that aligns with the market trends. We believe that given the shifts in our product revenues discussed above as well as recognizing the full impact of the significant changes in our manufacturing footprint and operating expenses, the company will see revenue growth, product improvements and improved profitability, assuming a relatively stable macro environment. Dave Morton and Dave Mosley will go more detail into these activities. And I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton now."

With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial model that were impacted in Q3. I would like to provide some detail to these conditions to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion around the actions we are taking at the manufacturing and operating expense levels. For the March quarter, the addressable HDD and cloud storage systems markets were lower than forecast, impacting our revenue results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand fell short of our expectations, including traditional mission-critical HDD enterprise products and desktop client products, primarily in China. In addition, we made strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity notebook market. 
In our systems and silicon business, we experienced weaker-than-expected demand across most of the product lines. The lower-than-forecasted HDD demand impacted our production levels and increased our factory absorption costs. We also aggressively managed our finished goods in the quarter and improved our inventory levels by approximately $118 million. This reduction in inventory negatively impacted our factory utilization.
Combined, these factors were the primary reasons for our product gross margins declining approximately 290 basis points sequentially to approximately 23% with 80 basis points impact from the HDD revenue shortfall, 70 basis points from the systems and silicon business revenue shortfall and 140 basis points from factory underutilization. While we are disappointed, we did not anticipate the weaker demand in the March quarter. The company is evaluating and implementing a variety of actions to reduce the company's cost structure, which will result in financial improvements over the next several months. 
Towards our infrastructure cost alignment in fiscal Q3 alone, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $90 million of one-time restructuring charges, the write-off of certain fixed assets, certain terminated contracts and discontinued inventory.
We are currently sizing future non-reoccurring restructuring cash charges that we are estimating will be approximately $150 [ph] million over the next several quarters. We anticipate having more detailed actions identified within 60 days, and we will expect that the financial benefit of these actions will begin to have a positive impact in the September quarter with a full benefit of occurring in calendar 2017. As we formalize the specific actions and timing of cost savings, we will continue to provide updates to this framework. While we are still formulating all of the actions we will take to address gross margins of operating profit, we believe the overall cost alignment activities we will implement will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business with the goal of achieving a minimum of $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share in calendar 2017. For the March quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $439 million, slightly lower than forecasted. Looking ahead, our expenses in the June quarter will be relatively flat with additional cost reductions being planned for FY '17.
Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $205 million, and free cash flow was $110 million. Fiscal year-to-date, we have generated $1.4 billion in cash in operations. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 298 million shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is manageable. As announced today, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63. There has been no change to our dividend policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast albeit at a higher payout ratios than previously stated as our objective.
I'll now turn over the call to Dave Mosley to cover our HDD business in more detail."

Beginning with the nearline cloud product lines, our 8-terabyte business-critical product continues its aggressive volume ramp, and we've been essentially sold out for the months of March and April. We've had over 200% volume growth of 8-terabyte in the March quarter, and we anticipate continued growth in the June quarter. In addition our 10-terabyte product lines shift the large volume qualification units in the March quarter, and the volume growth is accelerating in the June quarter as well. We believe our 10-terabyte product to be leading in all performance and power metrics, and we're very happy with the feedback from our customers and our qualifications. In the clients base, as Steve said, the PC market continued to decline in Q3, and we began end-of-life activities on some of the older 500 gigabyte and below products that have very low margins. Most of the margin cost benefits of these product exits will be realized over the next few quarters. In the March quarter, we began the ramp of our 1 and 2 terabytes 7-millimeter 2.5-inch product line for our consumer notebook and DVR customers. This new product line allows us to address the target markets with lower costs and improved value propositions for our customers. Qualifications have gone well with customer interest high, and we anticipate shipping several million units in the June quarter. Initially, the product will be a consumer offering, moving to OEM offerings in September and December, and we believe we will have competitive technology leadership through the end of the calendar year. We are also accelerating the application of these same technologies into our 3.5-inch product lines for surveillance, mass and DVR at the end of the calendar year. The mission-critical market served by our 10,000 and 15,000 RPM products has been declining over the last few quarters, and we have seen traditional TAM of approximately 8 million to 8.5 million units per quarter decline to approximately 6.5 million to 7 million units in the March quarter. Within the mission-critical market, approximately 25% of the volumes are 15,000 RPM HDDs. This is the primary area where we are seeing a shift in low-end servers moving to lower-capacity Flash SSDs, and we expect this trend to continue. In 10,000 RPM HDD, there has been some technology shifts happening as well. However, we believe the 10,000 RPM HDD market will have a much longer transition horizon. Our goal over the coming months is to manage our forecasting conservatively with mission-critical TAM declines in the June quarter potentially leveling to modest declines in the back half of the year. Over the long-term, we believe the technology shifts in this market support our complementary investment thesis of Flash for performance and driving HDD for capacity architectures.
Shifting our HDD both volumes to higher capacity operating will allow us to simplify our labor requirements and optimize our product portfolio, which will not need further product refreshes for some time. Coupled with this, improved utilization of our own factories sized properly for the product for the market demand will improve our cost considerably. We realized our non-depreciation related fixed costs are high competitively and also too high for current demand. These cost items will be addressed sooner than those related to the manufacturing footprint. There are also many costs related to the product transitions that while temporarily driving a higher cost profile will allow us to improve our cost footprint in FY '17. With respect to the shift to higher-capacity products, we do need to be mindful of longer lead times and supply chain management requirements for these products. By engaging directly with a broader customer base and establishing deeper channel partners -- partnerships, we believe we will improve our sales operations efficiency and forecast facility. Thanks. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Given the recent published earnings results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporation that serve the global technology and industrial markets, we are planning for seasonal declines in revenue in the June quarter for most of the markets we serve with the exception of the nearline market. Based on these factors, as well as our decision not to participate in the low-capacity PC client market, we expect to achieve revenues of approximately $2.3 billion in the June quarter with relatively flat gross margins and operating expenses. We continue to expect that demand in the second half of calendar year '16 will be stronger than the first half with positive seasonal trends and continued growth in nearline demand, offset somewhat by macroeconomic pressures. With this anticipated revenue growth as well as the actions we are taking to align our manufacturing footprint and operating expense investments, gross margins and profitability will improve in the second half of the calendar year 2016. Should there be improvement in the overall macroeconomic conditions, we would expect to see improved HDD unit demand across all markets with commensurate benefits to the company's performance.

So the adjustments on manufacturing are both where we take our internal capacity, right, which was underabsorbed and then taking production inside, which was basically if you can think of it as additional traditional under absorption the nonoperating fixed cost or the cost of the factories themselves. So there's kind of a double effect of what happens once we bring the drives inside as well as reduce our overall footprint. But we would expect that the calendar year '17 revenues, other than maybe seasonal decline from December to March, should continue to grow, assuming the macro condition is stable, in part because also the portfolio gets a lot stronger with the 1 TB and the 2.5 and the 2 TB on the desktop, which are then product sets that are highly competitive we believe that at least 6 months ahead of competition and capacity points that are much more relevant to us in the client space."

I mean, in general, the gross profit dollars are about the same, which is why losing 700,000 [ph] units but picking up 3 50 heard us, the gross margin percentages are about the same. So as the shift continues, once you reach the crossover point where we can either meet that upside demand or naturally exceed whatever erosion continues in mission-critical, then you get growth there. And like you said, it's really hard to understand what's happening in mission-critical. Right now, it's being driven by macro or is it incursion by Flash certain segments of that. I think the answer is it's a little of both. And maybe the macro been accelerating the inclusion of Flash it doesn't really matter, it's not like it's going to reverse itself. So we're preparing for the continued decline of the 15K segment, but as Dave indicated, the 10-K segment from our customer is probably going to remain intact for a number of quarters, if not a number of years. So I think it's more about managing our investment in the portfolio going forward, which clearly means continue to emphasize the nearline, and again just adjusting the manufacturing footprint, so you're basically keeping pace or a little bit ahead of the declines so you're always sold-out versus having adjusted capacity. Dave will talk to it in more detail."

As we think about heading into the back half of the year, obviously, first and foremost, we're going to continue to invest in our business itself. As we stated, as we look at some of these one-time costs, restructuring cash charge, specifically around $150 million, we think that's very manageable over a generation in what we're able to yield here, again, over the next 6 to 9 months. And then as far as the dividend, we think that is well manageable albeit at the higher end of those levels of the payout ratio and, obviously, up to the Board of Directors.

And then in terms of what we would do with that cash flow, again, I think defending the dividend is the first thing that we would do. I'd certainly like to keep the dividend level where it is and initially obviously these are payout ratios above the 30% or [ph] 50% that we indicated. But the company is growing into that with improving revenues and margins, then certainly, we'd put the company in a position where the board has an easier decision to make than a couple other way around.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In addition to my usual commentary, I've extended the prepared remarks for today's call, and I've asked management team to cover a few important aspects of our business as it relates to the March quarter and the positioning of the company moving forward. We will discuss some of the actions we're taking to align with near-term market realities and to improve the company's profitability and cash flow.
First, I will cover the higher-level trends we are seeing from customers and provide information as the direction we will be taking with the company with respect to structure and focus. Dave Morton will then walk through certain financial metrics. Dave Mosley will cover the HDD business, particularly with respect to our evolving product portfolio, and I'll close the call with our guidance for the June quarter and our general expectations for the second half of calendar 2016.
For the March quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.6 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 23%, net income of $66 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.22. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter were $439 million, reflecting cost controls and lower variable compensation. Overall inventory levels were down 11% sequentially and ended at the lowest level of finished goods, excluding the floods since June 2010. Capital expenditures of $95 million were in line with our expectations.
We believe Seagate's March quarter results are reflective of a generally weak macroeconomic environment as well as accelerating usage chips [ph] of technologies and architectures by end users. Our HDD shipments for the March quarter were 39.2 million units and 55.6 exabytes, reflecting a seasonally lower TAM than expected overall.
In the March quarter, we initiated targeted pricing increases across our product line, and we were successful in some areas and unsuccessful in others. We continue to believe the industry needs a more stable pricing environment to deliver the higher level of requirements being placed on our products and to realize the value we are providing to the market. As a result, we will continue to pursue a pricing strategy that reduces and properly reflects the investment in technology the market requires.
We experienced particular weakness in the client desktop markets as well as in the enterprise legacy market, with offsetting strength in the enterprise nearline cloud market. Overall, average capacity per drive was 1.4 terabytes, up 30% year-over-year. And within this nearline cloud, average capacity per drive was 3.9 terabytes, up 25% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, unit shipments were down 22% while total exabytes shipped were up 2%.
The decrease in the unit TAM in our markets presents challenges for Seagate that will require alignment through operational footprint, and it pressures the overall HDD supply chain, especially for suppliers that are supplying 1 part per drive. However, we are encouraged by the trend towards significantly higher average capacity per drive applications, which results in greater absorption in heads and disk in favor of [ph] HDD over any other storage device now and in the foreseeable future in terms of cost as a function of required performance.
The continued advancement and adaptation of mobile and cloud-based computing architectures is reflected in the revenue shifts we are seeing in our portfolio. Our long-term business leases continues to be that there will be a significant transition in HD market from a historical split -- revenue split of 60% client and 40% enterprise revenue to 40% client and 60% enterprise revenue over the next several years. We also expect that the average capacity per drive will increase in all markets.
Most important to our product positioning and related investments is not just the mix between client enterprise but the mix shift within these markets. In the client space, we expect to continue decline in PC shipments that we anticipate to moderate in the next year. PC HDDs now represent about 56% of Seagate's client revenue and approximately 30% of the total company revenue. While overall PC client HDD revenue is declining, the remaining share is nominated by high-capacity products, which will continue to increase with the new product offerings that we have started to introduce in the June quarter.
We are starting to see our client business shift to consumer, surveillance, gaming and DVR markets, which are all high-capacity user environments. We believe, over the next several quarters, this growth will result in these combined markets being greater than the traditional PC compute market today. As an example, our consumer business revenues as a percentage of total client revenues have grown 6% in the last 12 months, whereas PC revenues as a percentage of client revenues have declined 6%. This is consistent with our belief that reducing the amount of storage on certain client devices propagates it to another location.
In the enterprise market, revenue mix continues to trend from the legacy mission-critical market to the nearline cloud market. In the March quarter, we experienced unexpected weakness for our legacy mission-critical HDDs, which were approximately 700,000 units below our forecast. While it's difficult to attribute the weakness in enterprise mission-critical between macroeconomic factors and architectural shifts, we expect further declines in the mission-critical market in the June quarter and then decline should moderate over the quarters thereafter.
This mission-critical market weakness in the March quarter was offset by nearline cloud upside demand of more than 500,000 units, of which we could only deliver 350,000 additional units due to the long lead times required to put bill demand. Importantly, in the March quarter, the average capacity per drive for the mission-critical HDDs that came out of our forecast versus the average capacity of 8 TB, 8 terabytes, for the nearline HDD upside demand we saw, reflected a shift in exabytes of almost 6 to 1. [ph]
Demand signals from our nearline customers has improved over the last few weeks. We are planning for our fourth consecutive quarter of growth with high demand for our 8 terabyte portfolio and initial volume shipments of our 10-terabyte helium HDD product. As a result of these trends as well as from input from our major cloud customers, we believe that the shifts from legacy to cloud for enterprise applications has accelerated in the last 6 months and is now complementing the demand for cloud storage generated by consumer applications.
As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are aligning the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint, and we are reducing our capital expenditures to maintenance capital requirement levels. Through these actions, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity, and our operating philosophy will shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity. In the March quarter, we began the process of reducing our HDD manufacturing capacity from approximately 55 million to 60 million drives per quarter to approximately 35 million to 40 million drives per quarter. The actions required will be completed within the next 6 to 9 months. At the same time, we are continuing to accelerate the utilization of our own drive factories, internal head and media facilities.
For fiscal '16, total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $535 million, down approximately 28% over fiscal year '15. For fiscal year '17, assuming current outlook on demand, we are targeting an additional reduction in spending, reflecting a very low maintenance capital plan of approximately $400 million. In addition, we will continue operating expense management actions across the company that aligns with the market trends.
We believe that given the shifts in our product revenues discussed above as well as recognizing the full impact of the significant changes in our manufacturing footprint and operating expenses, the company will see revenue growth, product gross margin improvements and improved profitability, assuming a relatively stable macro environment.
Dave Morton and Dave Mosley will into go more detail on these activities, and I'll call -- turn the call over to Dave Morton now."

With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial model that were impacted in Q3. I would like to provide some detail to these conditions to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion around the actions we are taking at the manufacturing and operating expense levels.
For the March quarter, the addressable HDD and cloud storage systems markets were lower than forecast, impacting our revenue results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand fell short of our expectations, including traditional mission-critical HDD enterprise products and desktop client products, primarily in China. In addition, we made strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity notebook market.
In our systems and silicon business, we experienced weaker-than-expected demand across most of the product lines. The lower-than-forecasted HDD demand impacted our production levels and increased our factory absorption costs. We also aggressively managed our finished goods in the quarter and improved our inventory levels by approximately $118 million. This reduction in inventory negatively impacted our factory utilization.
Combined, these factors were the primary reasons for our product gross margins declining approximately 290 basis points sequentially to approximately 23% with 80 basis points impact from the HDD revenue shortfall, 70 basis points from the systems and silicon business revenue shortfall and 140 basis points from factory underutilization. While we are disappointed, we did not anticipate the weaker demand in the March quarter. The company is evaluating and implementing a variety of actions to reduce the company's cost structure, which will result in financial improvements over the next several months. 
Towards our infrastructure cost alignment in fiscal Q3 alone, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $90 million of one-time restructuring charges, write-off of certain fixed assets, certain terminated contracts and discontinued inventory.
We are currently sizing future nonreoccurring restructuring cash charges that we are estimating will be approximately $150 million over the next several quarters. We anticipate having more detailed actions identified within 60 days, and we will expect that the financial benefit of these actions will begin to have a positive impact in the September quarter with the full benefit of occurring in calendar 2017.
As we formalize the specific actions and timing of cost savings, we will continue to provide updates to this framework. While we are still formulating all of the actions we will take to address gross margins and operating profit, we believe the overall cost alignment activities we will implement will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business with the goal of achieving a minimum of $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share in calendar 2017. For the March quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $439 million, slightly lower than forecasted. Looking ahead, our expenses in the June quarter will be relatively flat with additional cost reductions being planned for FY '17.
Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $205 million, and free cash flow was $110 million. Fiscal year-to-date, we have generated $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 298 million shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is manageable.
As announced today, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63. There has been no change to our dividend policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast albeit at a higher payout ratio than previously stated as our objective.
I'll now turn over the call to Dave Mosley to cover our HDD business in more detail."

Beginning with the nearline cloud product lines, our 8-terabyte business-critical product continues its aggressive volume ramp, and we've been essentially sold out for the months of March and April.
We've had over 200% volume growth of 8-terabyte in the March quarter, and we anticipate continued growth in the June quarter. In addition, our 10-terabyte product lines shipped a large volume of qualification units in the March quarter, and the volume growth is accelerating in the June quarter as well. We believe our 10-terabyte product to be leading in all performance and power metrics, and we're very happy with the feedback from our customers and our qualifications.
In the client space, as Steve said, the PC market continued to decline in Q3, and we began end-of-life activities on some of the older 500 gigabyte and below products that have very low margins. Most of the margin cost benefits of these product exits will be realized over the next few quarters.
In the March quarter, we began the ramp of our 1- and 2-terabyte 7-millimeter 2.5-inch product line for our consumer, notebook and DVR customers. This new product line allows us to address the target markets with lower costs and improved value propositions for our customers. Qualifications have gone well with customer interest high, and we anticipate shipping several million units in the June quarter.
Initially, the product will be a consumer offering, moving to OEM offerings in September and December, and we believe we will have competitive technology leadership through the end of the calendar year. We are also accelerating the application of these same technologies into our 3.5-inch product lines for surveillance, NAS and DVR at the end of the calendar year.
The mission-critical market served by our 10,000- and 15,000-RPM products has been declining over the last few quarters, and we have seen traditional TAM of approximately 8 million to 8.5 million units per quarter decline to approximately 6.5 million to 7 million units in the March quarter. Within the mission-critical market, approximately 25% of the volumes are 15,000-RPM HDDs. This is the primary area where we are seeing a shift in low-end servers moving to lower-capacity flash SSDs, and we expect this trend to continue. In 10,000-RPM HDD, there has been some technology shifts happening as well. However, we believe the 10,000-RPM HDD market will have a much longer transition horizon.
Our goal over the coming months is to manage our forecasting conservatively with mission-critical TAM declines in the June quarter potentially leveling to modest declines in the back half of the year. Over the long term, we believe the technology shifts in this market support our complementary investment thesis of flash for performance and driving HDD for capacity architectures.
Shifting our HDD build volumes to higher-capacity offerings will allow us to simplify our wafer requirements and optimize our product portfolio, which will not need further product refreshes for some time. Coupled with this, improved utilization of our own factories sized properly for the product -- for the market demand will improve our cost considerably.
We realize our non-depreciation related fixed costs are high competitively and also too high for current demand. These cost items will be addressed sooner than those related to the manufacturing footprint. There are also many costs related to the product transitions that while temporarily driving a higher cost profile will allow us to improve our cost footprint in FY '17.
With respect to the shift to higher-capacity products, we do need to be mindful of longer lead times and supply chain management requirements for these products. By engaging directly with a broader customer base and establishing deeper channel partnerships, we believe we will improve our sales operations efficiencies and forecast visibility.
Thanks. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Given the recent published earnings results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology and industrial markets, we are planning for seasonal declines in revenue in the June quarter for most of the markets we serve with the exception of the nearline market. Based on these factors as well as our decision not to participate in the low-capacity PC client market, we expect to achieve revenues of approximately $2.3 billion in the June quarter with relatively flat gross margins and operating expenses.
We continue to expect that demand in the second half of calendar year '16 will be stronger than the first half with positive seasonal trends and continued growth in nearline demand, offset somewhat by macroeconomic pressures. With this anticipated revenue growth as well as the actions we are taking to align our manufacturing footprint and operating expense investments, gross margins and profitability will improve in the second half of the calendar year 2016.

So the adjustments on manufacturing are both where we take our internal capacity, right, which was underabsorbed and then taking production inside, which was basically, if you can think of it as additional underabsorption, whether or not that was the nonoperating fixed cost or the cost of the factories themselves. So there's kind of a double effect of what happens once we bring the drives inside as well as reduce our overall footprint. But we would expect that the calendar year '17 revenues, other than maybe seasonal decline from December to March, should continue to grow, assuming the macro condition is stable, in part because also the portfolio gets a lot stronger with the 1 TB and the 2.5 and the 2 TB on the desktop, which are then product sets that are highly competitive, we believe, at least 6 months ahead of competition and capacity points that are much more relevant to us in the client space."

I mean, in general, the gross profit dollars are about the same, which is why losing 700,000 units but picking up 350,000 hurt us. The gross margin percentages are about the same. So as the shift continues, once you kind of reach the crossover point where we can either meet that upside demand or just naturally exceed whatever erosion continues in mission-critical, then you get growth there. And like I said, it's really hard to understand what's happening in mission-critical right now. Is it being driven by macro or is it incursion by flash, certain segments of that. I think the answer is it's a little of both. And maybe the macro is even accelerating the incursion of flash. And it doesn't really matter because once that happens, it's not like it's going to reverse itself. So we're preparing for the continued decline of the 15k segment, but as Dave indicated, the 10k segment from our customer input is probably going to remain intact for a number of quarters, if not a number of years. So I think it's more about managing our investment in the portfolio going forward, which clearly means continue to emphasize the nearline and then obviously again just adjusting the manufacturing footprint. So you're basically keeping pace or a little bit ahead of the declines, so you're always sold-out versus having adjusted capacity. Dave will talk to it in more detail."

As we think about heading into the back half of the year, obviously, first and foremost, we're going to continue to invest in our business ourself. As we stated, as we look at some of these onetime costs, restructuring cash charge, specifically around $150 million, we think that's very manageable over our generation in what we're able to yield here, again, over the next 6 to 9 months. And then as far as the dividend, we think that is well manageable, albeit at the higher end of those levels of the payout ratio and obviously, up to the Board of Directors.

As long as the macro environment stays -- I won't say decent because I don't know that I can call it today decent, but as long as it stays like it is today with that product execution, we feel pretty good about the company's position competitively. And then in terms of what we would do with that cash flow, again, I think defending the dividend is the first thing that we would do. I certainly like to keep the dividend level where it is, and initially, obviously, these are payout ratios above the 30% or 50% that we had indicated. But if the company's growing into that with improving revenues and margins, then certainly, we'd put the company in a position where the board has, at least hopefully, an easier decision to make that at -- or the other way around. I think in terms of buybacks, whether or not it's debt or equity, for the near term, that's probably not going to be the use of cash. So probably it would be -- if there's excess cash, we'd keep it on the balance sheet just in case the macro situation turns on us as we had more confidence about our 2017 outlook and again, kind of the success of our products. And we would reevaluate that in terms of what's the best use of it beyond dividend or growing on balance sheet."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In addition to my usual commentary, I've extended the prepared remarks for today's call, and I've asked management team to cover a few important aspects of our business as it relates to the March quarter and the positioning of the company moving forward. We will discuss some of the actions we're taking to align with near-term market realities and to improve the company's profitability and cash flow.
First, I will cover the higher-level trends we are seeing from customers and provide information as the direction we will be taking with the company with respect to structure and focus. Dave Morton will then walk through certain financial metrics. Dave Mosley will cover the HDD business, particularly with respect to our evolving product portfolio, and I'll close the call with our guidance for the June quarter and our general expectations for the second half of calendar 2016.
For the March quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.6 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 23%, net income of $66 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.22. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter were $439 million, reflecting cost controls and lower variable compensation. Overall inventory levels were down 11% sequentially and ended at the lowest level of finished goods, excluding the floods since June 2010. Capital expenditures of $95 million were in line with our expectations.
We believe Seagate's March quarter results are reflective of a generally weak macroeconomic environment as well as accelerating usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. Our HDD shipments for the March quarter were 39.2 million units and 55.6 exabytes, reflecting a seasonally lower TAM than expected overall.
In the March quarter, we initiated targeted pricing increases across our product line, and we were successful in some areas and unsuccessful in others. We continue to believe the industry needs a more stable pricing environment to deliver the higher level of requirements being placed on our products and to realize the value we are providing to the market. As a result, we will continue to pursue a pricing strategy that reduces and properly reflects the investment in technology the market requires.
We experienced particular weakness in the client desktop markets as well as in the enterprise legacy market, with offsetting strength in the enterprise nearline cloud market. Overall, average capacity per drive was 1.4 terabytes, up 30% year-over-year. And within this nearline cloud, average capacity per drive was 3.9 terabytes, up 25% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, unit shipments were down 22% while total exabytes shipped were up 2%.
The decrease in the unit TAM in our markets presents challenges for Seagate that will require alignment through operational footprint, and it pressures the overall HDD supply chain, especially for suppliers that are supplying 1 part per drive. However, we are encouraged by the trend towards significantly higher average capacity per drive applications, which results in greater absorption in heads and disk and favor HDD over any other storage device now and in the foreseeable future in terms of cost as a function of required performance.
The continued advancement and adaptation of mobile and cloud-based computing architectures is reflected in the revenue shifts we are seeing in our portfolio. Our long-term business leases continues to be that there will be a significant transition in HD market from a historical split -- revenue split of 60% client and 40% enterprise revenue to 40% client and 60% enterprise revenue over the next several years. We also expect that the average capacity per drive will increase in all markets.
Most important to our product positioning and related investments is not just the mix between client enterprise but the mix shift within these markets. In the client space, we expect to continue decline in PC shipments that we anticipate to moderate in the next year. PC HDDs now represent about 56% of Seagate's client revenue and approximately 30% of the total company revenue. While overall PC client HDD revenue is declining, the remaining share is nominated by high-capacity products, which will continue to increase with the new product offerings that we have started to introduce in the June quarter.
We are starting to see our client business shift to consumer, surveillance, gaming and DVR markets, which are all high-capacity user environments. We believe, over the next several quarters, this growth will result in these combined markets being greater than the traditional PC compute market today. As an example, our consumer business revenues as a percentage of total client revenues have grown 6% in the last 12 months, whereas PC revenues as a percentage of client revenues have declined 6%. This is consistent with our belief that reducing the amount of storage on certain client devices propagates it to another location.
In the enterprise market, revenue mix continues to trend from the legacy mission-critical market to the nearline cloud market. In the March quarter, we experienced unexpected weakness for our legacy mission-critical HDDs, which were approximately 700,000 units below our forecast. While it's difficult to attribute the weakness in enterprise mission-critical between macroeconomic factors and architectural shifts, we expect further declines in the mission-critical market in the June quarter and then decline should moderate over the quarters thereafter.
This mission-critical market weakness in the March quarter was offset by nearline cloud upside demand of more than 500,000 units, of which we could only deliver 350,000 additional units due to the long lead times required to put bill demand. Importantly, in the March quarter, the average capacity per drive for the mission-critical HDDs that came out of our forecast versus the average capacity of 8 TB, 8 terabytes, for the nearline HDD upside demand we saw, reflected a shift in exabytes of almost 6 to 1. [ph]
Demand signals from our nearline customers has improved over the last few weeks. We are planning for our fourth consecutive quarter of growth with high demand for our 8 terabyte portfolio and initial volume shipments of our 10-terabyte helium HDD product. As a result of these trends as well as from input from our major cloud customers, we believe that the shifts from legacy to cloud for enterprise applications has accelerated in the last 6 months and is now complementing the demand for cloud storage generated by consumer applications.
As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are aligning the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint, and we are reducing our capital expenditures to maintenance capital requirement levels. Through these actions, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity, and our operating philosophy will shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity. In the March quarter, we began the process of reducing our HDD manufacturing capacity from approximately 55 million to 60 million drives per quarter to approximately 35 million to 40 million drives per quarter. The actions required will be completed within the next 6 to 9 months. At the same time, we are continuing to accelerate the utilization of our own drive factories, internal head and media facilities.
For fiscal '16, total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $535 million, down approximately 28% over fiscal year '15. For fiscal year '17, assuming current outlook on demand, we are targeting an additional reduction in spending, reflecting a very low maintenance capital plan of approximately $400 million. In addition, we will continue operating expense management actions across the company that aligns with the market trends.
We believe that given the shifts in our product revenues discussed above as well as recognizing the full impact of the significant changes in our manufacturing footprint and operating expenses, the company will see revenue growth, product gross margin improvements and improved profitability, assuming a relatively stable macro environment.
Dave Morton and Dave Mosley will into go more detail on these activities, and I'll call -- turn the call over to Dave Morton now."

With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial model that were impacted in Q3. I would like to provide some detail to these conditions to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion around the actions we are taking at the manufacturing and operating expense levels.
For the March quarter, the addressable HDD and cloud storage systems markets were lower than forecast, impacting our revenue results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand fell short of our expectations, including traditional mission-critical HDD enterprise products and desktop client products, primarily in China. In addition, we made strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity notebook market.
In our systems and silicon business, we experienced weaker-than-expected demand across most of the product lines. The lower-than-forecasted HDD demand impacted our production levels and increased our factory absorption costs. We also aggressively managed our finished goods in the quarter and improved our inventory levels by approximately $118 million. This reduction in inventory negatively impacted our factory utilization.
Combined, these factors were the primary reasons for our product gross margins declining approximately 290 basis points sequentially to approximately 23% with 80 basis points impact from the HDD revenue shortfall, 70 basis points from the systems and silicon business revenue shortfall and 140 basis points from factory underutilization. While we are disappointed, we did not anticipate the weaker demand in the March quarter. The company is evaluating and implementing a variety of actions to reduce the company's cost structure, which will result in financial improvements over the next several months. 
Towards our infrastructure cost alignment in fiscal Q3 alone, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $90 million of one-time restructuring charges, write-off of certain fixed assets, certain terminated contracts and discontinued inventory.
We are currently sizing future nonreoccurring restructuring cash charges that we are estimating will be approximately $150 million over the next several quarters. We anticipate having more detailed actions identified within 60 days, and we will expect that the financial benefit of these actions will begin to have a positive impact in the September quarter with the full benefit of occurring in calendar 2017.
As we formalize the specific actions and timing of cost savings, we will continue to provide updates to this framework. While we are still formulating all of the actions we will take to address gross margins and operating profit, we believe the overall cost alignment activities we will implement will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business with the goal of achieving a minimum of $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share in calendar 2017. For the March quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $439 million, slightly lower than forecasted. Looking ahead, our expenses in the June quarter will be relatively flat with additional cost reductions being planned for FY '17.
Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $205 million, and free cash flow was $110 million. Fiscal year-to-date, we have generated $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 298 million shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is manageable.
As announced today, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63. There has been no change to our dividend policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast albeit at a higher payout ratio than previously stated as our objective.
I'll now turn over the call to Dave Mosley to cover our HDD business in more detail."

Beginning with the nearline cloud product lines, our 8-terabyte business-critical product continues its aggressive volume ramp, and we've been essentially sold out for the months of March and April.
We've had over 200% volume growth of 8-terabyte in the March quarter, and we anticipate continued growth in the June quarter. In addition, our 10-terabyte product lines shipped a large volume of qualification units in the March quarter, and the volume growth is accelerating in the June quarter as well. We believe our 10-terabyte product to be leading in all performance and power metrics, and we're very happy with the feedback from our customers and our qualifications.
In the client space, as Steve said, the PC market continued to decline in Q3, and we began end-of-life activities on some of the older 500 gigabyte and below products that have very low margins. Most of the margin cost benefits of these product exits will be realized over the next few quarters.
In the March quarter, we began the ramp of our 1- and 2-terabyte 7-millimeter 2.5-inch product line for our consumer, notebook and DVR customers. This new product line allows us to address the target markets with lower costs and improved value propositions for our customers. Qualifications have gone well with customer interest high, and we anticipate shipping several million units in the June quarter.
Initially, the product will be a consumer offering, moving to OEM offerings in September and December, and we believe we will have competitive technology leadership through the end of the calendar year. We are also accelerating the application of these same technologies into our 3.5-inch product lines for surveillance, NAS and DVR at the end of the calendar year.
The mission-critical market served by our 10,000- and 15,000-RPM products has been declining over the last few quarters, and we have seen traditional TAM of approximately 8 million to 8.5 million units per quarter decline to approximately 6.5 million to 7 million units in the March quarter. Within the mission-critical market, approximately 25% of the volumes are 15,000-RPM HDDs. This is the primary area where we are seeing a shift in low-end servers moving to lower-capacity flash SSDs, and we expect this trend to continue. In 10,000-RPM HDD, there has been some technology shifts happening as well. However, we believe the 10,000-RPM HDD market will have a much longer transition horizon.
Our goal over the coming months is to manage our forecasting conservatively with mission-critical TAM declines in the June quarter potentially leveling to modest declines in the back half of the year. Over the long term, we believe the technology shifts in this market support our complementary investment thesis of flash for performance and driving HDD for capacity architectures.
Shifting our HDD build volumes to higher-capacity offerings will allow us to simplify our wafer requirements and optimize our product portfolio, which will not need further product refreshes for some time. Coupled with this, improved utilization of our own factories sized properly for the product -- for the market demand will improve our cost considerably.
We realize our non-depreciation related fixed costs are high competitively and also too high for current demand. These cost items will be addressed sooner than those related to the manufacturing footprint. There are also many costs related to the product transitions that while temporarily driving a higher cost profile will allow us to improve our cost footprint in FY '17.
With respect to the shift to higher-capacity products, we do need to be mindful of longer lead times and supply chain management requirements for these products. By engaging directly with a broader customer base and establishing deeper channel partnerships, we believe we will improve our sales operations efficiencies and forecast visibility.
Thanks. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Given the recent published earnings results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology and industrial markets, we are planning for seasonal declines in revenue in the June quarter for most of the markets we serve with the exception of the nearline market. Based on these factors as well as our decision not to participate in the low-capacity PC client market, we expect to achieve revenues of approximately $2.3 billion in the June quarter with relatively flat gross margins and operating expenses.
We continue to expect that demand in the second half of calendar year '16 will be stronger than the first half with positive seasonal trends and continued growth in nearline demand, offset somewhat by macroeconomic pressures. With this anticipated revenue growth as well as the actions we are taking to align our manufacturing footprint and operating expense investments, gross margins and profitability will improve in the second half of the calendar year 2016. Should there be improvement in the overall macroeconomic conditions, we would expect to see improved HDD unit demand across all markets with commensurate benefits to the company's performance.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we can now open it up for questions and answers."

So the adjustments on manufacturing are both where we take our internal capacity, right, which was underabsorbed and then taking production inside, which was basically, if you can think of it as additional underabsorption, whether or not that was the nonoperating fixed cost or the cost of the factories themselves. So there's kind of a double effect of what happens once we bring the drives inside as well as reduce our overall footprint. But we would expect that the calendar year '17 revenues, other than maybe seasonal decline from December to March, should continue to grow, assuming the macro condition is stable, in part because also the portfolio gets a lot stronger with the 1 TB on the 2.5 and the 2 TB on the desktop, which are then product sets that are highly competitive, we believe, at least 6 months ahead of competition and capacity points that are much more relevant to us in the client space."

I mean, in general, the gross profit dollars are about the same, which is why losing 700,000 units but picking up 350,000 hurt us. The gross margin percentages are about the same. So as the shift continues, once you kind of reach the crossover point where we can either meet that upside demand or just naturally exceed whatever erosion continues in mission-critical, then you get growth there. And like I said, it's really hard to understand what's happening in mission-critical right now. Is it being driven by macro or is it incursion by flash, certain segments of that. I think the answer is it's a little of both. And maybe the macro is even accelerating the incursion of flash. And it doesn't really matter because once that happens, it's not like it's going to reverse itself. So we're preparing for the continued decline of the 15k segment, but as Dave indicated, the 10k segment from our customer input is probably going to remain intact for a number of quarters, if not a number of years. So I think it's more about managing our investment in the portfolio going forward, which clearly means continue to emphasize the nearline and then obviously again just adjusting the manufacturing footprint. So you're basically keeping pace or a little bit ahead of the declines, so you're always sold-out versus having excess capacity. Dave will talk to it in more detail."

As we think about heading into the back half of the year, obviously, first and foremost, we're going to continue to invest in our business ourself. As we stated, as we look at some of these onetime costs, restructuring cash charge, specifically around $150 million, we think that's very manageable over our generation in what we're able to yield here, again, over the next 6 to 9 months. And then as far as the dividend, we think that is well manageable, albeit at the higher end of those levels of the payout ratio and obviously, up to the Board of Directors.

As long as the macro environment stays -- I won't say decent because I don't know that I can call it today decent, but as long as it stays like it is today with that product execution, we feel pretty good about the company's position competitively. And then in terms of what we would do with that cash flow, again, I think defending the dividend is the first thing that we would do. Certainly like to keep the dividend level where it is, and initially, obviously, these are payout ratios above the 30% or 50% that we had indicated. But if the company's growing into that with improving revenues and margins, then certainly, we'd put the company in a position where the board has, at least hopefully, an easier decision to make that at -- or the other way around. I think in terms of buybacks, whether or not it's debt or equity, for the near term, that's probably not going to be the use of cash. So probably it would be -- if there's excess cash, we'd keep it on the balance sheet just in case the macro situation turns on us. As we have more confidence about our 2017 outlook and again, kind of the success of our products, then we would reevaluate that in terms of what's the best use of it beyond dividend or growing on balance sheet."

For the June quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.65 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 25.8%, net income of $207 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.69. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the June quarter were $443 million. Capital expenditures of $146 million for the June quarter were higher than our previous forecast due to our decision to accelerate the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. In addition, we are accelerating the expansion of our crop facility to expedite the planned manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites. 
For the full fiscal year, our capital expenditures were $587 million, approximately 5% of revenue and below our targeted long-term model range of 6% to 8%. We believe Seagate's June quarter results are reflective of a generally stable but relatively benign macroeconomic environment as well as an acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage ships of technologies and architectures by end-users. Demand from cloud service providers was stronger than expected after several quarters of relatively modest demand from these customers. 
Our HDD shipments for the June quarter were 36.8 million units, representing a record 61.7 exabytes of storage. Average capacity per drive increased to a record 1.7 terabytes per drive, and ASPs of $67 were a record since the tide floods. Overall inventory levels were down 6% sequentially. And within this, finished goods were down 21%. These inventory levels represent sequentially improved inventory turns and lean production schedules as we ramp our new HDD products throughout the portfolio. 
With respect to our cloud systems business, we are making good progress in ramping new platforms and gaining new customers, offset by some demand softness from top-tier OEMs and government customers. The integration of Dot Hill is complete, and we will be launching converged storage platforms, including hybrid and all-Flash array offerings later this fiscal year, which we believe are equal to or better than our competition. 
On the silicon side, we have recently introduced a number of new products, including our industry-leading 2 terabyte NVME enterprise SSD product, which is getting positive customer feedback. This business is extremely competitive, and we are working in conjunction with our key NAND partners who are enabling us to develop workload-specific and optimized products.
For the fiscal year 2016, Seagate achieved revenues of $11.2 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, net income of $684 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.26. In fiscal 2016, we shipped 233 exabytes with average capacity per drive up 29% year-over-year. Within these results, we shipped 70 exabytes for the business critical portfolio, up 28% [ph] year-over-year. 
Consistent with our expectations of the impact of the shift from client/server to mobile cloud architectures, Seagate's HDD unit shipments over the last 5 fiscal years have decreased 15% while at the same time, exabyte shipments have grown 112% and average capacity per drive has increased 133%.
Applications which require higher capacity HDDs are responsible for the record demand for HDD storage. Additionally, these application trends align with the Seagate actions that are in progress to optimize the utilization in our heads, media and drive test factories. Since the majority of exabyte growth is related to high-definition streaming content where massive data ingest and sequential write operations are the key characteristics for the specific workloads, HDD is continuing to be the optimal cost performance solution over any other storage device. In the nearline enterprise market, our 8 terabyte products were the fastest growing products in units and revenue within our overall HDD portfolio this quarter. We expect the market to continue to shift towards this capacity point over the next 2 years. Our 10 terabyte helium enterprise product is best-in-class for powerful performance, and we will be shipping our 12 terabyte helium nearline enterprise test units for customer evaluation this quarter. To meet the high-capacity storage requirements of the client marketplace, we have recently introduced 10 terabyte capacity points across our Guardian Series client portfolio, with particular focus on the surveillance, gaming, DVR and mass markets. Over the next several quarters, we'll refresh most of our high-volume capacity points in our portfolio with lower-cost designs using our leadership in areal density and our improved operational footprint. Our customers will benefit from the portfolio advancements, and we believe that Seagate will be in leading competitive position as our market shifts from a low-capacity units-based demand profile to the future applications which are component-rich and require aggressive technology advancement.
This is particularly important as the storage market shifts from client/server to mobile cloud applications and storage environment. While we expect the shift to continue to pressure PC unit volumes with HDDs, we are encouraged by the capacity needs of the remaining PC client as well as the significant growth in non-PC client devices and applications.
Assuming a relatively stable macro environment, we believe that given the continued shifts in our product revenues as well as recognizing the full impact of the significant changes in our manufacturing footprint and operating expenses, the company will achieve revenue growth, product gross margin improvements and improved profitability. I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on these activities."

With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial model that were impacted in F Q4. I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion around the actions we are taking to manufacturing and operating expense levels. For the June quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was higher than forecast, driving benefit and our revenue and margin results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand was stronger than our expectations, specifically for our nearline enterprise HDD products. Our ATB nearline enterprise products were our leading revenue SKUs as overall HDD enterprise revenue increased to 45% of our total HDDs revenue.
By comparison, our PC client shipments were 25% of HDD revenue in the June quarter, reflecting the shift of client/server storage environments and our strategic participation in the higher-capacity segments. We continue to make strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity notebook and gaming market where the gross margin contribution does not warrant the long-term manufacturing investment. As a result, our future forecast for Seagate's HDD unit addressable market may have a variance to our competition as we may not participate in all HDD unit sales demand in any given quarter. 
As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio, customer demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are continuing to align the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint. And we are reducing our capital expenditures to maintenance capital requirement levels, which is expected to be less than 5% of our revenue over the next fiscal year. Through these actions, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity, and our operating philosophy will shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity.
Earlier this year, we began the process of reducing the HDD manufacturing capacity from approximately 55 million to 60 million drives per quarter to approximately 35 million to 40 million drives per quarter. The actions required will be completed within the next 6 to 9 months. At the same time, we are continuing to accelerate the utilization of our own drive factories, internal head and media facilities. 
Towards our infrastructure cost alignment, in the June quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $80 million in pretax charges. And additionally, in July, we announced further cost reduction activities reflecting $164 million in pretax charges. Overall restructuring actions are proceeding as planned, and we expect the financial benefit of these actions will begin to have a positive impact in the September quarter. 
For the June quarter, we recorded a tax benefit of $16 million. This is primarily related to the release of tax reserves and changes in our deferred taxes and foreign jurisdictions impacted by our global footprint changes. Our overall fiscal year 2016 tax expense was $26 million.
While we are still formulating all of the actions we will take to address gross margins and operating profit, we believe the new high-capacity and cost advantage products in our full HDD portfolio refresh and overall cost alignment activities we are implementing will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year 2017. 
Given current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in exceeding the minimum of $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share in calendar 2017 that we indicated last quarter. We recognize that we are on track to exceed this goal and will provide additional insights for calendar 2017 on our October earnings call. 
Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $269 million and for fiscal 2016, we generated $1.7 billion in cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the June quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 299 million shares outstanding.
Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggering maturities and low interest expense. Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment. There has been no change to our dividend policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter as supported by our cash flow generation forecast.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

As we manage the business in the near term, we are cognizant of the recent published earnings results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology industrial markets as well as ma",519,"Thanks, Dave. As we manage the business in the near term, we are cognizant of the recent published earnings results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology industrial markets as well as many consumer products companies. As indicated, demand for our nearline drives has accelerated from earlier in the year as cloud service providers are deploying new systems and replacing HDDs that are in service. We expect this demand to be relatively flat in the September quarter. We see growth in some areas of high-capacity non-PC clients, specifically DVR, surveillance and seasonal gaming demand offset with declines in PC-related markets as we narrow our participation in this segment. 
Overall exabyte demand should improve in the September quarter with our focus on high-capacity opportunities for our portfolio. Based on these factors, we expect revenue growth and gross margin improvement in the September quarter. Given the dynamic nature of the technology business as well as a still tepid macroeconomic environment, we have approached our outlook cautiously. We expect to achieve revenue some of at least $2.7 billion in the September quarter with gross margins of at least 27% and relatively flat operating expenses. We believe it's important that investors recognize the continued shift from client/server from mobile cloud and the related infrastructure and application level changes taking place in our industry. These shifts are impacting our traditional customer base while also creating significant opportunities for core technology providers such as Seagate with an expanding customer base. The new customer base includes our traditional OEMs and distribution customers as well as significant and growing demand from cloud service providers, surveillance companies and will likely include corporate demand in the not too distant future. As a result of these changes in product demand and customer base, we have experienced shifts in our traditional seasonal demand patterns. Cyclicality associated with cloud infrastructure buildout can now override seasonality, and this has implications for investors expectations and management of our company resources. While the overall shift in technology deployment and related growth in data science applications is quite favorable for the HDD industry on a moving annual average, the rate of growth for storage demand in the near term will likely fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as major systems installations either aggressively deploy or absorb capacity. As we analyze these trends, we are considering that these changes in customer buying patterns and capacity utilization may be better reflected in annual guidance pen for investors. We will discuss this possibility with our investors over the next few months. 
In addition, we continue to implement actions to align our manufacturing footprint and operating expense investment with market demand. These actions as well as the product portfolio introductions previously discussed should result in continued gross margin and operating margin improvement over the near term. Should there be improvement in the overall macroeconomic conditions, we would expect to see improved HDD unit demand across all markets with commensurate benefits to the company's financial performance.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we can now open it up for questions and answers."

I think we have a decent sense of what they think they need in terms of capacity deployment on an annual basis. But when it breaks down to quarter-to-quarter, I think given the nature of the customers, many of them are actually witnessing centralized perspective of demand. So there's a bunch of BUs that are deploying, and a lot of those BUs actually buy on their own. Some of them go to a centralized deployment. Some of them don't. So you can't think of this big CSPs necessarily as holistically planning capacity for every one of their application sets because a lot of those business units within those companies are under own cycles. And maybe it gets aggregated, maybe it doesn't, depending on the customer. So I think they're all learning. I think what's going to drive the better visibility is just the lead time associated with these products, and we've already seen it with the ATB. As you know, the wafer cycle times on the heads are longer than the quarter, and the test times are 3 weeks on top of that. So you're well outside of the quarter in terms of lead time. So if you don't do a great job of your capacity planning in advance of a quarter as the CSP, and you don't have excess capacity, you're going to be somewhat constrained, especially as they move into these spaces where they could see big step function changes in demand i.e. they pick up a big corporate customer that's going to a huge cloud-based installation of applications they don't have the capacity in place they can't take that business. My guess is if they miss one piece of that business like that once, all the planning is going to get a lot better. And we've seen that. Those trends are starting where you have these Fortune 50 or even Fortune 20 companies that are now putting moves on the cloud and that puts on basically sometimes pressure of we need a whole new data center. And this is the beginning of the trend, not even the middle or the end game. So we expect a lot more of that. So the lead time -- and the lead times, of course, with the 10 terabyte or [indiscernible] or the 12 terabyte [indiscernible] just because against the complexity of the technology or process content is way higher on the course of test type. So I think in general, their views aren't bad on the looking out over 12-month basis. It's just a quarter-to-quarter visibility is still developing. In terms of [indiscernible] 10s and 12, we think the ages going to be around for a long time. It's super high performance and very low-cost product for us. 10 TB, we certainly have customers that are taking the drive. We don't know that we see a huge uptick in 10 TB just because 2 only picking up 2 terabytes, and they cost a lot more right now. Maybe the 2 companies get up the yield curve and bring cost down, we'll see an acceleration of the deployment. That's what we noticed on ATB that once you got up the yield curve and in our case, because we have 2 heads less, we were able to hit points that really accelerated replacement of 4s and 6s with 8. So whether or not it's 10 or maybe 12 where you pick up 50% more capacity or frankly, maybe even 16 where it's on doubling capacity on that same real estate it will be interesting to see where that transition happens. I think the important thing is to make sure from a Seagate perspective that we're leading an area of density and we continue to deliver that in our products. And whenever the customers decide they want that product, we'll be there with them."

Again, the CSP influence on the overall business is a little tricky just because like we witnessed in this quarter, it could be kind of significant. And when they do start buying, they tend to start buying for longer periods of times, 2, 3, 4 quarters. That really hasn't been modeled in to our expectations. We'd rather kind of see the Webster rise before we make that call. We can't say that July started off quite strong, and the demand seems to be fairly solid. But as I think most of analysts know, typically the September quarter is backend-weighted quarter. And if we overlay the backend-weighted quarter and what we've seen so far, it kind of doesn't make sense to us so we've been a bit cautious, and then we'll see what happens with that demand. And again, I think until that customer base diversifies a bit more and we get, I think, more data around what happens month-to-month in addition to quarter-to-quarter, it's probably better for us just to be cautious about what we see and then be smarter as we move forward. What was the second question?
I still think -- I still think the annual demand for storage is still probably more defined by available capacity than it is real demand. Again, if you take population growth times connected devices times richness of content, it gets you easily to 3 or 4 zettabytes by 2020, which would imply kind of 30% to 35% annual growth in storage. And I still think that's really kind of what the demand is. And the question is can the HDD industry or demand industry for that matter invest in those levels of capital or not? And we'll see. It's pretty tight though, given the budgets that people have deployed or the fabs lined up. But I still think you're seeing exabyte demand well in excess of aerial density demand so in that sense we view it as demand's outstripping supply. And then of course, the packaging requirements are moving to more high capacity, so more heads per units but units probably flattening out. But from an absorption perspective for a Seagate making heads in this quarter because the process content is so much higher or the test content is so much higher, that's a really good trend for us."

And Dave Morton will then walk through certain financial highlights and I'll close the call with our guidance for the September quarter and our general expectations for the second half of calendar 2016.
For the June quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.65 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 25.8%, net income of $207 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.69. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the June quarter were $443 million. Capital expenditures of $146 million for the June quarter were higher than our previous forecast due to our decision to accelerate the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. In addition, we are accelerating the expansion of our crop facility to expedite the planned manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites. 
For the full fiscal year, our capital expenditures were $587 million, approximately 5% of revenue and below our targeted long-term model range of 6% to 8%. We believe Seagate's June quarter results are reflective of a generally stable but relatively benign macroeconomic environment as well as an acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end-users. Demand from cloud service providers was stronger than expected after several quarters of relatively modest demand from these customers. 
Our HDD shipments for the June quarter were 36.8 million units, representing a record 61.7 exabytes of storage. Average capacity per drive increased to a record 1.7 terabytes per drive, and ASPs of $67 were a record since the Thai floods. Overall inventory levels were down 6% sequentially. And within this, finished goods were down 21%. These inventory levels represent sequentially improved inventory turns and lean production schedules as we ramp our new HDD products throughout the portfolio. 
With respect to our cloud systems business, we are making good progress in ramping new platforms and gaining new customers, offset by some demand softness from top tier OEM and government customers. The integration of Dot Hill is complete and we will be launching converged storage platforms, including hybrid and all-flash array offerings later this fiscal year, which we believe are equal to or better than our competition. 
On the silicon side, we have recently introduced a number of new products including our industry-leading 2 terabyte NVMe Enterprise SSD product, which is getting positive customer feedback. This business is extremely competitive and we are working in conjunction with our key NAND partners who are enabling us to develop workload-specific and optimized products.
For the fiscal year 2016, Seagate achieved revenues of $11.2 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, net income of $684 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.26. In fiscal 2016, we shipped 233 exabytes with average capacity per drive up 29% year-over-year. Within these results, we shipped 70 exabytes for the business critical product portfolio, up 28% year-over-year. 
Consistent with our expectations of the impact of the shift from client/server to mobile cloud architectures, Seagate's HDD unit shipments over the last 5 fiscal years have decreased 15% while at the same time, exabyte shipments have grown 112% and the average capacity per drive has increased 133%.
Applications which require higher capacity HDDs are responsible for the record demand for HDD storage. Additionally, these application trends align with the Seagate actions that are in progress to optimize the utilization in our heads, media and drive test factories. Since the majority of exabyte growth is related to high-definition streaming content, where massive data ingest and sequential write operations are the key characteristics for the specific workloads, HDD is continuing to be the optimal cost performance solution over any other storage device. 
In the nearline enterprise market, our 8 terabyte products were the fastest-growing products in units and revenue within our overall HDD portfolio this quarter. We expect the market to continue to shift towards this capacity point over the next 2 years. Our 10 terabyte helium enterprise product is best-in-class for power performance, and we will be shipping our 12 terabyte helium nearline enterprise test units for customer evaluation this quarter. 
To meet the high-capacity storage requirements of the client marketplace, we have recently introduced 10 terabyte capacity points across our Guardian Series client portfolio, with particular focus on the surveillance, gaming, DVR and mass markets. Over the next several quarters, we will refresh most of our high-volume capacity points in our portfolio with lower-cost designs using our leadership in areal density and our improved operational footprint. 
Our customers will benefit from the portfolio advancements and we believe that Seagate will be in leading competitive position as our market shifts from a low-capacity units-based demand profile to the future applications which are component-rich and require aggressive technology advancement. This is particularly important as the storage market shifts from client/server to mobile cloud applications and storage environments. While we expect the shift to continue to pressure PC unit volumes with HDDs, we are encouraged by the capacity needs of the remaining PC client as well as the significant growth in non-PC client devices and applications.
Assuming a relatively stable macro environment, we believe that given the continued shifts in our product revenues as well as recognizing the full impact of the significant changes in our manufacturing footprint and operating expenses, the company will achieve revenue growth, product gross margin improvements and improved profitability. 
I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on these activities."

With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial model that were impacted in F Q4. I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion around the actions we are taking to manufacturing and operating expense levels. For the June quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was higher than forecast, driving benefit and our revenue and margin results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand was stronger than our expectations, specifically for our nearline enterprise HDD products. Our ATB nearline enterprise products were our leading revenue SKUs as overall HDD enterprise revenue increased to 45% of our total HDD revenue.
By comparison, our PC client shipments were 25% of HDD revenue in the June quarter, reflecting the shift of client/server storage environments and our strategic participation in the higher-capacity segments. We continue to make strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity notebook and gaming market where the gross margin contribution does not warrant the long-term manufacturing investment. As a result, our future forecast for Seagate's HDD unit addressable market may have a variance to our competition as we may not participate in all HDD unit sales demand in any given quarter. 
As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio, customer demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are continuing to align the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint. And we are reducing our capital expenditures to maintenance capital requirement levels, which is expected to be less than 5% of our revenue over the next fiscal year. Through these actions, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity, and our operating philosophy will shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity.
Earlier this year, we began the process of reducing the HDD manufacturing capacity from approximately 55 million to 60 million drives per quarter to approximately 35 million to 40 million drives per quarter. The actions required will be completed within the next 6 to 9 months. At the same time, we are continuing to accelerate the utilization of our own drive factories, internal head and media facilities. 
Towards our infrastructure cost alignment, in the June quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $80 million in pretax charges. And additionally, in July, we announced further cost reduction activities reflecting $164 million in pretax charges. Overall restructuring actions are proceeding as planned and we expect the financial benefit of these actions will begin to have a positive impact in the September quarter. 
For the June quarter, we recorded a tax benefit of $16 million. This is primarily related to the release of tax reserves and changes in our deferred taxes and foreign jurisdictions impacted by our global footprint changes. Our overall fiscal year 2016 tax expense was $26 million.
While we are still formulating all of the actions we will take to address gross margins and operating profit, we believe the new high-capacity and cost advantage products in our full HDD portfolio refresh and overall cost alignment activities we are implementing will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year 2017. 
Given current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in exceeding the minimum of $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share in calendar 2017 that we indicated last quarter. We recognize that we are on track to exceed this goal and will provide additional insights for calendar 2017 on our October earnings call. 
Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $269 million and for fiscal 2016, we generated $1.7 billion in cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the June quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 299 million shares outstanding.
Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework, given our staggering maturities and low interest expense. Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment. There has been no change to our dividend policy and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

As we manage the business in the near term, we are cognizant of the recent published earning results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology industrial markets as well as man",521,"Thanks, Dave. As we manage the business in the near term, we are cognizant of the recent published earning results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology industrial markets as well as many consumer products companies. As indicated, demand for our nearline drives has accelerated from earlier in the year as cloud service providers are deploying new systems and/or replacing HDDs that are in service. We expect this demand to be relatively flat in the September quarter. We see growth in some areas of high-capacity non-PC clients, specifically DVR, surveillance, NAS and seasonal gaming demand offset with declines in the PC-related markets as we narrow our participation in this segment. 
Overall exabyte demand should improve in the September quarter with our focus on high-capacity opportunities for our portfolio. Based on these factors, we expect revenue growth and gross margin improvement in the September quarter. Given the dynamic nature of the technology business as well as a still tepid macroeconomic environment, we have approached our outlook cautiously. We expect to achieve revenues of at least $2.7 billion in the September quarter with gross margins of at least 27% and relatively flat operating expenses. 
We believe it's important that investors recognize the continued shift from client/server to mobile cloud and the related infrastructure and application level changes taking place in our industry. These shifts are impacting our traditional customer base, while also creating significant opportunities for core technology providers such as Seagate with an expanding customer base. The new customer base includes our traditional OEMs and distribution customers, as well as significant and growing demand from cloud service providers, surveillance companies and will likely include corporate demand in the not too distant future. 
As a result of these changes in product demand and customer base, we have experienced shifts in our traditional seasonal demand patterns. Cyclicality associated with cloud infrastructure build-out can now override seasonality, and this has implications for investors expectations and management of our company resources. While the overall shift in technology deployment and related growth in data science applications is quite favorable for the HDD industry on a moving annual average, the rate of growth for storage demand in the near term will likely fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as major systems installations either aggressively deploy or absorb capacity. As we analyze these trends, we are considering that these changes in customer buying patterns and capacity utilization may be better reflected in the annual guidance planning for investors. We will discuss this possibility with our investors over the next few months. 
In addition, we continue to implement actions to align our manufacturing footprint and operating expense investment with market demand. These actions, as well as the product portfolio introductions previously discussed, should result in continued gross margin and operating margin improvement over the near term. Should there be improvement in the overall macroeconomic conditions, we would expect to see improved HDD unit demand across all markets with commensurate benefits to the company's financial performance.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we can now open it up for questions and answers."

I mean, I think, they have a decent sense of what they think they need in terms of capacity deployment on an annual basis. But when it breaks down to quarter-to-quarter, I think given the nature of the customers, many of them are actually witnessing centralized perspective of demand. So there's a bunch of BUs that are deploying, and a lot of those BUs actually buy on their own. Some of them go to a centralized deployment. Some of them don't. So you can't think of this big CSPs necessarily as holistically planning capacity for every one of their application sets because a lot of those business units within those companies are on their own cycles, and maybe it gets aggregated, maybe it doesn't, depending on the customer. So I think they're all learning. I think what's going to drive the better visibility is just the lead time associated with these products and we've already seen it with the ATB. As you know, the wafer cycle times on the heads are longer than the quarter and then the test times are 3 weeks on top of that. So you're well outside of a quarter in terms of lead time. So if you don't do a great job of your capacity planning in advance of a quarter as a CSP and you don't have excess capacity, you're going to be somewhat constrained especially as they move into these spaces where they could see big step function changes in demand, i.e., they pick up a big corporate customer that's going through a huge cloud-based installation of applications. Let's say if they don't have the capacity in place, they can't take that business. My guess is if they miss one piece of business like that once, all of a sudden, the planning is going to get a lot better. And we've seen that. Those trends are starting where you have these Fortune 50 or even Fortune 20 companies that are now making big moves to the cloud, and that puts on basically sometimes pressure of we need a whole new data center. And this is the beginning of the trend, not even the middle or the end game. So we expect a lot more of that. So the lead time -- and the lead times, of course, with the 10 terabyte or longer and the 12 terabyte or longer would just, because against the complexity of the technology, so your process content is way higher and of course, the test time is way higher. So I think, in general, their views aren't bad on the looking out over 12-month basis. It's just their quarter-to-quarter visibility is still developing. In terms of 8s, 10s, 12s, we think the 8s are going to be around for a long time, it's super high performance and very low-cost product for us. 10 TB, we certainly have customers that are taking the drive. We don't know that we see a huge uptick in 10 TB just because you're only picking up 2 terabytes and they cost a lot more right now. Maybe as the 2 companies get up the yield curve and bring cost down, we'll see an acceleration of the deployment. That's what we noticed on ATB that once you got up the yield curve, and in our case because we have a disc and 2 heads left, we were able to hit cross points that really accelerated the replacement of 4s and 6s with 8s. So whether or not it's 10 or maybe 12 where you pick up 50% more capacity, or frankly, maybe even 16 where it's -- I'm doubling capacity on that same real estate, it will be interesting to see where that transition happen. I think the important thing is to make sure, from a Seagate perspective, that we're leading in areal density and we continue to deliver that in our products. And whenever the customers decide they want that product, we'll be there with them."

Again, the CSP influence on the overall business is a little tricky just because, like we witnessed in this quarter, it can be kind of significant. And when they do start buying, they tend to start buying for longer periods of times, 2, 3, 4 quarters. That really hasn't been modeled into our expectations. We'd rather kind of see the whites of their eyes before we make that call. We can say that July started off quite strong and the demand seems to be fairly solid. But as I think most of analysts know, typically, the September quarter is backend-weighted quarter. And if we overlay the backend-weighted quarter on what we've seen so far, it kind of doesn't make sense to us. So we've been a bit cautious and then we'll see what happens with that demand. And again, I think until that customer base diversifies a bit more and we get, I think, more data around what happens month-to-month in addition to quarter-to-quarter, it's probably better for us just to be cautious about what we see and then be smarter as we move forward. What was the second question?
I still think the annual demand for storage is still probably more defined by available capacity than it is real demand. I mean, again, if you take population growth times connected devices times richness of content, it gets you easily to 3 or 4 zettabytes by 2020, which would imply kind of 30% to 35% annual growth in storage. And I still think that's really kind of what the demand is. And the question is, can the HDD industry or demand industry for that matter invest to those levels of capital or not? And we'll see. It's pretty tight though given the budgets that people have deployed or the fabs that are lined up. But I still think you're seeing exabyte demand that's well in excess of areal density demand. So in that sense, we view it as demand's outstripping supply. And then of course, those -- the packaging requirements are moving to more high capacity, so more heads in disc per units, but units probably flattening out. But from an absorption perspective for Seagate making heads in disc or because the process content is so much higher or the test content is so much higher, that's a really good trend for us."

And Dave Morton will then walk through certain financial highlights and I'll close the call with our guidance for the September quarter and our general expectations for the second half of calendar 2016.
For the June quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.65 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 25.8%, net income of $207 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.69. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the June quarter were $443 million. Capital expenditures of $146 million for the June quarter were higher than our previous forecast due to our decision to accelerate the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. In addition, we are accelerating the expansion of our crop[ph] facility to expedite the planned manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites. 
For the full fiscal year, our capital expenditures were $587 million, approximately 5% of revenue and below our targeted long-term model range of 6% to 8%. We believe Seagate's June quarter results are reflective of a generally stable but relatively benign macroeconomic environment as well as an acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end-users. Demand from cloud service providers was stronger than expected after several quarters of relatively modest demand from these customers. 
Our HDD shipments for the June quarter were 36.8 million units, representing a record 61.7 exabytes of storage. Average capacity per drive increased to a record 1.7 terabytes per drive, and ASPs of $67 were a record since the Thai floods. Overall inventory levels were down 6% sequentially. And within this, finished goods were down 21%. These inventory levels represent sequentially improved inventory turns and lean production schedules as we ramp our new HDD products throughout the portfolio. 
With respect to our cloud systems business, we are making good progress in ramping new platforms and gaining new customers, offset by some demand softness from top tier OEM and government customers. The integration of Dot Hill is complete and we will be launching converged storage platforms, including hybrid and all-flash array offerings later this fiscal year, which we believe are equal to or better than our competition. 
On the silicon side, we have recently introduced a number of new products including our industry-leading 2 terabyte NVMe Enterprise SSD product, which is getting positive customer feedback. This business is extremely competitive and we are working in conjunction with our key NAND partners who are enabling us to develop workload-specific and optimized products.
For the fiscal year 2016, Seagate achieved revenues of $11.2 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, net income of $684 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.26. In fiscal 2016, we shipped 233 exabytes with average capacity per drive up 29% year-over-year. Within these results, we shipped 70 exabytes for the business critical product portfolio, up 28% year-over-year. 
Consistent with our expectations of the impact of the shift from client/server to mobile cloud architectures, Seagate's HDD unit shipments over the last 5 fiscal years have decreased 15% while at the same time, exabyte shipments have grown 112% and the average capacity per drive has increased 133%.
Applications which require higher capacity HDDs are responsible for the record demand for HDD storage. Additionally, these application trends align with the Seagate actions that are in progress to optimize the utilization in our heads, media and drive test factories. Since the majority of exabyte growth is related to high-definition streaming content, where massive data ingest and sequential write operations are the key characteristics for the specific workloads, HDD is continuing to be the optimal cost performance solution over any other storage device. 
In the nearline enterprise market, our 8 terabyte products were the fastest-growing products in units and revenue within our overall HDD portfolio this quarter. We expect the market to continue to shift towards this capacity point over the next 2 years. Our 10 terabyte helium enterprise product is best-in-class for power performance, and we will be shipping our 12 terabyte helium nearline enterprise test units for customer evaluation this quarter. 
To meet the high-capacity storage requirements of the client marketplace, we have recently introduced 10 terabyte capacity points across our Guardian Series client portfolio, with particular focus on the surveillance, gaming, DVR and NAS markets. Over the next several quarters, we will refresh most of our high-volume capacity points in our portfolio with lower-cost designs using our leadership in areal density and our improved operational footprint. 
Our customers will benefit from the portfolio advancements and we believe that Seagate will be in leading competitive position as our market shifts from a low-capacity units-based demand profile to the future applications which are component-rich and require aggressive technology advancement. This is particularly important as the storage market shifts from client/server to mobile cloud applications and storage environments. While we expect the shift to continue to pressure PC unit volumes with HDDs, we are encouraged by the capacity needs of the remaining PC client as well as the significant growth in non-PC client devices and applications.
Assuming a relatively stable macro environment, we believe that given the continued shifts in our product revenues as well as recognizing the full impact of the significant changes in our manufacturing footprint and operating expenses, the company will achieve revenue growth, product gross margin improvements and improved profitability. 
I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on these activities."

With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial model that were impacted in F Q4. I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion around the actions we are taking to manufacturing and operating expense levels. For the June quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was higher than forecast, driving benefit and our revenue and margin results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand was stronger than our expectations, specifically for our nearline enterprise HDD products. Our ATB nearline enterprise products were our leading revenue SKUs as overall HDD enterprise revenue increased to 45% of our total HDDs revenue.
By comparison, our PC client shipments were 25% of HDD revenue in the June quarter, reflecting the shift of client/server storage environments and our strategic participation in the higher-capacity segments. We continue to make strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity notebook and gaming market where the gross margin contribution does not warrant the long-term manufacturing investment. As a result, our future forecast for Seagate's HDD unit addressable market may have a variance to our competition as we may not participate in all HDD unit sales demand in any given quarter. 
As we manage the shift in our product portfolio, customer demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are continuing to align the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint. And we are reducing our capital expenditures to maintenance capital requirement levels, which is expected to be less than 5% of our revenue over the next fiscal year. Through these actions, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity, and our operating philosophy will shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity.
Earlier this year, we began the process of reducing the HDD manufacturing capacity from approximately 55 million to 60 million drives per quarter to approximately 35 million to 40 million drives per quarter. The actions required will be completed within the next 6 to 9 months. At the same time, we are continuing to accelerate the utilization of our own drive factories, internal head and media facilities. 
Towards our infrastructure cost alignment, in the June quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $80 million in pretax charges. And additionally, in July, we announced further cost reduction activities reflecting $164 million in pretax charges. Overall restructuring actions are proceeding as planned and we expect the financial benefit of these actions will begin to have a positive impact in the September quarter. 
For the June quarter, we recorded a tax benefit of $16 million. This is primarily related to the release of tax reserves and changes in our deferred taxes and foreign jurisdictions impacted by our global footprint changes. Our overall fiscal year 2016 tax expense was $26 million.
While we are still formulating all of the actions we will take to address gross margins and operating profit, we believe the new high-capacity and cost advantage products in our full HDD portfolio refresh and overall cost alignment activities we are implementing will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year 2017. 
Given current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in exceeding the minimum of $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share in calendar 2017 that we indicated last quarter. We recognize that we are on track to exceed this goal and will provide additional insights for calendar 2017 on our October earnings call. 
Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $269 million and for fiscal 2016, we generated $1.7 billion in cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the June quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 299 million shares outstanding.
Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense. Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment. There has been no change to our dividend policy and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

As we manage the business in the near term, we are cognizant of the recent published earning results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology industrial markets as well as man",521,"Thanks, Dave. As we manage the business in the near term, we are cognizant of the recent published earning results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology industrial markets as well as many consumer products companies. As indicated, demand for our nearline drives has accelerated from earlier in the year as cloud service providers are deploying new systems and/or replacing HDDs that are in service. We expect this demand to be relatively flat in the September quarter. We see growth in some areas of high-capacity non-PC clients, specifically DVR, surveillance, NAS and seasonal gaming demand offset with declines in the PC-related markets as we narrow our participation in this segment. 
Overall exabyte demand should improve in the September quarter with our focus on high-capacity opportunities for our portfolio. Based on these factors, we expect revenue growth and gross margin improvement in the September quarter. Given the dynamic nature of the technology business as well as a still tepid macroeconomic environment, we have approached our outlook cautiously. We expect to achieve revenues of at least $2.7 billion in the September quarter with gross margins of at least 27% and relatively flat operating expenses. 
We believe it's important that investors recognize the continued shift from client/server to mobile cloud and the related infrastructure and application level changes taking place in our industry. These shifts are impacting our traditional customer base, while also creating significant opportunities for core technology providers such as Seagate with an expanding customer base. The new customer base includes our traditional OEMs and distribution customers, as well as significant and growing demand from cloud service providers, surveillance companies and will likely include corporate demand in the not too distant future. 
As a result of these changes in product demand and customer base, we have experienced shifts in our traditional seasonal demand patterns. Cyclicality associated with cloud infrastructure build-out can now override seasonality, and this has implications for investors expectations and management of our company resources. While the overall shift in technology deployment and related growth in data science applications is quite favorable for the HDD industry on a moving annual average, the rate of growth for storage demand in the near term will likely fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as major systems installations either aggressively deploy or absorb capacity. As we analyze these trends, we are considering that these changes in customer buying patterns and capacity utilization may be better reflected in the annual guidance planning for investors. We will discuss this possibility with our investors over the next few months. 
In addition, we continue to implement actions to align our manufacturing footprint and operating expense investment with market demand. These actions, as well as the product portfolio introductions previously discussed, should result in continued gross margin and operating margin improvement over the near term. Should there be improvement in the overall macroeconomic conditions, we would expect to see improved HDD unit demand across all markets with commensurate benefits to the company's financial performance.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we can now open it up for questions and answers."

I mean, I think, they have a decent sense of what they think they need in terms of capacity deployment on an annual basis. But when it breaks down to quarter-to-quarter, I think given the nature of the customers, many of them are actually witnessing centralized perspective of demand. So there's a bunch of BUs that are deploying, and a lot of those BUs actually buy on their own. Some of them go to a centralized deployment. Some of them don't. So you can't think of this big CSPs necessarily as holistically planning capacity for every one of their application sets because a lot of those business units within those companies are on their own cycles, and maybe it gets aggregated, maybe it doesn't, depending on the customer. So I think they're all learning. I think what's going to drive the better visibility is just the lead time associated with these products and we've already seen it with the ATB. As you know, the wafer cycle times on the heads are longer than the quarter and then the test times are 3 weeks on top of that. So you're well outside of a quarter in terms of lead time. So if you don't do a great job of your capacity planning in advance of a quarter as a CSP and you don't have excess capacity, you're going to be somewhat constrained especially as they move into these spaces where they could see big step function changes in demand, i.e., they pick up a big corporate customer that's going through a huge cloud-based installation of applications. Let's say if they don't have the capacity in place, they can't take that business. My guess is if they miss one piece of business like that once, all of a sudden, the planning is going to get a lot better. And we've seen that. Those trends are starting where you have these Fortune 50 or even Fortune 20 companies that are now making big moves to the cloud, and that puts on basically sometimes pressure of we need a whole new data center. And this is the beginning of the trend, not even the middle or the end game. So we expect a lot more of that. So the lead time -- and the lead times, of course, with the 10 terabyte or longer and the 12 terabyte or longer would just, because against the complexity of the technology, so your process content is way higher and of course, the test time is way higher. So I think, in general, their views aren't bad on the looking out over 12-month basis. It's just their quarter-to-quarter visibility is still developing. In terms of 8s, 10s, 12s, we think the 8s are going to be around for a long time, it's super high performance and very low-cost product for us. 10 TB, we certainly have customers that are taking the drive. We don't know that we see a huge uptick in 10 TB just because you're only picking up 2 terabytes and they cost a lot more right now. Maybe as the 2 companies get up the yield curve and bring cost down, we'll see an acceleration of the deployment. That's what we noticed on ATB that once you got up the yield curve, and in our case because we have a disc and 2 heads left, we were able to hit cross points that really accelerated the replacement of 4s and 6s with 8s. So whether or not it's 10 or maybe 12 where you pick up 50% more capacity, or frankly, maybe even 16 where it's -- I'm doubling capacity on that same real estate, it will be interesting to see where that transition happens. I think the important thing is to make sure, from a Seagate perspective, that we're leading in areal density and we continue to deliver that in our products. And whenever the customers decide they want that product, we'll be there with them."

Again, the CSP influence on the overall business is a little tricky just because, like we witnessed in this quarter, it can be so-- kind of significant. And when they do start buying, they tend to start buying for longer periods of times, 2, 3, 4 quarters. That really hasn't been modeled into our expectations. We'd rather kind of see the whites of their eyes before we make that call. We can say that July started off quite strong and the demand seems to be fairly solid. But as I think most of the analysts know, typically, the September quarter is backend-weighted quarter. And if we overlay the backend-weighted quarter on what we've seen so far, it kind of doesn't make sense to us. So we've been a bit cautious and then we'll see what happens with that demand. And again, I think until that customer base diversifies a bit more and we get, I think, more data around what happens month-to-month in addition to quarter-to-quarter, it's probably better for us just to be cautious about what we see and then be smarter as we move forward. What was the second question?
I still think the annual demand for storage is still probably more defined by available capacity than it is real demand. I mean, again, if you take population growth times connected devices times richness of content, it gets you easily to 3 or 4 zettabytes by 2020, which would imply kind of 30% to 35% annual growth in storage. And I still think that's really kind of what the demand is. And the question is, can the HDD industry or demand industry for that matter invest to those levels of capital or not? And we'll see. It's pretty tight though given the budgets that people have deployed or the fabs that are lined up. But I still think you're seeing exabyte demand that's well in excess of areal density demand. So in that sense, we view it as demand's outstripping supply. And then of course, those -- the packaging requirements are moving to more high capacity, so more heads in disc per units, but units probably flattening out. But from an absorption perspective for Seagate making heads in disc or because the process content is so much higher or the test content is so much higher, that's a really good trend for us."

For the June quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.65 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 25.8%, net income of $207 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.69. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the June quarter were $443 million. Capital expenditures of $146 million for the June quarter were higher than our previous forecast due to our decision to accelerate the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. In addition, we are accelerating the expansion of our crop [ph] facility to expedite the planned manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites. 
For the full fiscal year, our capital expenditures were $587 million, approximately 5% of revenue and below our targeted long-term model range of 6% to 8%. We believe Seagate's June quarter results are reflective of a generally stable but relatively benign macroeconomic environment as well as an acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end-users. Demand from cloud service providers was stronger than expected after several quarters of relatively modest demand from these customers. 
Our HDD shipments for the June quarter were 36.8 million units, representing a record 61.7 exabytes of storage. Average capacity per drive increased to a record 1.7 terabytes per drive, and ASPs of $67 were a record since the Thai floods. Overall inventory levels were down 6% sequentially. And within this, finished goods were down 21%. These inventory levels represent sequentially improved inventory turns and lean production schedules as we ramp our new HDD products throughout the portfolio. 
With respect to our cloud systems business, we are making good progress in ramping new platforms and gaining new customers, offset by some demand softness from top tier OEM and government customers. The integration of Dot Hill is complete and we will be launching converged storage platforms, including hybrid and all-flash array offerings later this fiscal year, which we believe are equal to or better than our competition. 
On the silicon side, we have recently introduced a number of new products including our industry-leading 2 terabyte NVMe Enterprise SSD product, which is getting positive customer feedback. This business is extremely competitive and we are working in conjunction with our key NAND partners who are enabling us to develop workload-specific and optimized products.
For the fiscal year 2016, Seagate achieved revenues of $11.2 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, net income of $684 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.26. In fiscal 2016, we shipped 233 exabytes with average capacity per drive up 29% year-over-year. Within these results, we shipped 70 exabytes for the business critical product portfolio, up 28% year-over-year. 
Consistent with our expectations of the impact of the shift from client/server to mobile cloud architectures, Seagate's HDD unit shipments over the last 5 fiscal years have decreased 15% while at the same time, exabyte shipments have grown 112% and the average capacity per drive has increased 133%.
Applications which require higher capacity HDDs are responsible for the record demand for HDD storage. Additionally, these application trends align with the Seagate actions that are in progress to optimize the utilization in our heads, media and drive test factories. Since the majority of exabyte growth is related to high-definition streaming content, where massive data ingest and sequential write operations are the key characteristics for the specific workloads, HDD is continuing to be the optimal cost performance solution over any other storage device. 
In the nearline enterprise market, our 8 terabyte products were the fastest-growing products in units and revenue within our overall HDD portfolio this quarter. We expect the market to continue to shift towards this capacity point over the next 2 years. Our 10 terabyte helium enterprise product is best-in-class for power performance, and we will be shipping our 12 terabyte helium nearline enterprise test units for customer evaluation this quarter. 
To meet the high-capacity storage requirements of the client marketplace, we have recently introduced 10 terabyte capacity points across our Guardian Series client portfolio, with particular focus on the surveillance, gaming, DVR and NAS markets. Over the next several quarters, we will refresh most of our high-volume capacity points in our portfolio with lower-cost designs using our leadership in areal density and our improved operational footprint. 
Our customers will benefit from the portfolio advancements and we believe that Seagate will be in leading competitive position as our market shifts from a low-capacity units-based demand profile to the future applications which are component-rich and require aggressive technology advancement. This is particularly important as the storage market shifts from client/server to mobile cloud applications and storage environments. While we expect the shift to continue to pressure PC unit volumes with HDDs, we are encouraged by the capacity needs of the remaining PC client as well as the significant growth in non-PC client devices and applications.
Assuming a relatively stable macro environment, we believe that given the continued shifts in our product revenues as well as recognizing the full impact of the significant changes in our manufacturing footprint and operating expenses, the company will achieve revenue growth, product gross margin improvements and improved profitability. 
I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on these activities."

With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial model that were impacted in F Q4. I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion around the actions we are taking to manufacturing and operating expense levels. For the June quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was higher than forecast, driving benefit and our revenue and margin results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand was stronger than our expectations, specifically for our nearline enterprise HDD products. Our ATB nearline enterprise products were our leading revenue SKUs as overall HDD enterprise revenue increased to 45% of our total HDDs revenue.
By comparison, our PC client shipments were 25% of HDD revenue in the June quarter, reflecting the shift of client/server storage environments and our strategic participation in the higher-capacity segments. We continue to make strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity notebook and gaming market where the gross margin contribution does not warrant the long-term manufacturing investment. As a result, our future forecast for Seagate's HDD unit addressable market may have a variance to our competition as we may not participate in all HDD unit sales demand in any given quarter. 
As we manage the shift in our product portfolio, customer demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are continuing to align the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint. And we are reducing our capital expenditures to maintenance capital requirement levels, which is expected to be less than 5% of our revenue over the next fiscal year. Through these actions, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity, and our operating philosophy will shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity.
Earlier this year, we began the process of reducing the HDD manufacturing capacity from approximately 55 million to 60 million drives per quarter to approximately 35 million to 40 million drives per quarter. The actions required will be completed within the next 6 to 9 months. At the same time, we are continuing to accelerate the utilization of our own drive factories, internal head and media facilities. 
Towards our infrastructure cost alignment, in the June quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $80 million in pretax charges. And additionally, in July, we announced further cost reduction activities reflecting $164 million in pretax charges. Overall restructuring actions are proceeding as planned and we expect the financial benefit of these actions will begin to have a positive impact in the September quarter. 
For the June quarter, we recorded a tax benefit of $16 million. This is primarily related to the release of tax reserves and changes in our deferred taxes and foreign jurisdictions impacted by our global footprint changes. Our overall fiscal year 2016 tax expense was $26 million.
While we are still formulating all of the actions we will take to address gross margins and operating profit, we believe the new high-capacity and cost advantage products in our full HDD portfolio refresh and overall cost alignment activities we are implementing will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year 2017. 
Given current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in exceeding the minimum of $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share in calendar 2017 that we indicated last quarter. We recognize that we are on track to exceed this goal and will provide additional insights for calendar 2017 on our October earnings call. 
Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $269 million and for fiscal 2016, we generated $1.7 billion in cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the June quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 299 million shares outstanding.
Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense. Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment. There has been no change to our dividend policy and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

As we manage the business in the near term, we are cognizant of the recent published earning results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology industrial markets as well as man",521,"Thanks, Dave. As we manage the business in the near term, we are cognizant of the recent published earning results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology industrial markets as well as many consumer products companies. As indicated, demand for our nearline drives has accelerated from earlier in the year as cloud service providers are deploying new systems and/or replacing HDDs that are in service. We expect this demand to be relatively flat in the September quarter. We see growth in some areas of high-capacity non-PC clients, specifically DVR, surveillance, NAS and seasonal gaming demand offset with declines in the PC-related markets as we narrow our participation in this segment. 
Overall exabyte demand should improve in the September quarter with our focus on high-capacity opportunities for our portfolio. Based on these factors, we expect revenue growth and gross margin improvement in the September quarter. Given the dynamic nature of the technology business as well as a still tepid macroeconomic environment, we have approached our outlook cautiously. We expect to achieve revenues of at least $2.7 billion in the September quarter with gross margins of at least 27% and relatively flat operating expenses. 
We believe it's important that investors recognize the continued shift from client/server to mobile cloud and the related infrastructure and application level changes taking place in our industry. These shifts are impacting our traditional customer base, while also creating significant opportunities for core technology providers such as Seagate with an expanding customer base. The new customer base includes our traditional OEMs and distribution customers, as well as significant and growing demand from cloud service providers, surveillance companies and will likely include corporate demand in the not too distant future. 
As a result of these changes in product demand and customer base, we have experienced shifts in our traditional seasonal demand patterns. Cyclicality associated with cloud infrastructure build-out can now override seasonality, and this has implications for investors’ expectations and management of our company resources. While the overall shift in technology deployment and related growth in data science applications is quite favorable for the HDD industry on a moving annual average, the rate of growth for storage demand in the near term will likely fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as major systems installations either aggressively deploy or absorb capacity. As we analyze these trends, we are considering that these changes in customer buying patterns and capacity utilization may be better reflected in the annual guidance planning for investors. We will discuss this possibility with our investors over the next few months. 
In addition, we continue to implement actions to align our manufacturing footprint and operating expense investment with market demand. These actions, as well as the product portfolio introductions previously discussed, should result in continued gross margin and operating margin improvement over the near term. Should there be improvement in the overall macroeconomic conditions, we would expect to see improved HDD unit demand across all markets with commensurate benefits to the company's financial performance.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we can now open it up for questions and answers."

I mean, I think, they have a decent sense of what they think they need in terms of capacity deployment on an annual basis. But when it breaks down to quarter-to-quarter, I think given the nature of the customers, many of them are actually witnessing centralized perspective of demand. So there's a bunch of BUs that are deploying, and a lot of those BUs actually buy on their own. Some of them go to a centralized deployment. Some of them don't. So you can't think of this big CSPs necessarily as holistically planning capacity for every one of their application sets because a lot of those business units within those companies are on their own cycles, and maybe it gets aggregated, maybe it doesn't, depending on the customer. So I think they're all learning. I think what's going to drive the better visibility is just the lead time associated with these products and we've already seen it with the ATB. As you know, the wafer cycle times on the heads are longer than the quarter and then the test times are 3 weeks on top of that. So you're well outside of a quarter in terms of lead time. So if you don't do a great job of your capacity planning in advance of a quarter as a CSP and you don't have excess capacity, you're going to be somewhat constrained especially as they move into these spaces where they could see big step function changes in demand, i.e., they pick up a big corporate customer that's going through a huge cloud-based installation of applications. Let's say if they don't have the capacity in place, they can't take that business. My guess is if they miss one piece of business like that once, all of a sudden, the planning is going to get a lot better. And we've seen that. Those trends are starting where you have these Fortune 50 or even Fortune 20 companies that are now making big moves to the cloud, and that puts on basically sometimes pressure of we need a whole new data center. And this is the beginning of the trend, not even the middle or the end game. So we expect a lot more of that. So the lead time -- and the lead times, of course, with the 10 terabyte or longer and the 12 terabyte or longer would just, because against the complexity of the technology, so your process content is way higher and of course, the test time is way higher. So I think, in general, their views aren't bad on the looking out over 12-month basis. It's just their quarter-to-quarter visibility is still developing. In terms of 8s, 10s, 12s, we think the 8s are going to be around for a long time, it's super high performance and very low-cost product for us. 10 TB, we certainly have customers that are taking the drive. We don't know that we see a huge uptick in 10 TB just because you're only picking up 2 terabytes and they cost a lot more right now. Maybe as the 2 companies get up the yield curve and bring cost down, we'll see an acceleration of the deployment. That's what we noticed on ATB that once you got up the yield curve, and in our case because we have a disc and 2 heads left, we were able to hit cross points that really accelerated the replacement of 4s and 6s with 8s. So whether or not it's 10 or maybe 12 where you pick up 50% more capacity, or frankly, maybe even 16 where it's -- I'm doubling capacity on that same real estate, it will be interesting to see where that transition happens. I think the important thing is to make sure, from a Seagate perspective, that we're leading in areal density and we continue to deliver that in our products. And whenever the customers decide they want that product, we'll be there with them."

Again, the CSP influence on the overall business is a little tricky just because, like we witnessed in this quarter, it can be so-- kind of significant. And when they do start buying, they tend to start buying for longer periods of times, 2, 3, 4 quarters. That really hasn't been modeled into our expectations. We'd rather kind of see the whites of their eyes before we make that call. We can say that July started off quite strong and the demand seems to be fairly solid. But as I think most of the analysts know, typically, the September quarter is backend-weighted quarter. And if we overlay the backend-weighted quarter on what we've seen so far, it kind of doesn't make sense to us. So we've been a bit cautious and then we'll see what happens with that demand. And again, I think until that customer base diversifies a bit more and we get, I think, more data around what happens month-to-month in addition to quarter-to-quarter, it's probably better for us just to be cautious about what we see and then be smarter as we move forward. What was the second question?
I still think the annual demand for storage is still probably more defined by available capacity than it is real demand. I mean, again, if you take population growth times connected devices times richness of content, it gets you easily to 3 or 4 zettabytes by 2020, which would imply kind of 30% to 35% annual growth in storage. And I still think that's really kind of what the demand is. And the question is, can the HDD industry or demand industry for that matter invest to those levels of capital or not? And we'll see. It's pretty tight though given the budgets that people have deployed or the fabs that are lined up. But I still think you're seeing exabyte demand that's well in excess of areal density demand. So in that sense, we view it as demand's outstripping supply. And then of course, those -- the packaging requirements are moving to more high capacity, so more heads in disc per units, but units probably flattening out. But from an absorption perspective for Seagate making heads in disc or because the process content is so much higher or the test content is so much higher, that's a really good trend for us."

We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our first fiscal quarter 2017 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com.  During today's call, we will review the highlights for the September quarter and provide the company outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2017 and then open the call for questions.
We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investors section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. 
We are planning for the call today to go approximately 0.5 hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits. 
As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, technology and product development advancements and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date.  Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. 
Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the Investors section of the company's website at seagate.com.
I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Luczo. Please go ahead, Steve."

For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business. Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the December quarter.
For the September quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, GAAP gross margins of 28.6%, net income of $167 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.55. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 29.5%, net income of $299 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.99, up 85% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $592 million.
We believe Seagate's September quarter reflects results or reflective of the generally stable but mixed macroeconomic environment as well as acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts [ph] of technologies and architectures by end users. 
Demand from cloud service providers for our nearline high-capacity portfolio was stronger than we expected going into the September quarter.
HDD exabyte shipments for the September quarter were up approximately 20% year-over-year with consecutive record shipments. We shipped 66.7 exabytes of storage in the September quarter. HDD unit shipments were 38.9 million units, with average capacity per drive at a record 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 44% year-over-year and reflecting our 10th quarter of sequential growth and capacity per drive. ASPs of $67 were sequentially flat for the September quarter. 
Our customers continue to benefit from our portfolio advancements, and we believe that Seagate is in a leading competitive position as our market shifts from a low-capacity, units-based demand profile to the future applications which are component-rich and require aggressive technology advancement. This is particularly important as the storage market shifts from client/server to mobile cloud applications and storage environments.
With respect to our Cloud Systems business, we are on track to launch new converged storage platforms, including hybrid and all-flash array offerings later this fiscal year, which we believe are equal to or better than our competition. And we expect to see continued revenue growth for this business in the December quarter.
We are pleased with Seagate's execution on the September quarter, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution on our cost reductions. 
I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on these activities."

With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the September quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion.For the September quarter,",714,"Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the September quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion.
For the September quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was higher than forecast, driving benefit in our revenue and margin results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand was stronger than our expectations, specifically for our nearline enterprise HDD products. Our ATB nearline enterprise products continues to be our leading revenue skew [ph] as overall HDD enterprise revenue was 41% of our total consolidated revenue. 
By comparison, our PC client shipments were 24% of total consolidated revenue in the September quarter, reflecting the shift of client/server storage environments and our competitive positioning in the [ph] higher-capacity segments.
From a market demand perspective, we continue to make strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity client market where the gross margin contribution does not warrant the long-term manufacturing investment. As a result, our future forecast for Seagate's HDD unit addressable market may have a variance to our competition, and our unit shipment market share may vary as we may not participate in all HDD unit sales demand in any given quarter.
Operating expenses for the September quarter were $580 million on a GAAP basis and $472 million on a non-GAAP basis. The sequential increase in our operating expenses was due to higher variable compensation expense related to the upside in our financial performance. 
During the September quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $82 million in pretax restructuring charges. We continue to drive our nonvariable compensation operating expense reduction activities, and our overall expenses will decline on a run rate basis as planned as we move through the fiscal year.
Capital expenditures amounted to $140 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital supporting the acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the planned manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites.
As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio, customer demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are on track to align the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue over the next fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity. Our operating philosophy will then shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity. 
While we are still in process of executing many actions, we believe that overall [ph] cost alignment activities in the new high-capacity and cost advantage [ph] products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year of 2017. 
Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around the midpoint of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32% and within our operating income targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY '17. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $592 million, and free cash flow was $452 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the September quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 299 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense.
For capital allocation, in the September quarter, we participated in a third-party block trade transaction in conjunction with value-add [ph] capital and deployed $100 million for the redemption of 3 million shares. 
Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter payable on January 4. There has been no change to our dividend policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Now as [ph] indicated, demand for our high-capacity nearline drives has accelerated from earlier in the year as cloud service providers are deploying new systems and/or replacing HDDs that are in service. 
For the December quarter, we expect this demand to remain stable, with overall market exabyte demand to be slightly stronger. We will maintain our focus on high-capacity opportunities for our portfolio. As such, we expect relatively flat revenue, with improvement in gross margins in the December quarter, and as previously discussed, nonvariable compensation operating expenses will trend down sequentially. 
We recognize the continued shift from cloud server [ph] to mobile cloud and the related infrastructure and application level changes taking place in our industry. These shifts are impacting our traditional product offering and customer base and are creating significant opportunities for core technology providers, such as Seagate, with an expanding customer base and higher value-add opportunities. The new customer base includes our traditional OEMs and distribution customers as well as significant and growing demand from cloud service providers, surveillance companies and will likely include corporate demand in the not-too-distant future.

So I think the factories are -- they're all running hot, but that wasn't unexpected. So I think at the component level, we're definitely at capacity, which the operations people like, as they love kind of chasing upsides and running linearly every month of the quarter.

But as you pointed out, the data center growth can have ebbs and flows, and they don't really kind of project out more than a few quarters. And even if they do, the accuracy that they have in the projection is not fantastic. Sometimes, they say they're going to slow down, and some big corporation decides to shift to cloud and sometimes they get -- utilization frees up. Sometimes, a particular customer were strong and may win or lose a big piece of business, which then creates an opportunity or they delay buying. So it's still, I think, fairly dynamic with an overall trend that can continue to absorb massive amount of storage as indicated by the record of exabyte shipment that we've now delivered 2 quarters in a row. So I think it's not going to be perfect quarter-to-quarter, but I think the 12-month over 12-month trends will be continue to be quite favorable as they have been for the last few years as we've started the shift to cloud."

We'll even see that on the client space, again, given where we're at in terms of 1 terabyte per disk notebook and 2 terabyte on desktop transition. We're going to get a mix advantage even within that space. So again, it's kind of all related to where we are technically. As we ramp these products, what we think our opportunity is competitively.

We did that when people thought we were going out of business 3 months ago. And -- but because we did, we gave them update, I think, the missing piece to do the model you want to do is where we think revenues are going to come in. Right now, I would say that we feel that there's can be revenue growth year-over-year and it's probably going to be in the mid-single digits, maybe mid- to high single digits. That would imply a, as you pointed out, beating that number by 40% to 50% with some headroom. So if you landed in the $3.75 to $4 range, I think that's probably right given that we can see today. But I think the good news is margins near the midpoint of the range. Operating margins, probably a year ahead where we thought we're going to be, And revenue growth, which I think we're feeling more confident on a year-over-year basis for the revenue growth as well."

As you know, in our business, you only need to be on capacity on one element, technically capacity. So yes, we're pretty much at capacity. But you got to remember, we're at capacity with a portfolio that's just rolling into a lot of new products. So the yield improvement potential is fairly significant. And then how we use that yield improvement in terms of where we use those extra heads, and that's very interesting as well. So we're just the biggest marginal contribution occurred as we free up capacity, whether or not it's head-related or disk-related or test-related. So yes, we're at capacity, but this is an extremely dynamic business that as you improve yield, you get more capacity. But as you get more capacity, you may then decide to use that more drives that have more heads and disks. So we're not in the business the way we want to. Let me skip to your third question because they're related as you pointed out. What that means is that when we scope a business to quote to 40 million units per quarter, then what we go do is task the steam to go for how the same footprint and same capital budget, how to get to 50. So it doesn't necessarily imply more capital per se. I think more capital would only be a function of was there some significant market opportunity, whether or not that was a spike in demand or a product opportunity from a technical leadership, which would then obviously be reflected in greater revenue growth or expanding gross margins. So we don't see any big change in where we run our business. And as you probably can tell, we've been really lean on capital, and we'll continue to do so even though we've had some fairly significant one-time capital events like what we're doing in our factories to prepare for the consolidation that we identified. Exabyte growth, again, I think it's just really important for everyone, whether or not it's an analyst or an investor, to understand that the exabyte growth feels like it's going to continue in this kind of 20% to 35% range on an annual basis. But that doesn't mean every year, quarter-over-quarter, it's going to go up 20%. And that's what we've witnessed, and that's, as I said before, it's going to be like this until we get more diversification of the cloud service providers or as corporations start to deploy cloud-like architectures that are using these super higher capacity drives. So whether or not you ask me for the next year or 2 years or 24 months or 18 months, my answer is kind of the same. It feels to us that the demand is going to continued for utilizing HDDs in the very highest capacity environments. And those are  that's a great trend for us because it's absorbing more heads and disk. It's a way more complicated channel. It's a way more complicated test. Manufacturing tolerance is much more difficult and all of that translates into a product that has a lot higher value-add. So we don't see any shift to that fundamental pieces."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call we are hosting from our corporate headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, following our successful Annual Meeting. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Phil Brace, President of Cloud Systems and Silicon Group. Dave Mosley, President and COO, is not on today's call due to travel. 
We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our first fiscal quarter 2017 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today's call, we will review the highlights for the September quarter and provide the company outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2017 and then open the call for questions.
We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investors section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. 
We are planning for the call today to go approximately 0.5 hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits. 
As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, technology and product development advancements and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. 
Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the Investors section of the company's website at seagate.com.
I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Luczo. Please go ahead, Steve."

For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business. Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the December quarter.
For the September quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, GAAP gross margins of 28.6%, net income of $167 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.55. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 29.5%, net income of $299 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.99, up 85% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $592 million.
We believe Seagate's September quarter reflects results or reflective of the generally stable but mixed macroeconomic environment as well as acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. 
Demand from cloud service providers for our nearline high-capacity portfolio was stronger than we expected going into the September quarter.
HDD exabyte shipments for the September quarter were up approximately 20% year-over-year with consecutive record shipments. We shipped 66.7 exabytes of storage in the September quarter. HDD unit shipments were 38.9 million units, with average capacity per drive at a record 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 44% year-over-year and reflecting our 10th quarter of sequential growth and capacity per drive. ASPs of $67 were sequentially flat for the September quarter. 
Our customers continue to benefit from our portfolio advancements, and we believe that Seagate is in a leading competitive position as our market shifts from a low-capacity, units-based demand profile to the future applications which are component-rich and require aggressive technology advancement. This is particularly important as the storage market shifts from client/server to mobile cloud applications and storage environments.
With respect to our Cloud Systems business, we are on track to launch new converged storage platforms, including hybrid and all-flash array offerings later this fiscal year, which we believe are equal to or better than our competition. And we expect to see continued revenue growth for this business in the December quarter.
We are pleased with Seagate's execution on the September quarter, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution on our cost reductions. 
I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on these activities."

With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the September quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion.For the September quarter,",709,"Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the September quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion.
For the September quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was higher than forecast, driving benefit in our revenue and margin results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand was stronger than our expectations, specifically for our nearline enterprise HDD products. Our ATB nearline enterprise products continues to be our leading revenue SKU as overall HDD enterprise revenue was 41% of our total consolidated revenue. 
By comparison, our PC client shipments were 24% of total consolidated revenue in the September quarter, reflecting the shift of client/server storage environments and our competitive positioning in the higher-capacity segments.
From a market demand perspective, we continue to make strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity client market where the gross margin contribution does not warrant the long-term manufacturing investment. As a result, our future forecast for Seagate's HDD unit addressable market may have a variance to our competition, and our unit shipment market share may vary as we may not participate in all HDD unit sales demand in any given quarter.
Operating expenses for the September quarter were $580 million on a GAAP basis and $472 million on a non-GAAP basis. The sequential increase in our operating expenses was due to higher variable compensation expense related to the upside in our financial performance. 
During the September quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $82 million in pretax restructuring charges. We continue to drive our nonvariable compensation operating expense reduction activities, and our overall expenses will decline on a run rate basis as planned as we move through the fiscal year.
Capital expenditures amounted to $140 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital supporting the acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the planned manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites.
As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio, customer demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are on track to align the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue over the next fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity. Our operating philosophy will then shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity. 
While we are still in process of executing many actions, we believe that overall cost alignment activities in the new high-capacity and cost advantage products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year of 2017. 
Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around the midpoint of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32% and within our operating income targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY '17. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $592 million, and free cash flow was $452 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the September quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 299 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense.
For capital allocation, in the September quarter, we participated in a third-party block trade transaction in conjunction with value-add capital and deployed $100 million for the redemption of 3 million shares. 
Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter payable on January 4. There has been no change to our dividend policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Now as indicated, demand for our high-capacity nearline drives has accelerated from earlier in the year as cloud service providers are deploying new systems and/or replacing HDDs that are in service. 
For the December quarter, we expect this demand to remain stable, with overall market exabyte demand to be slightly stronger. We will maintain our focus on high-capacity opportunities for our portfolio. As such, we expect relatively flat revenue, with improvement in gross margins in the December quarter, and as previously discussed, nonvariable compensation operating expenses will trend down sequentially. 
We recognize the continued shift from cloud server to mobile cloud and the related infrastructure and application level changes taking place in our industry. These shifts are impacting our traditional product offering and customer base and are creating significant opportunities for core technology providers, such as Seagate, with an expanding customer base and higher value-add opportunities. The new customer base includes our traditional OEMs and distribution customers as well as significant and growing demand from cloud service providers, surveillance companies and will likely include corporate demand in the not-too-distant future.

So I think the factories are -- they're all running hot, but that wasn't unexpected. So I think at the component level, we're definitely at capacity, which the operations people like because they love kind of chasing upsides and running linearly every month of the quarter.

But as you pointed out, the data center growth can have ebbs and flows, and they don't really kind of project out more than a few quarters. And even if they do, the accuracy that they have in that projection is not fantastic. Sometimes they say they're going to slow down, and some big corporation decides to shift to cloud, and sometimes they get -- utilization frees up. Sometimes, a particular customer were strong and may win or lose a big piece of business, which then either creates an opportunity or they delay buying. So it's still, I think, fairly dynamic, with an overall trend that they continue to absorb a massive amount of storage, as indicated by the record exabyte shipment that we've now delivered 2 quarters in a row. So I think it's not going to be perfect quarter-to-quarter, but I think the 12 month-over-12 month trends will continue to be quite favorable as they have been for the last few years as we started the shift to cloud."

Again, given the -- where we're at in terms of 1 terabyte per disk notebook and 2 terabyte on desktop transition, we're going to get a mix advantage even within that space. So again, it's kind of all related to where we are technically and, as we ramp these products, what we think our opportunity is competitively. In terms of your second comment, we posted 29.5%, and we said slight improvement, so I don't think that's at odds with what you just concluded."

We did that when people thought we were going out of business 3 months ago. And -- but because we did say we'd give them an update, I think the missing piece to do the model you want to do is, where do we think revenues are going to come in? Right now, I would say that we feel that there's going to be revenue growth year-over-year, and it's probably going to be in the mid-single digits, maybe mid- to high single digits. That would imply, as you pointed out, beating that number by 40% to 50% with some headroom. So if you landed in the $3.75 to $4 range, I think that's probably right given what we can see today. But I think the good news is margins near the midpoint in the range, operating margins, probably a year ahead where we thought we were going to be, and revenue growth, which I think we're feeling more confident that on a year-over-year basis, we're going to see the revenue growth as well."

I know the comps have been easier, but it feels like there's last few SKUs, maybe a little bit more high-cap demand than you guys thought there might -- well, than the industry has been seeing previously.

But you got to remember, we're at capacity with a portfolio that's j",547,"Well, Ananda, are we at capacity? As you know, in our business, you only need to be at capacity on one element, and you're technically at capacity. So yes, we're pretty much at capacity. But you got to remember, we're at capacity with a portfolio that's just rolling into a lot of new products. So the yield improvement potential is fairly significant. And then how we use that yield improvement in terms of where we use those extra heads, and it just gets very interesting as well. So where does the biggest marginal contribution occur as we free up capacity, whether or not it's head-related or disk-related or test-related? So yes, we're at capacity, but it's -- this is an extremely dynamic business that, as you improve yield, you get more capacity. But as you get more capacity, you may then decide to use that in more drives that have more heads and disks. So we're running the business the way we want to. Let me skip to your third question because they're related, as you pointed out. What that means is that when we scope a business to quote to 40 million units per quarter, then what we go do is we task the ops team to go figure out how -- in the same footprint and same capital budget, how to get to 50 million. So it doesn't necessarily imply more capital per se. I think more capital would only be a function of, was there some significant market opportunity, whether or not that was a spike in demand or a product opportunity from a technical leadership, which would then obviously be reflected in greater revenue growth or expanding gross margins. So we don't see any big change in where we run our business. And as you probably can tell, we've been really lean on capital, and we'll continue to do so even though we've had some fairly significant onetime capital events like what we're doing in our factories to prepare for the consolidation that we identified. Exabyte growth, again, I think it's just really important for everyone, whether or not it's an analyst or an investor, to understand that the exabyte growth feels like it's going to continue in this kind of 20% to 35% range on an annual basis. But that doesn't mean every year, quarter-over-quarter, it's going to go up 20%. And that's what we've witnessed, and that's -- as I said before, it's going to be like this until we get more diversification of the cloud service providers or as corporations start to deploy cloud-like architectures that are using these super high-capacity drives. So whether or not you ask me for the next year or 2 years or 24 months or 18 months, my answer is kind of the same. It feels to us that the demand is going to continue for utilizing HDDs in the very highest-capacity environments. And those are -- that's a great trend for us because it's absorbing more heads and disk. It's a way more complicated channel. It's more -- a way more complicated test. Manufacturing tolerance is much more difficult. And all of that translates into a product that has a lot higher value add. So we don't see any shift to that fundamental thesis."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call we are hosting from our corporate headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, following our successful Annual Meeting. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Phil Brace, President of Cloud Systems and Silicon Group. Dave Mosley, President and COO, is not on today's call due to travel. 
We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our first fiscal quarter 2017 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today's call, we will review the highlights for the September quarter and provide the company outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2017 and then open the call for questions.
We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investor section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. 
We are planning for the call today to go approximately 0.5 hours, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits. 
As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, technology and product development advancements, and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date.

For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business. Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the December quarter.
For the September quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, GAAP gross margins of 28.6%, net income of $167 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.55. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 29.5%, net income of $299 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.99, up 85% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $592 million.
We believe Seagate's September quarter reflects -- results are reflective of the generally stable but mixed macroeconomic environment as well as acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. 
Demand from cloud service providers for our nearline high-capacity portfolio was stronger than we expected going into the September quarter.
HDD exabyte shipments for the September quarter were up approximately 20% year-over-year with consecutive record shipments. We shipped 66.7 exabytes of storage in September quarter. HDD unit shipments were 38.9 million units with average capacity per drive at a record 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 44% year-over-year and reflecting our 10th quarter of sequential growth and capacity per drive. ASPs of $67 were sequentially flat for the September quarter. 
Our customers continue to benefit from our portfolio advancements, and we believe that Seagate is in the leading competitive position as our market shifts from a low-capacity, units-based demand profile to the future applications which are component-rich and require aggressive technology advancement. This is particularly important as the storage market shifts from client/server to mobile cloud applications and storage environments.
With respect to our cloud systems business, we are on track to launch new converged storage platforms, including hybrid and all-Flash array offerings later this fiscal year, which we believe are equal to or better than our competition. And we expect to see continued revenue growth for this business in the December quarter.
We are pleased with Seagate's execution in the September quarter, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution on our cost reductions. 
I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on these activities."

With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the September quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion.For the September quarter,",708,"Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the September quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion.
For the September quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was higher than forecast, driving benefit in our revenue and margin results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand was stronger than our expectations, specifically for our nearline enterprise HDD products. Our ATB nearline enterprise products continues to be our leading revenue SKU as overall HDD enterprise revenue was 41% of our total consolidated revenue. 
By comparison, our PC client shipments were 24% of total consolidated revenue in the September quarter, reflecting the shift of client/server storage environments and our competitive positioning in the higher-capacity segments.
From a market demand perspective, we continue to make strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity client market where the gross margin contribution does not warrant the long-term manufacturing investment. As a result, our future forecast for Seagate's HDD unit addressable market may have a variance to our competition, and our unit shipment market share may vary as we may not participate in all HDD unit sales demand in any given quarter.
Operating expenses for the September quarter were $580 million on a GAAP basis and $472 million on a non-GAAP basis. The sequential increase in our operating expenses was due to higher variable compensation expense related to the upside in our financial performance. 
During the September quarter, we implemented certain cost-reduction activities and recognized approximately $82 million in pretax restructuring charges. We continue to drive our nonvariable compensation operating expense reduction activities, and our overall expenses will decline on a run rate basis as planned as we move through the fiscal year.
Capital expenditures amounted to $140 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital supporting the acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the planned manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites.
As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio, customer demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are on track to align the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue over the next fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity. Our operating philosophy will then shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity. 
While we are still in process of executing many actions, we believe that overall cost alignment activities in the new high-capacity and cost advantage products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year of 2017. 
Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around the midpoint of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32% and within our operating income targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY '17. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $592 million, and free cash flow was $452 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the September quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 299 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense.
For capital allocation in the September quarter, we participated in a third-party block trade transaction in conjunction with ValueAct capital and deployed $100 million for the redemption of 3 million shares. 
Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter payable on January 4. There has been no change to our dividend policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Now as indicated, demand for our high-capacity nearline drives has accelerated from earlier in the year as cloud service providers are deploying new systems and/or replacing HDDs that are in service. 
For the December quarter, we expect this demand to remain stable, with overall market exabyte demand to be slightly stronger. We will maintain our focus on high-capacity opportunities for our portfolio. As such, we expect relatively flat revenue with improvement in gross margins in the December quarter, and as previously discussed, nonvariable compensation operating expenses will trend down sequentially. 
We recognize the continued shift from cloud server to mobile cloud and the related infrastructure and application-level changes taking place in our industry. These shifts are impacting our traditional product offering and customer base and are creating significant opportunities for core technology providers such as Seagate with an expanding customer base and higher value-add opportunities. The new customer base includes our traditional OEMs and distribution customers as well as significant and growing demand from cloud service providers, surveillance companies, and will likely include corporate demand in the not-too-distant future.

So I think the factories are -- they're all running hot, but that wasn't unexpected. So I think at the component level, we're definitely at capacity, which the operations people like because they love kind of chasing upsides and running linearly every month of the quarter.

But as you pointed out, the data center growth can have ebbs and flows, and they don't really kind of project out more than a few quarters. And even if they do, the accuracy that they have in that projection is not fantastic. Sometimes they say they're going to slow down, and some big corporation decides to shift to cloud, and sometimes they get -- utilization frees up. Sometimes, a particular customer were strong and may win or lose a big piece of business, which then either creates an opportunity or they delay buying. So it's still, I think, fairly dynamic with an overall trend that they continue to absorb a massive amount of storage as indicated by the record exabyte shipment that we've now delivered 2 quarters in a row. So I think it's not going to be perfect quarter-to-quarter, but I think the 12 month over 12 month trends will continue to be quite favorable as they have been for the last few years as we started the shift to cloud."

Because of our technical lead, that's the right place for us to be at. We'll even see that on the client space. Again, given the -- where we're at in terms of 1 terabyte per disk notebook and 2 terabyte on desktop transition, we're going to get a mix advantage even within that space. So again, it's kind of all related to where we are technically and, as we ramp these products, what we think our opportunity is competitively. In terms of your second comment, we posted 29.5%, and we said slight improvement, so I don't think that's at odds with what you just concluded."

I think Dave gave most of the pieces other than what we're thinking for revenue, and we're not going to kind of stay in the business of a calendar projection. We did that when people thought we were going out of business 3 months ago. And -- but because we did say we'd give them an update, I think the missing piece to do the model you want to do is where do we think revenues are going to come in? Right now, I would say that we feel that there's going to be revenue growth year-over-year, and it's probably going to be in the mid-single digits, maybe mid- to high single digits. That would imply, as you pointed out, beating that number by 40% to 50% with some headroom. So if you landed in the $3.75 to $4 range, I think that's probably right given what we can see today. But I think the good news is margins near the midpoint of the range, operating margins, probably a year ahead of where we thought we were going to be, and revenue growth, which I think we're feeling more confident that on a year-over-year basis, we're going to see the revenue growth as well."

I know the comps have been easier, but it feels like there's a last few cues, maybe a little bit more high-cap demand than you guys thought there -- well, than the industry has been seeing previously. And then the final thing is your comment about -- collectively, your guys comments about being in business to chase demand, if you can position as you want kind of exiting this.

But you got to remember, we're at capacity with a portfolio that's j",545,"Well, Ananda, are we at capacity? As you know, in our business, you only need to be at capacity on one element, and you're technically at capacity. So yes, we're pretty much at capacity. But you got to remember, we're at capacity with a portfolio that's just rolling into a lot of new products. So the yield improvement potential is fairly significant. And then how we use that yield improvement in terms of where we use those extra heads and disks gets very interesting as well. So where does the biggest marginal contribution occur as we free up capacity, whether or not it's head-related or disk-related or test-related? So yes, we're at capacity, but it's -- this is an extremely dynamic business that, as you improve yield, you get more capacity. But as you get more capacity, you may then decide to use that in more drives that have more heads and disks. So we're running the business the way we want to. Let me skip to your third question because they're related as you pointed out. What that means is that when we scope a business to quote to 40 million units per quarter, then what we go do is we task the ops team to go figure out how -- in the same footprint and same capital budget, how to get to 50 million. So it doesn't necessarily imply more capital, per se. I think more capital would only be a function of, was there some significant market opportunity, whether or not that was a spike in demand or a product opportunity from a technical leadership, which would then, obviously, be reflected in greater revenue growth or expanding gross margins. So we don't see any big change in where we run our business. And as you probably can tell, we've been really lean on capital, and we'll continue to do so even though we've had some fairly significant onetime capital events like what we're doing in our factories to prepare for the consolidation that we identified. Exabyte growth, again, I think it's just really important for everyone, whether or not it's an analyst or an investor, to understand that the exabyte growth feels like it's going to continue in this kind of 20% to 35% range on an annual basis. But that doesn't mean every year, quarter-over-quarter, it's going to go up 20%. And that's what we've witnessed, and that's -- as I said before, it's going to be like this until we get more diversification of the cloud service providers or as corporations start to deploy cloud-like architectures that are using these super high-capacity drives. So whether or not you ask me for the next year or 2 years or 24 months or 18 months, my answer is kind of the same. It feels to us that the demand is going to continue for utilizing HDDs in the very highest-capacity environments. And those are -- that's a great trend for us because it's absorbing more heads and disk. It's a way more complicated channel. It's more -- way more complicated test. Manufacturing tolerances are much more difficult. And all of that translates into a product that has a lot higher value add. So we don't see any shift to that fundamental thesis."

Dave Mosley, President and COO, is not on today's call due to travel. 
We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our first fiscal quarter 2017 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today's call, we will review the highlights for the September quarter and provide the company outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2017 and then open the call for questions.
We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investor section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. 
We are planning for the call today to go approximately 0.5 hours, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits.

For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business. Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the December quarter.
For the September quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, GAAP gross margins of 28.6%, net income of $167 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.55. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 29.5%, net income of $299 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.99, up 85% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $592 million.
We believe Seagate's September quarter reflects -- results are reflective of the generally stable but mixed macroeconomic environment as well as acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. 
Demand from cloud service providers for our nearline high-capacity portfolio was stronger than we expected going into the September quarter.
HDD exabyte shipments for the September quarter were up approximately 20% year-over-year with consecutive record shipments. We shipped 66.7 exabytes of storage in September quarter. HDD unit shipments were 38.9 million units with average capacity per drive at a record 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 44% year-over-year and reflecting our 10th quarter of sequential growth and capacity per drive. ASPs of $67 were sequentially flat for the September quarter. 
Our customers continue to benefit from our portfolio advancements, and we believe that Seagate is in the leading competitive position as our market shifts from a low-capacity, units-based demand profile to the future applications which are component-rich and require aggressive technology advancement. This is particularly important as the storage market shifts from client/server to mobile cloud applications and storage environments.
With respect to our cloud systems business, we are on track to launch new converged storage platforms, including hybrid and all-Flash array offerings later this fiscal year, which we believe are equal to or better than our competition. And we expect to see continued revenue growth for this business in the December quarter.
We are pleased with Seagate's execution in the September quarter, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution on our cost reductions. 
I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on these activities."

With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the September quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion.For the September quarter,",708,"Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the September quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion.
For the September quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was higher than forecast, driving benefit in our revenue and margin results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand was stronger than our expectations, specifically for our nearline enterprise HDD products. Our ATB nearline enterprise products continues to be our leading revenue SKU as overall HDD enterprise revenue was 41% of our total consolidated revenue. 
By comparison, our PC client shipments were 24% of total consolidated revenue in the September quarter, reflecting the shift of client/server storage environments and our competitive positioning in the higher-capacity segments.
From a market demand perspective, we continue to make strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity client market where the gross margin contribution does not warrant the long-term manufacturing investment. As a result, our future forecast for Seagate's HDD unit addressable market may have a variance to our competition, and our unit shipment market share may vary as we may not participate in all HDD unit sales demand in any given quarter.
Operating expenses for the September quarter were $580 million on a GAAP basis and $472 million on a non-GAAP basis. The sequential increase in our operating expenses was due to higher variable compensation expense related to the upside in our financial performance. 
During the September quarter, we implemented certain cost-reduction activities and recognized approximately $82 million in pretax restructuring charges. We continue to drive our nonvariable compensation operating expense reduction activities, and our overall expenses will decline on a run rate basis as planned as we move through the fiscal year.
Capital expenditures amounted to $140 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital supporting the acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the planned manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites.
As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio, customer demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are on track to align the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue over the next fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity. Our operating philosophy will then shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity. 
While we are still in process of executing many actions, we believe that overall cost alignment activities in the new high-capacity and cost advantage products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year of 2017. 
Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around the midpoint of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32% and within our operating income targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY '17. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $592 million, and free cash flow was $452 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the September quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 299 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense.
For capital allocation in the September quarter, we participated in a third-party block trade transaction in conjunction with ValueAct capital and deployed $100 million for the redemption of 3 million shares. 
Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter payable on January 4. There has been no change to our dividend policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Now as indicated, demand for our high-capacity nearline drives has accelerated from earlier in the year as cloud service providers are deploying new systems and/or replacing HDDs that are in service. 
For the December quarter, we expect this demand to remain stable, with overall market exabyte demand to be slightly stronger. We will maintain our focus on high-capacity opportunities for our portfolio. As such, we expect relatively flat revenue with improvement in gross margins in the December quarter, and as previously discussed, nonvariable compensation operating expenses will trend down sequentially. 
We recognize the continued shift from cloud server to mobile cloud and the related infrastructure and application level changes taking place in our industry. These shifts are impacting our traditional product offering and customer base and are creating significant opportunities for core technology providers such as Seagate with an expanding customer base and higher value-add opportunities. The new customer base includes our traditional OEMs and distribution customers as well as significant and growing demand from cloud service providers, surveillance companies, and will likely include corporate demand in the not-too-distant future.

So I think the factories are -- they're all running hot, but that wasn't unexpected. So I think at the component level, we're definitely at capacity, which the operations people like because they love kind of chasing upsides and running linearly every month of the quarter.

But as you pointed out, the data center growth can have ebbs and flows, and they don't really kind of project out more than a few quarters. And even if they do, the accuracy that they have in that projection is not fantastic. Sometimes they say they're going to slow down, and some big corporation decides to shift to cloud, and sometimes they get -- utilization frees up. Sometimes, a particular customer were strong and may win or lose a big piece of business, which then either creates an opportunity or they delay buying. So it's still, I think, fairly dynamic with an overall trend that they continue to absorb a massive amount of storage as indicated by the record exabyte shipment that we've now delivered 2 quarters in a row. So I think it's not going to be perfect quarter-to-quarter, but I think the 12 month over 12 month trends will continue to be quite favorable as they have been for the last few years as we started the shift to cloud."

Because of our technical lead, that's the right place for us to be at. We'll even see that on the client space. Again, given the -- where we're at in terms of 1 terabyte per disk notebook and 2 terabyte on desktop transition, we're going to get a mix advantage even within that space. So again, it's kind of all related to where we are technically and, as we ramp these products, what we think our opportunity is competitively. In terms of your second comment, we posted 29.5%, and we said slight improvement, so I don't think that's at odds with what you just concluded."

I think Dave gave most of the pieces other than what we're thinking for revenue, and we're not going to kind of stay in the business of a calendar projection. We did that when people thought we were going out of business 3 months ago. And -- but because we did say we'd give them an update, I think the missing piece to do the model you want to do is where do we think revenues are going to come in? Right now, I would say that we feel that there's going to be revenue growth year-over-year, and it's probably going to be in the mid-single digits, maybe mid- to high single digits. That would imply, as you pointed out, beating that number by 40% to 50% with some headroom. So if you landed in the $3.75 to $4 range, I think that's probably right given what we can see today. But I think the good news is margins near the midpoint of the range, operating margins, probably a year ahead of where we thought we were going to be, and revenue growth, which I think we're feeling more confident that on a year-over-year basis, we're going to see the revenue growth as well."

But you got to remember, we're at capacity with a portfolio that's j",545,"Well, Ananda, are we at capacity? As you know, in our business, you only need to be at capacity on one element, and you're technically at capacity. So yes, we're pretty much at capacity. But you got to remember, we're at capacity with a portfolio that's just rolling into a lot of new products. So the yield improvement potential is fairly significant. And then how we use that yield improvement in terms of where we use those extra heads and disks gets very interesting as well. So where does the biggest marginal contribution occur as we free up capacity, whether or not it's head-related or disk-related or test-related? So yes, we're at capacity, but it's -- this is an extremely dynamic business that, as you improve yield, you get more capacity. But as you get more capacity, you may then decide to use that in more drives that have more heads and disks. So we're running the business the way we want to. Let me skip to your third question because they're related as you pointed out. What that means is that when we scope a business to quote to 40 million units per quarter, then what we go do is we task the ops team to go figure out how -- in the same footprint and same capital budget, how to get to 50 million. So it doesn't necessarily imply more capital, per se. I think more capital would only be a function of, was there some significant market opportunity, whether or not that was a spike in demand or a product opportunity from a technical leadership, which would then, obviously, be reflected in greater revenue growth or expanding gross margins. So we don't see any big change in where we run our business. And as you probably can tell, we've been really lean on capital, and we'll continue to do so even though we've had some fairly significant onetime capital events like what we're doing in our factories to prepare for the consolidation that we identified. Exabyte growth, again, I think it's just really important for everyone, whether or not it's an analyst or an investor, to understand that the exabyte growth feels like it's going to continue in this kind of 20% to 35% range on an annual basis. But that doesn't mean every year, quarter-over-quarter, it's going to go up 20%. And that's what we've witnessed, and that's -- as I said before, it's going to be like this until we get more diversification of the cloud service providers or as corporations start to deploy cloud-like architectures that are using these super high-capacity drives. So whether or not you ask me for the next year or 2 years or 24 months or 18 months, my answer is kind of the same. It feels to us that the demand is going to continue for utilizing HDDs in the very highest-capacity environments. And those are -- that's a great trend for us because it's absorbing more heads and disk. It's a way more complicated channel. It's more -- way more complicated test. Manufacturing tolerances are much more difficult. And all of that translates into a product that has a lot higher value add. So we don't see any shift to that fundamental thesis."
