Today, I will review our results for the quarter and the year, after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. 
Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $239 million. Earnings per share were $0.99 and our return on common equity was 11.1%. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the quarter. 
Equity markets were lower year-over-year but higher, sequentially. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 was down 1% year-over-year and up 6.5%, sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was down about 3% year-over-year and up 4.4% sequentially with the year-over-year decline being driven by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Recall too that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and the third quarter 2015 markets were generally lower. 
In markets, the Barclays U.S. aggregate index was lower both year-over-year and sequentially. Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 11% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. In the sequential comparison, currency volatility was 4% lower. Foreign exchange market volumes, as measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, were down over 20% year-over-year and down about 13%, sequentially. Called that currency volatility and client activity influence are foreign exchange trading income. 
Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The dollar was stronger year-over-year, which tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth but benefited expense growth. Sequentially, the dollar was stronger against most major currencies, except the Australian dollar and Swedish kronor. 
U.S. short-term interest rates rose on the heels of the first Federal Reserve rate increase in nearly a decade. 3-month LIBOR and the Fed funds effective rate averaged 41 and 16 basis points, respectively both higher, sequentially. The overnight repo rate was also higher, averaging 22 basis points in the quarter. Before I move on -- move to the highlights of the quarter, allow me to mention one item discussed in our press release. 
In the fourth quarter, we sold approximately $550 million of nonstrategic leases and loans for a net gain of $26 million. We also wrote down by approximately $27 million certain held for sale leases, which had a book value of $112 million at year-end. The net effect of these 2 items on other operating income was essentially nil. 
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 2% with noninterest income essentially unchanged and net interest income up 9%. Expenses increased 6%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $18.5 million in the quarter, reflecting a change in the estimation methodology for inherent losses and improving credit quality. I'll explain the methodology changed later on this call. Net income was 2% lower year-over-year. 
In the sequential comparison, revenue was essentially flat with noninterest income down 2% and net interest income up 8%. Expenses increased 2%. Net income was 2% higher, sequentially. Client assets under custody of $6.1 trillion increased 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, strong new business was partially offset by the currency translation impact of a strong dollar. In the sequential quarter comparison, favorable equity markets and new business were partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar against most major currencies. 
Assets under management were $875 billion, down 6% year-over-year. A decline in equity assets was the primary driver due primarily to outflows from certain sovereign Wealth fund clients in light of economic conditions in their regions, a continuation of the trend we mentioned last quarter. In addition, fixed income assets were lower year-over-year, primarily due to the loss of one sizable passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned last quarter. Assets under management decreased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by lower securities lending collateral. 
Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 2% year-over-year and unchanged, sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $747 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% year-over-year and essentially unchanged, sequentially. New business and lower money market mutual fund waivers were the primary drivers of year-over-year growth with currency translation, as I mentioned earlier, detracting from overall fee growth by about 1 percentage points. Fee waivers were approximately $20.5 million in the fourth quarter, lower by $12.5 million year-over-year and $7 million, sequentially. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly. 
Foreign exchange trading income was $53 million in the fourth quarter, down 13% year-over-year and 16%, sequentially. Lower client volumes drove year-over-year decline while the sequential decline reflects lower volume and volatility. Other noninterest income was $68 million in the fourth quarter, down 12% from last year and down 9%, sequentially. The primary driver of the decline was other operating income, which at $33 million, was 20% lower year-over-year and 13% lower sequentially, reflecting decreases in various categories. 
In the year-over-year comparison, recall that the fourth quarter of 2014 included 2 quarters of income associated with a third-party servicing equipment, which was modified in late 2014. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $296 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 9% year-over-year at 8%, sequentially. 
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services businesses -- business, fees totaled $428 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% year-over-year and essentially unchanged, sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $286 million in the fourth quarter, up 2% year-on-year and down 3% sequentially while assets under custody for C&IS clients were spiking [ph] $6 trillion at quarter end, up 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year growth in custody and fund administration fees primarily reflects new business, partially offset by the unfavorable currency translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. 
In the sequential comparison, new business was more than offset by lower quarter lag equity markets, lower transaction volumes and favorable currency translation. Investment management fees in C&IS of $86 million in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were $8 million, lower by $9 million year-over-year and $4 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. 
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $648 million [ph] down 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier. Securities lending fees were $22 million in the fourth quarter, 3% higher than last year and 13% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $104 billion at year-end, but averaged $124 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. 
Other fees and C&IS were $34 billion in the fourth quarter, up 19% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services and benefit payments. The year-over-year increase also reflects higher sub advisory fees. 
Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $319 million in the fourth quarter, essentially unchanged both year-over-year and sequentially. In both comparisons, new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets. 
Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled $13 million in the current quarter, down $4 million year-over-year and $3 million sequentially, primarily reflecting higher gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $227 billion at year-end, up 1% both year-over-year and sequentially. 
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $296 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year and up 8% compared to the third quarter. Growth was driven by a higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Earning assets averaged $106 billion in the quarter, up 6% versus last year and 5% sequentially. In both comparisons driven in part by the level of client demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion, up 20% year-over-year and 7%, sequentially. 
We see solid loan growth again this quarter. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The net interest margin was 1.11% in the fourth quarter, up 3 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects a higher yield on the securities portfolio due to lower premium amortization in our mortgage-backed portfolio. Premium amortization was less than $1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $14 million in the third quarter and $7 million, 1 year ago. 
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $825 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially. Compensation expense, up $366 million, increased 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth and the impact of annual base pay adjustments, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates and a lower accrual for incentive compensation. Staff levels increased approximately 3% year-over-year with more than 85% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila and Limerick and our newest operating center in Tempe, Arizona. 
On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 1%, primarily reflecting staff growth. Employee benefit expense of $69 million increased 11% year-over-year, reflecting higher pension expense and employee medical expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense decreased 1% due primarily to seasonally lower payroll taxes. 
Outside services expense of $155 million was 8% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. Outside services expense declined 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower third-party sub advisory expense. Equipment & Software expense of $117 million was up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. 
Higher depreciation expense also contributed to the sequential increase. Other operating expense of $74 million increased by percent year-over-year and 14% sequentially, primarily, driven by higher business promotion expense and other miscellaneous expenses. The effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was 31.7%. Our fourth quarter results include a $5.5 million income tax benefit related to our decision to reinvest the earnings of certain additional foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the United States. This decision under APV opinion #23 reflects the continued growth and success of our business outside the U.S. and is consistent with similar [indiscernible] in the past. Excluding this income tax benefit, the effective tax rate was 33.6 and earnings per share were $0.96. 
As I mentioned earlier, our loan loss provision was a credit of $18.5 million in the fourth quarter. This reflects not only improving credit quality, as evidenced by a 9% or $19 million sequential reduction in nonperforming assets, but also a change effective December 31 in our methodology for estimating inherent losses. The new estimation methodology is more quantitatively focused and leveraged as work developed for regulatory purposes. This change resulted in a decrease in the inherent loss estimate for commercial and institutional loan portfolio, partially offset by increase in the allowance for off balance sheet commitments. 
Turning to the full year. Our results in 2015 are summarized on Page 8. Net income was $974 million and earnings per share were $3.99, both up 20% compared with 2014. During 2015, we recorded a $99.9 million gain on the sale of a portion of our holdings and Visa shares, a $45.8 million charge for voluntary cash conversions to certain confident funds, and a lease impairment of $17.8 million. Excluding these items, net income was $951 million and earnings per share were $3.98. 
We achieved a return on equity for the year of 11.5%, adjusted for the items I just noted, better than 10% in 2014 and between our target range of 10% to 15%. Full-year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, grew 5% in 2015; new business across segments and geographies contributed to this result. Foreign exchange trading income increased 25%, primarily reflecting higher currency volatility. Net interest income increased 6%, primarily driven by 7% growth in earning assets. The net result was 8% growth in overall revenue in 2015. 
Expenses were 5% higher in 2015, reflecting investments in staffing and technology to support the growth of the business as well as to comply with evolving regulatory requirements. 
Turning to Page 10, our key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expenses to fees ratio, pretax margin and ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees are particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses where we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from 131% in 2011 to 110 in 2015 has been a key contributor to the improvement in our return in equity from 8.6% to 11.5% across the same time period. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward.
Turning to Page 11. Our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.9 and 10.8, respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.5% and under the standardized approach approximately 10.5%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. 
The supplementary leverage ratio of the corporation was 6.2% and at the bank was 5.6%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable in Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. 
As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance on regulations on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the consolation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares at the cost of $152 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional 285 million of common stock for June 2016. 
For the full year, we returned 830 million in capital to shareholders via common dividends of 333 million and share repurchases of 497 million. Our total payout ratio for the year was 87%, which we believe continue to position Northern Trust among the highest rates of capital return across large U.S. banks. 
In closing, in 2015, we continued to grow the firm profitability for our shareholders, deliver comprehensive solutions for our clients and improve our technology and infrastructure to ensure the sustainability of our momentum. From a financial perspective, we delivered an 11.5% return on equity for the full-year moving further into our target range of 10% to 15%. In addition, we returned $830 million to our shareholder through our dividends and stock repurchases while maintaining strong capital liquidity levels. 
Our C&IS business delivered strong profitable growth in 2015. New business success was balanced both globally and across client and product types. During the year, C&IS introduced several new or enhanced capabilities for its clients. For example, we launched our complete FX service and outsourced foreign exchange execution for investment managers, which provides flexible execution options and operational efficiency. We also announced the agreement to acquire 88 Global LLP and institutional focused equity brokerage firm, which will expand our existing capabilities to the EMEA and the AIPAC regions. 
Our Wealth Management business grew revenue was 4% year-over-year, continue to produce attractive margins, achieving a pretax margin for the year of 36%. The product innovation in support of our personal clients continued in 2015. For example, in response to an increase in demand for art advisory services and how art fits in a client asset allocation, we have expanded our expertise in providing leverage against collections to preserve liquidity and a client's portfolio and the state. Also in 2015, we implemented a first-generation bank by text platform. Clients are now able to check balances, view their net worth summary, transfer money, locate ATMs and form other frequently used banking functions via text on their mobile devices.  
Our Asset Management business also has been successful in creating innovative client solutions. We expect to launch soon a new generation of target funds designed to improve retirement outcomes by leveraging our engineer equity expertise. Lastly, our investment technology and infrastructure facilitate that the growth we produced in 2015. An example of our investment was acknowledged in December when we were awarded best cloud and best analytical initiatives by Wires magazine, which recognizes financial services technology excellence.

And then also it seems like the biggest driver this quarter was the spike in the GSC book, the yields there.

And you can project the forward benefit of that going forward in your models. In terms of the securities portfolio improvement, if you will, in the spread, that was driven by the premium amortization that you described was a meaningful component of that during the period. It had some seasonality, but it's more impacted by factors such as movement in the housing market and/or rates in any given period. So we do typically see a slowdown in housing activity in the fourth quarter. We generally have better amortization in that period, if you will. But as we mentioned in the script, in the first part of the prepared remarks, it was slightly larger than last year, more than slightly was about $13 million difference quarter-over-quarter."

I know you called out that the loan sales, but I'm wondering if you can get a little tighter about extending credit given your outlook on the environment or is that just reading too much into it?"

In terms of our own credit quality, it's important to remember this. Our mix in our credit portfolio, as we have slowed or we have negative growth, if you will, in residential real estate, the growth is largely coming from areas that are investment account secured or large C&I type loans where the credit quality remains very robust and very strong right now. So the mix in our portfolio has driven improvement in the overall credit quality. I think we referenced the 9% sequential improvement in nonperforming assets and I think when a year-over-year basis the nonperforming assets were closer at 9% better. So we have experienced strength in our own credit portfolio."

So we still think the expensive fees ratio, it's an important barometer of our progress for sustainably improving profitability and returns. And we remain committed to improving that ratio.

I would say, Glen, as you pointed out on an annualized basis, we improved that since 2011 every year and we were like I said, remain committed to that improvement. Also, there is a numerator and a denominator in that equation in that ratio as you know it, and a different macroenvironment certainly makes the pace at which we can improve that challenging, particularly if you look across a very short time rate like a quarter. Look, we are cold focused on the areas that we can drive that. And that's new business on the topline and fee growth on the top line and the success continues there, very strongly new business results for the firm. On the expense side, on the denominator, if you will, or excuse me, the numerator on the expense side, we've got several initiatives that we continue to work on our location strategy procurement optimization, technology optimization, those are still in force and still moving at pace. You see some of that investment in our equipment software line in the depreciation. We don't have long-term benefits for us. So if a longer answer. But it's the question I know that matters.

So there are people providing services to companies and others that have been impacted.

Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today, I will review our results for the quarter and the year, after which, Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. 
Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $239 million. Earnings per share were $0.99 and our return on common equity was 11.1%. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the quarter. 
Equity markets were lower year-over-year but higher, sequentially. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 was down 1% year-over-year and up 6.5%, sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was down about 3% year-over-year and up 4.4% sequentially, with the year-over-year decline being driven by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Recall, too, that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and the third quarter 2015 markets were generally lower.  In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. aggregate index was lower both year-over-year and sequentially. 
Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 11% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. In the sequential comparison, currency volatility was 4% lower. Foreign exchange market volumes, as measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, were down over 20% year-over-year and down about 13%, sequentially. [indiscernible] calls that currency volatility and client activity influenced our foreign exchange trading income. 
Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar, and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The dollar was stronger year-over-year, which tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, but benefited expense growth. Sequentially, the dollar was stronger against most major currencies, except the Australian dollar and Swedish kronor. 
U.S. short-term interest rates rose on the heels of the first Federal Reserve rate increase in nearly a decade. 3-month LIBOR and the Fed funds effective rate averaged 41 and 16 basis points, respectively, both higher, sequentially. The overnight repo rate was also higher, averaging 22 basis points in the quarter. 
Before I move on -- move to the highlights of the quarter, allow me to mention one item discussed in our press release.  In the fourth quarter, we sold approximately $550 million of nonstrategic leases and loans for a net gain of $26 million. We also wrote down by approximately $27 million certain held for sale leases which had a book value of $112 million at year-end. The net effect of these 2 items on other operating income was essentially nil. 
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 2%, with noninterest income essentially unchanged and net interest income up 9%. Expenses increased 6%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $18.5 million in the quarter, reflecting a change in the estimation methodology for inherent losses and improving credit quality. I'll explain the methodology change later on this call. 
Net income was 2% lower year-over-year. 
In the sequential comparison, revenue was essentially flat, with noninterest income down 2% and net interest income up 8%. Expenses increased 2%. Net income was 2% higher, sequentially. 
Client assets under custody of $6.1 trillion increased 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, strong new business was partially offset by the currency translation impact of a strong dollar. In the sequential quarter comparison, favorable equity markets and new business were partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar against most major currencies. 
Assets under management were $875 billion, down 6% year-over-year. A decline in equity assets was the primary driver due primarily to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients in light of economic conditions in their regions, a continuation of the trend we mentioned last quarter. In addition, fixed income assets were lower year-over-year, primarily due to the loss of one sizable passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned last quarter. Assets under management decreased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by lower securities lending collateral. 
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue, on Page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 2% year-over-year and unchanged sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $747 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% year-over-year and essentially unchanged, sequentially. New business and lower money market mutual fund waivers were the primary drivers of year-over-year growth, with currency translation, as I mentioned earlier, detracting from overall fee growth by about 1 percentage point. Fee waivers were approximately $20.5 million in the fourth quarter, lower by $12.5 million year-over-year and $7 million, sequentially. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly. 
Foreign exchange trading income was $53 million in the fourth quarter, down 13% year-over-year and 16%, sequentially. Lower client volumes drove year-over-year decline, while the sequential decline reflects lower volumes and volatility. Other noninterest income was $68 million in the fourth quarter, down 12% from last year and down 9%, sequentially. The primary driver of the decline was other operating income, which at $33 million, was 20% lower year-over-year and 13% lower sequentially, reflecting decreases in various categories.  In the year-over-year comparison, recall that the fourth quarter of 2014 included 2 quarters of income associated with a third-party servicing agreement, which was modified in late 2014. 
Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $296 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 9% year-over-year at 8%, sequentially. 
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services businesses -- business, fees totaled $428 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% year-over-year and essentially unchanged, sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $286 million in the fourth quarter, up 2% year-on-year and down 3% sequentially; while assets under custody for C&IS clients were spiking at $6 trillion at quarter end, up 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year growth in custody and fund administration fees primarily reflects new business, partially offset by the unfavorable currency translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.  In the sequential comparison, new business was more than offset by lower quarter lag equity markets, lower transaction volumes and unfavorable currency translation. Investment management fees in C&IS of $86 million in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were $8 million, lower by $9 million year-over-year and $4 million, sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. 
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $648 million down 9% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier. 
Securities lending fees were $22 million in the fourth quarter, 3% higher than last year and 13% higher, sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $104 billion at year-end, but averaged $124 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. 
Other fees in C&IS were $34 billion in the fourth quarter, up 19% year-over-year and 1%, sequentially, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services and benefit payments. The year-over-year increase also reflects higher sub-advisory fees. 
Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $319 million in the fourth quarter, essentially unchanged both year-over-year and sequentially. In both comparisons, new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets. 
Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled $13 million in the current quarter, down $4 million year-over-year and $3 million sequentially, primarily reflecting higher gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $227 billion at year-end, up 1% both year-over-year and sequentially. 
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $296 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year and up 8% compared to the third quarter. Growth was driven by a higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Earning assets averaged $106 billion in the quarter, up 6% versus last year and 5%, sequentially, in both comparisons, driven in part by the level of client demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion, up 20% year-over-year and 7%, sequentially. 
We saw solid loan growth again this quarter. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially. 
The net interest margin was 1.11% in the fourth quarter, up 3 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects a higher yield on the securities portfolio due to lower premium amortization in our mortgage-backed portfolio. Premium amortization was less than $1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $14 million in the third quarter and $7 million 1 year ago. 
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $825 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially. Compensation expense of $366 million, increased 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth and the impact of annual base pay adjustments, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates and a lower accrual for incentive compensation. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year, with more than 85% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila and Limerick and our newest operating center in Tempe, Arizona.  On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 1%, primarily reflecting staff growth. 
Employee benefit expense of $69 million increased 11% year-over-year, reflecting higher pension expense and employee medical expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense decreased 1% due primarily to seasonally lower payroll taxes. 
Outside services expense of $155 million was 8% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. Outside services expense declined 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower third-party sub-advisory expense. Equipment and software expense of $117 million was up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives.  Higher depreciation expense also contributed to the sequential increase. 
Other operating expense of $74 million increased 5% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, primarily driven by higher business promotion expense and other miscellaneous expenses. The effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was 31.7%. Our fourth quarter results include a $5.5 million income tax benefit related to our decision to reinvest the earnings of certain additional foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the United States. This decision under APB Opinion No. 23 reflects the continued growth and success of our business outside the U.S. and is consistent with similar [indiscernible] in the past. Excluding this income tax benefit, the effective tax rate was 33.%  and earnings per share were $0.96. 
As I mentioned earlier, our loan loss provision was a credit of $18.5 million in the fourth quarter. This reflects not only improving credit quality, as evidenced by a 9% or $19 million sequential reduction in nonperforming assets, but also a change effective December 31 in our methodology for estimating inherent losses. The new estimation methodology is more quantitatively focused and leveraged as work developed for regulatory purposes. This change resulted in a decrease in the inherent loss estimate for commercial and institutional loan portfolio, partially offset by increase in the allowance for off-balance sheet commitments. 
Turning to the full year. Our results in 2015 are summarized on Page 8. Net income was $974 million and earnings per share were $3.99, both up 20% compared with 2014. During 2015, we recorded a $99.9 million gain on the sale of a portion of our holdings in Visa shares, a $45.8 million charge for voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar NAV funds, and a lease impairment of $17.8 million. Excluding these items, net income was $951 million and earnings per share were $3.90.
We achieved a return on equity for the year of 11.5%, adjusted for the items I just noted, better than 10% in 2014 and within our target range of 10% to 15%. 
Full-year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, grew 5% in 2015. New business across segments and geographies contributed to this result. Foreign exchange trading income increased 25%, primarily reflecting higher currency volatility. Net interest income increased 6%, primarily driven by 7% growth in earning assets. The net result was 8% growth in overall revenue in 2015. 
Expenses were 5% higher in 2015, reflecting investments in staffing and technology to support the growth of the business, as well as to comply with evolving regulatory requirements. 
Turning to Page 10, our key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expenses to fees ratio, pretax margin, and ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from 131% in 2011 to 110% in 2015 has been a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity from 8.6% to 11.5% across the same time period. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward.
Turning to Page 11. Our capital ratios remained solid, with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.9 and 10.8, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.5%, and under the standardized approach, would be approximately 10.5%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. 
The supplementary leverage ratio of the corporation was 6.2% and at the bank was 5.6%, both of which exceeds the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. 
As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. 
In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares at the cost of $152 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional 285 million of common stock for June 2016. 
For the full year, we returned 830 million in capital to shareholders via common dividends of 333 million and share repurchases of 497 million. Our total payout ratio for the year was 87%, which we believe continues to position Northern Trust among the highest rates of capital returned across large U.S. banks. 
In closing, in 2015, we continued to grow the firm profitability for our shareholders, deliver comprehensive solutions for our clients and improve our technology and infrastructure to ensure the sustainability of our momentum. From a financial perspective, we delivered an 11.5% return on equity for the full-year, moving further into our target range of 10% to 15%. In addition, we returned $830 million to our shareholder through our dividends and stock repurchases while maintaining strong capital liquidity levels. 
Our C&IS business delivered strong, profitable growth in 2015. New business success was balanced both globally and across client and product types. During the year, C&IS introduced several new or enhanced capabilities for its clients. For example, we launched our complete FX service and outsourced foreign exchange execution for investment managers, which provides flexible execution options and operational efficiency. We also announced the agreement to acquire Aviate Global LLP, an institutional-focused equity brokerage firm, which will expand our existing capabilities to the EMEA and APAC regions. 
Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 4% year-over-year and continue to produce attractive margins, achieving a pretax margin for the year of 36%. Product innovation, in support of our personal clients, continued in 2015. For an example, in response to an increase in demand for art advisory services and how art fits in a client's asset allocation, we have expanded our expertise in providing leverage against collections to preserve liquidity and the client's portfolio and estate. Also in 2015, we implemented a first-generation bank-by-text platform. Clients are now able to check balances, view their net worth summary, transfer money, locate ATMs and perform other frequently used banking functions via text on their mobile devices.  
Our Asset Management business also has been successful in creating innovative client solutions. We expect to launch soon a new generation of target date funds designed to improve retirement outcomes by leveraging our engineered equity expertise. 
Lastly, our investment in technology and infrastructure facilitated the growth we produced in 2015. An example of our investment was acknowledged in December when we were awarded best cloud and best analytical initiatives by Waters Magazine, which recognizes financial services technology excellence.

In terms of the securities portfolio improvement, if you will, and the spread, that was driven by the premium amortization that you described, was a meaningful component of that during the period. It had some seasonality, but it's more impacted by factors such as movement in the housing market and/or rates in any given period. So we do typically see a slowdown in housing activity in the fourth quarter. We generally have better amortization in that period, if you will. But as we mentioned in the script, in the first part of the prepared remarks, it was slightly larger than last year. More than slightly. It was about $13 million difference quarter-over-quarter."

So the mix in our portfolio has driven improvement in the overall credit quality. I think we referenced the 9% sequential improvement in nonperforming assets, and I think on a year-over-year basis, the nonperforming assets were closer at 19% better.

We still think that the expense-to-fees ratio is an important barometer of our progress toward sustainably improving profitability and returns. And we remain committed to improving that ratio. And as you noted, in the short-term and our quarterly progress, there can be a variety of factors. I would say, Glenn, as you pointed out, on an annualized basis, we-ve improved that since 2011 every year and we were, like I said, remain committed to that improvement. Also, there is a numerator and a denominator in that equation, in that ratio, as you know. And a different macro environment certainly makes the pace at which we can improve that challenging, particularly if you look across a very short time frame like a quarter. Look, we're focused on the areas that we can drive that, and that's new business on the top line and fee growth on the top line, and the success continues there. Very strong new business results for the firm. On the expense side, on the denominator, if you will -- or excuse me, on the numerator on the expense side, we've got several initiatives that we continue to work on: Our location strategy, procurement optimization, technology optimization. Those are still in force and still moving at pace. You see some of that investment in our equipment software line, and the depreciation, we hope, has long-term benefits for us. So a little longer answer, but it's the question I know that matters. We are committed to continuing to drive that ratio down. As fee growth slows, we have to recalibrate our business to address that on the expense side."

You probably have a gain on those purchases in the fourth quarter. So I'm not sure if we'll see gains on those down the road. But my question relates to the funding of some of the purchases. I know you were asked before, and I missed the answer. The short-term borrowings were up $1.7 billion. Now I'm just trying to understand the balance sheet dynamics a little bit more. I mean, earning assets grew at an annualized pace of 20% and you have short-term borrowings up quite a bit. And why? A lot of questions have touched on this, but I just want to make sure I have the right answer."

So that's on the institutional side. I know you also asked on the wealth side. And certainly, in certain regions, we've talked about Houston in that. There are -- there can be secondary or tertiary impacts from low oil prices. So there are people providing services to companies and others that have been impacted. Generally, our clients, given the wealth nature of our clients, are liquid, well-invested and well-diversified, away from those single-asset wealth creation vehicles. And we generally see modest impact to them from this type of environment. Our direct exposure, as you rightly said, is largely to large multinational, diversified firms with strong investment-grade credits. And so from a credit -- overall credit quality, at this point, while we certainly monitor it and look at it from a risk perspective, it does not have a significant impact on the overall credit quality of the firm."

It can be some of the impacts of netted low -- net interest income margins, et cetera, that are driving that fundamentally. I will say that our business is much more liability-driven. And so the focus is really on turning -- those liabilities are our fees, essentially. Those liabilities are clients placing deposits that we then turn into assets. And so our focus is on return on equity. And it just so happens that the ability to turn those liabilities into higher-earning assets has been muted in the last several years under these low environments. But I think the combination of those has probably driven the ROA down. But we focus really on the ROE as a primary profitability measure."

Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today, I will review our results for the quarter and the year, after which, Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. 
Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $239 million. Earnings per share were $0.99 and our return on common equity was 11.1%. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the quarter. 
Equity markets were lower year-over-year but higher, sequentially. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 was down 1% year-over-year and up 6.5%, sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was down about 3% year-over-year and up 4.4% sequentially, with the year-over-year decline being driven by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Recall, too, that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and the third quarter 2015 markets were generally lower.  In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. aggregate index was lower both year-over-year and sequentially. 
Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 11% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. In the sequential comparison, currency volatility was 4% lower. Foreign exchange market volumes, as measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, were down over 20% year-over-year and down about 13%, sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influenced our foreign exchange trading income. 
Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar, and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The dollar was stronger year-over-year, which tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, but benefited expense growth. Sequentially, the dollar was stronger against most major currencies, except the Australian dollar and Swedish kronor. 
U.S. short-term interest rates rose on the heels of the first Federal Reserve rate increase in nearly a decade. 3-month LIBOR and the Fed funds effective rate averaged 41 and 16 basis points, respectively, both higher, sequentially. The overnight repo rate was also higher, averaging 22 basis points in the quarter. 
Before I move on -- move to the highlights of the quarter, allow me to mention one item discussed in our press release.  In the fourth quarter, we sold approximately $550 million of nonstrategic leases and loans for a net gain of $26 million. We also wrote down, by approximately $27 million, certain held for sale leases which had a book value of $112 million at year-end. The net effect of these 2 items on other operating income was essentially nil. 
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 2%, with noninterest income essentially unchanged and net interest income up 9%. Expenses increased 6%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $18.5 million in the quarter, reflecting a change in the estimation methodology for inherent losses and improving credit quality. I'll explain the methodology change later on this call. 
Net income was 2% lower year-over-year. 
In the sequential comparison, revenue was essentially flat, with noninterest income down 2% and net interest income up 8%. Expenses increased 2%. Net income was 2% higher, sequentially. 
Client assets under custody of $6.1 trillion increased 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, strong new business was partially offset by the currency translation impact of a strong dollar. In the sequential quarter comparison, favorable equity markets and new business were partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar against most major currencies. 
Assets under management were $875 billion, down 6% year-over-year. A decline in equity assets was the primary driver due primarily to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients in light of economic conditions in their regions, a continuation of the trend we mentioned last quarter. In addition, fixed income assets were lower year-over-year, primarily due to the loss of one sizable passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned last quarter. Assets under management decreased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by lower securities lending collateral. 
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue, on Page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 2% year-over-year and unchanged sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $747 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% year-over-year and essentially unchanged, sequentially. New business and lower money market mutual fund waivers were the primary drivers of year-over-year growth, with currency translation, as I mentioned earlier, detracting from overall fee growth by about 1 percentage point. Fee waivers were approximately $20.5 million in the fourth quarter, lower by $12.5 million year-over-year and $7 million, sequentially. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly. 
Foreign exchange trading income was $53 million in the fourth quarter, down 13% year-over-year and 16%, sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline, while the sequential decline reflects lower volumes and volatility. Other noninterest income was $68 million in the fourth quarter, down 12% from last year and down 9%, sequentially. The primary driver of the decline was other operating income, which at $33 million, was 20% lower year-over-year and 13% lower sequentially, reflecting decreases in various categories.  In the year-over-year comparison, recall that the fourth quarter of 2014 included 2 quarters of income associated with a third-party servicing agreement, which was modified in late 2014. 
Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $296 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 9% year-over-year and 8%, sequentially. 
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services businesses -- business, fees totaled $428 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% year-over-year and essentially unchanged, sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $286 million in the fourth quarter, up 2% year-on-year and down 3% sequentially; while assets under custody for C&IS clients were spiking [ph] at $6 trillion at quarter end, up 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year growth in custody and fund administration fees primarily reflects new business, partially offset by the unfavorable currency translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.  In the sequential comparison, new business was more than offset by lower quarter lag equity markets, lower transaction volumes and unfavorable currency translation. Investment management fees in C&IS of $86 million in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were $8 million, lower by $9 million year-over-year and $4 million, sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. 
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $648 million down 9% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier. 
Securities lending fees were $22 million in the fourth quarter, 3% higher than last year and 13% higher, sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $104 billion at year-end, but averaged $124 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. 
Other fees in C&IS were $34 billion in the fourth quarter, up 19% year-over-year and 1%, sequentially, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services and benefit payments. The year-over-year increase also reflects higher sub-advisory fees. 
Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $319 million in the fourth quarter, essentially unchanged both year-over-year and sequentially. In both comparisons, new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets. 
Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled $13 million in the current quarter, down $4 million year-over-year and $3 million sequentially, primarily reflecting higher gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $227 billion at year-end, up 1% both year-over-year and sequentially. 
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $296 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year and up 8% compared to the third quarter. Growth was driven by a higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Earning assets averaged $106 billion in the quarter, up 6% versus last year and 5%, sequentially, in both comparisons, driven in part by the level of client demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion, up 20% year-over-year and 7%, sequentially. 
We saw solid loan growth again this quarter. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially. 
The net interest margin was 1.11% in the fourth quarter, up 3 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects a higher yield on the securities portfolio due to lower premium amortization in our mortgage-backed portfolio. Premium amortization was less than $1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $14 million in the third quarter and $7 million 1 year ago. 
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $825 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially. Compensation expense of $366 million, increased 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth and the impact of annual base pay adjustments, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates and a lower accrual for incentive compensation. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year, with more than 85% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila and Limerick and our newest operating center in Tempe, Arizona.  On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 1%, primarily reflecting staff growth. 
Employee benefit expense of $69 million increased 11% year-over-year, reflecting higher pension expense and employee medical expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense decreased 1% due primarily to seasonally lower payroll taxes. 
Outside services expense of $155 million was 8% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. Outside services expense declined 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower third-party sub-advisory expense. Equipment and software expense of $117 million was up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives.  Higher depreciation expense also contributed to the sequential increase. 
Other operating expense of $74 million increased 5% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, primarily driven by higher business promotion expense and other miscellaneous expenses. The effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was 31.7%. Our fourth quarter results include a $5.5 million income tax benefit related to our decision to reinvest the earnings of certain additional foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the United States. This decision under APB Opinion No. 23 reflects the continued growth and success of our business outside the U.S. and is consistent with similar assertions made in the past. Excluding this income tax benefit, the effective tax rate was 33.%  and earnings per share were $0.96. 
As I mentioned earlier, our loan loss provision was a credit of $18.5 million in the fourth quarter. This reflects not only improving credit quality, as evidenced by a 9% or $19 million sequential reduction in nonperforming assets, but also a change effective December 31 in our methodology for estimating inherent losses. The new estimation methodology is more quantitatively focused and leveraged as work developed for regulatory purposes. This change resulted in a decrease in the inherent loss estimate for commercial and institutional loan portfolio, partially offset by increase in the allowance for off-balance sheet commitments. 
Turning to the full year. Our results in 2015 are summarized on Page 8. Net income was $974 million and earnings per share were $3.99, both up 20% compared with 2014. During 2015, we recorded a $99.9 million gain on the sale of a portion of our holdings in Visa shares, a $45.8 million charge for voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar NAV funds, and a lease impairment of $17.8 million. Excluding these items, net income was $951 million and earnings per share were $3.90.
We achieved a return on equity for the year of 11.5%, adjusted for the items I just noted, better than 10% in 2014 and within our target range of 10% to 15%. 
Full-year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, grew 5% in 2015. New business across segments and geographies contributed to this result. Foreign exchange trading income increased 25%, primarily reflecting higher currency volatility. Net interest income increased 6%, primarily driven by 7% growth in earning assets. The net result was 8% growth in overall revenue in 2015. 
Expenses were 5% higher in 2015, reflecting investments in staffing and technology to support the growth of the business, as well as to comply with evolving regulatory requirements. 
Turning to Page 10, our key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expenses to fees ratio, pretax margin, and ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from 131% in 2011 to 110% in 2015 has been a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity from 8.6% to 11.5% across the same time period. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward.
Turning to Page 11. Our capital ratios remained solid, with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.9 and 10.8, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.5%, and under the standardized approach, would be approximately 10.5%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. 
The supplementary leverage ratio of the corporation was 6.2% and at the bank was 5.6%, both of which exceeds the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. 
As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. 
In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares at a cost of $152 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional 285 million of common stock for June 2016. 
For the full year, we returned 830 million in capital to shareholders via common dividends of 333 million and share repurchases of 497 million. Our total payout ratio for the year was 87%, which we believe continues to position Northern Trust among the highest rates of capital returned across large U.S. banks. 
In closing, in 2015, we continued to grow the firm profitability for our shareholders, deliver comprehensive solutions for our clients and improve our technology and infrastructure to ensure the sustainability of our momentum. From a financial perspective, we delivered an 11.5% return on equity for the full-year, moving further into our target range of 10% to 15%. In addition, we returned $830 million to our shareholders through our dividends and stock repurchases while maintaining strong capital liquidity levels. 
Our C&IS business delivered strong, profitable growth in 2015. New business success was balanced both globally and across client and product types. During the year, C&IS introduced several new or enhanced capabilities for its clients. For example, we launched our complete FX service and outsourced foreign exchange execution service for investment managers, which provides flexible execution options and operational efficiency. We also announced the agreement to acquire Aviate Global LLP, an institutional-focused equity brokerage firm, which will expand our existing capabilities to the EMEA and APAC regions. 
Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 4% year-over-year and continue to produce attractive margins, achieving a pretax margin for the year of 36%. Product innovation in support of our personal clients continued in 2015. For an example, in response to an increase in demand for art advisory services and how art fits in a client's asset allocation, we have expanded our expertise in providing leverage against collections, to preserve liquidity in a client's portfolio and estate. Also in 2015, we implemented a first-generation bank-by-text platform. Clients are now able to check balances, view their net worth summary, transfer money, locate ATMs and perform other frequently used banking functions via text on their mobile devices.  
Our Asset Management business also has been successful in creating innovative client solutions. We expect to launch, soon, a new generation of target date funds designed to improve retirement outcomes by leveraging our engineered equity expertise. 
Lastly, our investment in technology and infrastructure facilitated the growth we produced in 2015. An example of our investment was acknowledged in December when we were awarded Best Cloud and Best Analytics Initiatives by Waters Magazine, which recognizes financial services technology excellence.

Your analysis is correct, we benefited, obviously, from just a brief 2 weeks of that and you can project the forward benefit of that going forward in your models. In terms of the securities portfolio improvement, if you will, in the spread, that was driven by the premium amortization that you described, was a meaningful component of that during the period. It had some seasonality, but it's more impacted by factors such as movement in the housing market and/or rates in any given period. So we do typically see a slowdown in housing activity in the fourth quarter. We generally have better amortization in that period, if you will. But as we mentioned in the script, in the first part of the prepared remarks, it was slightly larger than last year -- more than slightly, it was about $13 million difference quarter-over-quarter."

So the mix in our portfolio has driven improvement in the overall credit quality. I think we referenced the 9% sequential improvement in nonperforming assets, and I think on a year-over-year basis, the nonperforming assets were closer at 19% better.

We still think that the expense-to-fees ratio is an important barometer of our progress toward sustainably improving profitability and returns. And we remain committed to improving that ratio. And as you noted, in the short-term and on a quarterly progress, there can be a variety of factors. I would say, Glenn, as you pointed out, on an annualized basis, we have improved that since 2011 every year and we were, like I said, remain committed to that improvement. Also, there is a numerator and a denominator in that equation, in that ratio, as you know. And a different macro environment certainly makes the pace at which we can improve that challenging, particularly if you look across a very short time frame, like a quarter. Look, we're focused on the areas that we can drive that, and that's new business on the top line and fee growth on the top line, and the success continues there. Very strong new business results for the firm. On the expense side, on the denominator, if you will -- or excuse me, on the numerator on the expense side, we've got several initiatives that we continue to work on: our location strategy, procurement optimization, technology optimization. Those are still in force and still moving at pace. You see some of that investment in our equipment and software line, and the depreciation, we hope, has long-term benefits for us. So a little longer answer, but it's the question I know that matters. We are committed to continuing to drive that ratio down. As fee growth slows, we have to recalibrate our business to address that on the expense side."

So we have a natural movement, either up or down, based on market levels. So there's a component in our expense base that moves relative to those markets. So it's not all fixed cost, if you will, into our expense base. As we thought -- think about the year going forward, we certainly -- we're on multiple iterations of macro factors impacting our business, such as markets up x or down x; rates; hikes, coming or not coming, and we run multiple iterations. We try very hard to run our business without macro factors being major inputs to the success of the firm's business going forward, which means we are not overly reliant on either rates or markets in any given period. And so that's how we build our process. And we hope that not being overly reliant allows us to be flexible in our ability to react to large macro events, particularly, in your question, on the expense side."

So that phenomena has helped drive down the AUM. What I will say is, about 95% of those are passive management mandates and generally have very low basis point fees.

So that's on the institutional side. I know you also asked on the wealth side. And certainly, in certain regions, we've talked about Houston as that, there are -- there can be secondary or tertiary impacts from low oil prices. So there are people providing services to companies and others that have been impacted. Generally, our clients, given the wealth nature of our clients, are liquid, well invested and well diversified away from those single-asset wealth creation vehicles and we generally see modest impact to them from this type of environment. Our direct exposure, as you rightly said, is largely to large multinational, diversified firms with strong investment-grade credits. And so from a credit -- overall credit quality, at this point, while we certainly monitor it and look at it from a risk perspective, it has not had a significant impact on the overall credit quality of the firm."

It can be some of the impacts of netted low -- low net interest income margins, et cetera, that are driving that fundamentally. I will say that our business is much more liability-driven. And so the focus is really on turning -- those liabilities are our fees, essentially, those liabilities are clients placing deposits that we then turn into assets. And so our focus is on return on equity. And it just so happens that the ability to turn those liabilities into higher-earning assets has been muted in the last several years under these low environments. But I think the combination of those has probably driven the ROA down. But we focus really on the ROE as a primary profitability measure."

Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $242 million",2797,"Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. 
Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $242 million, earnings per share were $1.01 and our return on common equity was 11.4%. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of these factors unfolded during the first quarter.
Equity markets rebounded in March after a volatile and negative start to the year. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter down 0.4% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE index was down 10.7% year-over-year and down 3.7% sequentially.  Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and fourth quarter 2015 markets were generally higher. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. aggregate index was lower year-over-year and higher sequentially.
Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 2% higher than the first quarter of last year and 12% higher sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were varied in the first quarter. As measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 11% to 14% year-over-year and up 19% to 24% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influenced our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, primarily versus the British pounds sterling, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth.
U.S. short-term interest rates were higher following the Federal Reserve rate increase in December. 3-month LIBOR and the fed funds effective rate averaged 62 and 37 basis points respectively, both higher sequentially. The overnight repo rate was also higher averaging 46 basis points in the quarter.
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 5% with noninterest income up a modest 1% and net interest income up a strong 18%. Expenses also increased 5%. The provision for credit losses was $2 million. Net income was 5% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 3% with noninterest income up 2% and net interest income up 6%. Expenses were essentially flat when compared with the fourth quarter. Net income was 1% higher sequentially.
Client assets under custody of $6.2 trillion increased 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, strong new business was partially offset by lower international equity markets and the currency translation impact of a strong dollar. In the sequential quarter comparison, new business, favorable quarter end equity markets and currency translation were all contributors to asset growth.
Assets under management were $900 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Lower equity assets were the primary driver due to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and weaker global equity markets. In addition, fixed income assets were lower primarily due to the loss of 1 passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned last quarter. Assets under management increased 3% sequentially primarily driven by higher cash and equity valances. 
Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with the revenue on Page 4. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 5% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $748 million in the first quarter, up 3% year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially.
Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver of this quarter. Fee waivers were approximately $8 million in the first quarter, lower by $25 million year-over-year and $13 million sequentially. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly.
Foreign exchange trading income was $61 million in the first quarter, down 15% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline while the sequential improvements reflect higher volumes and volatility.
Other noninterest income was $74 million in the first quarter, down 2% from last year and up 9% sequentially. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher other operating income. In the first quarter, we recorded a net gain of $2.3 million related to our decision to exit a portion of a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio, which I mentioned on this call last quarter. Our fourth quarter results included a $1.1 million net loss in other operating income related to the same decision. 
Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $314 million in the first quarter, increasing 18% year-over-year and 6% sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $433 million in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $286 million, up 3% year-over-year and unchanged sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.7 trillion at quarter end, up 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets and currency translation. Recall that lagged market values factor in to the quarter's fees, with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.
Investment management fees in C&IS of $89 million in the first quarter were up 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were approximately $2 million, lower by $13 million year-over-year and $6 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the fund.
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $670 billion down 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier, and up 3% sequentially due primarily to a $15 billion increase in cash balances and a $5 billion increase in equities.
Securities lending fees were $23 million in the first quarter, 5% higher than last year and 1% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $106 billion at quarter end and averaged $115 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower loan volumes in U.S. treasuries. This asset class has been most impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage in the securities lending business.
Other fees in C&IS were $35 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, and other ancillary services. In the sequential quarter comparison, other fees were up 4%, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payments business.
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust investment and other servicing fees were $315 million in the first quarter, down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance with fees increasing 13% year-over-year and 6% sequentially due to solid new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Performance in the regions was lower in both comparisons as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were more than offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets and lower fees on equity mutual funds. Recall that fees within the regions are based on month lagged asset value so the difficult equity markets in January and February negatively influenced first quarter fees.
Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled approximately $6 million in the current quarter, down $12 million year-over-year and $7 million sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates on the gross yields in the underlying funds.
Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $230 billion at quarter end, down 1% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. 
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $314 million in the first quarter, up 18% year-over-year, driven by higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Earning assets average $105 billion in the first quarter, up 6% versus last year, driven by a higher level of deposits. Demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion, increased 19% year-over-year, and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $49 billion, were up 4% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth again as loan balance averaged $34 billion in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year.
On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income increased 6% primarily driven by a higher net interest margin as average earning assets were unchanged sequentially. 
The net interest margin was 1.21% in the first quarter, up 11 basis points year-over-year and up 10 basis points sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the feds move in December. In the sequential quarter comparison, the benefit of higher interest rates was partially offset by higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization was $6 million in the first quarter, up from less than $1 million in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $829 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially. Compensation expense of $379 million increased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, the impact of last year's annual base pay adjustments and a higher accrual for interim incentive compensation, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates.
Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with more than 60% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila and Limerick. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher performance based incentive compensation including the requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement eligible employees and the immediate vesting of certain restricted stock units awarded in the first quarter.
Employee benefit expense of $71 million decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense increased 2% due primarily to seasonally higher payroll taxes partially offset by lower medical and lower pension expense.
Outside services expense of $150 million was 11% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense declined 3%, primarily reflecting lower consulting expense. 
Equipment and software expense of $114 million was up 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. In the sequential comparison, equipment software expense was down 2%, primarily reflecting lower equipment related expense. 
Other operating expense of $74 million increased 1% year-over-year and was unchanged sequentially. In the sequential comparison, seasonally higher business promotion expense related to the Northern Trust open was offset by lower expense in various other categories.
Our loan loss provision was $2 million in the first quarter. This compares to a provision credit of $4.5 million in the year-earlier quarter and a provision for credit of $18.5 million in the fourth quarter. Recall that we changed our methodology for estimating inherent losses effective December 31, 2015. This change resulted in the provision credit of $18.5 million last quarter. Loan quality remains very strong with nonperforming assets of $174 million at quarter end, down 7% versus year-end, and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 48 basis points at quarter end.
The effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 32.7%. 
Turning to Page 8. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fees ratio, pretax margin and ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as 131% in 2011, to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity. We have seen the ratio hold steady our move slightly upward over the most recent quarters, as both macro and seasonal factors can impact this measure in the short term. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and drive productivity within our expense base by our ongoing initiatives focused on location, strategy, procurement and technology.
Turning to Page 9. Our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.6% and 10.6%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.4% and under the standardized approach, would be approximately 10.3%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the Corporation was 6.1% and at the bank, was 6%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2019.
With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017.
As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.
In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $140 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional $145 million of common stock through June 2016.
In closing, the first quarter of 2016 was characterized by volatile markets, low commodity prices, low and even negative interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. Despite that difficult backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing earnings per share 7% year-over-year and delivering a return on equity of 11.4%.
Our sequential performance demonstrated our commitment to improving our operating efficiency. Expenses were essentially flat to the fourth quarter even with the seasonal uplift that results from the Northern Trust open and annual equity compensation grants. In addition, we returned $234 million to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases while maintaining strong capital ratios and funding our growth.
Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 3% year-over-year and continue to produce attractive returns, achieving a pretax margin of 34% in the first quarter. Our ability to serve complex client needs and create sophisticated solutions for our clients was evident within our Global Family Office business, which serves ultra high net worth individuals and family offices. Global Family Office had strong new business and a 13% trust fee growth in the quarter.
C&IS continue to grow as well. One growth driver over the last couple of years has been providing services to help our clients meet new regulatory requirements. For example, we provide depository services so clients can meet their AIFMD [indiscernible] and other assets safety-related regulations. Another growth driver has been providing new tools and technology to enhance our clients oversight of their increasing investments and alternatives. We recently announced an exclusive agreement with to offer our clients access to the largest amount of data for hedge funds on a single platform. These are just a couple of examples how we're growing our business by doing more for our clients. 
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this will be Bev Fleming's last earnings call after a remarkable 15 years as our Director of Investor Relations. So many of us within Northern Trust have relied on her expertise. Her wisdom, advice and counsel will most certainly be missed. Please join me in wishing her well in retirement. 
We are also fortunate to have Mark joining Investor Relations. Mark joined Northern Trust in 1994 and has served in a number of leadership roles within finance, including as Senior Financial Analyst in Investor Relations from 2001 to 2006. He brings a wealth of knowledge about the firm to the role.
Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today's call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting, which begins at 10:30 Central Time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice. 
Thank you, again, for participating in Northern Trust's First Quarter Earnings Call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Zach, please open the line."

The premium amortization, as we described in the quarter, it was up sequentially from the fourth quarter. I think it was $6 million in the quarter. We have discussed in the past that amortization is typically $9 million to $10 million in a quarter. It can move so it was slightly better than the normal run rate but in the fourth quarter of 2015, we actually experienced kind of a low, at only $1 million of premium monetization. So sequentially, it actually hurts the returns. On a year-over-year basis, it actually helped by a small amount actually, a modest amount. So that's a little bit of color on premium amortization. In terms of what we're buying in the improvement in the security portfolio, first of all, I would say the we benefited from the rate move in the portfolio. We did add about, you could see, about $1 billion of treasury securities. Those were largely 5- to 7-year duration purchases but swapped back to something closer to 3 months. So the duration in the portfolio was really not extended but we were able to get some enhanced yield there. We did have a small portion of that $1 billion that we went out a little longer and duration. So the overall duration -- the index duration of the portfolio only increased modestly."

Can you help us understand that dynamic a little bit more? So if $120 million is kind of a decent starting off point assuming no more rate hikes, how meaningful the benefit that we still see to that NIM from the initial high? And a follow-up also around that net interest income discussion, it looks like the ending balance sheet ended a bit higher than the average.

In terms of the NIM and the expansion or potential expansion of the NIM, 2 components that I want to address there. First is, you have to remember that approximately half of our balance sheet is in foreign office time deposits and in some of those places, we're experiencing negative spreads and others whereas that impression is not impacted by necessarily by treasury rates. In the U.S., 2 things to consider there if there are no further rate hikes. Many of our assets repriced in the first 3 months of this year or since the rate hike but there are still some repricing opportunities left inside of that portfolio. Remember it's of a short duration so there is some benefit in there. So I would say, we're going to wait and see how that plays out but to date, as you brightly saw in the NIM, the data has been relatively close to 0 and the assets have been able to reprice. We've been able to capture that 11 basis point increase in that NIM."

So the fees are based on February month-end, which was still quite down, and the lower fees on equity mutual funds, as you discussed. Our -- if you think about this, there's an ongoing and broad industry trend towards passive management as investors continue to face lower overall returns, and they look to control what they can control, which is mainly fees. So we have seen that kind of fee pressure in our funds into lower-cost alternatives. So the combination of the month lag in the fees, the migration, if you will, to lower fee structured products was not enough to offset the positive fee waiver in the quarter. We do still think relative to the industry that the growth rates are healthy and that the business is indeed, is strong. It's just a difficult macro environment for that business."

So in terms of the client behavior, the first part of your question on deposit behavior, we did not see any exodus of clients based on our deposit data that we pushed through. So we did not really see that, you could see that from sequentially, a very stable balance sheet size and even growth on the year-over-year basis, which is really driven by I would say, our core organic growth rate. So no real behavior changes. In terms of the migration from active, passive, what I would say first is that in some cases, that's from higher fee to lower fee solutions as our clients have struggled to get returns. They focus on what they can control, which is the fee portion of that. So they're looking for lower fee opportunities. And in some cases along that spectrum from active to passive, there are our product and capabilities that we continue to discuss with our clients. Those could be FlexShares. Those could be engineered data or engineered equity offerings. So we do have products along the spectrum, if you will, between fully active and fully passive that help mute some of that fee compression that we talked about."

Improvement in the ratio is driven by achieving positive fee operating leverage. And as is the case with operating leverage in the short term, there can be periods of time where we have degradation in the ratio, sometimes due to seasonal impacts. This quarter, for instance, while the ratio would've benefited from lower level fee waivers, the seasonal expense impact of stock-based compensation in the Northern Trust open more than offset the improvement in fee waivers. Gerard, we remain focused on the 2 parts of that equation that we can. The first is in what I would describe as the organic growth rate of our fees, and the second is on the strategic long-term initiatives on the expense side.

Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $242 million",2794,"Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. 
Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $242 million. Earnings per share were $1.01 and our return on common equity was 11.4%. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of these factors unfolded during the first quarter.
Equity markets rebounded in March after a volatile and negative start to the year. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter down 0.4% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. In International markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was down 10.7% year-over-year and down 3.7% sequentially.  Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and fourth quarter 2015 markets were generally higher. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was lower year-over-year and higher sequentially.
Currency volatility as measured by the G7 Index was 2% higher than the first quarter of last year and 12% higher sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were varied in the first quarter. As measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 11% to 14% year-over-year and up 19% to 24% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, primarily versus the British pound sterling, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth.
U.S. short-term interest rates were higher following the Federal Reserve rate increase in December. 3-month LIBOR and the fed funds effective rate averaged 62 and 37 basis points respectively, both higher sequentially. The overnight repo rate was also higher averaging 46 basis points in the quarter.
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 5% with noninterest income up a modest 1% and net interest income up a strong 18%. Expenses also increased 5%. The provision for credit losses was $2 million. Net income was 5% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 3% with noninterest income up 2% and net interest income up 6%. Expenses were essentially flat when compared with the fourth quarter. Net income was 1% higher sequentially.
Client assets under custody of $6.2 trillion increased 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, strong new business was partially offset by lower international equity markets and the currency translation impact of a strong dollar. In the sequential quarter comparison, new business, favorable quarter end equity markets, and currency translation were all contributors to asset growth.
Assets under management were $900 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Lower equity assets were the primary driver due to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and weaker global equity markets. In addition, fixed income assets were lower, primarily due to the loss of one passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned last quarter. Assets under management increased 3% sequentially, primarily driven by higher cash and equity balances. 
Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with the revenue on Page 4. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 5% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $748 million in the first quarter, up 3% year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially.
Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver this quarter. Fee waivers were approximately $8 million in the first quarter, lower by $25 million year-over-year and $13 million sequentially. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly.
Foreign exchange trading income was $61 million in the first quarter, down 15% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline, while the sequential improvements reflect higher volumes and volatility.
Other noninterest income was $74 million in the first quarter, down 2% from last year and up 9% sequentially. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher other operating income. In the first quarter, we recorded a net gain of $2.3 million related to our decision to exit a portion of a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio, which I mentioned on this call last quarter. Our fourth quarter results included a $1.1 million net loss in other operating income related to the same decision. 
Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $314 million in the first quarter, increasing 18% year-over-year and 6% sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $433 million in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $286 million, up 3% year-over-year and unchanged sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.7 trillion at quarter end, up 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets and currency translation. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees, with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.
Investment management fees in C&IS of $89 million in the first quarter were up 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were approximately $2 million, lower by $13 million year-over-year and $6 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds.
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $670 billion, down 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier, and up 3% sequentially due primarily to a $15 billion increase in cash balances and a $5 billion increase in equities.
Securities lending fees were $23 million in the first quarter, 5% higher than last year and 1% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $106 billion at quarter end and averaged $115 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower loan volumes in U.S. treasuries. This asset class has been most impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage in the securities lending business.
Other fees in C&IS were $35 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, and other ancillary services. In the sequential quarter comparison, other fees were up 4%, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payments business.
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $315 million in the first quarter, down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance, with fees increasing 13% year-over-year and 6% sequentially due to solid new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Performance in the regions was lower in both comparisons as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were more than offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets and lower fees on equity mutual funds. Recall that fees within the regions are based on month lagged asset value so the difficult equity markets in January and February negatively influenced first quarter fees.
Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled approximately $6 million in the current quarter, down $12 million year-over-year and $7 million sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates on the gross yields in the underlying funds.
Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $230 billion at quarter end, down 1% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. 
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $314 million in the first quarter, up 18% year-over-year, driven by higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Earning assets averaged $105 billion in the first quarter, up 6% versus last year, driven by a higher level of deposits. Demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion, increased 19% year-over-year, and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $49 billion, were up 4% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth again as loan balance averaged $34 billion in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year.
On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income increased 6% primarily driven by a higher net interest margin as average earning assets were unchanged sequentially. 
The net interest margin was 1.21% in the first quarter, up 11 basis points year-over-year and up 10 basis points sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the fed's move in December. In the sequential quarter comparison, the benefit of higher interest rates was partially offset by higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization was $6 million in the first quarter, up from less than $1 million in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $829 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially. Compensation expense of $379 million increased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, the impact of last year's annual base pay adjustments and a higher accrual for interim incentive compensation, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates.
Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with more than 60% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila and Limerick. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher performance-based incentive compensation, including the requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement eligible employees and the immediate vesting of certain restricted stock units awarded in the first quarter.
Employee benefit expense of $71 million decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense increased 2% due primarily to seasonally higher payroll taxes, partially offset by lower medical and lower pension expense.
Outside services expense of $150 million was 11% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense declined 3%, primarily reflecting lower consulting expense. 
Equipment and software expense of $114 million was up 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. In the sequential comparison, equipment software expense was down 2%, primarily reflecting lower equipment-related expense. 
Other operating expense of $74 million increased 1% year-over-year and was unchanged sequentially. In the sequential comparison, seasonally higher business promotion expense related to the Northern Trust Open was offset by lower expense in various other categories.
Our loan loss provision was $2 million in the first quarter. This compares to a provision credit of $4.5 million in the year-earlier quarter and a provision credit of $18.5 million in the fourth quarter. Recall that we changed our methodology for estimating inherent losses effective December 31, 2015. This change resulted in the provision credit of $18.5 million last quarter. Loan quality remains very strong with nonperforming assets of $174 million at quarter end, down 7% versus year-end, and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 48 basis points at quarter end.
The effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 32.7%. 
Turning to Page 8. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fees ratio, pretax margin and ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as 131% in 2011, to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity. We have seen the ratio hold steady or move slightly upward over the most recent quarters, as both macro and seasonal factors can impact this measure in the short term. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and drive productivity within our expense base by our ongoing initiatives focused on location, strategy, procurement and technology.
Turning to Page 9. Our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.6% and 10.6%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.4% and under the standardized approach, would be approximately 10.3%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the Corporation was 6.1% and at the bank, was 6%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2019.
With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017.
As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.
In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $140 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional $145 million of common stock through June 2016.
In closing, the first quarter of 2016 was characterized by volatile markets, low commodity prices, low and even negative interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. Despite that difficult backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing earnings per share 7% year-over-year and delivering a return on equity of 11.4%.
Our sequential performance demonstrated our commitment to improving our operating efficiency. Expenses were essentially flat to the fourth quarter even with the seasonal uplift that results from the Northern Trust Open and annual equity compensation grants. In addition, we returned $234 million to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, while maintaining strong capital ratios and funding our growth.
Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 3% year-over-year and continue to produce attractive returns, achieving a pretax margin of 34% in the first quarter. Our ability to serve complex client needs and create sophisticated solutions for our clients was evident within our Global Family Office business, which serves ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices. Global Family Office had strong new business and a 13% trust fee growth in the quarter.
C&IS continue to grow as well. One growth driver over the last couple of years has been providing services to help our clients meet new regulatory requirements. For example, we provide depository services so clients can meet their AIFMD, UCITS V and other asset safety-related regulations. Another growth driver has been providing new tools and technology to enhance our clients oversight of their increasing investments and alternatives. We recently announced an exclusive agreement with AltX to offer our clients access to the largest amount of data for hedge funds on a single platform. These are just a couple of examples of how we're growing our business by doing more for our clients. 
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this will be Bev Fleming's last earnings call after a remarkable 15 years as our Director of Investor Relations. So many of us within Northern Trust have relied on her expertise. Her wisdom, advice and counsel will most certainly be missed. Please join me in wishing her well in retirement. 
We are also fortunate to have Mark Bette joining Investor Relations. Mark joined Northern Trust in 1994 and has served in a number of leadership roles within finance, including as Senior Financial Analyst in Investor Relations from 2001 to 2006. He brings a wealth of knowledge about the firm to the role.
Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today's call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our Annual Meeting, which begins at 10:30 Central Time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice. 
Thank you, again, for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Zach, please open the line."

The premium amortization, as we described in the quarter, it was up sequentially from the fourth quarter. I think it was $6 million in the quarter. We have discussed in the past that amortization is typically $9 million to $10 million in a quarter. It can move. So it was slightly better than the normal run rate, but in the fourth quarter of 2015, we actually experienced kind of a low, at only $1 million of premium amortization. So sequentially, it actually hurt the returns. On a year-over-year basis, it actually helped by a small amount actually, a modest amount. So that's a little bit of color on premium amortization. In terms of what we're buying and the improvement in the security portfolio, first of all, I would say the -- we benefited from the rate move in the portfolio. We did add about -- you could see, about $1 billion of treasury securities. Those were largely 5- to 7-year duration purchases, but swapped back to something closer to 3 months. So the duration in the portfolio was really not extended, but we were able to get some enhanced yield there. We did have a small portion of that $1 billion that we went out a little longer in duration. So the overall duration of -- the index duration of the portfolio only increased modestly."

So Biff, it sounds like the securities roll out [indiscernible] for a very short duration and there might be additional benefit just as the security portfolio kind of reprices even, I guess, if we don't get them any more hikes this year. Can you help us understand that dynamic a little bit more? So if 120-ish is kind of a decent starting off point assuming no more rate hikes, how meaningful of the benefit could we still see to the NIM from the initial hike? And the follow-up also around the net interest income discussion. It looks like the ending balance sheet ended a bit higher than the average. So just wondering whether it's the timing of the kind of net new business that came in a little bit later in the quarter? Or is it just the typical end quarter stuff so the balance sheet was a little bit lower, but the average should kind of normalize as we look into the second quarter?"

It can move as you know, on March 31 or any quarter end period based on client activity, et cetera. So I would say, there was nothing unusual about that movement from our perspective. In terms of the NIM and the expansion or potential expansion of the NIM, 2 components that I want to address there. First is, you have to remember that approximately half of our balance sheet is in foreign office time deposits and in some of those places, we're experiencing negative spreads in others where that compression is not impacted by necessarily by treasury rates. In the U.S., 2 things to consider there if there are no further rate hikes. Many of our assets repriced in the first 3 months of this year or since the rate hike, but there are still some repricing opportunities left inside of that portfolio. Remember it's of a short duration so there is some benefit in there. So I would say, we're going to wait and see how that plays out, but to date, as you correctly saw in the NIM, the data has been relatively close to 0 and the assets have been able to reprice. We've been able to capture that 11 basis point increase in the NIM."

So the fees are based on February month-end, which was still quite down, and the lower fees on equity mutual funds, as you discussed. If you think about this, there's an ongoing and broad industry trend towards passive management as investors continue to face lower overall returns, and they look to control what they can control, which is mainly fees. So we have seen that kind of fee pressure in our funds into lower cost alternatives. So the combination of the month lag in the fees, the migration, if you will, to lower fee structured products was not enough to offset the positive fee waiver in the quarter. We do still think relative to the industry that the growth rates are healthy and that the business is indeed, is strong. It's just a difficult macro environment for that business."

So if you think about -- let me start with the first quarter, there is some seasonality in the first quarter that you can see if you look historically. As it relates specifically to the occupancy expense, I think, looking at a longer period of quarters in the past, probably gives you a better indication of the run rate in our occupancy expense. So that line item, as you look historically, has remained fairly consistent. And that's probably your better trending. Other line items, you suggest that we did differ salary increases to October 1 for all employees so that we did April of 2015. We did merit salary increases. We will not have that in this sequential comparison. And we continue to be vigilant on business promotion, non-regulatory consulting spend and all other key discretionary line items and there is a continued focus on that line item as we enter Q2 and beyond."

So we did not really see that and you can see that from sequentially a very stable balance sheet size and even growth on a year-over-year basis, which is really driven by I would say, our core organic growth rate. So no real behavior changes. In terms of the migration from active, passive, what I -- I would say first is that, in some cases, that's from higher fee to lower fee solutions, as our clients have struggled to get returns, they focus on what they can control, which is the fee portion of that. So they're looking for lower fee opportunities. And in some cases along that spectrum from active to passive, there are our product and capabilities that we continue to discuss with our clients. Those could be FlexShares. Those could be engineered data or engineered equity offerings. So we do have products along the spectrum, if you will, between fully active and fully passive that help mute some of that fee compression that we talked about."

And that obviously has a knock-on impact to produce better ROE. Improvement in the ratio is driven by achieving positive fee operating leverage. And as is the case with operating leverage in the short-term, there can be periods of time where we have degradation in the ratio, sometimes due to seasonal impacts. This quarter, for instance, while the ratio would've benefited from lower level fee waivers, the seasonal expense impact of stock-based compensation in the Northern Trust Open more than offset the improvement in fee waivers. Gerard, we remain focused on the 2 parts of that equation that we can. The first is in what I would describe as the organic growth rate of our fees.

Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $242 million",2795,"Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. 
Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $242 million. Earnings per share were $1.01 and our return on common equity was 11.4%. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of these factors unfolded during the first quarter.
Equity markets rebounded in March after a volatile and negative start to the year. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter down 0.4% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. In International markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was down 10.7% year-over-year and down 3.7% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and fourth quarter 2015 markets were generally higher. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was lower year-over-year and higher sequentially.
Currency volatility as measured by the G7 Index was 2% higher than the first quarter of last year and 12% higher sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were varied in the first quarter. As measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 11% to 14% year-over-year and up 19% to 24% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, primarily versus the British pound sterling, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth.
U.S. short-term interest rates were higher following the Federal Reserve rate increase in December. 3-month LIBOR and the fed funds effective rate averaged 62 and 37 basis points respectively, both higher sequentially. The overnight repo rate was also higher, averaging 46 basis points in the quarter.
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 5% with noninterest income up a modest 1% and net interest income up a strong 18%. Expenses also increased 5%. The provision for credit losses was $2 million. Net income was 5% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 3% with noninterest income up 2% and net interest income up 6%. Expenses were essentially flat when compared with the fourth quarter. Net income was 1% higher sequentially.
Client assets under custody of $6.2 trillion increased 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, strong new business was partially offset by lower international equity markets and the currency translation impact of a strong dollar. In the sequential quarter comparison, new business, favorable quarter end equity markets and currency translation were all contributors to asset growth.
Assets under management were $900 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Lower equity assets were the primary driver due to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and weaker global equity markets. In addition, fixed income assets were lower, primarily due to the loss of one passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned last quarter. Assets under management increased 3% sequentially, primarily driven by higher cash and equity balances. 
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with the revenue on Page 4. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 5% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $748 million in the first quarter, up 3% year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially.
Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver this quarter. Fee waivers were approximately $8 million in the first quarter, lower by $25 million year-over-year and $13 million sequentially. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly.
Foreign exchange trading income was $61 million in the first quarter, down 15% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline, while the sequential improvements reflect higher volumes and volatility.
Other noninterest income was $74 million in the first quarter, down 2% from last year and up 9% sequentially. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher other operating income. In the first quarter, we recorded a net gain of $2.3 million related to our decision to exit a portion of a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio, which I mentioned on this call last quarter. Our fourth quarter results included a $1.1 million net loss in other operating income related to the same decision. 
Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $314 million in the first quarter, increasing 18% year-over-year and 6% sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $433 million in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $286 million, up 3% year-over-year and unchanged sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.7 trillion at quarter end, up 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets and currency translation. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees, with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.
Investment management fees in C&IS of $89 million in the first quarter were up 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were approximately $2 million, lower by $13 million year-over-year and $6 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds.
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $670 billion, down 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier, and up 3% sequentially due primarily to a $15 billion increase in cash balances and a $5 billion increase in equities.
Securities lending fees were $23 million in the first quarter, 5% higher than last year and 1% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $106 billion at quarter end and averaged $115 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower loan volumes in U.S. treasuries. This asset class has been most impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage in the securities lending business.
Other fees in C&IS were $35 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, and other ancillary services. In the sequential quarter comparison, other fees were up 4%, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payments business.
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $315 million in the first quarter, down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance, with fees increasing 13% year-over-year and 6% sequentially due to solid new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Performance in the regions was lower in both comparisons as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were more than offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets and lower fees on equity mutual funds. Recall that fees within the regions are based on month lagged asset value so the difficult equity markets in January and February negatively influenced first quarter fees.
Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled approximately $6 million in the current quarter, down $12 million year-over-year and $7 million sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates on the gross yields in the underlying funds.
Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $230 billion at quarter end, down 1% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. 
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $314 million in the first quarter, up 18% year-over-year, driven by a higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Earning assets averaged $105 billion in the first quarter, up 6% versus last year, driven by a higher level of deposits. Demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion, increased 19% year-over-year, and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $49 billion, were up 4% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth again as loan balance averaged $34 billion in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year.
On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income increased 6% primarily driven by a higher net interest margin as average earning assets were unchanged sequentially. 
The net interest margin was 1.21% in the first quarter, up 11 basis points year-over-year and up 10 basis points sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the fed's move in December. In the sequential quarter comparison, the benefit of higher interest rates was partially offset by higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization was $6 million in the first quarter, up from less than $1 million in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $829 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially. Compensation expense of $379 million increased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, the impact of last year's annual base pay adjustments and a higher accrual for interim incentive compensation, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates.
Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with more than 60% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila and Limerick. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher performance-based incentive compensation, including the requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement eligible employees and the immediate vesting of certain restricted stock units awarded in the first quarter.
Employee benefit expense of $71 million decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense increased 2% due primarily to seasonally higher payroll taxes, partially offset by lower medical and lower pension expense.
Outside services expense of $150 million was 11% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense declined 3%, primarily reflecting lower consulting expense. 
Equipment and software expense of $114 million was up 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. In the sequential comparison, equipment software expense was down 2%, primarily reflecting lower equipment-related expense. 
Other operating expense of $74 million increased 1% year-over-year and was unchanged sequentially. In the sequential comparison, seasonally higher business promotion expense related to the Northern Trust Open was offset by lower expense in various other categories.
Our loan loss provision was $2 million in the first quarter. This compares to a provision credit of $4.5 million in the year-earlier quarter and a provision credit of $18.5 million in the fourth quarter. Recall that we changed our methodology for estimating inherent losses effective December 31, 2015. This change resulted in the provision credit of $18.5 million last quarter. Loan quality remains very strong with nonperforming assets of $174 million at quarter end, down 7% versus year-end, and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 48 basis points at quarter end.
The effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 32.7%. 
Turning to Page 8. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fees ratio, pretax margin and ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as 131% in 2011, to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity. We have seen the ratio hold steady or move slightly upward over the most recent quarters, as both macro and seasonal factors can impact this measure in the short term. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and drive productivity within our expense base by our ongoing initiatives focused on location, strategy, procurement and technology.
Turning to Page 9. Our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.6% and 10.6%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.4% and under the standardized approach, would be approximately 10.3%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the Corporation was 6.1% and at the bank, was 6%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2019.
With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017.
As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.
In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $140 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional $145 million of common stock through June 2016.
In closing, the first quarter of 2016 was characterized by volatile markets, low commodity prices, low and even negative interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. Despite that difficult backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing earnings per share 7% year-over-year and delivering a return on equity of 11.4%.
Our sequential performance demonstrated our commitment to improving our operating efficiency. Expenses were essentially flat to the fourth quarter even with the seasonal uplift that results from the Northern Trust Open and annual equity compensation grants. In addition, we returned $234 million to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, while maintaining strong capital ratios and funding our growth.
Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 3% year-over-year and continue to produce attractive returns, achieving a pretax margin of 34% in the first quarter. Our ability to serve complex client needs and create sophisticated solutions for our clients was evident within our Global Family Office business, which serves ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices. Global Family Office had strong new business and a 13% trust fee growth in the quarter.
C&IS continued to grow as well. One growth driver over the last couple of years has been providing services to help our clients meet new regulatory requirements. For example, we provide depository services so clients can meet their AIFMD, UCITS V and other asset safety-related regulations. Another growth driver has been providing new tools and technology to enhance our clients' oversight of their increasing investments and alternatives. We recently announced an exclusive agreement with AltX to offer our clients access to the largest amount of data for hedge funds on a single platform. These are just a couple of examples of how we're growing our business by doing more for our clients. 
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this will be Bev Fleming's last earnings call after a remarkable 15 years as our Director of Investor Relations. So many of us within Northern Trust have relied on her expertise. Her wisdom, advice and counsel will most certainly be missed. Please join me in wishing her well in retirement. 
We are also fortunate to have Mark Bette joining Investor Relations. Mark joined Northern Trust in 1994 and has served in a number of leadership roles within finance, including as Senior Financial Analyst in Investor Relations from 2001 to 2006. He brings a wealth of knowledge about the firm to the role.
Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today's call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our Annual Meeting, which begins at 10:30 Central Time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice. 
Thank you, again, for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Zach, please open the line."

The premium amortization, as we described in the quarter, it was up sequentially from the fourth quarter. I think it was $6 million in the quarter. We have discussed in the past that amortization is typically $9 million to $10 million in a quarter. It can move. So it was slightly better than the normal run rate, but in the fourth quarter of 2015, we actually experienced kind of a low, at only $1 million of premium amortization. So sequentially, it actually hurt the returns. On a year-over-year basis, it actually helped by a small amount actually, a modest amount. So that's a little bit of color on premium amortization. In terms of what we're buying and the improvement in the security portfolio, first of all, I would say the -- we benefited from the rate move in the portfolio. We did add about -- you could see, about $1 billion of treasury securities. Those were largely 5- to 7-year duration purchases, but swapped back to something closer to 3 months. So the duration in the portfolio was really not extended, but we were able to get some enhanced yield there. We did have a small portion of that $1 billion that we went out a little longer in duration. So the overall duration of -- the index duration of the portfolio only increased modestly."

Can you help us understand that dynamic a little bit more? So if 120-ish is kind of a decent starting off point assuming no more rate hikes, how meaningful of the benefit could we still see to the NIM from the initial hike? And the follow-up also around the net interest income discussion. It looks like the ending balance sheet ended a bit higher than the average. So just wondering whether it's the timing of the kind of net new business that came in a little bit later in the quarter?

It can move as you know, on March 31 or any quarter end period based on client activity, et cetera. So I would say there was nothing unusual about that movement from our perspective. In terms of the NIM and the expansion or potential expansion of the NIM, 2 components that I want to address there. First is, you have to remember that approximately half of our balance sheet is in foreign office time deposits and in some of those places, we're experiencing negative spreads in others where that compression is not impacted by necessarily by treasury rates. In the U.S., 2 things to consider there if there are no further rate hikes. Many of our assets repriced in the first 3 months of this year since the rate hike, but there are still some repricing opportunities left inside of that portfolio. Remember it's of a short duration so there is some benefit in there. So I would say, we're going to wait and see how that plays out, but to date, as you correctly saw in the NIM, the data has been relatively close to 0 and the assets have been able to reprice. We've been able to capture that 11 basis point increase in the NIM."

So in the quarter, new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers weren't really sufficient to offset the drag from -- remember, we have month lag equity market. So the fees are based on February month-end, which was still quite down, and the lower fees on equity mutual funds, as you discussed. If you think about this, there's an ongoing and broad industry trend towards passive management as investors continue to face lower overall returns, and they look to control what they can control, which is mainly fees. So we have seen that kind of fee pressure in our funds into lower cost alternatives. So the combination of the month lag in the fees, the migration, if you will, to lower fee structured products was not enough to offset the positive fee waiver in the quarter. We do still think relative to the industry that the growth rates are healthy and that the business is indeed, is strong. It's just a difficult macro environment for that business."

So if you think about -- let me start with the first quarter, there is some seasonality in the first quarter that you can see if you look historically. As it relates specifically to the occupancy expense, I think, looking at a longer period of quarters in the past, probably gives you a better indication of the run rate in our occupancy expense. So that line item, as you look historically, has remained fairly consistent. And that's probably your better trending. Other line items, you suggest that we did defer salary increases to October 1 for all employees, so that we did April of 2015. We did merit salary increases. We will not have that in this sequential comparison. And we continue to be vigilant on business promotion, non-regulatory consulting spend and all other key discretionary line items and there is a continued focus on that line item as we enter Q2 and beyond."

So no real behavior changes. In terms of the migration from active, passive, what I -- I would say first is that, in some cases, that's from higher fee to lower fee solutions, as our clients have struggled to get returns, they focus on what they can control, which is the fee portion of that. So they're looking for lower fee opportunities. And in some cases along that spectrum from active to passive, there are our product and capabilities that we continue to discuss with our clients. Those could be FlexShares. Those could be engineered data or engineered equity offerings. So we do have products along the spectrum, if you will, between fully active and fully passive that help mute some of that fee compression that we talked about."

And that obviously has a knock-on impact to produce better ROE. Improvement in the ratio is driven by achieving positive fee operating leverage. And as is the case with operating leverage in the short-term, there can be periods of time where we have degradation in the ratio, sometimes due to seasonal impacts. This quarter, for instance, while the ratio would've benefited from lower level fee waivers, the seasonal expense impact of stock-based compensation in the Northern Trust Open more than offset the improvement in fee waivers. Gerard, we remain focused on the 2 parts of that equation that we can. The first is in what I would describe as the organic growth rate of our fees.

Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $242 million",2795,"Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. 
Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $242 million. Earnings per share were $1.01 and our return on common equity was 11.4%. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of these factors unfolded during the first quarter.
Equity markets rebounded in March after a volatile and negative start to the year. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter down 0.4% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. In International markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was down 10.7% year-over-year and down 3.7% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and fourth quarter 2015 markets were generally higher. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was lower year-over-year and higher sequentially.
Currency volatility as measured by the G7 Index was 2% higher than the first quarter of last year and 12% higher sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were varied in the first quarter. As measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 11% to 14% year-over-year and up 19% to 24% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, primarily versus the British pound sterling, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth.
U.S. short-term interest rates were higher following the Federal Reserve rate increase in December. 3-month LIBOR and the fed funds effective rate averaged 62 and 37 basis points respectively, both higher sequentially. The overnight repo rate was also higher, averaging 46 basis points in the quarter.
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 5% with noninterest income up a modest 1% and net interest income up a strong 18%. Expenses also increased 5%. The provision for credit losses was $2 million. Net income was 5% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 3% with noninterest income up 2% and net interest income up 6%. Expenses were essentially flat when compared with the fourth quarter. Net income was 1% higher sequentially.
Client assets under custody of $6.2 trillion increased 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, strong new business was partially offset by lower international equity markets and the currency translation impact of a strong dollar. In the sequential quarter comparison, new business, favorable quarter end equity markets and currency translation were all contributors to asset growth.
Assets under management were $900 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Lower equity assets were the primary driver due to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and weaker global equity markets. In addition, fixed income assets were lower, primarily due to the loss of one passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned last quarter. Assets under management increased 3% sequentially, primarily driven by higher cash and equity balances. 
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with the revenue on Page 4. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 5% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $748 million in the first quarter, up 3% year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially.
Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver this quarter. Fee waivers were approximately $8 million in the first quarter, lower by $25 million year-over-year and $13 million sequentially. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly.
Foreign exchange trading income was $61 million in the first quarter, down 15% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline, while the sequential improvements reflect higher volumes and volatility.
Other noninterest income was $74 million in the first quarter, down 2% from last year and up 9% sequentially. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher other operating income. In the first quarter, we recorded a net gain of $2.3 million related to our decision to exit a portion of a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio, which I mentioned on this call last quarter. Our fourth quarter results included a $1.1 million net loss in other operating income related to the same decision. 
Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $314 million in the first quarter, increasing 18% year-over-year and 6% sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $433 million in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $286 million, up 3% year-over-year and unchanged sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.7 trillion at quarter end, up 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets and currency translation. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees, with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.
Investment management fees in C&IS of $89 million in the first quarter were up 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were approximately $2 million, lower by $13 million year-over-year and $6 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds.
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $670 billion, down 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier, and up 3% sequentially due primarily to a $15 billion increase in cash balances and a $5 billion increase in equities.
Securities lending fees were $23 million in the first quarter, 5% higher than last year and 1% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $106 billion at quarter end and averaged $115 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower loan volumes in U.S. treasuries. This asset class has been most impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage in the securities lending business.
Other fees in C&IS were $35 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, and other ancillary services. In the sequential quarter comparison, other fees were up 4%, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payments business.
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $315 million in the first quarter, down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance, with fees increasing 13% year-over-year and 6% sequentially due to solid new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Performance in the regions was lower in both comparisons as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were more than offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets and lower fees on equity mutual funds. Recall that fees within the regions are based on month lagged asset value so the difficult equity markets in January and February negatively influenced first quarter fees.
Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled approximately $6 million in the current quarter, down $12 million year-over-year and $7 million sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates on the gross yields in the underlying funds.
Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $230 billion at quarter end, down 1% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. 
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $314 million in the first quarter, up 18% year-over-year, driven by a higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Earning assets averaged $105 billion in the first quarter, up 6% versus last year, driven by a higher level of deposits. Demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion, increased 19% year-over-year, and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $49 billion, were up 4% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth again as loan balance averaged $34 billion in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year.
On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income increased 6% primarily driven by a higher net interest margin as average earning assets were unchanged sequentially. 
The net interest margin was 1.21% in the first quarter, up 11 basis points year-over-year and up 10 basis points sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the fed's move in December. In the sequential quarter comparison, the benefit of higher interest rates was partially offset by higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization was $6 million in the first quarter, up from less than $1 million in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $829 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially. Compensation expense of $379 million increased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, the impact of last year's annual base pay adjustments and a higher accrual for interim incentive compensation, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates.
Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with more than 60% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila and Limerick. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher performance-based incentive compensation, including the requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement eligible employees and the immediate vesting of certain restricted stock units awarded in the first quarter.
Employee benefit expense of $71 million decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense increased 2% due primarily to seasonally higher payroll taxes, partially offset by lower medical and lower pension expense.
Outside services expense of $150 million was 11% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense declined 3%, primarily reflecting lower consulting expense. 
Equipment and software expense of $114 million was up 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. In the sequential comparison, equipment software expense was down 2%, primarily reflecting lower equipment-related expense. 
Other operating expense of $74 million increased 1% year-over-year and was unchanged sequentially. In the sequential comparison, seasonally higher business promotion expense related to the Northern Trust Open was offset by lower expense in various other categories.
Our loan loss provision was $2 million in the first quarter. This compares to a provision credit of $4.5 million in the year-earlier quarter and a provision credit of $18.5 million in the fourth quarter. Recall that we changed our methodology for estimating inherent losses effective December 31, 2015. This change resulted in the provision credit of $18.5 million last quarter. Loan quality remains very strong with nonperforming assets of $174 million at quarter end, down 7% versus year-end, and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 48 basis points at quarter end.
The effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 32.7%. 
Turning to Page 8. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fees ratio, pretax margin and ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as 131% in 2011, to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity. We have seen the ratio hold steady or move slightly upward over the most recent quarters, as both macro and seasonal factors can impact this measure in the short term. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and drive productivity within our expense base by our ongoing initiatives focused on location, strategy, procurement and technology.
Turning to Page 9. Our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.6% and 10.6%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.4% and under the standardized approach, would be approximately 10.3%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the Corporation was 6.1% and at the bank, was 6%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2019.
With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017.
As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.
In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $140 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional $145 million of common stock through June 2016.
In closing, the first quarter of 2016 was characterized by volatile markets, low commodity prices, low and even negative interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. Despite that difficult backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing earnings per share 7% year-over-year and delivering a return on equity of 11.4%.
Our sequential performance demonstrated our commitment to improving our operating efficiency. Expenses were essentially flat to the fourth quarter even with the seasonal uplift that results from the Northern Trust Open and annual equity compensation grants. In addition, we returned $234 million to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, while maintaining strong capital ratios and funding our growth.
Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 3% year-over-year and continue to produce attractive returns, achieving a pretax margin of 34% in the first quarter. Our ability to serve complex client needs and create sophisticated solutions for our clients was evident within our Global Family Office business, which serves ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices. Global Family Office had strong new business and a 13% trust fee growth in the quarter.
C&IS continued to grow as well. One growth driver over the last couple of years has been providing services to help our clients meet new regulatory requirements. For example, we provide depository services so clients can meet their AIFMD, UCITS V and other asset safety-related regulations. Another growth driver has been providing new tools and technology to enhance our clients' oversight of their increasing investments and alternatives. We recently announced an exclusive agreement with AltX to offer our clients access to the largest amount of data for hedge funds on a single platform. These are just a couple of examples of how we're growing our business by doing more for our clients. 
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this will be Bev Fleming's last earnings call after a remarkable 15 years as our Director of Investor Relations. So many of us within Northern Trust have relied on her expertise. Her wisdom, advice and counsel will most certainly be missed. Please join me in wishing her well in retirement. 
We are also fortunate to have Mark Bette joining Investor Relations. Mark joined Northern Trust in 1994 and has served in a number of leadership roles within finance, including as Senior Financial Analyst in Investor Relations from 2001 to 2006. He brings a wealth of knowledge about the firm to the role.
Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today's call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our Annual Meeting, which begins at 10:30 Central Time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice. 
Thank you, again, for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Zach, please open the line."

The premium amortization, as we described in the quarter, it was up sequentially from the fourth quarter. I think it was $6 million in the quarter. We have discussed in the past that amortization is typically $9 million to $10 million in a quarter. It can move. So it was slightly better than the normal run rate, but in the fourth quarter of 2015, we actually experienced kind of a low, at only $1 million of premium amortization. So sequentially, it actually hurt the returns. On a year-over-year basis, it actually helped by a small amount actually, a modest amount. So that's a little bit of color on premium amortization. In terms of what we're buying and the improvement in the security portfolio, first of all, I would say the -- we benefited from the rate move in the portfolio. We did add about -- you could see, about $1 billion of treasury securities. Those were largely 5- to 7-year duration purchases, but swapped back to something closer to 3 months. So the duration in the portfolio was really not extended, but we were able to get some enhanced yield there. We did have a small portion of that $1 billion that we went out a little longer in duration. So the overall duration of -- the index duration of the portfolio only increased modestly."

Can you help us understand that dynamic a little bit more? So if 120-ish is kind of a decent starting off point assuming no more rate hikes, how meaningful of the benefit could we still see to the NIM from the initial hike? And the follow-up also around the net interest income discussion. It looks like the ending balance sheet ended a bit higher than the average. So just wondering whether it's the timing of the kind of net new business that came in a little bit later in the quarter? Or is it just the typical end quarter stuff so the balance sheet was a little bit lower, but the average should kind of normalize as we look into the second quarter?"

It can move as you know, on March 31 or any quarter end period based on client activity, et cetera. So I would say there was nothing unusual about that movement from our perspective. In terms of the NIM and the expansion or potential expansion of the NIM, 2 components that I want to address there. First is, you have to remember that approximately half of our balance sheet is in foreign office time deposits and in some of those places, we're experiencing negative spreads in others where that compression is not impacted by necessarily by treasury rates. In the U.S., 2 things to consider there if there are no further rate hikes. Many of our assets repriced in the first 3 months of this year since the rate hike, but there are still some repricing opportunities left inside of that portfolio. Remember it's of a short duration so there is some benefit in there. So I would say, we're going to wait and see how that plays out, but to date, as you correctly saw in the NIM, the data has been relatively close to 0 and the assets have been able to reprice. We've been able to capture that 11 basis point increase in the NIM."

So in the quarter, new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers weren't really sufficient to offset the drag from -- remember, we have month lag equity market. So the fees are based on February month-end, which was still quite down, and the lower fees on equity mutual funds, as you discussed. If you think about this, there's an ongoing and broad industry trend towards passive management as investors continue to face lower overall returns, and they look to control what they can control, which is mainly fees. So we have seen that kind of fee pressure in our funds into lower cost alternatives. So the combination of the month lag in the fees, the migration, if you will, to lower fee structured products was not enough to offset the positive fee waiver in the quarter. We do still think relative to the industry that the growth rates are healthy and that the business is, indeed, is strong. It's just a difficult macro environment for that business."

So that line item, as you look historically, has remained fairly consistent. And that's probably your better trending. Other line items, you suggest that we did defer salary increases to October 1 for all employees, so that we did April of 2015. We did merit salary increases. We will not have that in this sequential comparison. And we continue to be vigilant on business promotion, non-regulatory consulting spend and all other key discretionary line items and there is a continued focus on that line item as we enter Q2 and beyond."

So no real behavior changes. In terms of the migration from active, passive, what I -- I would say first is that, in some cases, that's from higher fee to lower fee solutions, as our clients have struggled to get returns, they focus on what they can control, which is the fee portion of that. So they're looking for lower fee opportunities. And in some cases along that spectrum from active to passive, there are our product and capabilities that we continue to discuss with our clients. Those could be FlexShares. Those could be engineered data or engineered equity offerings. So we do have products along the spectrum, if you will, between fully active and fully passive that help mute some of that fee compression that we talked about."

And that obviously has a knock-on impact to produce better ROE. Improvement in the ratio is driven by achieving positive fee operating leverage. And as is the case with operating leverage in the short-term, there can be periods of time where we have degradation in the ratio, sometimes due to seasonal impacts. This quarter, for instance, while the ratio would've benefited from lower level fee waivers, the seasonal expense impact of stock-based compensation in the Northern Trust Open more than offset the improvement in fee waivers. Gerard, we remain focused on the 2 parts of that equation that we can. The first is in what I would describe as the organic growth rate of our fees.

This gain is reflected on our income statement in the Other Operating Income line. The sale reduces our ownership in Visa Class B shares to 4.13 million shares as of the end of the second quarter. At the current conversion rate, that is equivalent up [ph] 2 6.81 million Class A shares of Visa. These shares are recorded on our balance sheet at their original cost basis of 0. The $118.2 million net gain included $5 million in costs relating to the mark-to-market of the swap on last year's sale of 1 million Class B shares. 
Second, we recorded a $46.5 million charge in connection with an agreement subject to court approval to certain long-standing securities lending litigation. This charge is reflected within the other operating expense line of our income statement. The charge covers settlements and cases related to client losses from the 2008 financial crisis. With this agreement, we are pleased to have resolved the most significant litigation against Northern Trust related to the financial crisis. 
Third, we recognized 21.6 million in losses associated with our loan and lease portfolio. This included $14.1 million in impairment charges and the loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio as well as a $7.5 million impairment charge related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars. Of these $21.6 million in losses, $18.9 million is reflected on the other Operating Income line while the remaining $2.7 million reflected within net interest income. 
Fourth, we recorded an $18.6 million charge relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS asset servicing clients. The impact of this charge is reflected on the other operating expense line on our income statement. Lastly, we recorded $17.5 million in expense related to severance and personnel-related charges. I will discuss both of these last 2 items in further detail later in the call when we review our expenses for the quarter. 
In excluding these 5 items, second quarter net income was $253 million, earnings per share were $1.06 and our return on common equity was 11.7%. Recall that our results in the second quarter of 2015 included a pretax gain of $99.9 million relating to the sale of 1 million Class B Visa shares, voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar, net asset value funds of $45.8 million and the impairment of the residual value of certain aircraft lease agreements of $17.8 million. 
A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the second quarter. Equity markets have been mixed during 2016. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 1.7% year-over-year and up 1.9%, sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE index was down 12.7% year-over-year and down 2.6%, sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and first quarter markets were generally lower. 
In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was higher for both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons. Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 10.5% higher than the second quarter of last year and 5% higher, sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were down in the second quarter. As measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 9% to 13% year-over-year and down 9% to 12%, sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income. 
Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, particularly in the year-over-year comparison, tempered custody growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth. U.S. short-term interest rates were higher compared to last year following the Federal Reserve rate increase in December but flat sequentially. 3-month LIBOR and the Fed funds effective rate averaged 64 and 37 basis points, respectively. The overnight repo rate was also higher compared to last year, but flat sequentially, averaging 45 basis points in the quarter. 
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. My comments are on the adjusted basis, which excludes the prior year and current quarter items I mentioned in my opening comments. Year-over-year, revenue increased 4% with noninterest income up 1% and net interest income up 12%. Expenses also increased 4%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million, reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Net income was 2% higher year-over-year. 
In the sequential comparison. Revenue increased 3% while noninterest income was up 4% and net interest income down 2%. Expenses increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 5% higher, sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.7% for the quarter, down slightly from 1 year ago, but up from 11.4% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of 6.4 trillion increased 3% compared to 1 year ago and 2% on a sequential basis. In both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar. 
Assets under management were $906 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Lower equity assets were the primary driver due to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and weaker global equity markets. In addition, fixed income assets were lower, primarily due to the loss of 1 passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned during our third quarter call. Assets under management increased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by higher fixed income and equity balances, partially offset by lower cash balances. 
Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.3 billion. Adjusted for the items I mentioned in my opening, revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, up 4% from last year and up 3%, sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $777 million in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year and up 4% for the prior quarter. 
Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver this quarter. Fee waivers were essentially 0 in the second quarter compared to $28 million 1 year ago and $8 million in the first quarter. I'll go into further detail in trust and investment fees shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was $64 million in the second quarter, down 14% year-over-year and up 6%, sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline while the sequential improvement mainly reflects higher volatility. Other noninterest income was $76 million in the second quarter, up 4% from last year and up 4%, sequentially. 
The current quarter's results include $2.6 million in revenue associated with the Aviate acquisition, which closed on May 1. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by other operating income, partially offset by a net investment security loss of $2 million in the current quarter due to an other and temporary impairment of certain Community Reinvestment Act eligible securities. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher securities commission and trading income, primarily due to the Aviate acquisition and higher other operating income partially offset by the investment security loss.
Please note that as referred to in our call last quarter, the first quarter results included a net gain of $2.3 million related to our decision to exit a portion of a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio. The primary driver of the remaining sequential increase and other operating income was higher income associated with the supplemental compensation plans that have an associated expense within other operating expense. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $309 million in the second quarter, increasing 12% year-over-year and down 2%, sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $447 million in the second quarter, up 3% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $293 million, unchanged from 1 year ago and up 2%, sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.8 trillion at quarter end, up 3% year-over-year and up 2%, sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS, custody funded administration fees. Unfavorable currency translation impacted the year-over-year comparison.
Investment management fees and C&IS of $94 million in the second quarter were up 17% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were essentially 0 during the second quarter, lower by $14 million year-over-year and $2 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. Beyond fee waivers, the favorable impact of new business was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $672 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier and flat, sequentially.
Securities lending fees were $27 million in the second quarter, flat with the prior year and 18% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. The sequential performance primarily reflects the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spreads. Securities lending collateral was $108 billion at the quarter end and averaged $117 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 7% year-over-year and were up 2%, sequentially. 
The decline in loan volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. These asset classes have been most impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage in the securities lending business. Other fees in C&IS were $33 million in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment, risk and analytical services and other ancillary services. In the sequential quarter comparison, other fees were down 8%, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payments business.
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $330 million in the second quarter, up 2% year-over-year and 5%, sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance with fees increasing 14% year-over-year and 6% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and new business. Performance in the regions was lower on a year-over-year basis as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets and lower fees on equity mutual funds. On a sequential basis, fees within the regions benefited from lower money market fee waivers and favorable lagged markets.
Money market mutual fund fee waivers and wealth management were essentially 0 in the current quarter, down $14 million year-over-year and $6 million sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates on the gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $234 billion at quarter end, up 1% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially.
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $307 million in the second quarter, up 19% year-over-year and down 2% compared to the fourth -- first quarter. $2.7 million of the $7.5 million impairment on certain aircraft and railcars from my opening comments was included in this quarter's net interest income. Also, recall that the prior year's results included a $17.8 million lease impairment. Excluding these 2 items, net interest income was up 12% compared to 1 year ago, driven by a higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. 
Earning assets averaged $107 billion in the second quarter, up 3% versus last year, driven by a higher level of deposits. Demand deposits, which averaged $27 billion, increased 5% year-over-year and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $50 billion were up 2% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth again as loan balances averaged $34 billion in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the previously mentioned $2.7 million impairment, net interest income declined 2%, primarily driven by a lower net interest margin as averaged earning assets were up 2%, sequentially. 
And adjusted for the impairment, net interest margin was 1.17% in the second quarter, up 11 basis points year-over-year and down 4 basis points, sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the Fed's move in September. In the sequential quarter comparison, the lower margin was driven by higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization was $20 million in the second quarter, up from $6 million in the first quarter.
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $925 million in the second quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 12%, sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded 3 expense-related charges in the quarter. First, I described in my opening remarks, we recorded a $46.5 million charge in connection with an agreement to settle certain securities lending litigation. This charge is reflected within the other operating expense line. Second, an $18.6 million charge related to contractual modifications associated with the existing C&IS asset of servicing clients. These were previously incurred implementation costs that were being deferred over the life of the client contracts. 
As a result of the contractual modifications, these costs are no longer considered recoverable and have been brought forward into the current period. The expense associated with this charge would have been amortized into expense over the next 2 to 3 years. This $18.6 million charge is reflected in other operating expense. Third, we recorded a charge of $17.5 million related to severance and other personnel-related costs. Of that $15.2 million relates to severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 150 positions. As outlined in our earnings release, $13 million of that charge appears on the compensation line, $1.5 million in employee benefit expense and $0.7 million in outside service expense.
Our actions taken this quarter reflect the continued focus on improving profitability and returns and we expect the charges to produce annual ongoing savings of approximately $15 million once fully implemented. The remaining $2.3 million of personnel-related charges reflected in other operating expense. Recall that 1 year ago, other operating expense included a $45.8 million charge associated with our voluntary cash contributions to 4 constant dollar DAF funds. Adjusting for these second quarter items both in this year and last, expenses were 4% higher year-over-year and 2% higher sequentially. 
It is also worth noting the current quarter -- now it's also worth noting that the current quarter included $3.4 million of expense associated with our acquisition of the Aviate business, which closed on May 1. Now let's go through the remaining components of expense. My comments going forward will exclude the 3 current year charges totaling $82.6 million and last year's charge of 485.8 [ph]. Compensation expense of $377 million increased 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with approximately 60% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in India, Manila and Limerick. 
On a sequential basis, compensation expense declined 1% as the impact of staff growth and higher current year cash-based incentive accruals was more than offset by the decline in stock-based incentives due to the first quarter, including the impact of options granted to retired eligible employees and the immediate vesting of certain restricted stocks units awarded during the quarter. Employee benefit expense of $71 million was down 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pension expense. 
On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was flat as higher medical costs were offset by lower payroll taxes. Outside service expense of $158 million was 8% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense increased 6%, primarily reflecting higher consulting and subcustodian expense. Equipment software expense of $118 million was up 3% both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. 
Occupancy expense of $45 million was up 5% year-over-year and 11%, sequentially. The increase is primarily reflected higher rent expense with the sequential comparison also impacted by a lease adjustment reflected in the prior quarter. Other operating expense of $74 million increased 7% year-over-year, primarily related to higher costs associated with account servicing activities, higher supplemental compensation plan expense and increased FDIC costs, partially offset by lower costs associated with the timing of charitable contributions. 
Sequentially, other operating expense declined 1% due to lower business promotion expense as the Northern Trust Open was during the first quarter, offset by increases in various other costs including higher supplemental compensation plan expense and higher staff related expense. It is worth noting that as mentioned, when I reviewed our operating income, the increase in supplemental compensation plan expense has an associated increase in revenue. 
Our loan loss provision was a credit of $3 million in the second quarter. This compares to a provision expense of $2 million in the prior quarter and a credit of $10 million in the prior year. The credit in the current quarter was driven by improved credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio and a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio. Loan quality remains very strong with nonperforming assets of $166 million at quarter end, down 5% versus the prior quarter and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 44 basis points at quarter end. The effective income tax rate in the quarter was 33.9%. 
Turning to Page 8. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust in investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today, is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity. 
As you can see on this page, after adjusting for the items noted in my opening comments, we have been able to continue our trend of improving this ratio. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward, through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and drive productivity within our expense base by our ongoing initiatives focused on location strategy, impairment and technology. 
Turning to Page 9. Our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.5 and 10.6, respectively calculated on the transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be 11.3% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 10.4%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirements of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. 
The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.1 and at the bank was 5.8, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. 
As we announced in June, our 2016 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve. In it, we requested authorities to increase our quarterly common dividend to $0.38 per share and the repurchase up to 275 million of common stock through June 2017. In the second quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $141 million. Yesterday, our Board of Directors formally approved the planned dividend increase, which will be payable on October 1. 
When we consider our strategy for capital actions, we take into consideration the level of retained capital to facilitate our continued growth, our level of capital to absorb significant stress scenarios and to enable us to continue to hold top-tier credit ratings. We also look at our capital levels and structure compared to our peers as our clients entrusts us with the safekeeping of their assets. It is important for us to demonstrate competitive capital strength. 
Our growth as measured by assets, earning assets and risk-weighted assets has grown at a rate about double that of our common equity since 2012, and we expect to remain focused on growth. We will continue to evaluate our capital structure as it relates to regulatory requirements and look to optimize the cost of our capital for the firm not only in the short-term, but importantly, over the long-term as well.
In closing, the second quarter of 2016 was characterized by continued market volatility, low and even negative interest rates around the globe and geopolitical uncertainty highlighted by the Brexit vote. Despite that challenging backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing our earnings per share 5% both year-over-year and sequentially adjusting for the items noted at the beginning of our prepared remarks. Our adjusted return on common equity was 11.7%, improving 30 basis points, sequentially. 
We also achieved sequential operating leverage of 1 point as we continue to strive to produce even greater operating efficiency. We also returned $230 million to our shareholders while retaining enough capital to fund our growth and maintain quality credit ratings. In the quarter, we were also pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve for our 2016 capital plan submission. 
Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 5% year-over-year, grew fees 5%, sequentially and produced a 38.2% pretax margin. All of this was accomplished against a challenging economic backdrop. C&IS continued to grow as well. In the second quarter, we had good success in growing our business organically with such wins as Ariel investment and RECM Global Fund Limited and Currency. We also formally closed our Aviate transaction, allowing us to expand our brokerage capabilities to EMEA and APAC. 
I would also like to mention that our team handled the Brexit situation effectively as they enacted their contingency plans in light of the leave vote. Our efforts around Brexit remain focused first and foremost, on our clients needs and we're communicating frequently as the situation clarifies. Lastly, Northern Trust has been named as a recipient of the 2016 CIO 100, an annual award program recognizing organizations around the world that exemplify the highest level of operational and strategic excellence in information technology. Technological solutions remain a vital part of our value proposition to our clients and this external validation of our efforts was an important indicator of the value of our investment. 
Thank you, again for participating in Northern Trust's second quarter earnings conference call Today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your question. Derek, please open the line."

When we consider sort of the outlook for premium amortization, we consider the drivers in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. And there are several as you cited. First is our expectations around the rate environment. The second is obviously the pace at which refinances happen. And we model all of that in and there is also third, a seasonality to it. If you look historically at our prepayment amortization, it tends to be at its highest in the second and third quarters with some relief in the fourth and first, absent any unique rate environment that we're in. So we factor all of that in. And we've seen that play out over previous cycles. This was larger than we've seen historically, and I think it's probably driven by the rate of refinancing in the markets. The last element in the premium amortization is the characteristics of the portfolio we're investing in ourselves, how much time is left to maturity and what is the underlying construct of the portfolio's we're invested in. So when we weigh all of those out, we do tend to see a tickup in second and third quarters seasonality, normally and then lower in the fourth and first quarters. Again, though the rate movements can also impact that as well. The second part was -- of your question was around deposits betas, I believe, with a second rate hike. When and if a second rate hike occurs, obviously the first rate hike produced closed to a 0 deposit beta, that is not much was passed on in that. We think even in the second deposit beta, while observing it for the first time, that we would continue to see that sharing while it would move up, still would be relatively favorable for financial institutions and us as well."

And do we really have the right level of capital to facilitate that growth. We've had 3 consecutive years of very high payout as you know, an example would be our balance sheet has grown almost twice the growth in our common equity over the last 3 years. And additionally, if you look from 2013 to now, our assets are up almost at a CAGR of 5.6% and our common equity is only up 2.7%. So we look at sort of the ratio or the relationship between the growth that we want in our plans and our capital we need to retain to fund that growth. The second issue we look at is how does our business perform under stress and do we have enough capital to deal with, whether it's a Fed-mandated stress scenario or our own idiosyncratic. And we look at the proper level of capital to absorb that. Third is credit ratings. As you see at a 10.6 common equity Tier 1 standardized ratio, we're mid-table maybe even slightly below on a point time. So we're not at the top, but we worry about what that would mean from a credit ratings. We want and need to maintain high credit ratings. And then third is -- or fourth is around our clients. In the marketplace, our clients do evaluate what our capital levels look like vis-à-vis others. And they can use things like the ratios that we're talking about now to measure that. And so being in the vicinity of our close-in competitors, we think it's a competitive factor. It doesn't mean we have to be exactly there, but we have to be within the area code to make sure that, that's appropriate. We weigh all of those, and we come up with an ASK. I will say that the retention of that is not generating ROEs that we think, if it's supporting risk-weighted average growth that is not generating the 10% to 15% ROEs, we will revisit that in our next submission."

If you look at, we do provide the assets under custody in certain regions, that can give you some indication of the relative importance in size in the marketplace. If I could ask -- answer a little bit more, the question around Brexit and its impact, I'll start by saying that the good news is that the team was ready and executed very well on the immediate impacts of Brexit, which was most important for our clients. and that was relatively seamless and the client was largely unimpacted by that. Well, a lot of volatility was going on. In terms of impact to us, I think it's very early to make a comment what that would be as we're still watching the situation unfold. But I think it's important to highlight exactly our business mix in Europe. We are largely a C&IS institution, corporate institutional business in EMEA, we have a small wealth business, but largely it's corporate institutional business that does both administration for pensions and also asset managers. The important characteristics there particularly for the fund administration is -- or excuse me, for all the custody and asset servicing is the right to do that across Europe. Our banking entity is based in the U.K. today. So if that passport doesn't get negotiated as potentially could happen, we have to look at where we can also conduct businesses. We have large fund administration businesses in Ireland and Luxembourg, which we think there or others, we could leverage to read down the silo bank to allow us to conduct our business.

We negotiated a mutually agreed change to that where we gave up the right to call back based on our understanding of the relationship at the time, and they gave something back as well.

We don't publish that. But it's at or near normal levels that we've seen or if slightly higher than that and if the pipeline remains strong. So on the fee growth side organically, we feel it remains strong. If you look at the actual fee growth that you're reconciling, there are some headwinds in there. There was some currency negativity in the comparison, particularly for the C&IS business. So it was hurt by the stronger dollar. That was one factor. And in the C&IS business, there can also be some lumpiness to that, as the wins tend to be very large. But we feel very good about the pipeline and the growth rate. On the Wealth side, the new business flows and in fact, in the second quarter, we're very strong, very robust. But they do still have the issues that we've talked about on previous calls, which are around fee compression as we have seen for instance, the migration from say, active to passive, particularly true in the Wealth Management business. So that has created fee compression, which is somewhat offset by growth to new business. So across both, we still feel pretty good about our growth rates in those businesses. And I think in particular this quarter if we looked at it, even excluding the benefit of fee waivers, Wealth Management across its regions still have mid to high single-digit growth rates, which I think is pretty good, particularly relative to the industry."

About 20% then gets down to what I would say more discretionary spend in that line item. That's things like consulting like you highlighted where perhaps it can move and ramp if we need to take on special initiatives around regulatory environment or if Jenna Shrewd, our Chief Operating Officer, has programs of work around digitization or improvement to lower future run rate. We can from time to time, see that move. I will say that if you take just the consulting spend portion of that, the rate has actually slowed from the second half of last year. I know you see this numbers spike. It has slowed. It meaningfully went up in the second half of last year as we ramped up for CCAR and other regulatory. We have seen that start to slow in this quarter, but it's still at elevated levels versus year-on-year.

Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results.
[Operator Instructions] Thank you, again, for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman"

Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $261",4031,"Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.
Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $261 million. Earnings per share were $1.09 and our return on common equity was 12.2%. As outlined in our press release, our results for the second quarter included 5 items, which I would like to highlight for you today.
First, we recorded a pretax gain of $118.2 million on the sale of $1.1 million Class B Visa shares net of swap expense. This gain is reflected on our income statement in the Other Operating Income line. The sale reduces our ownership position in Visa Class B shares to 4.13 million shares as of the end of the second quarter. 
At the current conversion rate, that is equivalent up to 6.81 [ph] million Class A shares of Visa. These shares are recorded on our balance sheet at their original cost basis of 0. The $118.2 million net gain included $5 million in costs relating to the mark-to-market of the swap on last year's sale of 1 million Class B shares.
Second, we recorded a $46.5 million charge in connection with an agreement, subject to court approval, to certain long-standing securities lending litigation. This charge is reflected within the other operating expense line of our income statement. The charge covers settlements and cases related to client losses from the 2008 financial crisis. With this agreement, we are pleased to have resolved the most significant litigation against Northern Trust related to the financial crisis. 
Third, we recognized 21.6 million in losses associated with our loan and lease portfolio. This included $14.1 million in impairment charges and the loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio as well as a $7.5 million impairment charge related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars. Of these $21.6 million in losses, $18.9 million is reflected on the other Operating Income line while the remaining $2.7 million reflected within net interest income.
Fourth, we recorded an $18.6 million charge relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS asset servicing clients. The impact of this charge is reflected on the other operating expense line on our income statement. Lastly, we recorded $17.5 million in expense related to severance and personnel-related charges. I will discuss both of these last 2 items in further detail later in the call when we review our expenses for the quarter.
In excluding these 5 items, second quarter net income was $253 million, earnings per share were $1.06 and our return on common equity was 11.7%. Recall that our results in the second quarter of 2015 included a pretax gain of $99.9 million relating to the sale of 1 million Class B Visa shares, voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar, net asset value funds of $45.8 million and the impairment of the residual value of certain aircraft lease agreements of $17.8 million.
A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the second quarter. Equity markets have been mixed during 2016. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 1.7% year-over-year and up 1.9%, sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE index was down 12.7% year-over-year and down 2.6%, sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and first quarter markets were generally lower.
In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was higher for both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons. Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 10.5% higher than the second quarter of last year and 5% higher, sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were down in the second quarter. As measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 9% to 13% year-over-year and down 9% to 12%, sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income.
Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, particularly in the year-over-year comparison, tempered custody growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth. U.S. short-term interest rates were higher compared to last year following the Federal Reserve rate increase in December but flat sequentially. 3-month LIBOR and the Fed funds effective rate averaged 64 and 37 basis points, respectively. The overnight repo rate was also higher compared to last year, but flat sequentially, averaging 45 basis points in the quarter.
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. My comments are on the adjusted basis, which excludes the prior year and current quarter items I mentioned in my opening comments. Year-over-year, revenue increased 4% with noninterest income up 1% and net interest income up 12%. Expenses also increased 4%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million, reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Net income was 2% higher year-over-year.
In the sequential comparison. Revenue increased 3% while noninterest income was up 4% and net interest income down 2%. Expenses increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 5% higher, sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.7% for the quarter, down slightly from 1 year ago, but up from 11.4% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of 6.4 trillion increased 3% compared to 1 year ago and 2% on a sequential basis. In both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar.
Assets under management were $906 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Lower equity assets were the primary driver due to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and weaker global equity markets. In addition, fixed income assets were lower, primarily due to the loss of 1 passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned during our third quarter call. Assets under management increased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by higher fixed income and equity balances, partially offset by lower cash balances.
Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.3 billion. Adjusted for the items I mentioned in my opening, revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, up 4% from last year and up 3%, sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $777 million in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year and up 4% for the prior quarter.
Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver this quarter. Fee waivers were essentially 0 in the second quarter compared to $28 million 1 year ago and $8 million in the first quarter. I'll go into further detail in trust and investment fees shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was $64 million in the second quarter, down 14% year-over-year and up 6%, sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline while the sequential improvement mainly reflects higher volatility. Other noninterest income was $76 million in the second quarter, up 4% from last year and up 4%, sequentially.
The current quarter's results include $2.6 million in revenue associated with the Aviate acquisition, which closed on May 1. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by other operating income, partially offset by a net investment security loss of $2 million in the current quarter due to and other than temporary impairment of certain Community Reinvestment Act eligible securities. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher securities commission and trading income, primarily due to the Aviate acquisition and higher other operating income partially offset by the investment security loss.
Please note that as referred to in our call last quarter, the first quarter results included a net gain of $2.3 million related to our decision to exit a portion of a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio. The primary driver of the remaining sequential increase and other operating income was higher income associated with the supplemental compensation plans that have an associated expense within other operating expense. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $309 million in the second quarter, increasing 12% year-over-year and down 2%, sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $447 million in the second quarter, up 3% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $293 million, unchanged from 1 year ago and up 2%, sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.8 trillion at quarter end, up 3% year-over-year and up 2%, sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets. Recall that lagged market value factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS, custody and funded administration fees. Unfavorable currency translation impacted the year-over-year comparison.
Investment management fees and C&IS of $94 million in the second quarter were up 17% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were essentially 0 during the second quarter, lower by $14 million year-over-year and $2 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. Beyond fee waivers, the favorable impact of new business was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $672 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier and flat, sequentially.
Securities lending fees were $27 million in the second quarter, flat with the prior year and 18% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. The sequential performance primarily reflects the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spreads. Securities lending collateral was $108 billion at the quarter end and averaged $117 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 7% year-over-year and were up 2%, sequentially.
The decline in loan volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. These asset classes have been most impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage in the securities lending business. Other fees in C&IS were $33 million in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment, risk and analytical services and other ancillary services. In the sequential quarter comparison, other fees were down 8%, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payments business.
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $330 million in the second quarter, up 2% year-over-year and 5%, sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance with fees increasing 14% year-over-year and 6% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and new business. Performance in the regions was lower on a year-over-year basis as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets and lower fees on equity mutual funds. On a sequential basis, fees within the regions benefited from lower money market fee waivers and favorable lagged markets.
Money market mutual fund fee waivers and wealth management were essentially 0 in the current quarter, down $14 million year-over-year and $6 million, sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates on the gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $234 billion at quarter end, up 1% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially.
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $307 million in the second quarter, up 19% year-over-year and down 2% compared to the fourth -- first quarter. $2.7 million of the $7.5 million impairment on certain aircraft and railcars from my opening comments was included in this quarter's net interest income. Also, recall that the prior year's results included a $17.8 million lease impairment. Excluding these 2 items, net interest income was up 12% compared to 1 year ago, driven by a higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. 
Earning assets averaged $107 billion in the second quarter, up 3% versus last year, driven by a higher level of deposits. Demand deposits, which averaged $27 billion, increased 5% year-over-year and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $50 billion were up 2% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth again as loan balances averaged $34 billion in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the previously mentioned $2.7 million impairment, net interest income declined 2%, primarily driven by a lower net interest margin as average earning assets were up 2%, sequentially. 
When adjusted for the impairment, net interest margin was 1.17% in the second quarter, up 11 basis points year-over-year and down 4 basis points, sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the Fed's move in December. In the sequential quarter comparison, the lower margin was driven by higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization was $20 million in the second quarter, up from $6 million in the first quarter.
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $925 million in the second quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 12%, sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded 3 expense-related charges in the quarter. First, I described in my opening remarks, we recorded a $46.5 million charge in connection with an agreement to settle certain securities lending litigation. This charge is reflected within the other operating expense line. Second, an $18.6 million charge related to contractual modifications associated with the existing C&IS asset of servicing clients. These were previously incurred implementation costs that were being deferred over the life of the client contracts.
As a result of the contractual modifications, these costs are no longer considered recoverable and have been brought forward into the current period. The expense associated with this charge would have been amortized into expense over the next 2 to 3 years. This $18.6 million charge is reflected in other operating expense. Third, we recorded a charge of $17.5 million related to severance and other personnel-related costs. Of that $15.2 million relates to severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 150 positions. As outlined in our earnings release, $13 million of that charge appears in the compensation line, $1.5 million in employee benefit expense and $0.7 million in outside service expense.
Our actions taken this quarter reflect the continued focus on improving profitability and returns, and we expect the charges to produce annual ongoing savings of approximately $15 million once fully implemented. The remaining $2.3 million of personnel-related charges reflected in other operating expense. Recall that 1 year ago, other operating expense included a $45.8 million charge associated with our voluntary cash contributions to 4 constant dollar DAF funds. Adjusting for these second quarter items, both in this year and last, expenses were 4% higher year-over-year and 2% higher, sequentially.
It is also worth noting that the current quarter -- now it is also worth noting that the current quarter included $3.4 million of expense associated with our acquisition of the Aviate business, which closed on May 1. 
Now let's go through the remaining components of expense. My comments going forward will exclude the 3 current year charges totaling $82.6 million and last year's charge of 45.8 million. Compensation expense of $377 million increased 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with approximately 60% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in India, Manila and Limerick.
On a sequential basis, compensation expense declined 1% as the impact of staff growth and higher current year cash-based incentive accruals was more than offset by the decline in stock-based incentives due to the first quarter, including the impact of options granted to retirement-eligible employees and the immediate vesting of certain restricted stocks units awarded during the quarter. Employee benefit expense of $71 million was down 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pension expense.
On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was flat as higher medical costs were offset by lower payroll taxes. Outside service expense of $158 million was 8% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements.
On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense increased 6%, primarily reflecting higher consulting and sub-custodian expense. Equipment software expense of $118 million was up 3% both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives.
Occupancy expense of $45 million was up 5% year-over-year and 11%, sequentially. The increases primarily reflected higher rent expense with the sequential comparison also impacted by a lease adjustment reflected in the prior quarter. Other operating expense of $74 million increased 7% year-over-year, primarily related to higher costs associated with account servicing activities, higher supplemental compensation plan expense and increased FDIC costs, partially offset by lower costs associated with the timing of charitable contributions.
Sequentially, other operating expense declined 1% due to lower business promotion expense as the Northern Trust Open was during the first quarter, offset by increases in various other costs including higher supplemental compensation plan expense and higher staff-related expense. It is worth noting that as mentioned, when I reviewed our operating income, the increase in supplemental compensation plan expense has an associated increase in revenue.
Our loan loss provision was a credit of $3 million in the second quarter. This compares to a provision expense of $2 million in the prior quarter and a credit of $10 million in the prior year. The credit in the current quarter was driven by improved credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio and a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio. Loan quality remains very strong with nonperforming assets of $166 million at quarter end, down 5% versus the prior quarter and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 44 basis points at quarter end. The effective income tax rate in the quarter was 33.9%. 
Turning to Page 8. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust in investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it has -- was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today, is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity.
As you can see on this page, after adjusting for the items noted in my opening comments, we have been able to continue our trend of improving this ratio. This metric remains an important parameter of our progress, and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward, through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and drive productivity within our expense base by our ongoing initiatives focused on location strategy, impairment and technology.
Turning to Page 9. Our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.5% and 10.6%, respectively calculated on the transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.3% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 10.4%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirements of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer.
The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.1% and at the bank was 5.8%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018.
With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.
As we announced in June, our 2016 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve. In it, we requested authorities to increase our quarterly common dividend to $0.38 per share and the repurchase up to 275 million of common stock through June 2017. In the second quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $141 million. Yesterday, our Board of Directors formally approved the planned dividend increase, which will be payable on October 1.
When we consider our strategy for capital actions, we take into consideration the level of retained capital to facilitate our continued growth, our level of capital to absorb significant stress scenarios and to enable us to continue to hold top-tier credit ratings. We also look at our capital levels and structure compared to our peers as our clients entrusts us with the safekeeping of their assets. It is important for us to demonstrate competitive capital strength.
Our growth as measured by assets, earning assets and risk-weighted assets has grown at a rate about double that of our common equity since 2012, and we expect to remain focused on growth. We will continue to evaluate our capital structure as it relates to regulatory requirements and look to optimize the cost of our capital for the firm not only in the short-term, but importantly, over the long-term as well.
In closing, the second quarter of 2016 was characterized by continued market volatility, low and even negative interest rates around the globe and geopolitical uncertainty highlighted by the Brexit vote. Despite that challenging backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing our earnings per share 5% both year-over-year and sequentially adjusting for the items noted at the beginning of our prepared remarks. Our adjusted return on common equity was 11.7%, improving 30 basis points, sequentially.
We also achieved sequential operating leverage of 1 point as we continue to strive to produce even greater operating efficiency. We also returned $230 million to our shareholders while retaining enough capital to fund our growth and maintain quality credit ratings. In the quarter, we were also pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve for our 2016 capital plan submission.
Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 5% year-over-year, grew fees 5%, sequentially and produced a 38.2% pretax margin. All of this was accomplished against a challenging economic backdrop. C&IS continued to grow as well. In the second quarter, we had good success in growing our business organically with such wins as Ariel investment and RECM Global Fund Limited and Currency. We also formally closed our Aviate transaction, allowing us to expand our brokerage capabilities into EMEA and APAC.
I would also like to mention that our team handled the Brexit situation effectively as they enacted their contingency plans in light of the leave vote. Our efforts around Brexit remain focused first and foremost, on our clients' needs, and we're communicating frequently as the situation clarifies. 
Lastly, Northern Trust has been named as a recipient of the 2016 CIO 100, an annual award program recognizing organizations around the world that exemplify the highest level of operational and strategic excellence in information technology. Technological solutions remain a vital part of our value proposition to our clients and this external validation of our efforts was an important indicator of the value of our investment.
Thank you, again for participating in Northern Trust's second quarter earnings conference call, today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your question. Derek, please open the line."

When we consider sort of the outlook for premium amortization, we consider the drivers in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. And there are several as you cited. First is our expectations around the rate environment. The second is obviously the pace at which refinances happen. And we model all of that in and there is also third, a seasonality to it. If you look historically at our prepayment amortization, it tends to be at its highest in the second and third quarters with some relief in the fourth and first, absent any unique rate environment that we're in. So we factor all of that in. And we've seen that play out over previous cycles. This was larger than we've seen historically, and I think it's probably driven by the rate of refinancing in the markets. The last element in the premium amortization is the characteristics of the portfolio we're investing in ourselves, how much time is left to maturity and what is the underlying construct of the portfolio's we're invested in. So when we weigh all of those out, we do tend to see a tick-up in second and third quarters seasonality, normally and then lower in the fourth and first quarters. Again, though the rate movements can also impact that as well. The second part was -- of your question was around deposits betas, I believe, with a second rate hike. When and if a second rate hike occurs, obviously the first rate hike produced closed to a 0 deposit beta is not -- much was passed on in that. We think even in the second deposit beta, while observing it for the first time that we would continue to see that sharing while it would move up, still be relatively favorable for financial institutions and us as well."

And do we really have the right level of capital to facilitate that growth. We've had 3 consecutive years of very high payout, as you know. An example would be our balance sheet has grown almost twice the growth in our common equity over the last 3 years. And additionally, if you look from 2013 to now, our assets are up almost at a CAGR of 5.6% and our common equity is only up 2.7%. So we look at sort of the ratio or the relationship between the growth that we want in our plans and the capital we need to retain to fund that growth. The second issue we look at is how does our business perform under stress and do we have enough capital to deal with, whether it's a Fed-mandated stress scenario or our own idiosyncratic, and we look at the proper level of capital to absorb that. Third is credit ratings. As you see at a 10.6% common equity Tier 1 standardized ratio, we're mid-table, maybe even slightly below on a point time. So we're not at the top, but we worry about what that would mean from a credit ratings. We want and need to maintain high credit ratings. And then third is -- or fourth is around our clients. In the marketplace, our clients do evaluate what our capital levels look like vis-à-vis others. And they can use things like the ratios that we're talking about now to measure that. And so being in the vicinity of our close-in competitors, we think, is a competitive factor. It doesn't mean we have to be exactly there, but we have to be within the area code to make sure that, that's appropriate. We weigh all of those and we come up with an ask. I will say if the retention of that is not generating ROEs that we think, if it's supporting risk-weighted asset growth that is not generating the 10% to 15% ROEs, we will revisit that in our next submission."

If you look at -- we do provide the assets under custody in certain regions. That can give you some indication of the relative importance in size in the marketplace. If I could ask -- answer a little bit more the question around Brexit and its impact, I should start by saying that the good news is, is the team was ready and executed very well on the immediate impacts of Brexit, which was most important for our clients in that it was relatively seamless and the client was largely unimpacted by that. Well, a lot of volatility was going on. In terms of impact to us, I think it's very early to make a comment on what that would be as we're still watching the situation unfold. But I think it is important to highlight exactly our business mix in Europe. We are largely a C&IS institution, corporate and institutional businesses in EMEA. We have a small wealth business, but largely it's corporate and institutional business that does both administration for pensions and also asset managers. The important characteristics there, particularly for the fund administration, is -- or excuse me, for all the custody and asset servicing is the right to do that across Europe. Our banking entity is based in the U.K. today. So if that passport doesn't get negotiated as potentially could happen, we have to look at where we can also conduct businesses. We have large fund administration businesses in Ireland and Luxembourg, which we think there or others, could -- we could leverage to redomicile or domicile a bank to allow us to conduct our business.

We negotiated a mutually agreed change to that, where we gave up the right to call back based on our understanding of the relationship at the time, and they gave something back as well. And when you gave that -- when we gave up that ability to call back, we were able to write the asset off and then obviously have the depreciation benefit in future run rates.

In both of our primary businesses, we continue to see strong new business and wins in both wealth and in C&IS. And so I would say organic growth rates in both businesses continues to be high. We don't publish that. But it's at or near normal levels that we've seen, or if not, slightly higher than that and that the pipeline remained strong. So on the fee growth side organically, we feel it remained strong. If you look at the actual fee growth that you're reconciling, there are some headwinds in there. There was some currency negativity in the comparison, particularly for the C&IS business. So it was hurt by the stronger dollar. That was one factor. And in the C&IS business, there can also be some lumpiness to that as the wins tend to be very large. But we feel very good about the pipeline and the growth rate. On the wealth side, the new business flows -- and in fact, in the second quarter, we're very strong, very robust. But they do still have the issues that we've talked about on previous calls, which are around fee compression as we have seen, for instance, the migration from, say, active to passive, particularly true in the Wealth Management business. So that has created fee compression, which is somewhat offset by growth in new business. So across both, we still feel pretty good about our growth rates in those businesses. And I think particular this quarter, if we looked at it, even excluding the benefit of fee waivers, Wealth Management across its regions still had mid to high single-digit growth rates, which I think is pretty good, particularly relative to the industry."

Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $261",4030,"Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.
Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $261 million. Earnings per share were $1.09 and our return on common equity was 12.2%. As outlined in our press release, our results for the second quarter included 5 items, which I would like to highlight for you today.
First, we recorded a pretax gain of $118.2 million on the sale of $1.1 million Class B Visa shares net of swap expense. This gain is reflected on our income statement in the Other Operating Income line. The sale reduces our ownership position in Visa Class B shares to 4.13 million shares as of the end of the second quarter. 
At the current conversion rate, that is equivalent up to 6.81 [ph] million Class A shares of Visa. These shares are recorded on our balance sheet at their original cost basis of 0. The $118.2 million net gain included $5 million in costs relating to the mark-to-market of the swap on last year's sale of 1 million Class B shares.
Second, we recorded a $46.5 million charge in connection with an agreement, subject to court approval, to certain long-standing securities lending litigation. This charge is reflected within the other operating expense line of our income statement. The charge covers settlements and cases related to client losses from the 2008 financial crisis. With this agreement, we are pleased to have resolved the most significant litigation against Northern Trust related to the financial crisis. 
Third, we recognized 21.6 million in losses associated with our loan and lease portfolio. This included $14.1 million in impairment charges and the loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio as well as a $7.5 million impairment charge related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars. Of these $21.6 million in losses, $18.9 million is reflected on the other Operating Income line while the remaining $2.7 million reflected within net interest income.
Fourth, we recorded an $18.6 million charge relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS asset servicing clients. The impact of this charge is reflected on the other operating expense line on our income statement. Lastly, we recorded $17.5 million in expense related to severance and personnel-related charges. I will discuss both of these last 2 items in further detail later in the call when we review our expenses for the quarter.
In excluding these 5 items, second quarter net income was $253 million, earnings per share were $1.06 and our return on common equity was 11.7%. Recall that our results in the second quarter of 2015 included a pretax gain of $99.9 million relating to the sale of 1 million Class B Visa shares, voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar, net asset value funds of $45.8 million and the impairment of the residual value of certain aircraft lease agreements of $17.8 million.
A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the second quarter. Equity markets have been mixed during 2016. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 1.7% year-over-year and up 1.9%, sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE index was down 12.7% year-over-year and down 2.6%, sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and first quarter markets were generally lower.
In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was higher for both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons. Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 10.5% higher than the second quarter of last year and 5% higher, sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were down in the second quarter. As measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 9% to 13% year-over-year and down 9% to 12%, sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income.
Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, particularly in the year-over-year comparison, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth. U.S. short-term interest rates were higher compared to last year following the Federal Reserve rate increase in December but flat sequentially. 3-month LIBOR and the Fed funds effective rate averaged 64 and 37 basis points, respectively. The overnight repo rate was also higher compared to last year, but flat sequentially, averaging 45 basis points in the quarter.
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. My comments are on the adjusted basis, which excludes the prior year and current quarter items I mentioned in my opening comments. Year-over-year, revenue increased 4% with noninterest income up 1% and net interest income up 12%. Expenses also increased 4%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million, reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Net income was 2% higher year-over-year.
In the sequential comparison. Revenue increased 3% while noninterest income was up 4% and net interest income down 2%. Expenses increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 5% higher, sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.7% for the quarter, down slightly from 1 year ago, but up from 11.4% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of 6.4 trillion increased 3% compared to 1 year ago and 2% on a sequential basis. In both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar.
Assets under management were $906 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Lower equity assets were the primary driver due to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and weaker global equity markets. In addition, fixed income assets were lower, primarily due to the loss of 1 passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned during our third quarter call. Assets under management increased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by higher fixed income and equity balances, partially offset by lower cash balances.
Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.3 billion. Adjusted for the items I mentioned in my opening, revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, up 4% from last year and up 3%, sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $777 million in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year and up 4% for the prior quarter.
Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver this quarter. Fee waivers were essentially 0 in the second quarter compared to $28 million 1 year ago and $8 million in the first quarter. I'll go into further detail in trust and investment fees shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was $64 million in the second quarter, down 14% year-over-year and up 6%, sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline while the sequential improvement mainly reflects higher volatility. Other noninterest income was $76 million in the second quarter, up 4% from last year and up 4%, sequentially.
The current quarter's results include $2.6 million in revenue associated with the Aviate acquisition, which closed on May 1. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by other operating income, partially offset by a net investment security loss of $2 million in the current quarter due to an other than temporary impairment of certain Community Reinvestment Act eligible securities. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher securities commission and trading income, primarily due to the Aviate acquisition and higher other operating income partially offset by the investment security loss.
Please note that as referred to in our call last quarter, the first quarter results included a net gain of $2.3 million related to our decision to exit a portion of a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio. The primary driver of the remaining sequential increase and other operating income was higher income associated with the supplemental compensation plans that have an associated expense within other operating expense. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $309 million in the second quarter, increasing 12% year-over-year and down 2%, sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $447 million in the second quarter, up 3% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $293 million, unchanged from 1 year ago and up 2%, sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.8 trillion at quarter end, up 3% year-over-year and up 2%, sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets. Recall that lagged market value factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS, custody and funded administration fees. Unfavorable currency translation impacted the year-over-year comparison.
Investment management fees and C&IS of $94 million in the second quarter were up 17% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were essentially 0 during the second quarter, lower by $14 million year-over-year and $2 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. Beyond fee waivers, the favorable impact of new business was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $672 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier and flat, sequentially.
Securities lending fees were $27 million in the second quarter, flat with the prior year and 18% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. The sequential performance primarily reflects the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spreads. Securities lending collateral was $108 billion at the quarter end and averaged $117 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 7% year-over-year and were up 2%, sequentially.
The decline in loan volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. This asset class has been most impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage in the securities lending business. Other fees in C&IS were $33 million in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment, risk and analytical services and other ancillary services. In the sequential quarter comparison, other fees were down 8%, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payments business.
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $330 million in the second quarter, up 2% year-over-year and 5%, sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance with fees increasing 14% year-over-year and 6% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and new business. Performance in the regions was lower on a year-over-year basis as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets and lower fees on equity mutual funds. On a sequential basis, fees within the regions benefited from lower money market fee waivers and favorable lagged markets.
Money market mutual fund fee waivers and wealth management were essentially 0 in the current quarter, down $14 million year-over-year and $6 million, sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates on the gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $234 billion at quarter end, up 1% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially.
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $307 million in the second quarter, up 19% year-over-year and down 2% compared to the fourth -- first quarter. $2.7 million of the $7.5 million impairment on certain aircraft and railcars from my opening comments was included in this quarter's net interest income. Also, recall that the prior year's results included a $17.8 million lease impairment. Excluding these 2 items, net interest income was up 12% compared to 1 year ago, driven by a higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. 
Earning assets averaged $107 billion in the second quarter, up 3% versus last year, driven by a higher level of deposits. Demand deposits, which averaged $27 billion, increased 5% year-over-year and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $50 billion were up 2% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth again as loan balances averaged $34 billion in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the previously mentioned $2.7 million impairment, net interest income declined 2%, primarily driven by a lower net interest margin as average earning assets were up 2%, sequentially. 
When adjusted for the impairment, net interest margin was 1.17% in the second quarter, up 11 basis points year-over-year and down 4 basis points, sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the Fed's move in December. In the sequential quarter comparison, the lower margin was driven by higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization was $20 million in the second quarter, up from $6 million in the first quarter.
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $925 million in the second quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 12%, sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded 3 expense-related charges in the quarter. First, as described in my opening remarks, we recorded a $46.5 million charge in connection with an agreement to settle certain securities lending litigation. This charge is reflected within the other operating expense line. Second, an $18.6 million charge related to contractual modifications associated with the existing C&IS asset of servicing clients. These were previously incurred implementation costs that were being deferred over the life of the client contracts.
As a result of the contractual modifications, these costs are no longer considered recoverable and have been brought forward into the current period. The expense associated with this charge would have been amortized into expense over the next 2 to 3 years. This $18.6 million charge is reflected in other operating expense. Third, we recorded a charge of $17.5 million related to severance and other personnel-related costs. Of that $15.2 million relates to severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 150 positions. As outlined in our earnings release, $13 million of that charge appears in the compensation line, $1.5 million in employee benefit expense and $0.7 million in outside service expense.
Our actions taken this quarter reflect the continued focus on improving profitability and returns, and we expect the charges to produce annual ongoing savings of approximately $15 million once fully implemented. The remaining $2.3 million of personnel-related charges reflected in other operating expense. Recall that 1 year ago, other operating expense included a $45.8 million charge associated with our voluntary cash contributions to 4 constant dollar DAF funds. Adjusting for these second quarter items, both in this year and last, expenses were 4% higher year-over-year and 2% higher, sequentially.
It is also worth noting that the current quarter -- now it is also worth noting that the current quarter included $3.4 million of expense associated with our acquisition of the Aviate business, which closed on May 1. 
Now let's go through the remaining components of expense. My comments going forward will exclude the 3 current year charges totaling $82.6 million and last year's charge of 45.8 [ph] million. Compensation expense of $377 million increased 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with approximately 60% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in India, Manila and Limerick.
On a sequential basis, compensation expense declined 1% as the impact of staff growth and higher current year cash-based incentive accruals was more than offset by the decline in stock-based incentives due to the first quarter, including the impact of options granted to retirement-eligible employees and the immediate vesting of certain restricted stocks units awarded during the quarter. Employee benefit expense of $71 million was down 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pension expense.
On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was flat as higher medical costs were offset by lower payroll taxes. Outside service expense of $158 million was 8% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements.
On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense increased 6%, primarily reflecting higher consulting and sub-custodian expense. Equipment software expense of $118 million was up 3% both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives.
Occupancy expense of $45 million was up 5% year-over-year and 11%, sequentially. The increases primarily reflected higher rent expense with the sequential comparison also impacted by a lease adjustment reflected in the prior quarter. Other operating expense of $74 million increased 7% year-over-year, primarily related to higher costs associated with account servicing activities, higher supplemental compensation plan expense and increased FDIC costs, partially offset by lower costs associated with the timing of charitable contributions.
Sequentially, other operating expense declined 1% due to lower business promotion expense as the Northern Trust Open was during the first quarter, offset by increases in various other costs including higher supplemental compensation plan expense and higher staff-related expense. It is worth noting that as mentioned, when I reviewed our operating income, the increase in supplemental compensation plan expense has an associated increase in revenue.
Our loan loss provision was a credit of $3 million in the second quarter. This compares to a provision expense of $2 million in the prior quarter and a credit of $10 million in the prior year. The credit in the current quarter was driven by improved credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio and a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio. Loan quality remains very strong with nonperforming assets of $166 million at quarter end, down 5% versus the prior quarter and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 44 basis points at quarter end. The effective income tax rate in the quarter was 33.9%. 
Turning to Page 8. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense-to-fee ratio pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust in investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it has -- was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today, is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity.
As you can see on this page, after adjusting for the items noted in my opening comments, we have been able to continue our trend of improving this ratio. This metric remains an important parameter of our progress, and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward, through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and drive productivity within our expense base by our ongoing initiatives focused on location strategy, preparement and technology.
Turning to Page 9. Our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.5% and 10.6%, respectively calculated on the transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.3% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 10.4%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirements of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer.
The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.1% and at the bank was 5.8%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018.
With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.
As we announced in June, our 2016 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve. In it, we requested authorities increase our quarterly common dividend to $0.38 per share and the repurchase up to 275 million of common stock through June 2017. In the second quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $141 million. Yesterday, our Board of Directors formally approved the planned dividend increase, which will be payable on October 1.
When we consider our strategy for capital actions, we take into consideration the level of retained capital to facilitate our continued growth, our level of capital to absorb significant stress scenarios and to enable us to continue to hold top-tier credit ratings. We also look at our capital levels and structure compared to our peers as our clients entrust us with the safekeeping of their assets. It is important for us to demonstrate competitive capital strength.
Our growth as measured by assets, earning assets and risk-weighted assets has grown at a rate about double that of our common equity since 2012, and we expect to remain focused on growth. We will continue to evaluate our capital structure as it relates to regulatory requirements and look to optimize the cost of our capital for the firm not only in the short-term, but importantly, over the long-term as well.
In closing, the second quarter of 2016 was characterized by continued market volatility, low and even negative interest rates around the globe and geopolitical uncertainty highlighted by the Brexit vote. Despite that challenging backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing our earnings per share 5% both year-over-year and sequentially adjusting for the items noted at the beginning of our prepared remarks. Our adjusted return on common equity was 11.7%, improving 30 basis points, sequentially.
We also achieved sequential operating leverage of 1 point as we continue to strive to produce even greater operating efficiency. We also returned $230 million to our shareholders while retaining enough capital to fund our growth and maintain quality credit ratings. In the quarter, we were also pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve for our 2016 capital plan submission.
Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 5% year-over-year, grew fees 5%, sequentially and produced a 38.2% pretax margin. All of this was accomplished against a challenging economic backdrop. C&IS continued to grow as well. In the second quarter, we had good success in growing our business organically with such wins as Ariel investment and RECM Global Fund Limited and Currency. We also formally closed our Aviate transaction, allowing us to expand our brokerage capabilities into EMEA and APAC.
I would also like to mention that our team handled the Brexit situation effectively as they enacted their contingency plans in light of the leave vote. Our efforts around Brexit remain focused first and foremost, on our clients' needs, and we're communicating frequently as the situation clarifies. 
Lastly, Northern Trust has been named as a recipient of the 2016 CIO 100, an annual award program recognizing organizations around the world that exemplify the highest level of operational and strategic excellence in information technology. Technological solutions remain a vital part of our value proposition to our clients and this external validation of our efforts was an important indicator of the value of our investment.
Thank you, again for participating in Northern Trust's second quarter earnings conference call, today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your question. Derek, please open the line."

When we consider sort of the outlook for premium amortization, we consider the drivers in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. And there are several as you cited. First is our expectations around the rate environment. The second is obviously the pace at which refinances happen. And we model all of that in and there is also third, a seasonality to it. If you look historically at our prepayment amortization, it tends to be at its highest in the second and third quarters with some relief in the fourth and first, absent any unique rate environment that we're in. So we factor all of that in. And we've seen that play out over previous cycles. This was larger than we've seen historically, and I think it's probably driven by the rate of refinancing in the markets. The last element in the premium amortization is the characteristics of the portfolio we're invested in ourselves, how much time is left to maturity and what is the underlying construct of the portfolio's we're invested in. So when we weigh all of those out, we do tend to see a tick-up in second and third quarters seasonality, normally and then lower in the fourth and first quarters. Again, though the rate movements can also impact that as well. The second part was -- of your question was around deposits betas, I believe, with a second rate hike. When and if a second rate hike occurs, obviously the first rate hike produced close to a 0 deposit beta is not -- much was passed on in that. We think even in the second deposit beta, while observing it for the first time that we would continue to see that sharing while it would move up, still be relatively favorable for financial institutions and us as well."

And do we really have the right level of capital to facilitate that growth. We've had 3 consecutive years of very high payout, as you know. An example would be our balance sheet has grown almost twice the growth in our common equity over the last 3 years. And additionally, if you look from 2013 to now, our assets are up almost at a CAGR of 5.6% and our common equity is only up 2.7%. So we look at sort of the ratio or the relationship between the growth that we want in our plans and the capital we need to retain to fund that growth. The second issue we look at is how does our business perform under stress and do we have enough capital to deal with, whether it's a Fed-mandated stress scenario or our own idiosyncratic, and we look at the proper level of capital to absorb that. Third is credit ratings. As you see at a 10.6% common equity Tier 1 standardized ratio, we're mid-table, maybe even slightly below on a point time. So we're not at the top, but we worry about what that would mean from a credit ratings. We want and need to maintain high credit ratings. And then third is -- or fourth is around our clients. In the marketplace, our clients do evaluate what our capital levels look like vis-à-vis others. And they can use things like the ratios that we're talking about now to measure that. And so being in the vicinity of our close-in competitors, we think, is a competitive factor. It doesn't mean we have to be exactly there, but we have to be within the area code to make sure that, that's appropriate. We weigh all of those and we come up with an ask. I will say if the retention of that is not generating ROEs that we think, if it's supporting risk-weighted asset growth that is not generating the 10% to 15% ROEs, we will revisit that in our next submission."

If you look at -- we do provide the assets under custody in certain regions. That can give you some indication of the relative importance in size in the marketplace. If I could ask -- answer a little bit more the question around Brexit and its impact, I should start by saying that the good news is, is the team was ready and executed very well on the immediate impacts of Brexit, which was most important for our clients in that it was relatively seamless and the client was largely unimpacted by that while a lot of volatility was going on. In terms of impact to us, I think it's very early to make a comment on what that would be as we're still watching the situation unfold. But I think it is important to highlight exactly our business mix in Europe. We are largely a C&IS institution, corporate and institutional businesses in EMEA. We have a small wealth business, but largely it's corporate and institutional business that does both administration for pensions and also asset managers. The important characteristics there, particularly for the fund administration, is -- or excuse me, for all the custody and asset servicing is the right to do that across Europe. Our banking entity is based in the U.K. today. So if that passport doesn't get negotiated as potentially could happen, we have to look at where we can also conduct businesses. We have large fund administration businesses in Ireland and Luxembourg, which we think there or others, could -- we could leverage to redomicile or domicile a bank to allow us to conduct our business.

We negotiated a mutually agreed change to that, where we gave up the right to call back based on our understanding of the relationship at the time, and they gave something back as well. And when you gave that -- when we gave up that ability to call back, we were able to write the asset off and then obviously have the depreciation benefit in future run rates.

In both of our primary businesses, we continue to see strong new business and wins in both wealth and in C&IS. And so I would say organic growth rates in both businesses continues to be high. We don't publish that. But it's at or near normal levels that we've seen, or if not, slightly higher than that and that the pipeline remained strong. So on the fee growth side organically, we feel it remained strong. If you look at the actual fee growth that you're reconciling, there are some headwinds in there. There was some currency negativity in the comparison, particularly for the C&IS business. So it was hurt by the stronger dollar. That was one factor. And in the C&IS business, there can also be some lumpiness to that as the wins tend to be very large. But we feel very good about the pipeline and the growth rate. On the wealth side, the new business flows -- and in fact, in the second quarter, we're very strong, very robust. But they do still have the issues that we've talked about on previous calls, which are around fee compression as we have seen, for instance, the migration from, say, active to passive, particularly true in the Wealth Management business. So that has created fee compression, which is somewhat offset by growth in new business. So across both, we still feel pretty good about our growth rates in those businesses. And I think particular this quarter, if we looked at it, even excluding the benefit of fee waivers, Wealth Management across its regions still had mid to high single-digit growth rates, which I think is pretty good, particularly relative to the industry."

It's subcustodian expense, third-party adviser fees. It's brokerage clearing. It's really tied to revenue. About half is, I would say, directly or indirectly tied as well, things like market data that we have to pay to other vendors. Some of our offshoring work that has -- that's volume-driven, et cetera, is tied to market levels and revenue performance. And then that's about 80%. About 20% then gets down to what I would say more discretionary spend in that line item. That's things like consulting that you've highlighted, where perhaps it can move and ramp if we need to take on special initiatives around regulatory environment or if Jenna Shrewd, our Chief Operating Officer, has programs of work around digitization or improvement to lower future run rate, we can, from time-to-time, see that move. I will say that if you take just the consulting spend portion of that, the rate has actually slowed from the second half of last year. I know you see this number spike. It has slowed. It meaningfully went up in the second half of last year as we ramped up for CCAR and other regulatory. We have seen that start to slow in this quarter, but it's still at elevated levels versus year-on-year. And there is also in there some expense associated with the severance that I talked about and some expense in there that's associated with Aviate, our acquisition. So when you pull all of those down, the growth rate was more modest in the absolute year-on-year or sequential comparison."

We saw that trend reverse in our Wealth Management business in the first quarter, where we actually saw risk being put on the table, at least certainly early in the quarter, where we saw our cash balances actually coming down and we saw increases, particularly in our case in fixed income. But I think we saw some risk on in the quarter. So interesting. On the C&IS side, our flows tend to be more passive mandates, so S&P 500 and other types, that's not our only, but they -- our biggest flows tend to be there. And we've seen those move around from time-to-time, particularly as we cited in certain large sovereign wealth pools, they've actually had to monetize some of those index mandates to deal with local requirements, if you will, in their regions. I think we saw that slow a bit in the second quarter perhaps as the price of oil or other factors stabilized to some degree. So we saw that pace slow. But I think that's the color I would say around where we saw flows in the quarter."

Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $261",4030,"Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.
Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $261 million. Earnings per share were $1.09 and our return on common equity was 12.2%. As outlined in our press release, our results for the second quarter included 5 items, which I would like to highlight for you today.
First, we recorded a pretax gain of $118.2 million on the sale of $1.1 million Class B Visa shares net of swap expense. This gain is reflected on our income statement in the Other Operating Income line. The sale reduces our ownership position in Visa Class B shares to 4.13 million shares as of the end of the second quarter. 
At the current conversion rate, that is equivalent up to 6.81 [ph] million Class A shares of Visa. These shares are recorded on our balance sheet at their original cost basis of 0. The $118.2 million net gain included $5 million in costs relating to the mark-to-market of the swap on last year's sale of 1 million Class B shares.
Second, we recorded a $46.5 million charge in connection with an agreement, subject to court approval, to certain long-standing securities lending litigation. This charge is reflected within the other operating expense line of our income statement. The charge covers settlements and cases related to client losses from the 2008 financial crisis. With this agreement, we are pleased to have resolved the most significant litigation against Northern Trust related to the financial crisis. 
Third, we recognized 21.6 million in losses associated with our loan and lease portfolio. This included $14.1 million in impairment charges and the loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio as well as a $7.5 million impairment charge related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars. Of these $21.6 million in losses, $18.9 million is reflected on the other Operating Income line while the remaining $2.7 million reflected within net interest income.
Fourth, we recorded an $18.6 million charge relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS asset servicing clients. The impact of this charge is reflected on the other operating expense line on our income statement. Lastly, we recorded $17.5 million in expense related to severance and personnel-related charges. I will discuss both of these last 2 items in further detail later in the call when we review our expenses for the quarter.
In excluding these 5 items, second quarter net income was $253 million, earnings per share were $1.06 and our return on common equity was 11.7%. Recall that our results in the second quarter of 2015 included a pretax gain of $99.9 million relating to the sale of 1 million Class B Visa shares, voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar, net asset value funds of $45.8 million and the impairment of the residual value of certain aircraft lease agreements of $17.8 million.
A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the second quarter. Equity markets have been mixed during 2016. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 1.7% year-over-year and up 1.9%, sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE index was down 12.7% year-over-year and down 2.6%, sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and first quarter markets were generally lower.
In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was higher for both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons. Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 10.5% higher than the second quarter of last year and 5% higher, sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were down in the second quarter. As measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 9% to 13% year-over-year and down 9% to 12%, sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income.
Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, particularly in the year-over-year comparison, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth. U.S. short-term interest rates were higher compared to last year following the Federal Reserve rate increase in December but flat sequentially. 3-month LIBOR and the Fed funds effective rate averaged 64 and 37 basis points, respectively. The overnight repo rate was also higher compared to last year, but flat sequentially, averaging 45 basis points in the quarter.
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. My comments are on the adjusted basis, which excludes the prior year and current quarter items I mentioned in my opening comments. Year-over-year, revenue increased 4% with noninterest income up 1% and net interest income up 12%. Expenses also increased 4%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million, reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Net income was 2% higher year-over-year.
In the sequential comparison. Revenue increased 3% while noninterest income was up 4% and net interest income down 2%. Expenses increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 5% higher, sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.7% for the quarter, down slightly from 1 year ago, but up from 11.4% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of 6.4 trillion increased 3% compared to 1 year ago and 2% on a sequential basis. In both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar.
Assets under management were $906 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Lower equity assets were the primary driver due to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and weaker global equity markets. In addition, fixed income assets were lower, primarily due to the loss of 1 passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned during our third quarter call. Assets under management increased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by higher fixed income and equity balances, partially offset by lower cash balances.
Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.3 billion. Adjusted for the items I mentioned in my opening, revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, up 4% from last year and up 3%, sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $777 million in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year and up 4% for the prior quarter.
Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver this quarter. Fee waivers were essentially 0 in the second quarter compared to $28 million 1 year ago and $8 million in the first quarter. I'll go into further detail in trust and investment fees shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was $64 million in the second quarter, down 14% year-over-year and up 6%, sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline while the sequential improvement mainly reflects higher volatility. Other noninterest income was $76 million in the second quarter, up 4% from last year and up 4%, sequentially.
The current quarter's results include $2.6 million in revenue associated with the Aviate acquisition, which closed on May 1. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by other operating income, partially offset by a net investment security loss of $2 million in the current quarter due to an other than temporary impairment of certain Community Reinvestment Act eligible securities. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher securities commission and trading income, primarily due to the Aviate acquisition and higher other operating income partially offset by the investment security loss.
Please note that as referred to in our call last quarter, the first quarter results included a net gain of $2.3 million related to our decision to exit a portion of a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio. The primary driver of the remaining sequential increase and other operating income was higher income associated with the supplemental compensation plans that have an associated expense within other operating expense. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $309 million in the second quarter, increasing 12% year-over-year and down 2%, sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $447 million in the second quarter, up 3% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $293 million, unchanged from 1 year ago and up 2%, sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.8 trillion at quarter end, up 3% year-over-year and up 2%, sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets. Recall that lagged market value factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS, custody and funded administration fees. Unfavorable currency translation impacted the year-over-year comparison.
Investment management fees and C&IS of $94 million in the second quarter were up 17% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were essentially 0 during the second quarter, lower by $14 million year-over-year and $2 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. Beyond fee waivers, the favorable impact of new business was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $672 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier and flat, sequentially.
Securities lending fees were $27 million in the second quarter, flat with the prior year and 18% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. The sequential performance primarily reflects the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spreads. Securities lending collateral was $108 billion at the quarter end and averaged $117 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 7% year-over-year and were up 2%, sequentially.
The decline in loan volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. This asset class has been most impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage in the securities lending business. Other fees in C&IS were $33 million in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment, risk and analytical services and other ancillary services. In the sequential quarter comparison, other fees were down 8%, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payments business.
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $330 million in the second quarter, up 2% year-over-year and 5%, sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance with fees increasing 14% year-over-year and 6% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and new business. Performance in the regions was lower on a year-over-year basis as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets and lower fees on equity mutual funds. On a sequential basis, fees within the regions benefited from lower money market fee waivers and favorable lagged markets.
Money market mutual fund fee waivers and wealth management were essentially 0 in the current quarter, down $14 million year-over-year and $6 million, sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates on the gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $234 billion at quarter end, up 1% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially.
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $307 million in the second quarter, up 19% year-over-year and down 2% compared to the fourth -- first quarter. $2.7 million of the $7.5 million impairment on certain aircraft and railcars from my opening comments was included in this quarter's net interest income. Also, recall that the prior year's results included a $17.8 million lease impairment. Excluding these 2 items, net interest income was up 12% compared to 1 year ago, driven by a higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. 
Earning assets averaged $107 billion in the second quarter, up 3% versus last year, driven by a higher level of deposits. Demand deposits, which averaged $27 billion, increased 5% year-over-year and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $50 billion were up 2% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth again as loan balances averaged $34 billion in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the previously mentioned $2.7 million impairment, net interest income declined 2%, primarily driven by a lower net interest margin as average earning assets were up 2%, sequentially. 
When adjusted for the impairment, net interest margin was 1.17% in the second quarter, up 11 basis points year-over-year and down 4 basis points, sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the Fed's move in December. In the sequential quarter comparison, the lower margin was driven by higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization was $20 million in the second quarter, up from $6 million in the first quarter.
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $925 million in the second quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 12%, sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded 3 expense-related charges in the quarter. First, as described in my opening remarks, we recorded a $46.5 million charge in connection with an agreement to settle certain securities lending litigation. This charge is reflected within the other operating expense line. Second, an $18.6 million charge related to contractual modifications associated with the existing C&IS asset of servicing clients. These were previously incurred implementation costs that were being deferred over the life of the client contracts.
As a result of the contractual modifications, these costs are no longer considered recoverable and have been brought forward into the current period. The expense associated with this charge would have been amortized into expense over the next 2 to 3 years. This $18.6 million charge is reflected in other operating expense. Third, we recorded a charge of $17.5 million related to severance and other personnel-related costs. Of that $15.2 million relates to severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 150 positions. As outlined in our earnings release, $13 million of that charge appears in the compensation line, $1.5 million in employee benefit expense and $0.7 million in outside service expense.
Our actions taken this quarter reflect the continued focus on improving profitability and returns, and we expect the charges to produce annual ongoing savings of approximately $15 million once fully implemented. The remaining $2.3 million of personnel-related charges reflected in other operating expense. Recall that 1 year ago, other operating expense included a $45.8 million charge associated with our voluntary cash contributions to 4 constant dollar DAF funds. Adjusting for these second quarter items, both in this year and last, expenses were 4% higher year-over-year and 2% higher, sequentially.
It is also worth noting that the current quarter -- now it is also worth noting that the current quarter included $3.4 million of expense associated with our acquisition of the Aviate business, which closed on May 1. 
Now let's go through the remaining components of expense. My comments going forward will exclude the 3 current year charges totaling $82.6 million and last year's charge of 45.8 [ph] million. Compensation expense of $377 million increased 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with approximately 60% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in India, Manila and Limerick.
On a sequential basis, compensation expense declined 1% as the impact of staff growth and higher current year cash-based incentive accruals was more than offset by the decline in stock-based incentives due to the first quarter, including the impact of options granted to retirement-eligible employees and the immediate vesting of certain restricted stocks units awarded during the quarter. Employee benefit expense of $71 million was down 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pension expense.
On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was flat as higher medical costs were offset by lower payroll taxes. Outside service expense of $158 million was 8% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements.
On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense increased 6%, primarily reflecting higher consulting and sub-custodian expense. Equipment software expense of $118 million was up 3% both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives.
Occupancy expense of $45 million was up 5% year-over-year and 11%, sequentially. The increases primarily reflected higher rent expense with the sequential comparison also impacted by a lease adjustment reflected in the prior quarter. Other operating expense of $74 million increased 7% year-over-year, primarily related to higher costs associated with account servicing activities, higher supplemental compensation plan expense and increased FDIC costs, partially offset by lower costs associated with the timing of charitable contributions.
Sequentially, other operating expense declined 1% due to lower business promotion expense as the Northern Trust Open was during the first quarter, offset by increases in various other costs including higher supplemental compensation plan expense and higher staff-related expense. It is worth noting that as mentioned, when I reviewed our operating income, the increase in supplemental compensation plan expense has an associated increase in revenue.
Our loan loss provision was a credit of $3 million in the second quarter. This compares to a provision expense of $2 million in the prior quarter and a credit of $10 million in the prior year. The credit in the current quarter was driven by improved credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio and a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio. Loan quality remains very strong with nonperforming assets of $166 million at quarter end, down 5% versus the prior quarter and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 44 basis points at quarter end. The effective income tax rate in the quarter was 33.9%. 
Turning to Page 8. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense-to-fee ratio pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust in investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it has -- was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today, is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity.
As you can see on this page, after adjusting for the items noted in my opening comments, we have been able to continue our trend of improving this ratio. This metric remains an important parameter of our progress, and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward, through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and drive productivity within our expense base by our ongoing initiatives focused on location strategy, preparement and technology.
Turning to Page 9. Our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.5% and 10.6%, respectively calculated on the transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.3% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 10.4%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirements of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer.
The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.1% and at the bank was 5.8%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018.
With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.
As we announced in June, our 2016 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve. In it, we requested authorities increase our quarterly common dividend to $0.38 per share and the repurchase up to 275 million of common stock through June 2017. In the second quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $141 million. Yesterday, our Board of Directors formally approved the planned dividend increase, which will be payable on October 1.
When we consider our strategy for capital actions, we take into consideration the level of retained capital to facilitate our continued growth, our level of capital to absorb significant stress scenarios and to enable us to continue to hold top-tier credit ratings. We also look at our capital levels and structure compared to our peers as our clients entrust us with the safekeeping of their assets. It is important for us to demonstrate competitive capital strength.
Our growth as measured by assets, earning assets and risk-weighted assets has grown at a rate about double that of our common equity since 2012, and we expect to remain focused on growth. We will continue to evaluate our capital structure as it relates to regulatory requirements and look to optimize the cost of our capital for the firm not only in the short-term, but importantly, over the long-term as well.
In closing, the second quarter of 2016 was characterized by continued market volatility, low and even negative interest rates around the globe and geopolitical uncertainty highlighted by the Brexit vote. Despite that challenging backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing our earnings per share 5% both year-over-year and sequentially adjusting for the items noted at the beginning of our prepared remarks. Our adjusted return on common equity was 11.7%, improving 30 basis points, sequentially.
We also achieved sequential operating leverage of 1 point as we continue to strive to produce even greater operating efficiency. We also returned $230 million to our shareholders while retaining enough capital to fund our growth and maintain quality credit ratings. In the quarter, we were also pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve for our 2016 capital plan submission.
Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 5% year-over-year, grew fees 5%, sequentially and produced a 38.2% pretax margin. All of this was accomplished against a challenging economic backdrop. C&IS continued to grow as well. In the second quarter, we had good success in growing our business organically with such wins as Ariel investment and RECM Global Fund Limited and Currency. We also formally closed our Aviate transaction, allowing us to expand our brokerage capabilities into EMEA and APAC.
I would also like to mention that our team handled the Brexit situation effectively as they enacted their contingency plans in light of the leave vote. Our efforts around Brexit remain focused first and foremost, on our clients' needs, and we're communicating frequently as the situation clarifies. 
Lastly, Northern Trust has been named as a recipient of the 2016 CIO 100, an annual award program recognizing organizations around the world that exemplify the highest level of operational and strategic excellence in information technology. Technological solutions remain a vital part of our value proposition to our clients and this external validation of our efforts was an important indicator of the value of our investment.
Thank you, again for participating in Northern Trust's second quarter earnings conference call, today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your question. Derek, please open the line."

When we consider sort of the outlook for premium amortization, we consider the drivers in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. And there are several as you cited. First is our expectations around the rate environment. The second is obviously the pace at which refinances happen. And we model all of that in and there is also third, a seasonality to it. If you look historically at our prepayment amortization, it tends to be at its highest in the second and third quarters with some relief in the fourth and first, absent any unique rate environment that we're in. So we factor all of that in. And we've seen that play out over previous cycles. This was larger than we've seen historically, and I think it's probably driven by the rate of refinancing in the markets. The last element in the premium amortization is the characteristics of the portfolio we're invested in ourselves, how much time is left to maturity and what is the underlying construct of the portfolio's we're invested in. So when we weigh all of those out, we do tend to see a tick-up in second and third quarters seasonality, normally and then lower in the fourth and first quarters. Again, though the rate movements can also impact that as well. The second part was -- of your question was around deposits betas, I believe, with a second rate hike. When and if a second rate hike occurs, obviously the first rate hike produced close to a 0 deposit beta is not -- much was passed on in that. We think even in the second deposit beta, while observing it for the first time that we would continue to see that sharing while it would move up, still be relatively favorable for financial institutions and us as well."

And do we really have the right level of capital to facilitate that growth. We've had 3 consecutive years of very high payout, as you know. An example would be our balance sheet has grown almost twice the growth in our common equity over the last 3 years. And additionally, if you look from 2013 to now, our assets are up almost at a CAGR of 5.6% and our common equity is only up 2.7%. So we look at sort of the ratio or the relationship between the growth that we want in our plans and the capital we need to retain to fund that growth. The second issue we look at is how does our business perform under stress and do we have enough capital to deal with, whether it's a Fed-mandated stress scenario or our own idiosyncratic, and we look at the proper level of capital to absorb that. Third is credit ratings. As you see at a 10.6% common equity Tier 1 standardized ratio, we're mid-table, maybe even slightly below on a point time. So we're not at the top, but we worry about what that would mean from a credit ratings. We want and need to maintain high credit ratings. And then third is -- or fourth is around our clients. In the marketplace, our clients do evaluate what our capital levels look like vis-à-vis others. And they can use things like the ratios that we're talking about now to measure that. And so being in the vicinity of our close-in competitors, we think, is a competitive factor. It doesn't mean we have to be exactly there, but we have to be within the area code to make sure that, that's appropriate. We weigh all of those and we come up with an ask. I will say if the retention of that is not generating ROEs that we think, if it's supporting risk-weighted asset growth that is not generating the 10% to 15% ROEs, we will revisit that in our next submission."

If you look at -- we do provide the assets under custody in certain regions. That can give you some indication of the relative importance in size in the marketplace. If I could ask -- answer a little bit more the question around Brexit and its impact, I should start by saying that the good news is, is the team was ready and executed very well on the immediate impacts of Brexit, which was most important for our clients in that it was relatively seamless and the client was largely unimpacted by that while a lot of volatility was going on. In terms of impact to us, I think it's very early to make a comment on what that would be as we're still watching the situation unfold. But I think it is important to highlight exactly our business mix in Europe. We are largely a C&IS institution, corporate and institutional businesses in EMEA. We have a small wealth business, but largely it's corporate and institutional business that does both administration for pensions and also asset managers. The important characteristics there, particularly for the fund administration, is -- or excuse me, for all the custody and asset servicing is the right to do that across Europe. Our banking entity is based in the U.K. today. So if that passport doesn't get negotiated as potentially could happen, we have to look at where we can also conduct businesses. We have large fund administration businesses in Ireland and Luxembourg, which we think there or others, could -- we could leverage to redomicile or domicile a bank to allow us to conduct our business.

In both of our primary businesses, we continue to see strong new business and wins in both wealth and in C&IS. And so I would say organic growth rates in both businesses continues to be high. We don't publish that. But it's at or near normal levels that we've seen, or if not, slightly higher than that and that the pipeline remained strong. So on the fee growth side organically, we feel it remained strong. If you look at the actual fee growth that you're reconciling, there are some headwinds in there. There was some currency negativity in the comparison, particularly for the C&IS business. So it was hurt by the stronger dollar. That was one factor. And in the C&IS business, there can also be some lumpiness to that as the wins tend to be very large. But we feel very good about the pipeline and the growth rate. On the wealth side, the new business flows -- and in fact, in the second quarter, we're very strong, very robust. But they do still have the issues that we've talked about on previous calls, which are around fee compression as we have seen, for instance, the migration from, say, active to passive, particularly true in the Wealth Management business. So that has created fee compression, which is somewhat offset by growth in new business. So across both, we still feel pretty good about our growth rates in those businesses. And I think particular this quarter, if we looked at it, even excluding the benefit of fee waivers, Wealth Management across its regions still had mid to high single-digit growth rates, which I think is pretty good, particularly relative to the industry."

When we adjust for the premium amortization, we actually think the NIM probably would have been up 1 basis point taking that out. I know we can't. But if you did, that explains the sequential decline. In terms of forward thinking on the portfolio, if the rates stay at the levels we're at today and the low end of the curve doesn't move, we'll have to think about the delicacy with which we manage that. As you know, we're significantly impacted by the short end of the curve, which has remained relatively flat, if not even slightly up. I think LIBOR has -- 3-month LIBOR has actually moved up just a tick or 2. The longer flattening impact has a much more modest impact to us. So we continue to look at that, look at where our runoff in our portfolio is and how we can reinvest that."

About 20% then gets down to what I would say more discretionary spend in that line item. That's things like consulting that you've highlighted, where perhaps it can move and ramp if we need to take on special initiatives around regulatory environment or if Jenna Shrewd, our Chief Operating Officer, has programs of work around digitization or improvement to lower future run rate, we can, from time-to-time, see that move. I will say that if you take just the consulting spend portion of that, the rate has actually slowed from the second half of last year. I know you see this number spike. It has slowed. It meaningfully went up in the second half of last year as we ramped up for CCAR and other regulatory. We have seen that start to slow in this quarter, but it's still at elevated levels versus year-on-year. And there is also in there some expense associated with the severance that I talked about and some expense in there that's associated with Aviate, our acquisition.

Prior -- in the first quarter of this year, we saw cash as an asset class with inflows and most of the risk-seeking assets -- equities and even -- and a little bit fixed income instruments with outflows. We saw that trend reverse in our Wealth Management business in the first quarter, where we actually saw risk being put on the table, at least certainly early in the quarter, where we saw our cash balances actually coming down and we saw increases, particularly in our case in fixed income. But I think we saw some risk on in the quarter. So interesting. On the C&IS side, our flows tend to be more passive mandates, so S&P 500 and other types, that's not our only, but they -- our biggest flows tend to be there. And we've seen those move around from time-to-time, particularly as we cited in certain large sovereign wealth pools, they've actually had to monetize some of those index mandates to deal with local requirements, if you will, in their regions. I think we saw that slow a bit in the second quarter perhaps as the price of oil or other factors stabilized to some degree. So we saw that pace slow. But I think that's the color I would say around where we saw flows in the quarter."

For those of you who did not receive our third quarter earnings press release and Financial Trends Report via e-mail this morning, they are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use as a guide for today's call.
This October 19 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is a replay that will be available on our website through November 16. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today.
In the current quarter, we elected to early adopt a new accounting standard issued earlier this year that made certain changes for stock-based compensation. One of the most significant changes requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as part of income tax expense rather than as part of additional paid-in capital. This change has been made for all periods in 2016. The impact resulted in a tax benefit of $6.4 million in the third quarter results and a benefit of $12.3 million on a year-to-date basis. Please see Page 11 of our earnings release for more information on the impact to our first and second quarter 2016 results. 
Now for our safe harbor statement. What we say during today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results.

Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $258 milli",3235,"Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $258 million. Earnings per share were $1.08 and our return on common equity was 11.7%. Our assets under custody increased 13% compared to 1 year ago and 6% sequentially. Our assets under management were up 7% compared to 1 year ago and up 4%, sequentially. 
The current quarter results include 2 items I wanted to highlight: First, the quarter included $5.4 million of impairment charges and loss on sales related to a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio; second, we had a $3.5 million charge in connection with the settlement of our remaining securities lending litigation. All securities lending litigation stemming from the 2008 financial crisis is now resolved subject to final court approval. I will highlight these items again as we walk through our detailed results. 
A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Before going through our results in detail, let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the third quarter. 
Equity markets performed well in the quarter. In U.S. market, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 12.9% year-over-year and up 3.3%, sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was up 1.6% year-over-year and up 5.4%, sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values, and second quarter markets were not as strong as the third quarter. 
In bond markets. The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was higher for the year-over-year comparison but lower for the sequential comparison. Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 2.6% higher than that the third quarter of last year but 8.4% lower, sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were down in the third quarter. 
As measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 14% to 17% year-over-year and down 9% to 11%, sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influenced our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, particularly in the year-over-year comparison, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth. The most significant move was in the British pound, which ended the third quarter 14% lower than 1 year ago. 
Short-term interest rates were mixed during the quarter. U.S. short-term rates were higher than 1 year ago and also moved higher sequentially, most evident in the 3-month LIBOR which averaged 79 basis points during the quarter. In the U.K. however, short-term rates declined, driven by the Bank of England's August rate reduction of 25 basis points.
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 5%, with noninterest income up 3% and net interest income up 13%. Expenses increased 4%, which drove 1.3 points of positive operating leverage. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million, reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Net income was 10% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, recall several items we reported to you last quarter. A pretax gain of $118.2 million on the sale of 1.1 million Class B Visa shares, a pretax charge of $46.5 million in connection with certain securities lending related litigation, a pretax loss of $21.6 million associated with our loan and lease portfolio, a pretax charge of $18.6 million relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS asset servicing clients and a pretax charge of $17.5 million related severance and personnel-related costs. 
On an adjusted basis, excluding the second quarter items, revenue declined with noninterest income down 1% and net interest income slightly higher. Expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter, and net income was 1% higher, sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.7% for the quarter, up from the 10.9% reported 1 year ago but down from the 12.3% in the prior quarter. Adjusting for the previously mentioned second quarter items, the third quarter's return on average common equity was down from 11.9% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of $6.7 trillion increased 13% compared to 1 year ago and 6% on a sequential basis. In both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar. 
Assets under management were $946 billion, up 7% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. Favorable market impacts and new business drove the growth in both comparisons. 
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 5% from last year but down 8%, sequentially. Adjusting for the second quarter items that I mentioned earlier, revenue was down 1%, sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $788 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and up 1% from the prior quarter.
Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver of the performance compared to last year. Fee waivers were essentially 0 in the third quarter compared to $28 million 1 year ago. Fee waivers were not a factor in the sequential comparison. 
Foreign exchange trading income was $54 million in the third quarter, down 15% year-over-year and down 17%, sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline while the sequential decline reflected lower volatility as well as lower client volumes. 
Other noninterest income was $69 million in the third quarter, down 8% from last year and down 10% sequentially when adjusting for the second quarter items I mentioned previously. The current quarter's results include $4.7 million in revenue associated with the Aviate acquisition, which closed during the second quarter. The prior quarter's results included $2.6 million of Aviate associated revenue. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by a $5.4 million loss associated with our lease portfolio, a $2.3 million loss associated with the mark-to-market of our Visa-related swaps as well as lower brokerage and credit-related fees. 
Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $310 million in the third quarter, increasing 13% year-over-year and up 1%, sequentially. 
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $451 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and 1% on a sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $299 million, up 2% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $6.2 trillion at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year and up 6%, sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the unfavorable currency exchange rates. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. 
Investment management fees in C&IS of $94 million in the third quarter were up 14% year-over-year and flat, sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. As was the case last quarter, fee waivers and [ph] C&IS were essentially 0 during the third quarter compared to $12 million, 1 year ago. 
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $704 billion, up 6% year-over-year and 5%, sequentially. 
Securities lending fees were $23 million in the third quarter, 14% lower than the prior quarter, but up 17% year-over-year. The sequential quarter decline reflects the typical seasonal pattern with the international dividend season driving wider spreads in the second quarter of each year. The year-over-year increase was driven by increased spreads, primarily relating to the widening of the spread between 3-month LIBOR and Fed funds. 
Securities lending collateral was $114 billion at quarter end and averaged $113 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 7% year-over-year and were down 3%, sequentially. The decline in loan volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. Security lending activity has been impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage. 
Other fees and [ph] C&IS were $34 million in the third quarter, up 1% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments and other ancillary services. 
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $338 million in the third quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance with fees increasing 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers compared to one year ago as well as favorable markets and new business. 
Performance within the regions also benefited from lower [Audio Gap] [ph] fee waivers compared to last year as well as favorable markets and new business. Money market mutual fund fee waivers and [ph] Wealth Management were essentially 0 in the current quarter, which was equal to the prior quarter and down $15 million year-over-year. 
Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $242 billion at quarter end, up 8% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially.
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $310 million in the third quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $108 billion in the third quarter, up 7% versus last year, driven by higher level of deposits and short-term borrowings. Demand deposits, which average $26 billion, increased 6% year-over-year, and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $51 billion, were up 3% year-over-year. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to 1 year ago. The net interest margin was 1.14% in the third quarter and was up 6 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the Fed's move in December. 
On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the previously mentioned $2.7 million impairment in the prior quarter, net interest income was up slightly and average earning assets were up 1% while the net interest margin was down 3 basis points, sequentially. While our net interest margin saw a [ph] benefit due to higher U.S. short-term interest rates, mainly the 1 month LIBOR, this was offset by the Bank of England rate cut of 25 basis points in August and the change in our overall earning asset mix. Day count also had a slight detrimental impact on our net interest margin in the third quarter. 
Premium amortization was $20 million in the third quarter, up from $14 million 1 year ago but flat with the second quarter. 
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $843 million in the third quarter, up 4% year-over-year and down 9%, sequentially. Excluding the second quarter items I mentioned earlier, expenses were essentially flat on a sequential basis. The current quarter's expenses included $6.6 million in costs associated with the Aviate acquisition compared to $3.4 million in the prior quarter. This quarter's expenses also included the $3.5 million charge relating to the settlement of certain securities lending related litigation as I mentioned in the beginning of my comments. 
Now let's go through the components of expense. My comments going forward will exclude the second quarter items I mentioned earlier, totaling $82.6 million. Compensation expense of $382 million increased 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth and higher performance-based compensation, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year. The growth in staff was all attributable to lower costs locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick and Tempe, Arizona. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 1%, driven by the impact of current quarter severance charges, staff growth and higher performance-based incentive accruals. Recall that the annual base pay adjustments were deferred from earlier in the year, and were made effective October 1, which we expect will result in a $7 million lift to compensation expense in the fourth quarter. 
Employee benefit expense of $73 million was up 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher medical costs, partially offset by lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was up 4%, driven by higher medical costs. 
Outside services expense of $158 million was flat compared to the prior year as higher technical services, Aviate-related expense and subcustodian costs were offset by lower consulting related spend and third-party adviser fees year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, outside service expense was also flat as higher levels of technical services, legal and subcustodian costs were offset by lower levels of consulting spend. 
Equipment & Software expense of $115 million was up 1% from one year ago, but down 3%, sequentially. The year-over-year growth was due to higher software-related expense. The sequential decline was driven by software amortization and computer maintenance and rental-related costs. Spending in support of our strategy continues as we invest to support clients, improve employee efficiency and meet Regulatory and Compliance requirements. Other operating expense of $71 million increased 9% year-over-year, primarily related to the previously mentioned $3.5 million securities lending litigation settlement and higher FDIC costs of $3 million associated with the newly implemented assessment surcharge on banks with consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. 
Sequentially, other operating expense declined 3% on an adjusted basis. Declines associated with asset-servicing amortized cost, the timing of charitable contributions and other miscellaneous expenses more than offset increases from the security lending litigation settlement and a $2 million sequential increase in FDIC expense.
Our loan loss provision was a credit of $3 million in the third quarter. This compares to a provision credit of $3 million in the prior quarter and a credit of $10 million in the prior year. The credit provision in the current quarter was primarily driven by a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the specific reserve requirement for the commercial portfolio. Nonperforming assets of $181 million were up from $166 million in the prior quarter, but down from the $207 million 1 year ago. Loan quality remains very strong with the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 52 basis points at quarter end.
Turning to Page 8. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense-to-fees ratio, pretax margin and ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as 131% in 2011, to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement on our return on equity. As you can see on this page, our performance in the current quarter has continued to drive the ratio lower and is now at 107%. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress, and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and driving productivity within our expense base through our ongoing initiatives focused on location, strategy, procurement and technology.
Turning to page 9. Our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.8% and 11.2%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common [Audio Gap] [ph] tier 1 capital ratio under the advance approach would be approximately 11.6% [ph], and under the standardized approach would be approximately 11%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.6%, and at the bank, was 5.9%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018.
With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. 
During the third quarter, Northern Trust issued $500 million in perpetual preferred stock and an initial fixed dividend rate of 4.6 through October 1, 2020 16 [ph] -- 2026. Fixed-rate dividends for this new issuance are expected to be paid on a semiannual basis, with the first dividend anticipated to be declared at the January 2017 Board of Directors meeting and paid April 1, 2017. Given the early August issuance, the initial preferred dividend payment will cover 8 months and therefore, is expected to equal $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Going forward, these fixed-rate dividends are expected to be paid every other quarter in the amount of $11.5 million.
Beginning October 1, 2026, dividends on this issuance are expected to be paid quarterly at a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 3.202%. In the third quarter, we repurchased 950,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $65 million. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 6% to $0.38 per common share. 
In closing, the global macroeconomic environment continue to produce a difficult operating environment in the third quarter of 2016. Low and even negative interest rates around the globe, post Brexit uncertainty, election uncertainty and debate over Central Bank actions characterize the quarter. Despite that challenging backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing our earnings per share 13% year-over-year. We also produced 1.3 points of positive operating leverage and importantly, drove our expense-to-fee ratio to 107%. Our return on equity of 11.7% represents an 80 basis point improvement over one year ago.
Our Wealth Management business grew total revenue 7% year-over-year with fees up 6%. This business had a pretax margin of 41%. New business success in our highest network categories remain strong. Our C&IS business generated 6% revenue growth and 5% fee growth. Our new business in the quarter helped us grow organically and was exemplified with wins such as [indiscernible] life and the expansion of relationships with existing clients such as the New Zealand Superannuation Fund.
In our Asset Management business, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of our ETF franchise per shares [ph]. Since its launch 5 years ago, the suite of ETF's has grown from 4 funds to 24 and attracted more than $10 billion in assets. During the quarter, we once again had positive flows that outstripped industry averages.
Lastly, in the quarter, we successfully executed the issuance of 500 million in preferred stock, taking advantage of attractive market pricing and creating capital flexibility for the firm going forward. 
Thank you, again, for participating in Northern Trust third quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would like -- would be happy to answer your questions. Lisa, please open the line."

So if it's unexpected, we would anticipate seeing the benefit to come perhaps in the first quarter or second quarter of next year. If the markets anticipate that, well, then we could see some of that benefit in fourth quarter. And then the last component that I would highlight here is, it also then matters greatly as to how the deposit pricing reacts to that anticipated rate hike. As you know, in the last rate hike, the deposit data remained low. We will wait to observe how it unfolds this time."

In fact, in the year before that, it was almost $13 million. So we did not see the premium amortization seasonal decline that we've typically experienced in the third quarter. Traditionally in the fourth quarter and first quarter, we see our lowest levels of premium amortization. But again, in this third quarter, we saw slightly elevated premium amortization and less benefit from the seasonal decline."

First of all, residential real estate loans declined 12% year-over-year. And that's strategically an initiative that we've been on as we look at our wholesale designation and really, our upmarket practice and our Wealth Management best-in-class. So that's a conscious decision on the residential real estate. So that has been a drag on that loan growth. The second thing, as we look year-over-year at loan growth, our C&I loans are actually up 6%. Commercial real estate's up 11% and private client lending is up 17%. So we actually have seen loan growth in the areas that we've targeted and I think that is important. Sequentially, if you look at that, the residential real estate continued it's decline. C&I did decline. And I think we're seeing that across the industry from what I've seen in C&IS -- C&I loans. Commercial real estate was 1% and private client was up 3%, sequentially. So we had the right mix of that. As it relates to RWA growth or use of capital and capital returns. What we're disciplined around is not using our capital to put on whether it's loans or any other risk-weighted asset growth items that aren't generating the right level of returns. So we won't just use it to grow the balance sheet for nonstrategic RWA growth. And in this case, as I highlighted for you in the case of residential real estate for us, the slowing there is something that we're targeting strategically."

And in Wealth, largely across our geographies, we continue to see I think accelerated success in some of our large market investments like New York City that's growing double or triple the overall Wealth management averages to date.

And third, is there a technological or talent gap in those? That's where we start. I think the question was phrased, there's European institutions that are contemplating their own organizational structure. So many of those may have a capability or a geography or a technological or talent gap where we have a need. So now, that may manifest itself. I don't think there's an extraordinary amount of focus on Europe versus any other region in the world.

In terms of how we get after it. It's really is a dual effort. It really is both a revenue and the expense line. On the revenue line, we think about that as the organic growth in their is controllable by us. So the ability to move new business, retain clients, is 100% inside of our capabilities and efforts around new products capabilities, services that we can bring to our client base is important. And so we focus on the organic growth in our -- on the fee side. On the expense side. We've highlighted some of those initiatives to you. Probably most prominent over the last 3 to 5 years in driving that ratio has been our ability to locate our people in the right cost type locations. A great example is, in this quarter, net, our net headcount grew only in what we deem to be Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations. There are other initiatives. We've talk about procurement, we've talked about technology saves where it's cloud-based work or storage-based work et cetera. But we really get after them, the expense side where we do believe there are still levers inside the expense base that we continue to pull.

In the current quarter, we elected to early adopt a new accounting standard issued earlier this year that made certain changes for stock-based compensation. One of the most significant changes requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as part of income tax expense rather than as part of additional paid-in capital. This change has been made for all periods in 2016. The impact resulted in a tax benefit of $6.4 million in the third quarter results and a benefit of $12.3 million on a year-to-date basis. Please see Page 11 of our earnings release for more information on the impact to our first and second quarter 2016 results. 
Now for our safe harbor statement. What we say during today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results.

Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $258 milli",3224,"Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $258 million. Earnings per share were $1.08 and our return on common equity was 11.7%. Our assets under custody increased 13% compared to 1 year ago and 6% sequentially. Our assets under management were up 7% compared to 1 year ago and up 4%, sequentially. 
The current quarter results include 2 items I wanted to highlight: First, the quarter included $5.4 million of impairment charges and loss on sales related to a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio; second, we had a $3.5 million charge in connection with the settlement of our remaining securities lending litigation. All securities lending litigation stemming from the 2008 financial crisis is now resolved subject to final court approval. I will highlight these items again as we walk through our detailed results. 
A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Before going through our results in detail, let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the third quarter. 
Equity markets performed well in the quarter. In U.S. market, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 12.9% year-over-year and up 3.3%, sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was up 1.6% year-over-year and up 5.4%, sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values, and second quarter markets were not as strong as the third quarter. 
In bond markets. The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was higher for the year-over-year comparison but lower for the sequential comparison. Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 2.6% higher than that the third quarter of last year but 8.4% lower, sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were down in the third quarter. 
As measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 14% to 17% year-over-year and down 9% to 11%, sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influenced our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, particularly in the year-over-year comparison, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth. The most significant move was in the British pound, which ended the third quarter 14% lower than 1 year ago. 
Short-term interest rates were mixed during the quarter. U.S. short-term rates were higher than 1 year ago and also moved higher sequentially, most evident in the 3-month LIBOR which averaged 79 basis points during the quarter. In the U.K. however, short-term rates declined, driven by the Bank of England's August rate reduction of 25 basis points.
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 5%, with noninterest income up 3% and net interest income up 13%. Expenses increased 4%, which drove 1.3 points of positive operating leverage. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million, reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Net income was 10% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, recall several items we reported to you last quarter. A pretax gain of $118.2 million on the sale of 1.1 million Class B Visa shares, a pretax charge of $46.5 million in connection with certain securities lending related litigation, a pretax loss of $21.6 million associated with our loan and lease portfolio, a pretax charge of $18.6 million relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS asset servicing clients and a pretax charge of $17.5 million related severance and personnel-related costs. 
On an adjusted basis, excluding the second quarter items, revenue declined with noninterest income down 1% and net interest income slightly higher. Expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter, and net income was 1% higher, sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.7% for the quarter, up from the 10.9% reported 1 year ago but down from the 12.3% in the prior quarter. Adjusting for the previously mentioned second quarter items, the third quarter's return on average common equity was down from 11.9% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of $6.7 trillion increased 13% compared to 1 year ago and 6% on a sequential basis. In both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar. 
Assets under management were $946 billion, up 7% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. Favorable market impacts and new business drove the growth in both comparisons. 
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 5% from last year but down 8%, sequentially. Adjusting for the second quarter items that I mentioned earlier, revenue was down 1%, sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $788 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and up 1% from the prior quarter.
Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver of the performance compared to last year. Fee waivers were essentially 0 in the third quarter compared to $28 million 1 year ago. Fee waivers were not a factor in the sequential comparison. 
Foreign exchange trading income was $54 million in the third quarter, down 15% year-over-year and down 17%, sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline while the sequential decline reflected lower volatility as well as lower client volumes. 
Other noninterest income was $69 million in the third quarter, down 8% from last year and down 10% sequentially when adjusting for the second quarter items I mentioned previously. The current quarter's results include $4.7 million in revenue associated with the Aviate acquisition, which closed during the second quarter. The prior quarter's results included $2.6 million of Aviate associated revenue. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by a $5.4 million loss associated with our lease portfolio, a $2.3 million loss associated with the mark-to-market of our Visa-related swaps as well as lower brokerage and credit-related fees. 
Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $310 million in the third quarter, increasing 13% year-over-year and up 1%, sequentially. 
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $451 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and 1% on a sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $299 million, up 2% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $6.2 trillion at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year and up 6%, sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the unfavorable currency exchange rates. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. 
Investment management fees in C&IS of $94 million in the third quarter were up 14% year-over-year and flat, sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. As was the case last quarter, fee waivers in C&IS were essentially 0 during the third quarter compared to $12 million, 1 year ago. 
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $704 billion, up 6% year-over-year and 5%, sequentially. 
Securities lending fees were $23 million in the third quarter, 14% lower than the prior quarter, but up 17% year-over-year. The sequential quarter decline reflects the typical seasonal pattern with the international dividend season driving wider spreads in the second quarter of each year. The year-over-year increase was driven by increased spreads, primarily relating to the widening of the spread between 3-month LIBOR and Fed funds. 
Securities lending collateral was $114 billion at quarter end and averaged $113 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 7% year-over-year and were down 3%, sequentially. The decline in loan volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. Security lending activity has been impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage. 
Other fees in C&IS were $34 million in the third quarter, up 1% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments and other ancillary services. 
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $338 million in the third quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 2%, sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance with fees increasing 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers compared to 1 year ago as well as favorable markets and new business. 
Performance within the regions also benefited from lower 
[Audio Gap] 
fee waivers compared to last year as well as favorable markets and new business. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management were essentially 0 in the current quarter, which was equal to the prior quarter and down $15 million year-over-year. 
Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $242 billion at quarter end, up 8% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially.
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $310 million in the third quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $108 billion in the third quarter, up 7% versus last year, driven by higher level of deposits and short-term borrowings. Demand deposits, which average $26 billion, increased 6% year-over-year, and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $51 billion, were up 3% year-over-year. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to 1 year ago. The net interest margin was 1.14% in the third quarter and was up 6 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the Fed's move in December. 
On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the previously mentioned $2.7 million impairment in the prior quarter, net interest income was up slightly and average earning assets were up 1% while the net interest margin was down 3 basis points, sequentially. While our net interest margin saw a benefit due to higher U.S. short-term interest rates, mainly the 1 month LIBOR, this was offset by the Bank of England rate cut of 25 basis points in August and the change in our overall earning asset mix. Day count also had a slight detrimental impact on our net interest margin in the third quarter. 
Premium amortization was $20 million in the third quarter, up from $14 million 1 year ago but flat with the second quarter. 
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $843 million in the third quarter, up 4% year-over-year and down 9%, sequentially. Excluding the second quarter items I mentioned earlier, expenses were essentially flat on a sequential basis. The current quarter's expenses included $6.6 million in costs associated with the Aviate acquisition compared to $3.4 million in the prior quarter. This quarter's expenses also included the $3.5 million charge relating to the settlement of certain securities lending related litigation as I mentioned in the beginning of my comments. 
Now let's go through the components of expense. My comments going forward will exclude the second quarter items I mentioned earlier, totaling $82.6 million. Compensation expense of $382 million increased 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth and higher performance-based compensation, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year. The growth in staff was all attributable to lower costs locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick and Tempe, Arizona. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 1%, driven by the impact of current quarter severance charges, staff growth and higher performance-based incentive accruals. Recall that the annual base pay adjustments were deferred from earlier in the year, and were made effective October 1, which we expect will result in a $7 million lift to compensation expense in the fourth quarter. 
Employee benefit expense of $73 million was up 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher medical costs, partially offset by lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was up 4%, driven by higher medical costs. 
Outside services expense of $158 million was flat compared to the prior year as higher technical services, Aviate-related expense and subcustodian costs were offset by lower consulting related spend and third-party adviser fees year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, outside service expense was also flat as higher levels of technical services, legal and subcustodian costs were offset by lower levels of consulting spend. 
Equipment & Software expense of $115 million was up 1% from one year ago, but down 3%, sequentially. The year-over-year growth was due to higher software-related expense. The sequential decline was driven by software amortization and computer maintenance and rental-related costs. Spending in support of our strategy continues as we invest to support clients, improve employee efficiency and meet Regulatory and Compliance requirements. Other operating expense of $71 million increased 9% year-over-year, primarily related to the previously mentioned $3.5 million securities lending litigation settlement and higher FDIC costs of $3 million associated with the newly implemented assessment surcharge on banks with consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. 
Sequentially, other operating expense declined 3% on an adjusted basis. Declines associated with asset-servicing amortized cost, the timing of charitable contributions and other miscellaneous expenses more than offset increases from the security lending litigation settlement and a $2 million sequential increase in FDIC expense.
Our loan loss provision was a credit of $3 million in the third quarter. This compares to a provision credit of $3 million in the prior quarter and a credit of $10 million in the prior year. The credit provision in the current quarter was primarily driven by a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the specific reserve requirement for the commercial portfolio. Nonperforming assets of $181 million were up from $166 million in the prior quarter, but down from the $207 million 1 year ago. Loan quality remains very strong with the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 52 basis points at quarter end.
Turning to Page 8. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense-to-fees ratio, pretax margin and ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as 131% in 2011, to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement on our return on equity. As you can see on this page, our performance in the current quarter has continued to drive the ratio lower and is now at 107%. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress, and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and driving productivity within our expense base through our ongoing initiatives focused on location, strategy, procurement and technology.
Turning to Page 9. Our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.8% and 11.2%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our 
[Audio Gap] 
tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.6%, and under the standardized approach would be approximately 11%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.6%, and at the bank, was 5.9%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018.
With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. 
During the third quarter, Northern Trust issued $500 million in perpetual preferred stock and an initial fixed dividend rate of 4.6 through October 1, 2016 -- 2026. Fixed-rate dividends for this new issuance are expected to be paid on a semiannual basis, with the first dividend anticipated to be declared at the January 2017 Board of Directors meeting and paid April 1, 2017. Given the early August issuance, the initial preferred dividend payment will cover 8 months and therefore, is expected to equal $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Going forward, these fixed-rate dividends are expected to be paid every other quarter in the amount of $11.5 million.
Beginning October 1, 2026, dividends on this issuance are expected to be paid quarterly at a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 3.202%. In the third quarter, we repurchased 950,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $65 million. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 6% to $0.38 per common share. 
In closing, the global macroeconomic environment continue to produce a difficult operating environment in the third quarter of 2016. Low and even negative interest rates around the globe, post Brexit uncertainty, election uncertainty and debate over Central Bank actions characterize the quarter. Despite that challenging backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing our earnings per share 13% year-over-year. We also produced 1.3 points of positive operating leverage and importantly, drove our expense-to-fee ratio to 107%. Our return on equity of 11.7% represents an 80 basis point improvement over one year ago.
Our Wealth Management business grew total revenue 7% year-over-year with fees up 6%. This business had a pretax margin of 41%. New business success in our highest network categories remain strong. Our C&IS business generated 6% revenue growth and 5% fee growth. Our new business in the quarter helped us grow organically and was exemplified with wins such as [indiscernible] Life and the expansion of relationships with existing clients such as the New Zealand Superannuation Fund.
In our Asset Management business, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of our ETF franchise per shares. Since its launch 5 years ago, the suite of ETF's has grown from 4 funds to 24 and attracted more than $10 billion in assets. During the quarter, we once again had positive flows that outstripped industry averages.
Lastly, in the quarter, we successfully executed the issuance of 500 million in preferred stock, taking advantage of attractive market pricing and creating capital flexibility for the firm going forward. 
Thank you, again, for participating in Northern Trust third quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would like -- would be happy to answer your questions. Lisa, please open the line."

As we think about using short-term borrowings that you described, what you would see on our balance sheet in short-term borrowings or funding sources, we can, from time to time, use federal home loan borrowings. They have an advantage, if you will, around our liquidity needs so we use them to manage our balance sheet liquidity from time to time. And they help, if you will, with LCR compliance and other issues. So that's how we think about the short-term borrowings that, in any given period, we can utilize for those types of purposes."

We would expect that if a rate rise were to happen in November or, more likely, December, based on market ratification, that we would benefit from that. What is important to remember is, how do the markets react in advance of that? How well-telegraphed is that rate increase? So if it's unexpected, we would anticipate seeing the benefit to come perhaps in the first quarter or second quarter of next year. If the markets anticipate that, well, then we could see some of that benefit in fourth quarter. And then the last component that I would highlight here is, it also then matters greatly as to how the deposit pricing reacts to that anticipated rate hike. As you know, in the last rate hike, the deposit data remained low. We will wait to observe how it unfolds this time."

I think last quarter, you guys had a fairly elevated amount of premium amortization running through the numbers. It looks like the yield on the guidance didn't really move.

Or kind of 114 basis points is a fairly decent run rate for us to start thinking about 4Q?"

So we did not see the premium amortization seasonal decline that we've typically experienced in the third quarter. Traditionally, in the fourth quarter and first quarter, we see our lowest levels of premium amortization. But again, in this third quarter, we saw slightly elevated premium amortization and less benefit from the seasonal decline."

You guys have obviously, had a little bit of decline sequentially, probably due to the charge. But bigger picture. The bucket has been kind of range-bound at these levels for the last couple of quarters after seeing a couple of years, a really nice loan growth. How should we think about that on the forward basis? I know part of your capital return plan, I think, was contemplating the fact that you guys are growing, and loan growth could be one of the components of why the capital return dynamic was quite lower than we had expected. So maybe kind of tie it together for us as we think about the loan growth outlook."

First of all, residential real estate loans declined 12% year-over-year. And that's strategically an initiative that we've been on as we look at our wholesale designation and really, our upmarket practice in our Wealth Management business. So that's a conscious decision on the residential real estate. So that has been a drag against that loan growth. The second thing, as we look year-over-year at loan growth, our C&I loans are actually up 6%. Commercial real estate's up 11%. And private client lending is up 17%. So we actually have seen loan growth in the areas that we've targeted, and I think is important. Sequentially, if you look at that, the residential real estate continued it's decline. C&I did decline, and I think we're seeing that across the industry from what I've seen in C&I loans. Commercial real estate was 1%, and private client was up 3%, sequentially. So we had the right mix of that. As it relates to RWA growth or use of capital and capital returns. What we're disciplined around is not using our capital to put on whether it's loans or any other risk-weighted asset growth items that aren't generating the right level of returns. So we won't just use it to grow the balance sheet for nonstrategic RWA growth. And in this case, as I highlighted for you in the case of residential real estate for us, the slowing there is something that we're targeting strategically."

We saw very, very good strong growth. And I would say generally across the globe. So whether it was in Asia Pacific region, in Australia or in our European region, where we had substantial new wins, or even here in North America in our C&IS business. And in Wealth, largely across our geographies, we continue to see, I think, accelerated success in some of our large market investments, like New York City, that's growing double or triple the overall Wealth management averages to date. So I think it was a broad base set of successes that really drove that, not just a market-driven beat. Like I said, about 50% was from new business and/or flows."

We would -- we've not stated a public target for that ratio other than to say that we continue to try to drive that lower. So we've not said anything further other than we're committed to driving it lower over time. The way we think about it, Gerard, is, is that our most reliable income source is our trust investment servicing fees. And if we continue to have that cover more and more of our operating expenses, it allows for some of the other profitability line items like foreign exchange, net interest income to truly flow straight to the bottom line. In terms of how we get after it. It really is a dual effort. It is both the revenue and the expense line. On the revenue line, we think about that as the organic growth in their is controllable by us. So the ability to win new business, retain clients is a 100% inside of our capabilities and efforts around new products capabilities, services that we can bring to our client base is important. And so we focus on the organic growth in our -- on the fee side. On the expense side, we've highlighted some of those initiatives to you. Probably most prominent over the last 3 to 5 years in driving that ratio has been our ability to locate our people in the right cost type locations. A great example is, in this quarter, net, our net headcount grew only in what we deem to be Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations. There are other initiatives. We've talked about procurement. We've talked about technology saves where it's cloud-based work or storage-based work et cetera. But we really get after them, the expense side where we do believe there are still levers inside the expense base that we can continue to pull. A combination of those, we think can continue to drive that ratio lower. It is more difficult as we eliminate some of the lower hanging fruit."

In the current quarter, we elected to early adopt a new accounting standard issued earlier this year that made certain changes for stock-based compensation. One of the most significant changes requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as part of income tax expense rather than as part of additional paid-in capital. This change has been made for all periods in 2016. The impact resulted in a tax benefit of $6.4 million in the third quarter results and a benefit of $12.3 million on a year-to-date basis. Please see Page 11 of our earnings release for more information on the impact to our first and second quarter 2016 results. 
Now for our safe harbor statement. What we say during today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.

Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $258 million. Earnings per share were $1.08 and our return on common equity was 11.7%. Our assets under custody increased 13% compared to 1 year ago and 6% sequentially. Our assets under management were up 7% compared to 1 year ago and up 4%, sequentially. 
The current quarter results include 2 items I wanted to highlight: First, the quarter included $5.4 million of impairment charges and loss on sales related to a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio; second, we had a $3.5 million charge in connection with the settlement of our remaining securities lending litigation. All securities lending litigation stemming from the 2008 financial crisis is now resolved subject to final court approval. I will highlight these items again as we walk through our detailed results. 
A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Before going through our results in detail, let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the third quarter. 
Equity markets performed well in the quarter. In U.S. market, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 12.9% year-over-year and up 3.3% sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was up 1.6% year-over-year and up 5.4% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values, and second quarter markets were not as strong as the third quarter. 
In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was higher for the year-over-year comparison but lower for the sequential comparison. Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 2.6% higher than the third quarter of last year but 8.4% lower sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were down in the third quarter.
As measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 14% to 17% year-over-year and down 9% to 11% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar, and, therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, particularly in the year-over-year comparison, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth. The most significant move was in the British pound, which ended the third quarter 14% lower than 1 year ago. 
Short-term interest rates were mixed during the quarter. U.S. short-term rates were higher than 1 year ago and also moved higher sequentially, most evident in the 3-month LIBOR which averaged 79 basis points during the quarter. In the U.K. however, short-term rates declined, driven by the Bank of England's August rate reduction of 25 basis points.
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 5%, with noninterest income up 3% and net interest income up 13%. Expenses increased 4%, which drove 1.3 points of positive operating leverage. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million, reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Net income was 10% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, recall several items we reported to you last quarter: a pretax gain of $118.2 million on the sale of 1.1 million Class B Visa shares, a pretax charge of $46.5 million in connection with certain securities lending related litigation, a pretax loss of $21.6 million associated with our loan and lease portfolio, a pretax charge of $18.6 million relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS asset servicing clients and a pretax charge of $17.5 million related severance and personnel-related costs. 
On an adjusted basis, excluding the second quarter items, revenue declined with noninterest income down 1% and net interest income slightly higher. Expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter, and net income was 1% higher sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.7% for the quarter, up from the 10.9% reported 1 year ago but down from the 12.3% in the prior quarter. Adjusting for the previously mentioned second quarter items, the third quarter's return on average common equity was down from 11.9% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of $6.7 trillion increased 13% compared to 1 year ago and 6% on a sequential basis. In both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar. 
Assets under management were $946 billion, up 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Favorable market impacts and new business drove the growth in both comparisons. 
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 5% from last year but down 8% sequentially. Adjusted for the second quarter items that I mentioned earlier, revenue was down 1% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $788 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and up 1% from the prior quarter.
Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver of the performance compared to last year. Fee waivers were essentially 0 in the third quarter compared to $28 million 1 year ago. Fee waivers were not a factor in the sequential comparison. 
Foreign exchange trading income was $54 million in the third quarter, down 15% year-over-year and down 17% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline while the sequential decline reflected lower volatility as well as lower client volumes. 
Other noninterest income was $69 million in the third quarter, down 8% from last year and down 10% sequentially when adjusting for the second quarter items I mentioned previously. The current quarter's results include $4.7 million in revenue associated with the Aviate acquisition, which closed during the second quarter. The prior quarter's results included $2.6 million of Aviate associated revenue. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by a $5.4 million loss associated with our lease portfolio, a $2.3 million loss associated with the mark-to-market of our Visa-related swaps as well as lower brokerage and credit-related fees. 
Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $310 million in the third quarter, increasing 13% year-over-year and up 1%, sequentially. 
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $451 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and 1% on a sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $299 million, up 2% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $6.2 trillion at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year and up 6%, sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the unfavorable currency exchange rates. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. 
Investment management fees in C&IS of $94 million in the third quarter were up 14% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. As was the case last quarter, fee waivers in C&IS were essentially 0 during the third quarter compared to $12 million 1 year ago. 
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $704 billion, up 6% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. 
Securities lending fees were $23 million in the third quarter, 14% lower than the prior quarter, but up 17% year-over-year. The sequential quarter decline reflects the typical seasonal pattern, with the international dividend season driving wider spreads in the second quarter of each year. The year-over-year increase was driven by increased spreads primarily relating to the widening of the spread between 3-month LIBOR and Fed funds. 
Securities lending collateral was $114 billion at quarter end and averaged $113 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 7% year-over-year and were down 3% sequentially. The decline in loan volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. Security lending activity has been impacted by the regulatory landscape, as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage. 
Other fees in C&IS were $34 million in the third quarter, up 1% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments and other ancillary services. 
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $338 million in the third quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance, with fees increasing 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers compared to 1 year ago as well as favorable markets and new business. 
Performance within the regions also benefited from lower 
[Audio Gap] 
fee waivers compared to last year as well as favorable markets and new business. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management were essentially 0 in the current quarter, which was equal to the prior quarter and down $15 million year-over-year. 
Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $242 billion at quarter end, up 8% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $310 million in the third quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $108 billion in the third quarter, up 7% versus last year, driven by higher level of deposits and short-term borrowings. Demand deposits, which average $26 billion, increased 6% year-over-year, and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $51 billion, were up 3% year-over-year. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to 1 year ago. The net interest margin was 1.14% in the third quarter and was up 6 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the Fed's move in December. 
On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the previously mentioned $2.7 million impairment in the prior quarter, net interest income was up slightly and average earning assets were up 1% while the net interest margin was down 3 basis points sequentially. While our net interest margin saw a benefit due to higher U.S. short-term interest rates, mainly the 1 month LIBOR, this was offset by the Bank of England rate cut of 25 basis points in August and the change in our overall earning asset mix. Day count also had a slight detrimental impact on our net interest margin in the third quarter. 
Premium amortization was $20 million in the third quarter, up from $14 million 1 year ago but flat with the second quarter. 
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $843 million in the third quarter, up 4% year-over-year and down 9%, sequentially. Excluding the second quarter items I mentioned earlier, expenses were essentially flat on a sequential basis. The current quarter's expenses included $6.6 million in costs associated with the Aviate acquisition compared to $3.4 million in the prior quarter. This quarter's expenses also included the $3.5 million charge relating to the settlement of certain securities lending related litigation as I mentioned in the beginning of my comments. 
Now let's go through the components of expense. My comments going forward will exclude the second quarter items I mentioned earlier, totaling $82.6 million. Compensation expense of $382 million increased 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth and higher performance-based compensation, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year. The growth in staff was all attributable to lower-cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick and Tempe, Arizona. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 1%, driven by the impact of current quarter severance charges, staff growth and higher performance-based incentive accruals. Recall that the annual base pay adjustments were deferred from earlier in the year, and were made effective October 1, which we expect will result in a $7 million lift to compensation expense in the fourth quarter. 
Employee benefit expense of $73 million was up 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher medical costs, partially offset by lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was up 4%, driven by higher medical costs. 
Outside services expense of $158 million was flat compared to the prior year as higher technical services, Aviate-related expense and subcustodian costs were offset by lower consulting related spend and third-party adviser fees year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, outside service expense was also flat as higher levels of technical services, legal and subcustodian costs were offset by lower levels of consulting spend. 
Equipment & Software expense of $115 million was up 1% from one year ago but down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was due to higher software-related expense. The sequential decline was driven by software amortization and computer maintenance and rental-related costs. Spending in support of our strategy continues as we invest to support clients, improve employee efficiency and meet Regulatory and Compliance requirements. Other operating expense of $71 million increased 9% year-over-year, primarily related to the previously mentioned $3.5 million securities lending litigation settlement and higher FDIC costs of $3 million associated with the newly implemented assessment surcharge on banks with consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. 
Sequentially, other operating expense declined 3% on an adjusted basis. Declines associated with asset-servicing amortized cost, the timing of charitable contributions and other miscellaneous expenses more than offset increases from the security lending litigation settlement and a $2 million sequential increase in FDIC expense.
Our loan loss provision was a credit of $3 million in the third quarter. This compares to a provision credit of $3 million in the prior quarter and a credit of $10 million in the prior year. The credit provision in the current quarter was primarily driven by a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the specific reserve requirement for the commercial portfolio. Nonperforming assets of $181 million were up from $166 million in the prior quarter, but down from the $207 million 1 year ago. Loan quality remains very strong, with the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 52 basis points at quarter end.
Turning to Page 8. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense-to-fees ratio, pretax margin and, ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as 131% in 2011, to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement on our return on equity. As you can see on this page, our performance in the current quarter has continued to drive the ratio lower and is now at 107%. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress, and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and driving productivity within our expense base through our ongoing initiatives focused on location, strategy, procurement and technology.
Turning to Page 9. Our capital ratios remained solid, with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.8% and 11.2%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our 
[Audio Gap] 
tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.6%, and under the standardized approach would be approximately 11%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.6%, and at the bank, was 5.9%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018.
With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. 
During the third quarter, Northern Trust issued $500 million in perpetual preferred stock at an initial fixed dividend rate of 4.6 through October 1, 2016 -- 2026. Fixed-rate dividends for this new issuance are expected to be paid on a semiannual basis, with the first dividend anticipated to be declared at the January 2017 Board of Directors meeting and paid April 1, 2017. Given the early August issuance, the initial preferred dividend payment will cover 8 months and therefore, is expected to equal $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Going forward, these fixed-rate dividends are expected to be paid every other quarter in the amount of $11.5 million.
Beginning October 1, 2026, dividends on this issuance are expected to be paid quarterly at a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 3.202%. In the third quarter, we repurchased 950,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $65 million. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 6% to $0.38 per common share. 
In closing, the global macroeconomic environment continued to produce a difficult operating environment in the third quarter of 2016. Low and even negative interest rates around the globe, post-Brexit uncertainty, election uncertainty and debate over Central Bank actions characterize the quarter. Despite that challenging backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing our earnings per share 13% year-over-year. We also produced 1.3 points of positive operating leverage and importantly, drove our expense-to-fee ratio to 107%. Our return on equity of 11.7% represents an 80 basis point improvement over one year ago.
Our Wealth Management business grew total revenue 7% year-over-year with fees up 6%. This business had a pretax margin of 41%. New business success in our highest net worth categories remain strong. Our C&IS business generated 6% revenue growth and 5% fee growth. Our new business in the quarter helped us grow organically and was exemplified with wins such as Rothesay Life and the expansion of relationships with existing clients such as the New Zealand Superannuation Fund.
In our Asset Management business, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of our ETF franchise per shares. Since its launch 5 years ago, the suite of ETFs has grown from 4 funds to 24 and attracted more than $10 billion in assets. During the quarter, we once again had positive flows that outstripped industry averages.
Lastly, in the quarter, we successfully executed the issuance of 500 million in preferred stock, taking advantage of attractive market pricing and creating capital flexibility for the firm going forward. 
Thank you, again, for participating in Northern Trust’s third quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would like -- would be happy to answer your questions. Lisa, please open the line."

As we think about using short-term borrowings that you described, what you would see on our balance sheet in short-term borrowings or funding sources, we can, from time to time, use federal home loan borrowings. They have an advantage, if you will, around our liquidity needs so we use them to manage our balance sheet liquidity from time to time. And they help, if you will, with LCR compliance and other issues. So that's how we think about the short-term borrowings that, in any given period, we can utilize for those types of purposes."

We would expect that if a rate rise were to happen in November or, more likely, December, based on market prognostication, that we would benefit from that. What is important to remember is, how do the markets react in advance of that? How well-telegraphed is that rate increase? So if it's unexpected, we would anticipate seeing the benefit to come perhaps in the first quarter or second quarter of next year. If the markets anticipate that, well, then we could see some of that benefit in fourth quarter. And then the last component that I would highlight here is, it also then matters greatly as to how the deposit pricing reacts to that anticipated rate hike. As you know, in the last rate hike, the deposit data remained low. We will wait to observe how it unfolds this time."

So we did not see the premium amortization seasonal decline that we've typically experienced in the third quarter. Traditionally, in the fourth quarter and first quarter, we see our lowest levels of premium amortization. But again, in this third quarter, we saw slightly elevated premium amortization and less benefit from the seasonal decline."

I know part of your capital return plan, I think, was contemplating the fact that you guys are growing, and loan growth could be one of the components of why the capital return dynamic was quite a bit lower than we had expected.

First of all, residential real estate loans declined 12% year-over-year. And that's strategically an initiative that we've been on as we look at our wholesale designation and really, our upmarket practice in our Wealth Management business. So that's a conscious decision on the residential real estate. So that has been a drag against that loan growth. The second thing, as we look year-over-year at loan growth, our C&I loans are actually up 6%. Commercial real estate's up 11%. And private client lending is up 17%. So we actually have seen loan growth in the areas that we've targeted, and I think is important. Sequentially, if you look at that, the residential real estate continued its decline. C&I did decline, and I think we're seeing that across the industry from what I've seen in C&I loans. Commercial real estate was 1%, and private client was up 3% sequentially. So we had the right mix of that. As it relates to RWA growth or use of capital and capital returns, what we're disciplined around is not using our capital to put on whether it's loans or any other risk-weighted asset growth items that aren't generating the right level of returns. So we won't just use it to grow the balance sheet for nonstrategic RWA growth. And in this case, as I highlighted for you in the case of residential real estate for us, the slowing there is something that we're targeting strategically."

It also matters, Ken, in -- whether it's emerging market currencies or it's G7 currencies and the volatility between the 2. So most of our FX, though -- the vast majority of our FX is really driven by our core custody business. It's in relation to supporting the asset managers that are supporting our clients or our clients' needs. There's not a proprietary trading element to this. It's just in support of that.

It's things like market data, use of market data, systems and processing, client customization work, but it's generally linked, if you will, to the directional revenue of the firm in that.

We would -- we've not stated a public target for that ratio other than to say that we continue to try to drive that lower. So we've not said anything further other than we're committed to driving it lower over time. The way we think about it, Gerard, is, is that our most reliable income source is our trust investment servicing fees. And if we continue to have that cover more and more of our operating expenses, it allows for some of the other profitability line items like foreign exchange, net interest income to truly flow straight to the bottom line. In terms of how we get after it, it really is a dual effort. It is both the revenue and the expense line. On the revenue line, we think about that as the organic growth in there is controllable by us. So the ability to win new business, retain clients is a 100% inside of our capabilities and efforts around new products capabilities, services that we can bring to our client base is important. And so we focus on the organic growth in our -- on the fee side. On the expense side, we've highlighted some of those initiatives to you. Probably most prominent over the last 3 to 5 years in driving that ratio has been our ability to locate our people in the right cost type locations. A great example is, in this quarter, net, our net headcount grew only in what we deem to be Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations. There are other initiatives. We've talked about procurement. We've talked about technology saves where it's cloud-based work or storage-based work et cetera. But we really get after then the expense side, where we do believe there are still levers inside the expense base that we can continue to pull. A combination of those, we think, can continue to drive that ratio lower. It is more difficult as we eliminate some of the lower hanging fruit."

In the current quarter, we elected to early adopt a new accounting standard issued earlier this year that made certain changes for stock-based compensation. One of the most significant changes requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as part of income tax expense rather than as part of additional paid-in capital. This change has been made for all periods in 2016. The impact resulted in a tax benefit of $6.4 million in the third quarter results and a benefit of $12.3 million on a year-to-date basis. Please see Page 11 of our earnings release for more information on the impact to our first and second quarter 2016 results. 
Now for our safe harbor statement. What we say during today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results.

Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $258 milli",3222,"Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $258 million. Earnings per share were $1.08 and our return on common equity was 11.7%. Our assets under custody increased 13% compared to 1 year ago and 6% sequentially. Our assets under management were up 7% compared to 1 year ago and up 4%, sequentially. 
The current quarter results include 2 items I wanted to highlight: First, the quarter included $5.4 million of impairment charges and loss on sales related to a nonstrategic loan and lease portfolio; second, we had a $3.5 million charge in connection with the settlement of our remaining securities lending litigation. All securities lending litigation stemming from the 2008 financial crisis is now resolved subject to final court approval. I will highlight these items again as we walk through our detailed results. 
A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Before going through our results in detail, let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the third quarter. 
Equity markets performed well in the quarter. In U.S. market, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 12.9% year-over-year and up 3.3% sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was up 1.6% year-over-year and up 5.4% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values, and second quarter markets were not as strong as the third quarter. 
In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was higher for the year-over-year comparison but lower for the sequential comparison. Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 2.6% higher than the third quarter of last year but 8.4% lower sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were down in the third quarter.
As measured by 2 of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 14% to 17% year-over-year and down 9% to 11% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and, therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, particularly in the year-over-year comparison, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth. The most significant move was in the British pound, which ended the third quarter 14% lower than 1 year ago. 
Short-term interest rates were mixed during the quarter. U.S. short-term rates were higher than 1 year ago and also moved higher sequentially, most evident in the 3-month LIBOR which averaged 79 basis points during the quarter. In the U.K. however, short-term rates declined, driven by the Bank of England's August rate reduction of 25 basis points.
Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 5%, with noninterest income up 3% and net interest income up 13%. Expenses increased 4%, which drove 1.3 points of positive operating leverage. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million, reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Net income was 10% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, recall several items we reported to you last quarter: a pretax gain of $118.2 million on the sale of 1.1 million Class B Visa shares, a pretax charge of $46.5 million in connection with certain securities lending related litigation, a pretax loss of $21.6 million associated with our loan and lease portfolio, a pretax charge of $18.6 million relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS asset servicing clients and a pretax charge of $17.5 million related severance and personnel-related costs. 
On an adjusted basis, excluding the second quarter items, revenue declined with noninterest income down 1% and net interest income slightly higher. Expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter, and net income was 1% higher sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.7% for the quarter, up from the 10.9% reported 1 year ago but down from the 12.3% in the prior quarter. Adjusting for the previously mentioned second quarter items, the third quarter's return on average common equity was down from 11.9% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of $6.7 trillion increased 13% compared to 1 year ago and 6% on a sequential basis. In both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar. 
Assets under management were $946 billion, up 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Favorable market impacts and new business drove the growth in both comparisons. 
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 5% from last year but down 8% sequentially. Adjusted for the second quarter items that I mentioned earlier, revenue was down 1% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $788 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and up 1% from the prior quarter.
Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver of the performance compared to last year. Fee waivers were essentially 0 in the third quarter compared to $28 million 1 year ago. Fee waivers were not a factor in the sequential comparison. 
Foreign exchange trading income was $54 million in the third quarter, down 15% year-over-year and down 17% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline while the sequential decline reflected lower volatility as well as lower client volumes. 
Other noninterest income was $69 million in the third quarter, down 8% from last year and down 10% sequentially when adjusting for the second quarter items I mentioned previously. The current quarter's results include $4.7 million in revenue associated with the Aviate acquisition, which closed during the second quarter. The prior quarter's results included $2.6 million of Aviate associated revenue. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by a $5.4 million loss associated with our lease portfolio, a $2.3 million loss associated with the mark-to-market of our Visa-related swaps as well as lower brokerage and credit-related fees. 
Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $310 million in the third quarter, increasing 13% year-over-year and up 1%, sequentially. 
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $451 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and 1% on a sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $299 million, up 2% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $6.2 trillion at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year and up 6%, sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the unfavorable currency exchange rates. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. 
Investment management fees in C&IS of $94 million in the third quarter were up 14% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. As was the case last quarter, fee waivers in C&IS were essentially 0 during the third quarter compared to $12 million 1 year ago. 
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $704 billion, up 6% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. 
Securities lending fees were $23 million in the third quarter, 14% lower than the prior quarter, but up 17% year-over-year. The sequential quarter decline reflects the typical seasonal pattern, with the international dividend season driving wider spreads in the second quarter of each year. The year-over-year increase was driven by increased spreads primarily relating to the widening of the spread between 3-month LIBOR and Fed funds. 
Securities lending collateral was $114 billion at quarter end and averaged $113 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 7% year-over-year and were down 3% sequentially. The decline in loan volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. Security lending activity has been impacted by the regulatory landscape, as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage. 
Other fees in C&IS were $34 million in the third quarter, up 1% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments and other ancillary services. 
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $338 million in the third quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance, with fees increasing 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers compared to 1 year ago as well as favorable markets and new business. 
Performance within the regions also benefited from lower 
[Audio Gap] 
fee waivers compared to last year as well as favorable markets and new business. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management were essentially 0 in the current quarter, which was equal to the prior quarter and down $15 million year-over-year. 
Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $242 billion at quarter end, up 8% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $310 million in the third quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $108 billion in the third quarter, up 7% versus last year, driven by higher level of deposits and short-term borrowings. Demand deposits, which average $26 billion, increased 6% year-over-year, and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $51 billion, were up 3% year-over-year. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to 1 year ago. The net interest margin was 1.14% in the third quarter and was up 6 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the Fed's move in December. 
On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the previously mentioned $2.7 million impairment in the prior quarter, net interest income was up slightly and average earning assets were up 1% while the net interest margin was down 3 basis points sequentially. While our net interest margin saw a benefit due to higher U.S. short-term interest rates, mainly the 1 month LIBOR, this was offset by the Bank of England rate cut of 25 basis points in August and the change in our overall earning asset mix. Day count also had a slight detrimental impact on our net interest margin in the third quarter. 
Premium amortization was $20 million in the third quarter, up from $14 million 1 year ago but flat with the second quarter. 
Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $843 million in the third quarter, up 4% year-over-year and down 9%, sequentially. Excluding the second quarter items I mentioned earlier, expenses were essentially flat on a sequential basis. The current quarter's expenses included $6.6 million in costs associated with the Aviate acquisition compared to $3.4 million in the prior quarter. This quarter's expenses also included the $3.5 million charge relating to the settlement of certain securities lending related litigation as I mentioned in the beginning of my comments. 
Now let's go through the components of expense. My comments going forward will exclude the second quarter items I mentioned earlier, totaling $82.6 million. Compensation expense of $382 million increased 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth and higher performance-based compensation, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year. The growth in staff was all attributable to lower-cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick and Tempe, Arizona. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 1%, driven by the impact of current quarter severance charges, staff growth and higher performance-based incentive accruals. Recall that the annual base pay adjustments were deferred from earlier in the year, and were made effective October 1, which we expect will result in a $7 million lift to compensation expense in the fourth quarter. 
Employee benefit expense of $73 million was up 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher medical costs, partially offset by lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was up 4%, driven by higher medical costs. 
Outside services expense of $158 million was flat compared to the prior year as higher technical services, Aviate-related expense and subcustodian costs were offset by lower consulting related spend and third-party adviser fees year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, outside service expense was also flat as higher levels of technical services, legal and subcustodian costs were offset by lower levels of consulting spend. 
Equipment & Software expense of $115 million was up 1% from one year ago but down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was due to higher software-related expense. The sequential decline was driven by software amortization and computer maintenance and rental-related costs. Spending in support of our strategy continues as we invest to support clients, improve employee efficiency and meet Regulatory and Compliance requirements. Other operating expense of $71 million increased 9% year-over-year, primarily related to the previously mentioned $3.5 million securities lending litigation settlement and higher FDIC costs of $3 million associated with the newly implemented assessment surcharge on banks with consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. 
Sequentially, other operating expense declined 3% on an adjusted basis. Declines associated with asset-servicing amortized cost, the timing of charitable contributions and other miscellaneous expenses more than offset increases from the security lending litigation settlement and a $2 million sequential increase in FDIC expense.
Our loan loss provision was a credit of $3 million in the third quarter. This compares to a provision credit of $3 million in the prior quarter and a credit of $10 million in the prior year. The credit provision in the current quarter was primarily driven by a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the specific reserve requirement for the commercial portfolio. Nonperforming assets of $181 million were up from $166 million in the prior quarter, but down from the $207 million 1 year ago. Loan quality remains very strong, with the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 52 basis points at quarter end.
Turning to Page 8. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense-to-fees ratio, pretax margin and, ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as 131% in 2011, to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement on our return on equity. As you can see on this page, our performance in the current quarter has continued to drive the ratio lower and is now at 107%. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress, and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and driving productivity within our expense base through our ongoing initiatives focused on location, strategy, procurement and technology.
Turning to Page 9. Our capital ratios remained solid, with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.8% and 11.2%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our 
[Audio Gap] 
tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.6%, and under the standardized approach would be approximately 11%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.6%, and at the bank, was 5.9%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018.
With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. 
During the third quarter, Northern Trust issued $500 million in perpetual preferred stock at an initial fixed dividend rate of 4.6 through October 1, 2016 -- 2026. Fixed-rate dividends for this new issuance are expected to be paid on a semiannual basis, with the first dividend anticipated to be declared at the January 2017 Board of Directors meeting and paid April 1, 2017. Given the early August issuance, the initial preferred dividend payment will cover 8 months and therefore, is expected to equal $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Going forward, these fixed-rate dividends are expected to be paid every other quarter in the amount of $11.5 million.
Beginning October 1, 2026, dividends on this issuance are expected to be paid quarterly at a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 3.202%. In the third quarter, we repurchased 950,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $65 million. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 6% to $0.38 per common share. 
In closing, the global macroeconomic environment continued to produce a difficult operating environment in the third quarter of 2016. Low and even negative interest rates around the globe, post-Brexit uncertainty, election uncertainty and debate over Central Bank actions characterize the quarter. Despite that challenging backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing our earnings per share 13% year-over-year. We also produced 1.3 points of positive operating leverage and importantly, drove our expense-to-fee ratio to 107%. Our return on equity of 11.7% represents an 80 basis point improvement over one year ago.
Our Wealth Management business grew total revenue 7% year-over-year with fees up 6%. This business had a pretax margin of 41%. New business success in our highest net worth categories remain strong. Our C&IS business generated 6% revenue growth and 5% fee growth. Our new business in the quarter helped us grow organically and was exemplified with wins such as Rothesay Life and the expansion of relationships with existing clients such as the New Zealand Superannuation Fund.
In our Asset Management business, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of our ETF franchise per shares. Since its launch 5 years ago, the suite of ETFs has grown from 4 funds to 24 and attracted more than $10 billion in assets. During the quarter, we once again had positive flows that outstripped industry averages.
Lastly, in the quarter, we successfully executed the issuance of 500 million in preferred stock, taking advantage of attractive market pricing and creating capital flexibility for the firm going forward. 
Thank you, again, for participating in Northern Trust’s third quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would like -- would be happy to answer your questions. Lisa, please open the line."

As we think about using short-term borrowings that you described, what you would see on our balance sheet in short-term borrowings or funding sources, we can, from time to time, use federal home loan borrowings. They have an advantage, if you will, around our liquidity needs so we use them to manage our balance sheet liquidity from time to time. And they help, if you will, with LCR compliance and other issues. So that's how we think about the short-term borrowings that, in any given period, we can utilize for those types of purposes."

As we think about the -- a potential rate rise, as you know, our portfolio typically remain short in duration. We would expect that if a rate rise were to happen in November or, more likely, December, based on market prognostication, that we would benefit from that. What is important to remember is, how do the markets react in advance of that? How well-telegraphed is that rate increase? So if it's unexpected, we would anticipate seeing the benefit to come perhaps in the first quarter or second quarter of next year. If the markets anticipate that, well, then we could see some of that benefit in fourth quarter. And then the last component that I would highlight here is, it also then matters greatly as to how the deposit pricing reacts to that anticipated rate hike. As you know, in the last rate hike, the deposit data remained low. We will wait to observe how it unfolds this time."

So we did not see the premium amortization seasonal decline that we've typically experienced in the third quarter. Traditionally, in the fourth quarter and first quarter, we see our lowest levels of premium amortization. But again, in this third quarter, we saw slightly elevated premium amortization and less benefit from the seasonal decline."

I know part of your capital return plan, I think, was contemplating the fact that you guys are growing, and loan growth could be one of the components of why the capital return dynamic was quite a bit lower than we had expected.

First of all, residential real estate loans declined 12% year-over-year. And that's strategically an initiative that we've been on as we look at our wholesale designation and really, our upmarket practice in our Wealth Management business. So that's a conscious decision on the residential real estate. So that has been a drag against that loan growth. The second thing, as we look year-over-year at loan growth, our C&I loans are actually up 6%. Commercial real estate's up 11%. And private client lending is up 17%. So we actually have seen loan growth in the areas that we've targeted, and I think is important. Sequentially, if you look at that, the residential real estate continued its decline. C&I did decline, and I think we're seeing that across the industry from what I've seen in C&I loans. Commercial real estate was 1%, and private client was up 3% sequentially. So we had the right mix of that. As it relates to RWA growth or use of capital and capital returns, what we're disciplined around is not using our capital to put on whether it's loans or any other risk-weighted asset growth items that aren't generating the right level of returns. So we won't just use it to grow the balance sheet for nonstrategic RWA growth. And in this case, as I highlighted for you in the case of residential real estate for us, the slowing there is something that we're targeting strategically."

So whether it was in Asia Pacific region, in Australia or in our European region, where we had substantial new wins, or even here in North America in our C&IS business. And in Wealth, largely across our geographies, we continue to see, I think, accelerated success in some of our large market investments, like New York City, that's growing double or triple the overall Wealth management averages to date.

It also matters, Ken, in -- whether it's emerging market currencies or it's G7 currencies and the volatility between the 2. So most of our FX, though -- the vast majority of our FX is really driven by our core custody business.

About half is what I would say is what we call technical services, and it's generally linked to business activity. It's things like market data, use of market data, systems and processing, client customization work, but it's generally linked, if you will, to the directional revenue of the firm in that. The third part, probably the part that we're talking about here, is about 20%, and that's the most discretionary. That's things like consulting spend.

If those don't manifest, then we will revisit that plan in the 2017 submission cycle.

A great example is, in this quarter, net, our net headcount grew only in what we deem to be Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations. There are other initiatives. We've talked about procurement. We've talked about technology saves where it's cloud-based work or storage-based work et cetera. But we really get after then the expense side, where we do believe there are still levers inside the expense base that we can continue to pull. A combination of those, we think, can continue to drive that ratio lower. It is more difficult as we eliminate some of the lower hanging fruit."

And then as a follow-up, obviously, we're all familiar with Governor Tarullo's speech a couple of weeks back about issuing an NPR on the qualitative part of CCAR for banks under $250 billion in assets not having to go through the qualitative portion. Assuming that sticks and the qualitative portion is removed from your CCAR process, will that change your view on how much capital you will return to your shareholders? I recognize you always like to keep very strong capital levels because of your reputation. But would that still influence you guys on thinking a little bit differently about the return of excess capital?"

We are not exempt from that language because while our balance sheet is lower than $250 billion, another caveat is around more than $10 billion of foreign balance sheet. We do exceed that, as you see. So we are in what they deem the large and complex bank group, which is not what Governor Tarullo was discussing in that meeting. Still CCAR qualitative and quantitative in our requirements. Thanks."
