Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will open my remarks with an overview of our fourth quarter and later in the call, I will give you a recap of our full year performance.
3M finished 2015 with another quarter of disciplined execution and a challenging external environment. Across our enterprise, we controlled the controllable while investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders. With respect to our earnings per share, we posted GAAP EPS of $1.66, down 8% year-over-year.
As you recall, in October, we announced our corporate restructuring, which was completed in the fourth quarter. This action resulted in a Q4 pretax charge of $114 million and will deliver a savings of $130 million in 2016. Excluding these Q4 charge, we posted earnings per share of $1.80.
Companywide, organic local currency sales declined 1.1%. Consistent with our expectations at our December Outlook meeting, organic growth was down low single-digits in our 2 Industrial-related businesses, namely Industrial and Safety and Graphics. Also, as expected, Electronics and Energy decreased in the high single-digits as the Consumer electronics market softened. On the positive side, our 2 Consumer driven businesses posted strong organic growth in the quarter.
Consumer was up nearly 3% organically, while Health Care increased almost 5%, its highest growth of the year. Acquisitions added 1.5 percentage points to our sales, while the stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by nearly 6%. In total, Q4 sales was $7.3 billion.
Looking at margins. We delivered another good broad-based performance in the quarter. When you exclude restructuring, margins were up 60 basis points to a healthy 22%, with 4 of our 5 business groups posting margins greater than 21%. In the fourth quarter, we posted strong free cash flow with a robust 182% conversion. We also continued to invest in our business while returning nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Overall, we had a solid finish to the year. And now, I would turn the call over to Nick, who will go through the details of the quarter. Nick?"

Acquisitions, n",1616,"Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering sales growth on Slide 4.
Organic local currency sales declined 1.1% in the fourth quarter, with volumes down 2.3%, partially offset by selling prices, which were up 1.2%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 1.5 percentage points to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety, Polypore's Separations Media business and Ivera Medical, along with the divestitures of library systems and our license plate converting business in France.
Finally, foreign currency impacts reduced sales by 5.8 percentage points with notable year-on-year declines in the euro, yen and Brazilian real. As a result, in U.S. dollar terms, fourth quarter worldwide sales declined 5.4% versus last year.
In the United States, organic growth was down slightly as we experienced weak end market demand in our Industrial related businesses. At the same time, our Consumer orientated businesses, Health Care and Consumer, continued to deliver positive organic growth. Organic growth in Asia Pacific declined 2.7%. 3 of our 5 business groups posted positive growth in the region, led by Health Care and Consumer, while Electronics and Energy declined high single-digits. Within Asia Pacific, organic growth declined by 3% in both Japan and China/Hong Kong. Excluding our Electronics businesses, Japan was up 3% organically while China/Hong Kong declined 3%.
Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.1%, with Central/East Europe up high single-digits; West Europe up slightly and Middle East Africa down mid-single digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada declined 60 basis points. Brazil declined 6%, while Mexico continued its trend of strong organic growth, increasing 7%. Please turn to Slide 5 for the fourth quarter P&L. 
Companywide, fourth quarter sales were $7.3 billion with operating income of $1.5 billion. GAAP operating margins in the quarter were 20.5%, down 1 percentage point year-on-year. Excluding restructuring, margins increased 60 basis points to 22.1%, which reflects our ability to execute and effectively control those things within our control. On the right-hand side of this slide, you'll see the various components of our fourth quarter margin performance. Let me comment on the primary drivers impacting margins during the quarter.
Lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 2 percentage points of margin expansion. Our global sourcing teams continued to capitalize on the impact of lower commodity prices and are generating additional savings above market. Foreign currency, net of hedge gains, decreased margins by 30 basis points. Fourth quarter strategic investments lowered margins by 40 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio management actions in our renewable energy business. Similar to past quarters, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced margins by 60 basis points.
Finally, our fourth quarter pretax restructuring charge of $114 million reduced margins by 160 basis points. S income mentioned, these actions will result in a pretax savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. Let's now turn to Slide 6 for a look at earnings per share. 
Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $1.66 per share, down 8.3% year-on-year. Our restructuring decreased GAAP earnings by $0.14 per share. Excluding these costs, earnings were $1.80. As you see, a number of other factors impact -- also impacted our earnings. Growth and margin expansion added $0.03 to earnings in the quarter, which includes headwinds of $0.05 from pension expense and $0.04 from strategic investments. Excluding restructuring, our fourth quarter tax rate was 28.6% versus 28% in last year's fourth quarter. This reduced earnings by $0.01 per share.
Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $96 million or the equivalent of $0.11 per share. Acquisitions and divestitures increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 4% year-over-year, which added $0.06 to fourth quarter EPS. Please turn to Slide 7. 
We delivered strong free cash flow in the fourth quarter with the conversion rate of 182%. The primary driver was improved working capital. Free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up $199 million year-over-year. For the full year, we posted free cash flow conversion of 103%, similar to 2014. 
In 2015, we continued to manage toward a better optimized capital structure. We added leverage of approximately $4 billion, which helped fund investments in organic growth, acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we invested $446 million in CapEx, bringing our full year investment to just under $1.5 billion. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Also in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. During 2015, we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders, including cash dividends of $2.6 billion and gross share repurchases of $5.2 billion.
Now let's review our business group performance, starting with Industrial on Slide 8. Industrial posted quarterly sales of $2.5 billion. Organic growth was minus 1.8%, reflecting a slow Industrial economy, which impacted our business. In particular, our advanced materials business declined high single-digits, impacted by weak demand in the oil and gas end market. 
On a positive note, our automotive OEM business grew high single-digits, as we continue to gain share by increasing 3M's content per vehicle. This business has consistently grown faster than global car and light truck production levels. 3M Purification also posted strong organic growth in the quarter. The acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business, which enhances 3M's core filtration platform, added 1.7 percentage points to Industrial sales growth. Integration activities and financial performance are on track and meeting expectations.
On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was positive in India, Latin America/Canada and Asia Pacific, while the U.S. declined mid single-digits. The Industrial business delivered operating income of $476 million in the quarter, with operating margins of 19.3% or 21%, excluding restructuring. In addition, the businesses is absorbing the Polypore's Separations Media acquisition, which reduced margins by another 50 basis points. Please turn to Slide 9. 
Fourth quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were down 2.5% organically to $1.3 billion. As a reminder, organic growth in this business was up over 9% in Q4 2014, which included a $30 million impact from Ebola-related demand for personnel safety products. Excluding this impact, Q4 sales in our Safety and Graphics business was flat organically.
Within Safety and Graphics, our commercial solutions business had another solid quarter, which capped off a strong full year of mid single-digit growth. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 4.6 percentage points to sales growth. As a reminder, in August, we acquired Capital Safety, a leading provider of fall protection equipment. Integration is on track and the business is meeting operating income targets.
On a geographic basis, organic growth declined in all regions. Operating income was $282 million in the quarter and operating margins increased 1 percentage point to 21.8% or 22.7% excluding restructuring. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures added 150 basis points to Safety and Graphics fourth quarter operating margins. Please turn to Slide 10. 
Our Health Care business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.4 billion with organic growth of 4.5%. Organic growth was broad-based, led by double-digit increases in both health information systems and food safety, with oral care up mid single-digits in the quarter. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 80 basis points to fourth quarter sales growth and continues to exceed performance objectives. 
Health Care grew organically in all geographic areas, led by Asia Pacific. This business continues to drive penetration in developing markets, with 8% organic growth in the quarter. China/Hong Kong was particularly strong with double-digit organic growth.
Operating income was $444 million, up nearly 3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Health Care's operating margins were 32.1%, up 110 basis points year-over-year or up 180 basis points excluding restructuring. We continue to be pleased with a strong and consistent performance of our Health Care business and will continue to invest in this business to drive greater success.
Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Fourth quarter sales for this business group were $1.2 billion, down 7.7% organically. On the electronics side, organic sales declined 8%, impacted by weakness in the Consumer electronics and market and excess channel inventory. We expect this softness to continue into the first quarter. Our energy-related businesses were down 6% organically as sales declined in renewable energy, telecom and Electrical Markets.
On a geographic basis, organic growth was down across all areas. Operating income for Electronics and Energy was $200 million, with operating margins of 16.5% or 17.5% excluding restructuring. In addition, portfolio management actions in our renewable energy business reduced Electronics and Energy margins by 2.4 percentage points. For the full year, operating margins were 21.1%, up from 19.9% in 2014. Our portfolio actions in this business grew over the last 3 years continued to pay off in 2015. These actions are enabling us to deliver solid margins even in the face of challenging conditions in both Electronics and Energy end markets. I'll finish with our Consumer business on Slide 12.
Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion. Organic growth was a solid 2.7%, paced by our home improvement business. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands, such as Filtrete filters and Command Adhesives. Stationery and office supplies and Home Care were also up organically, while organic sales declined in consumer health care.
Fourth quarter holiday sales were strong, driven by solid demand for our category leading Scotch and Command branded products. Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was broad-based across all areas, led by the U.S. Consumers operating income was $254 million, with operating margins of 23.1% or 23.4% excluding restructuring. 
That wraps up our review of the fourth quarter business results. Please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn it back over to Inge. Inge?"

With another solid margin and cash flow performance, our fourth quarter capped off a year of disciplined execution and efficient growth from our global team. Even in a low growth environment, we expanded full year margins nearly a full percentage point to 23.3% excluding restructuring.
In 2015, the for second year in a row, we posted free cash flow conversion above 100%. We also delivered a strong return on invested capital of 22.5%, coming on top of a 22% return in 2014. Beyond these solid financial results, I view 2015 as a fundamentally important year in terms of 3M's future. This is because of the investments we made and the actions we took to position our company for long-term success. 
As you see, last year, we invested a total of $7 billion in research and development acquisitions and CapEx. We also made significant progress on our 3 key levers, which represent important value creators for our enterprise. The first is portfolio management, which is all about strengthening and focusing on our portfolio of businesses. We do this through both acquisitions and divestitures and also, through business consolidation. 
Last year, we took actions on all fronts. In Health Care, as an example, we combined our Dental and Orthodontic businesses into one single oral care Solutions business. Consolidating businesses allow us to allocate resources to our best opportunities while creating greater customer relevance, scale, productivity and improve speed.
In 2012, in fact, we have realigned from 6 sectors to 5 business groups and from 40 businesses to 26. To complement organic growth, we also made 3 strategic acquisitions in 2015. This includes Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business, which enhance 2 of our core technology platforms: Personal Safety and Filtration. At the same time, we divested 3 businesses that no longer fit within our portfolio.
Investing in innovation is our second lever. Last year, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. As you have heard me say many times, research and development is the heartbeat of our company. It enables us to both invent and manufacture cutting-edge, relevant and unique products for our customers. This in turn drives organic growth, which is our primary growth metric and also supports our premium margins and return on invested capital. 
Last year, in addition to investing in technology development, we took action to better connect our scientific capabilities to our customers around the world. We opened 6 new Customer Technical Centers, including in West Europe, Middle East Africa and Asia Pacific. We also opened our new state-of-the-art research laboratory in the United States, which we look forward to showing you at our Investor Day in March.
Our third lever, business transformation, starts and ends with our customers. It's about transforming our business processes to make it easier and quicker for our customers to do business with us anywhere around the world. The backbone of business transformation is our new global ERP system. In 2015, we made good progress, most recently with the successful rollout in the Nordic countries.
We also announced the creation of 3 global service centers, which will optimize our delivery of transactional services and service and broader platform for operational effectiveness into the future. We expect business transformation to result in a $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion reduction in working capital.
That covers all 3 levers, and I'm very pleased with our progress in all of them. In addition to work we did on those levers, we made other investments to position 3M for success in both the short and long-term. As we have talked about before, we run our company with one eye on the microscope and the other eye on the telescope, or in other words, making sure we are positioned for success today and many years into the future.
Let me give you 2 examples. First, on the telescope view, we made a significant investment related to our brand equity. Our 3M brand is strong. And last year, we invested in a new plan brand platform, 3M Science Applied to Life. to make it even stronger. This will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to sort problems for our customers, which go back to our vision of improving every company, every home and every life.
Next, on the microscope view, we completed a corporate restructuring focused on structural overhead and slower growing markets, which will help us manage through the current economic realities. And we made all these investments last year while also return $8 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
When I look upon all we accomplished in 2015, it was a fundamentally important year for the future of our enterprise. As you can see, we are continuing to build an even stronger, more competitive company that will win in 2016 and beyond. And on Slide 14, you will see our planning estimates for this year, which are unchanged from December's Outlook meeting. 
We estimate earnings per share in the range of $8.10 to $8.45, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be 1% to 3%, with acquisitions adding 1% to sales. Finally, we expect our free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%.
With that, I thank you for your attention. We will now take your questions."

We did a good job managing working capital throughout the fourth quarter. And in addition, the restructuring expenses of $114 million pretax, much of that did not yet result in a cash outflow.

We are very strong in the United States in our Consumer business. So we have a stronger and better penetration in the United States than we have outside of United States. So that is also then talking to our opportunities as we move ahead to expand more with consumer outside of United States. If you look upon United States specifically and you look upon data and facts, which were an -- a key detailer for us relative to potential growth rate, we all know that there's a challenge on IPI as we go into 2016. And the fact they are saying that it's a slow Q1, Q2, maybe Q3 and then Q4, it will pick up again on IPI year-over-year. If you look upon retail sales index, it's actually different. It's very robust as we go in already to Q1 and Q2 and for the rest of the year. So I would say that our business there is in a good position and we feel very good about it. We have very good brands, we had a lot of value into the channels and we are managing a lot of categories in that business. The same goes for Health Care. Health Care is the same. Health Care, for us -- I'm not talking U.S. versus outside of U.S. there. I'm talking about developed economies versus developing economies. And 80% of our portfolio in Health Care is in developed economies. Meaning, developing is still a huge opportunity for us, and we are growing very well there. Our margins are very high. So I think that's coming back to, in times like these, where you see some challenges in some economies around the world, if that's in Industrial or electronics or even in safety, we have the advantage that we have domestic driven businesses in Consumer and Health Care that just carries on. And you saw that this quarter again, Health Care had almost 5% organic local currency, the strongest for the year and in margin expansion. It's just a fantastic business for us, and the same goes for Consumer. So we feel very, very good about them and it's sustainable. I think that's the important  thing. It's a sustainable business model for us based on world-class product solutions."

So United States, that was pressured this quarter, down 6, but we were growing in many other cases around the world. And I think that's important to think about in terms of us as a global growth company. So we had organic growth in India, china. We grew 6% in China. If you think about that, it's a big market, second biggest subsidiary for 3M outside of the United States and the second biggest economy in the world. Still, for us, our Industrial business in the quarter, 6% growth. We have 3% growth in Japan, and United States was an issue. So I think we have to balance it out in terms of how we look upon the future here. And we have decided and we are a global growth company.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will open my remarks with an overview of our fourth quarter, and later in the call, I will give you a recap of our full year performance.
3M finished 2015 with another quarter of disciplined execution in a challenging external environment. Across all enterprise, we controlled the controllable while investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders. With respect to our earnings per share, we posted GAAP EPS of $1.66, down 8% year-over-year.
As you recall, in October, we announced our corporate restructuring, which was completed in the fourth quarter. This action resulted in a Q4 pretax charge of $114 million and will deliver savings of $130 million in 2016. Excluding this Q4 charge, we posted earnings per share of $1.80.
Company wide, organic local currency sales declined 1.1%. Consistent with our expectations at our December Outlook Meeting, organic growth was down low single digits in our 2 industrial-related businesses, namely Industrial and Safety and Graphics. Also, as expected, Electronics and Energy decreased in the high single digits as the consumer electronics market softened. On the positive side, our 2 consumer-driven businesses posted strong organic growth in the quarter. Consumer was up nearly 3% organically, while Health Care increased almost 5%, its highest growth of the year. 
Acquisitions added 1.5 percentage points to our sales, while the stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by nearly 6%. In total, Q4 sales was $7.3 billion.
Looking at margins. We delivered another good broad-based performance in the quarter. When you exclude restructuring, margins were up 60 basis points to a healthy 22%, with 4 of our 5 business groups posting margins greater than 21%. In the fourth quarter, we posted strong free cash flow with a robust 182% conversion. We also continued to invest in our business while returning nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Overall, we had a solid finish to the year. And now I would turn the call over to Nick, who will give -- go through the details of the quarter. Nick?"

Acquisitions, n",1614,"Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering sales growth on Slide 4.
Organic local currency sales declined 1.1% in the fourth quarter, with volumes down 2.3%, partially offset by selling prices, which were up 1.2%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 1.5 percentage points to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety, Polypore's Separations Media business and Ivera Medical, along with the divestitures of library systems and our license plate converting business in France.
Finally, foreign currency impacts reduced sales by 5.8 percentage points with notable year-on-year declines in the euro, yen and Brazilian real. As a result, in U.S. dollar terms, fourth quarter worldwide sales declined 5.4% versus last year.
In the United States, organic growth was down slightly as we experienced weak end-market demand in our industrial-related businesses. At the same time, our consumer-orientated businesses, Health Care and Consumer, continued to deliver positive organic growth. 
Organic growth in Asia Pacific declined 2.7%. 3 of our 5 business groups posted positive growth in the region, led by Health Care and Consumer, while Electronics and Energy declined high single digits. Within Asia Pacific, organic growth declined by 3% in both Japan and China/Hong Kong. Excluding our Electronics businesses, Japan was up 3% organically while China/Hong Kong declined 3%.
Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.1%, with Central/East Europe up high single digits; West Europe up slightly and Middle East/Africa down mid-single digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada declined 60 basis points. Brazil declined 6%, while Mexico continued its trend of strong organic growth, increasing 7%. 
Please turn to Slide 5 for the fourth quarter P&L. Company wide, fourth quarter sales were $7.3 billion with operating income of $1.5 billion. GAAP operating margins in the quarter were 20.5%, down 1 percentage point year-on-year. Excluding restructuring, margins increased 60 basis points to 22.1%, which reflects our ability to execute and effectively control those things within our control. On the right-hand side of this slide, you'll see the various components of our fourth quarter margin performance. Let me comment on the primary drivers impacting margins during the quarter.
Lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 2 percentage points of margin expansion. Our global sourcing teams continued to capitalize on the impact of lower commodity prices and are generating additional savings above market. Foreign currency, net of hedge gains, decreased margins by 30 basis points. Fourth quarter strategic investments lowered margins by 40 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio management actions in our renewable energy business. Similar to past quarters, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced margins by 60 basis points.
Finally, our fourth quarter pretax restructuring charge of $114 million reduced margins by 160 basis points. As Inge mentioned, these actions will result in a pretax savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 for a look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $1.66 per share, down 8.3% year-on-year. Our restructuring decreased GAAP earnings by $0.14 per share. Excluding these costs, earnings were $1.80. As you see, a number of other factors impact -- also impacted our earnings. Growth and margin expansion added $0.03 to earnings in the quarter, which includes headwinds of $0.05 from pension expense and $0.04 from strategic investments. Excluding restructuring, our fourth quarter tax rate was 28.6% versus 28% in last year's fourth quarter. This reduced earnings by $0.01 per share.
Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $96 million or the equivalent of $0.11 per share. Acquisitions and divestitures increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 4% year-over-year, which added $0.06 to quarter EPS. 
Please turn to Slide 7. We delivered strong free cash flow in the fourth quarter with a conversion rate of 182%. The primary driver was improved working capital. Free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up $199 million year-over-year. For the full year, we posted free cash flow conversion of 103%, similar to 2014. 
In 2015, we continued to manage toward a better optimized capital structure. We added leverage of approximately $4 billion, which helped fund investments in organic growth, acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we invested $446 million in CapEx, bringing our full year investment to just under $1.5 billion. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Also in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. During 2015, we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders, including cash dividends of $2.6 billion and gross share repurchases of $5.2 billion.
Now let's review our business group performance, starting with Industrial on Slide 8. Industrial posted quarterly sales of $2.5 billion. Organic growth was minus 1.8%, reflecting a slow industrial economy, which impacted our business. In particular, our advanced materials business declined high single digits, impacted by weak demand in the oil and gas end market. 
On a positive note, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits, as we continue to gain share by increasing 3M's content per vehicle. This business has consistently grown faster than global car and light truck production levels. 3M purification also posted strong organic growth in the quarter. The acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business, which enhances 3M's core filtration platform, added 1.7 percentage points to Industrial sales growth. Integration activities and financial performance are on track and meeting expectations. On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was positive in EMEA, Latin America/Canada and Asia Pacific, while the U.S. declined mid-single digits. 
The Industrial business delivered operating income of $476 million in the quarter, with operating margins of 19.3% or 21%, excluding restructuring. In addition, the businesses is absorbing the Polypore Separations Media acquisition, which reduced margins by another 50 basis points. 
Please turn to Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were down 2.5% organically to $1.3 billion. As a reminder, organic growth in this business was up over 9% in Q4 2014, which included a $30 million impact from Ebola-related demand for personal safety products. Excluding this impact, Q4 sales in our Safety and Graphics business was flat organically.
Within Safety and Graphics, our commercial solutions business had another solid quarter, which capped off a strong full year of mid-single-digit growth. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 4.6 percentage points to sales growth. As a reminder, in August, we acquired Capital Safety, a leading provider of fall protection equipment. Integration is on track and the business is meeting operating income targets. On a geographic basis, organic growth declined in all regions. 
Operating income was $282 million in the quarter and operating margins increased 1 percentage point to 21.8% or 22.7%, excluding restructuring. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures added 150 basis points to Safety and Graphics fourth quarter operating margins. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Our Health Care business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.4 billion with organic growth of 4.5%. Organic growth was broad based, led by double-digit increases in both health information systems and food safety, with oral care up mid-single digits in the quarter. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 80 basis points to fourth quarter sales growth and continues to exceed performance objectives. 
Health Care grew organically in all geographic areas, led by Asia Pacific. This business continues to drive penetration in developing markets, with 8% organic growth in the quarter. China/Hong Kong was particularly strong with double-digit organic growth.
Operating income was $444 million, up nearly 3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Health Care's operating margins were 32.1%, up 110 basis points year-over-year or up 180 basis points, excluding restructuring. We continue to be pleased with the strong and consistent performance of our Health Care business and will continue to invest in this business to drive greater success.
Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Fourth quarter sales for this business group were $1.2 billion, down 7.7% organically. On the electronics side, organic sales declined 8%, impacted by weakness in the consumer electronics and market and excess channel inventory. We expect this softness to continue into the first quarter. Our energy-related businesses were down 6% organically as sales declined in renewable energy, telecom and electrical markets. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down across all areas. 
Operating income for Electronics and Energy was $200 million, with operating margins of 16.5% or 17.5%, excluding restructuring. In addition, portfolio management actions in our renewable energy business reduced Electronics and Energy margins by 2.4 percentage points. For the full year, operating margins were 21.1%, up from 19.9% in 2014. Our portfolio actions in this business group over the last 3 years continued to pay off in 2015. These actions are enabling us to deliver solid margins even in the face of challenging conditions in both Electronics and Energy end markets. 
I'll finish with our Consumer business on Slide 12. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion. Organic growth was a solid 2.7%, paced by our home improvement business. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands, such as Filtrete filters and Command adhesives. Stationery and office supplies and home care were also up organically, while organic sales declined in consumer health care.
Fourth quarter holiday sales were strong, driven by solid demand for our category-leading Scotch and Command-branded products. Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was broad-based across all areas, led by the U.S. Consumer's operating income was $254 million, with operating margins of 23.1% or 23.4%, excluding restructuring. 
That wraps up our review of the fourth quarter business results. Please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn it back over to Inge. Inge?"

With another solid margin and cash flow performance, our fourth quarter capped off a year of disciplined execution and efficient growth from our global team. Even in a low-growth environment, we expanded full year margins nearly a full percentage point to 23.3%, excluding restructuring.
In 2015, for second year in a row, we posted free cash flow conversion above 100%. We also delivered a strong return on invested capital of 22.5%, coming on top of a 22% return in 2014. Beyond these solid financial results, I view 2015 as a fundamentally important year in terms of 3M's future. This is because of the investments we made and the actions we took to position our company for long-term success. 
As you see, last year, we invested a total of $7 billion in research and development acquisitions and CapEx. We also made significant progress on our 3 key levers, which represent important value creators for our enterprise. 
The first is portfolio management, which is all about strengthening and focusing on our portfolio of businesses. We do this through both acquisitions and divestiture and also through business consolidation. Last year, we took actions on all fronts. In Health Care, as an example, we combined our Dental and Orthodontic businesses into one single oral care solution business. Consolidating businesses allow us to allocate resources to our best opportunities while creating greater customer relevance, scale, productivity and improve speed. Since 2012, in fact, we have realigned from 6 sectors to 5 business groups and from 40 businesses to 26. 
To complement organic growth, we also made 3 strategic acquisitions in 2015. This includes Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business, which enhance 2 of our core technology platforms: personal safety and filtration. At the same time, we divested 3 businesses that no longer fit within our portfolio.
Investing in innovation is our second lever. Last year, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. As you have heard me say many times, research and development is the heartbeat of our company. It enable us to both invent and manufacture cutting-edge, relevant and unique products for our customers. This in turn drives organic growth, which is our primary growth metric and also supports our premium margins and return on invested capital. 
Last year, in addition to investing in technology development, we took action to better connect our scientific capabilities to our customers around the world. We opened 6 new Customer Technical Centers, including in West Europe, Middle East/Africa and Asia Pacific. We also opened our new state-of-the-art research laboratory in United States, which we look forward to showing you at our investor day in March.
Our third lever, business transformation, starts and ends with our customers. It's about transforming our business processes to make it easier and quicker for our customers to do business with us anywhere around the world. The backbone of business transformation is our new global ERP system. In 2015, we made good progress, most recently with the successful rollout in the Nordic countries.
We also announced the creation of 3 global service centers, which will optimize our delivery of transactional services and service a broader platform for operational effectiveness into the future. We expect business transformation to result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion reduction in working capital.
That covers all 3 levers, and I'm very pleased with our progress in all of them. In addition to work we did on those levers, we made other investment to position 3M for success in both the short and long term. As we have talked about before, we run our company with one eye on the microscope and the other eye on the telescope, or in other words, making sure we are positioned for success today and many years into the future.
Let me give you 2 examples. First, on the telescope view, we made a significant investment related to our brand equity. Our 3M brand is strong and last year, we invested in new plan brand platform: 3M Science. Applied to Life., to make it even stronger. This will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to solve problems for our customers, which go back to our vision of improving every company, every home and every life.
Next, on the microscope view, we completed a corporate restructuring focused on structural overhead and slower growing markets, which will help us manage through the current economic realities. And we made all these investments last year while also return $8 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
When I look upon all we accomplished in 2015, it was a fundamentally important year for the future of our enterprise. As you can see, we are continuing to build an even stronger, more competitive company that will win in 2016 and beyond. And on Slide 14, you will see our planning estimates for this year, which are unchanged from December's Outlook Meeting. 
We estimate earnings per share in the range of $8.10 to $8.45, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be 1% to 3%, with acquisitions adding 1% to sales. Finally, we expect our free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%.
With that, I thank you for your attention. We will now take your questions."

The first quarter of any year is typically our lowest free cash flow conversion, and the fourth quarter of the year is typically our highest free cash flow conversion. We saw that play out in 2015, and we'd expect that to play out in 2016. In particular, what you're seeing in the fourth quarter, there's a couple of things: One is working capital. We did a good job managing working capital throughout the fourth quarter. And in addition, the restructuring expenses of $114 million pretax, much of that did not yet result in a cash outflow. That cash outflow will come in the first half of 2016. So we're seeing a little bit of movement between 2015 and 2016 there. As far as hedging, Deane, the -- we continue to manage our hedging strategy, as I've described in the past, that over the next 12 months, we attempt to hedge approximately 50% of our economic exposure. And then in certain developed currencies, we layer on additional hedges on a diminishing scale out into the second and third year. That's playing out as we planned. For the total 2015, we had a hedging benefit of $182 million. And if foreign exchange rates stay where they are today, that $182 million will become approximately $160 million for total 2016."

And West Europe, you see some spots of growth, but I think the very important thing there is that Germany, the machine of Germany start to deliver a little bit more growth, then we maybe can see a little bit more then. I think we are well prepared in that part of the world due to work that we have done for the last, I will say, maybe the last 5 years. So I've streamlined the organization, taken out structure, bigger span of control and lower levels in the organization, et cetera, in terms of management.

We have -- we are very strong in United States in our Consumer business. So we have a stronger and better penetration in United States than we have outside of United States. So that is also then talking to our opportunities as we move ahead to expand more with Consumer outside of United States. If you look upon United States specifically and you look upon data and facts, which will -- is a key detailer for us relative to potential growth rate, we all know that there is a challenge on IPI as we go into 2016. And the fact there is saying that it's a slow Q1, Q2, maybe Q3 and then Q4, it will pick up again on IPI year-over-year. If you look upon retail sales index, it's actually different. It's very robust as we go in already to Q1 and Q2 and for the rest of the year. So I would say that our business there is in a good position, and we feel very good about it. We have very good brands. We had very -- we add a lot of value into the channels, and we are managing a lot of categories in that business. The same go for Health Care. Health Care is the same. Health Care, for us -- I'm not talking U.S. versus outside of U.S. there. I'm talking about developed economies versus developing economies. And 80% of our portfolio in Health Care is in developed economies. Meaning, developing and still a huge opportunity for us, and we are growing very well there. And our margins are very high. So I think that's coming back to -- in times like these, where you see some challenges in some economies around the world, if that's in Industrial or electronics or even in safety, we have the advantage that we have domestic-driven businesses in Consumer and Health Care that is carries on. And you saw that this quarter. Again, Health Care had almost 5% organic local currency, the strongest for the year and with margin expansion. It's just a fantastic business for us, and the same go for Consumer. So we feel very, very good about them and it's sustainable. I think that's the important thing.

Still, for us, our Industrial business in the quarter, 6% growth. We have 3% growth in Japan, and United States was an issue.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will open my remarks with an overview of our fourth quarter, and later in the call, I will give you a recap of our full year performance.
3M finished 2015 with another quarter of disciplined execution in a challenging external environment. Across all enterprise, we controlled the controllable while investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders. With respect to our earnings per share, we posted GAAP EPS of $1.66, down 8% year-over-year.
As you recall, in October, we announced our corporate restructuring, which was completed in the fourth quarter. This action resulted in a Q4 pretax charge of $114 million and will deliver savings of $130 million in 2016. Excluding this Q4 charge, we posted earnings per share of $1.80.
Company wide, organic local currency sales declined 1.1%. Consistent with our expectations at our December Outlook Meeting, organic growth was down low single digits in our 2 industrial-related businesses, namely Industrial and Safety and Graphics. Also, as expected, Electronics and Energy decreased in the high single digits as the consumer electronics market softened. On the positive side, our 2 consumer-driven businesses posted strong organic growth in the quarter. Consumer was up nearly 3% organically, while Health Care increased almost 5%, its highest growth of the year. 
Acquisitions added 1.5 percentage points to our sales, while the stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by nearly 6%. In total, Q4 sales was $7.3 billion.
Looking at margins. We delivered another good broad-based performance in the quarter. When you exclude restructuring, margins were up 60 basis points to a healthy 22%, with 4 of our 5 business groups posting margins greater than 21%. In the fourth quarter, we posted strong free cash flow with a robust 182% conversion. We also continued to invest in our business while returning nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Overall, we had a solid finish to the year. And now I would turn the call over to Nick, who will give -- go through the details of the quarter. Nick?"

Organic local currency sales declined 1.1% in the fourth quarter, with volumes down 2.3%, partially offset by selling prices, which were up 1.2%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 1.5 percentage points to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety, Polypore's Separations Media business and Ivera Medical, along with the divestitures of library systems and our license plate converting business in France.
Finally, foreign currency impacts reduced sales by 5.8 percentage points with notable year-on-year declines in the euro, yen and Brazilian real. As a result, in U.S. dollar terms, fourth quarter worldwide sales declined 5.4% versus last year.
In the United States, organic growth was down slightly as we experienced weak end-market demand in our industrial-related businesses. At the same time, our consumer-orientated businesses, Health Care and Consumer, continued to deliver positive organic growth. 
Organic growth in Asia Pacific declined 2.7%. 3 of our 5 business groups posted positive growth in the region, led by Health Care and Consumer, while Electronics and Energy declined high single digits. Within Asia Pacific, organic growth declined by 3% in both Japan and China/Hong Kong. Excluding our Electronics businesses, Japan was up 3% organically while China/Hong Kong declined 3%.
Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.1%, with Central/East Europe up high single digits; West Europe up slightly and Middle East/Africa down mid-single digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada declined 60 basis points. Brazil declined 6%, while Mexico continued its trend of strong organic growth, increasing 7%.

GAAP operating margins in the quarter were 20.5%, down 1 percentage point year-on-year. Excluding restructuring, margins increased 60 basis points to 22.1%, which reflects our ability to execute and effectively control those things within our control. On the right-hand side of this slide, you'll see the various components of our fourth quarter margin performance. Let me comment on the primary drivers impacting margins during the quarter.
Lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 2 percentage points of margin expansion. Our global sourcing teams continued to capitalize on the impact of lower commodity prices and are generating additional savings above market. Foreign currency, net of hedge gains, decreased margins by 30 basis points. Fourth quarter strategic investments lowered margins by 40 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio management actions in our renewable energy business. Similar to past quarters, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced margins by 60 basis points.
Finally, our fourth quarter pretax restructuring charge of $114 million reduced margins by 160 basis points. As Inge mentioned, these actions will result in a pretax savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 for a look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $1.66 per share, down 8.3% year-on-year. Our restructuring decreased GAAP earnings by $0.14 per share. Excluding these costs, earnings were $1.80. As you see, a number of other factors impact -- also impacted our earnings. Growth and margin expansion added $0.03 to earnings in the quarter, which includes headwinds of $0.05 from pension expense and $0.04 from strategic investments. Excluding restructuring, our fourth quarter tax rate was 28.6% versus 28% in last year's fourth quarter. This reduced earnings by $0.01 per share.
Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $96 million or the equivalent of $0.11 per share. Acquisitions and divestitures increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 4% year-over-year, which added $0.06 to fourth quarter EPS. 
Please turn to Slide 7. We delivered strong free cash flow in the fourth quarter with a conversion rate of 182%. The primary driver was improved working capital. Free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up $199 million year-over-year. For the full year, we posted free cash flow conversion of 103%, similar to 2014. 
In 2015, we continued to manage toward a better optimized capital structure. We added leverage of approximately $4 billion, which helped fund investments in organic growth, acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we invested $446 million in CapEx, bringing our full year investment to just under $1.5 billion. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Also in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. During 2015, we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders, including cash dividends of $2.6 billion and gross share repurchases of $5.2 billion.
Now let's review our business group performance, starting with Industrial on Slide 8. Industrial posted quarterly sales of $2.5 billion. Organic growth was minus 1.8%, reflecting a slow industrial economy, which impacted our business. In particular, our advanced materials business declined high single digits, impacted by weak demand in the oil and gas end market. 
On a positive note, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits, as we continue to gain share by increasing 3M's content per vehicle. This business has consistently grown faster than global car and light truck production levels. 3M purification also posted strong organic growth in the quarter. The acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business, which enhances 3M's core filtration platform, added 1.7 percentage points to Industrial sales growth. Integration activities and financial performance are on track and meeting expectations. On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was positive in EMEA, Latin America/Canada and Asia Pacific, while the U.S. declined mid-single digits. 
The Industrial business delivered operating income of $476 million in the quarter, with operating margins of 19.3% or 21%, excluding restructuring. In addition, the business is absorbing the Polypore Separations Media acquisition, which reduced margins by another 50 basis points. 
Please turn to Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were down 2.5% organically to $1.3 billion. As a reminder, organic growth in this business was up over 9% in Q4 2014, which included a $30 million impact from Ebola-related demand for personal safety products. Excluding this impact, Q4 sales in our Safety and Graphics business was flat organically.
Within Safety and Graphics, our commercial solutions business had another solid quarter, which capped off a strong full year of mid-single-digit growth. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 4.6 percentage points to sales growth. As a reminder, in August, we acquired Capital Safety, a leading provider of fall protection equipment. Integration is on track and the business is meeting operating income targets. On a geographic basis, organic growth declined in all regions. 
Operating income was $282 million in the quarter and operating margins increased 1 percentage point to 21.8% or 22.7%, excluding restructuring. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures added 150 basis points to Safety and Graphics fourth quarter operating margins. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Our Health Care business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.4 billion with organic growth of 4.5%. Organic growth was broad based, led by double-digit increases in both health information systems and food safety, with oral care up mid-single digits in the quarter. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 80 basis points to fourth quarter sales growth and continues to exceed performance objectives. 
Health Care grew organically in all geographic areas, led by Asia Pacific. This business continues to drive penetration in developing markets, with 8% organic growth in the quarter. China/Hong Kong was particularly strong with double-digit organic growth.
Operating income was $444 million, up nearly 3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Health Care's operating margins were 32.1%, up 110 basis points year-over-year or up 180 basis points, excluding restructuring. We continue to be pleased with the strong and consistent performance of our Health Care business and will continue to invest in this business to drive greater success.
Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Fourth quarter sales for this business group were $1.2 billion, down 7.7% organically. On the electronics side, organic sales declined 8%, impacted by weakness in the consumer electronics end market and excess channel inventory. We expect this softness to continue into the first quarter. Our energy-related businesses were down 6% organically as sales declined in renewable energy, telecom and electrical markets. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down across all areas. 
Operating income for Electronics and Energy was $200 million, with operating margins of 16.5% or 17.5%, excluding restructuring. In addition, portfolio management actions in our renewable energy business reduced Electronics and Energy margins by 2.4 percentage points. For the full year, operating margins were 21.1%, up from 19.9% in 2014. Our portfolio actions in this business group over the last 3 years continued to pay off in 2015. These actions are enabling us to deliver solid margins even in the face of challenging conditions in both Electronics and Energy end markets. 
I'll finish with our Consumer business on Slide 12. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion. Organic growth was a solid 2.7%, paced by our home improvement business. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands, such as Filtrete filters and Command adhesives. Stationery and office supplies and home care were also up organically, while organic sales declined in consumer health care.
Fourth quarter holiday sales were strong, driven by solid demand for our category-leading Scotch and Command-branded products. Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was broad-based across all areas, led by the U.S. Consumer's operating income was $254 million, with operating margins of 23.1% or 23.4%, excluding restructuring. 
That wraps up our review of the fourth quarter business results. Please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn it back over to Inge. Inge?"

With another solid margin and cash flow performance, our fourth quarter capped off a year of disciplined execution and efficient growth from our global team. Even in a low-growth environment, we expanded full year margins nearly a full percentage point to 23.3%, excluding restructuring.
In 2015, for second year in a row, we posted free cash flow conversion above 100%. We also delivered a strong return on invested capital of 22.5%, coming on top of a 22% return in 2014. Beyond these solid financial results, I view 2015 as a fundamentally important year in terms of 3M's future. This is because of the investments we made and the actions we took to position our company for long-term success. 
As you see, last year, we invested a total of $7 billion in research and development acquisitions and CapEx. We also made significant progress on our 3 key levers, which represent important value creators for our enterprise. 
The first is portfolio management, which is all about strengthening and focusing on our portfolio of businesses. We do this through both acquisitions and divestiture and also through business consolidation. Last year, we took actions on all fronts. In Health Care, as an example, we combined our Dental and Orthodontic businesses into one single oral care solution business. Consolidating businesses allow us to allocate resources to our best opportunities while creating greater customer relevance, scale, productivity and improve speed. Since 2012, in fact, we have realigned from 6 sectors to 5 business groups and from 40 businesses to 26. 
To complement organic growth, we also made 3 strategic acquisitions in 2015. This includes Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business, which enhance 2 of our core technology platforms: personal safety and filtration. At the same time, we divested 3 businesses that no longer fit within our portfolio.
Investing in innovation is our second lever. Last year, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. As you have heard me say many times, research and development is the heartbeat of our company. It enable us to both invent and manufacture cutting-edge, relevant and unique products for our customers. This in turn drives organic growth, which is our primary growth metric and also supports our premium margins and return on invested capital. 
Last year, in addition to investing in technology development, we took action to better connect our scientific capabilities to our customers around the world. We opened 6 new Customer Technical Centers, including in West Europe, Middle East/Africa and Asia Pacific. We also opened our new state-of-the-art research laboratory in United States, which we look forward to showing you at our investor day in March.
Our third lever, business transformation, starts and ends with our customers. It's about transforming our business processes to make it easier and quicker for our customers to do business with us anywhere around the world. The backbone of business transformation is our new global ERP system. In 2015, we made good progress, most recently with the successful rollout in the Nordic countries.
We also announced the creation of 3 global service centers, which will optimize our delivery of transactional services and service a broader platform for operational effectiveness into the future. We expect business transformation to result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion reduction in working capital.
That covers all 3 levers, and I'm very pleased with our progress in all of them. In addition to work we did on those levels, we made other investment to position 3M for success in both the short and long term. As we have talked about before, we run our company with one eye on the microscope and the other eye on the telescope, or in other words, making sure we are positioned for success today and many years into the future.
Let me give you 2 examples. First, on the telescope view, we made a significant investment related to our brand equity. Our 3M brand is strong and last year, we invested in the new brand platform: 3M Science. Applied to Life., to make it even stronger. This will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to solve problems for our customers, which go back to our vision of improving every company, every home and every life.
Next, on the microscope view, we completed a corporate restructuring focused on structural overhead and slower growing markets, which will help us manage through the current economic realities. And we made all these investments last year while also return $8 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
When I look upon all we accomplished in 2015, it was a fundamentally important year for the future of our enterprise. As you can see, we are continuing to build an even stronger, more competitive company that will win in 2016 and beyond. And on Slide 14, you will see our planning estimates for this year, which are unchanged from December's Outlook Meeting. 
We estimate earnings per share in the range of $8.10 to $8.45, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be 1% to 3%, with acquisitions adding 1% to sales. Finally, we expect our free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%.
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

A rough ballpark for us is a $10 movement in oil helps us for an entire year by $0.02 to $0.03. So our thinking right now is we're right about at the high end of that $0.10 to $0.15. And at the time we guided this in December, we saw virtually all of that benefit coming in the first half of 2016.

I think we are well prepared in that part of the world due to work that we have done for the last, I have to say, maybe the last 5 years of streamlined organization, taking out structure, bigger span of control and lower levels in the organization, et cetera, in terms of management.

We have -- we are very strong in United States in our Consumer business. So we have a stronger and better penetration in United States than we have outside of United States. So that is also then talking to our opportunities as we move ahead to expand more with Consumer outside of United States. If you look upon United States specifically and you look upon data and facts, which will -- is a key indicator for us relative to potential growth rates, we all know that there is a challenge on IPI as we go into 2016. And the fact there is saying that it's a slow Q1, Q2, maybe Q3 and then Q4, it will pick up again on IPI year-over-year. If you look upon retail sales index, it's actually different. It's very robust as we go in already to Q1 and Q2 and for the rest of the year. So I would say that our business there is in a good position, and we feel very good about it. We have very good brands. We have very -- we add a lot of value into the channels, and we are managing a lot of categories in that business. The same go for Health Care. Health Care is the same. Health Care, for us -- I'm not talking U.S. versus outside of U.S. there. I'm talking about developed economies versus developing economies. And 80% of our portfolio in Health Care is in developed economies. Meaning, developing is still a huge opportunity for us, and we are growing very well there. And our margins are very high. So I think that's coming back to -- in times like this, where you see some challenges in some economies around the world, if that's in Industrial or electronics or even in safety, we have the advantage that we have domestic-driven businesses in Consumer and Health Care that is carries on. And you saw that this quarter again. Health Care had almost 5% organic local currency, or the strongest for the year and with margin expansion. It's just a fantastic business for us, and the same go for Consumer. So we feel very, very good about them and it's sustainable. I think that's the important thing.

But we have also to think about it in terms of growth on a global base. So United States, there was pressure this quarter, down 6, but we were growing in many other cases around the world. And I think that's important to think about in terms of us as a global growth company. So we had organic growth in India, China. We grew 6% in China. If you think about that, it's a big market, second biggest subsidiary for 3M outside of the United States and the second biggest economy in the world. Still, for us, our Industrial business in the quarter, 6% growth. We had 3% growth in Japan, and United States was an issue. So I think we have to balance it out in terms of how we look upon the future here. And we have decided and we are a global-growth company.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will open my remarks with an overview of our fourth quarter, and later in the call, I will give you a recap of our full year performance.
3M finished 2015 with another quarter of disciplined execution in a challenging external environment. Across all enterprise, we controlled the controllable while investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders. With respect to our earnings per share, we posted GAAP EPS of $1.66, down 8% year-over-year.
As you recall, in October, we announced our corporate restructuring, which was completed in the fourth quarter. This action resulted in a Q4 pretax charge of $114 million and will deliver savings of $130 million in 2016. Excluding this Q4 charge, we posted earnings per share of $1.80.
Companywide, organic local currency sales declined 1.1%. Consistent with our expectations at our December Outlook Meeting, organic growth was down low single digits in our 2 industrial-related businesses, namely Industrial and Safety and Graphics. Also, as expected, Electronics and Energy decreased in the high single digits as the consumer electronics market softened. On the positive side, our 2 consumer-driven businesses posted strong organic growth in the quarter. Consumer was up nearly 3% organically, while Health Care increased almost 5%, its highest growth of the year. 
Acquisitions added 1.5 percentage points to our sales, while the stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by nearly 6%. In total, Q4 sales was $7.3 billion.
Looking at margins. We delivered another good broad-based performance in the quarter. When you exclude restructuring, margins were up 60 basis points to a healthy 22%, with 4 of our 5 business groups posting margins greater than 21%. In the fourth quarter, we posted strong free cash flow with a robust 182% conversion. We also continued to invest in our business while returning nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Overall, we had a solid finish to the year. And now I would turn the call over to Nick, who will give -- go through the details of the quarter. Nick?"

Organic local currency sales declined 1.1% in the fourth quarter, with volumes down 2.3%, partially offset by selling prices, which were up 1.2%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 1.5 percentage points to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety, Polypore's Separations Media business and Ivera Medical, along with the divestitures of library systems and our license plate converting business in France.
Finally, foreign currency impacts reduced sales by 5.8 percentage points with notable year-on-year declines in the euro, yen and Brazilian real. As a result, in U.S. dollar terms, fourth quarter worldwide sales declined 5.4% versus last year.
In the United States, organic growth was down slightly as we experienced weak end-market demand in our industrial-related businesses. At the same time, our consumer-orientated businesses, Health Care and Consumer, continued to deliver positive organic growth. 
Organic growth in Asia Pacific declined 2.7%. 3 of our 5 business groups posted positive growth in the region, led by Health Care and Consumer, while Electronics and Energy declined high single digits. Within Asia Pacific, organic growth declined by 3% in both Japan and China/Hong Kong. Excluding our Electronics businesses, Japan was up 3% organically while China/Hong Kong declined 3%.
Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.1%, with Central/East Europe up high single digits; West Europe up slightly and Middle East/Africa down mid-single digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada declined 60 basis points. Brazil declined 6%, while Mexico continued its trend of strong organic growth, increasing 7%. 
Please turn to Slide 5 for the fourth quarter P&L. Companywide, fourth quarter sales were $7.3 billion with operating income of $1.5 billion. GAAP operating margins in the quarter were 20.5%, down 1 percentage point year-on-year. Excluding restructuring, margins increased 60 basis points to 22.1%, which reflects our ability to execute and effectively control those things within our control. On the right-hand side of this slide, you'll see the various components of our fourth quarter margin performance. Let me comment on the primary drivers impacting margins during the quarter.
Lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 2 percentage points of margin expansion. Our global sourcing teams continued to capitalize on the impact of lower commodity prices and are generating additional savings above market. Foreign currency, net of hedge gains, decreased margins by 30 basis points. Fourth quarter strategic investments lowered margins by 40 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio management actions in our renewable energy business. Similar to past quarters, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced margins by 60 basis points.
Finally, our fourth quarter pretax restructuring charge of $114 million reduced margins by 160 basis points. As Inge mentioned, these actions will result in a pretax savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 for a look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $1.66 per share, down 8.3% year-on-year. Our restructuring decreased GAAP earnings by $0.14 per share. Excluding these costs, earnings were $1.80. As you see, a number of other factors impact -- also impacted our earnings. Growth and margin expansion added $0.03 to earnings in the quarter, which includes headwinds of $0.05 from pension expense and $0.04 from strategic investments. Excluding restructuring, our fourth quarter tax rate was 28.6% versus 28% in last year's fourth quarter. This reduced earnings by $0.01 per share.
Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $96 million or the equivalent of $0.11 per share. Acquisitions and divestitures increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 4% year-over-year, which added $0.06 to fourth quarter EPS. 
Please turn to Slide 7. We delivered strong free cash flow in the fourth quarter with a conversion rate of 182%. The primary driver was improved working capital. Free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up $199 million year-over-year. For the full year, we posted free cash flow conversion of 103%, similar to 2014. 
In 2015, we continued to manage toward a better optimized capital structure. We added leverage of approximately $4 billion, which helped fund investments in organic growth, acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we invested $446 million in CapEx, bringing our full year investment to just under $1.5 billion. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Also in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. During 2015, we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders, including cash dividends of $2.6 billion and gross share repurchases of $5.2 billion.
Now let's review our business group performance, starting with Industrial on Slide 8. Industrial posted quarterly sales of $2.5 billion. Organic growth was minus 1.8%, reflecting a slow industrial economy, which impacted our business. In particular, our advanced materials business declined high single digits, impacted by weak demand in the oil and gas end market. 
On a positive note, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits, as we continue to gain share by increasing 3M's content per vehicle. This business has consistently grown faster than global car and light truck production levels. 3M purification also posted strong organic growth in the quarter. The acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business, which enhances 3M's core filtration platform, added 1.7 percentage points to Industrial sales growth. Integration activities and financial performance are on track and meeting expectations. On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was positive in EMEA, Latin America/Canada and Asia Pacific, while the U.S. declined mid-single digits. 
The Industrial business delivered operating income of $476 million in the quarter, with operating margins of 19.3% or 21%, excluding restructuring. In addition, the business is absorbing the Polypore Separations Media acquisition, which reduced margins by another 50 basis points. 
Please turn to Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were down 2.5% organically to $1.3 billion. As a reminder, organic growth in this business was up over 9% in Q4 2014, which included a $30 million impact from Ebola-related demand for personal safety products. Excluding this impact, Q4 sales in our Safety and Graphics business was flat organically.
Within Safety and Graphics, our commercial solutions business had another solid quarter, which capped off a strong full year of mid-single-digit growth. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 4.6 percentage points to sales growth. As a reminder, in August, we acquired Capital Safety, a leading provider of fall protection equipment. Integration is on track and the business is meeting operating income targets. On a geographic basis, organic growth declined in all regions. 
Operating income was $282 million in the quarter and operating margins increased 1 percentage point to 21.8% or 22.7%, excluding restructuring. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures added 150 basis points to Safety and Graphics fourth quarter operating margins. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Our Health Care business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.4 billion with organic growth of 4.5%. Organic growth was broad based, led by double-digit increases in both health information systems and food safety, with oral care up mid-single digits in the quarter. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 80 basis points to fourth quarter sales growth and continues to exceed performance objectives. 
Health Care grew organically in all geographic areas, led by Asia Pacific. This business continues to drive penetration in developing markets, with 8% organic growth in the quarter. China/Hong Kong was particularly strong with double-digit organic growth.
Operating income was $444 million, up nearly 3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Health Care's operating margins were 32.1%, up 110 basis points year-over-year or up 180 basis points, excluding restructuring. We continue to be pleased with the strong and consistent performance of our Health Care business and will continue to invest in this business to drive greater success.
Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Fourth quarter sales for this business group were $1.2 billion, down 7.7% organically. On the electronics side, organic sales declined 8%, impacted by weakness in the consumer electronics end market and excess channel inventory. We expect this softness to continue into the first quarter. Our energy-related businesses were down 6% organically as sales declined in renewable energy, telecom and electrical markets. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down across all areas. 
Operating income for Electronics and Energy was $200 million, with operating margins of 16.5% or 17.5%, excluding restructuring. In addition, portfolio management actions in our renewable energy business reduced Electronics and Energy margins by 2.4 percentage points. For the full year, operating margins were 21.1%, up from 19.9% in 2014. Our portfolio actions in this business group over the last 3 years continued to pay off in 2015. These actions are enabling us to deliver solid margins even in the face of challenging conditions in both Electronics and Energy end markets. 
I'll finish with our Consumer business on Slide 12. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion. Organic growth was a solid 2.7%, paced by our home improvement business. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands, such as Filtrete filters and Command adhesives. Stationery and office supplies and home care were also up organically, while organic sales declined in consumer health care.
Fourth quarter holiday sales were strong, driven by solid demand for our category-leading Scotch and Command-branded products. Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was broad-based across all areas, led by the U.S. Consumer's operating income was $254 million, with operating margins of 23.1% or 23.4%, excluding restructuring. 
That wraps up our review of the fourth quarter business results. Please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn it back over to Inge. Inge?"

With another solid margin and cash flow performance, our fourth quarter capped off a year of disciplined execution and efficient growth from our global team. Even in a low-growth environment, we expanded full year margins nearly a full percentage point to 23.3%, excluding restructuring.
In 2015, for second year in a row, we posted free cash flow conversion above 100%. We also delivered a strong return on invested capital of 22.5%, coming on top of a 22% return in 2014. Beyond these solid financial results, I view 2015 as a fundamentally important year in terms of 3M's future. This is because of the investments we made and the actions we took to position our company for long-term success. 
As you see, last year, we invested a total of $7 billion in research and development acquisitions and CapEx. We also made significant progress on our 3 key levers, which represent important value creators for our enterprise. 
The first is portfolio management, which is all about strengthening and focusing on our portfolio of businesses. We do this through both acquisitions and divestiture and also through business consolidation. Last year, we took actions on all fronts. In Health Care, as an example, we combined our Dental and Orthodontic businesses into one single oral care solution business. Consolidating businesses allow us to allocate resources to our best opportunities while creating greater customer relevance, scale, productivity and improve speed. Since 2012, in fact, we have realigned from 6 sectors to 5 business groups and from 40 businesses to 26. 
To complement organic growth, we also made 3 strategic acquisitions in 2015. This includes Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business, which enhance 2 of our core technology platforms: personal safety and filtration. At the same time, we divested 3 businesses that no longer fit within our portfolio.
Investing in innovation is our second lever. Last year, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. As you have heard me say many times, research and development is the heartbeat of our company. It enable us to both invent and manufacture cutting-edge, relevant and unique products for our customers. This in turn drives organic growth, which is our primary growth metric and also supports our premium margins and return on invested capital. 
Last year, in addition to investing in technology development, we took action to better connect our scientific capabilities to our customers around the world. We opened 6 new Customer Technical Centers, including in West Europe, Middle East/Africa and Asia Pacific. We also opened our new state-of-the-art research laboratory in United States, which we look forward to showing you at our investor day in March.
Our third lever, business transformation, starts and ends with our customers. It's about transforming our business processes to make it easier and quicker for our customers to do business with us anywhere around the world. The backbone of business transformation is our new global ERP system. In 2015, we made good progress, most recently with the successful rollout in the Nordic countries.
We also announced the creation of 3 global service centers, which will optimize our delivery of transactional services and service a broader platform for operational effectiveness into the future. We expect business transformation to result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion reduction in working capital.
That covers all 3 levers, and I'm very pleased with our progress in all of them. In addition to work we did on those levels, we made other investment to position 3M for success in both the short and long term. As we have talked about before, we run our company with one eye on the microscope and the other eye on the telescope, or in other words, making sure we are positioned for success today and many years into the future.
Let me give you 2 examples. First, on the telescope view, we made a significant investment related to our brand equity. Our 3M brand is strong and last year, we invested in the new brand platform: 3M Science. Applied to Life., to make it even stronger. This will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to solve problems for our customers, which go back to our vision of improving every company, every home and every life.
Next, on the microscope view, we completed a corporate restructuring focused on structural overhead and slower growing markets, which will help us manage through the current economic realities. And we made all these investments last year while also return $8 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
When I look upon all we accomplished in 2015, it was a fundamentally important year for the future of our enterprise. As you can see, we are continuing to build an even stronger, more competitive company that will win in 2016 and beyond. And on Slide 14, you will see our planning estimates for this year, which are unchanged from December's Outlook Meeting. 
We estimate earnings per share in the range of $8.10 to $8.45, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be 1% to 3%, with acquisitions adding 1% to sales. Finally, we expect our free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%.
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

And at the time we guided this in December, we saw virtually all of that benefit coming in the first half of 2016. We still see it heavily weighted to the first half of 2016, but we can see some of that benefit, if oil stays in this range, coming into the second half as well."

And we have also to think about it that Central/East Europe, that growth rate was very much price that came out from our action we took in Russia. So Central/East Europe, Middle East/Africa, take that portion of it, generally speaking, it's a challenging environment geopolitically then we then have to be careful of. And West Europe, you see some spots of growth, but I think the very important thing there is that Germany, the machine of Germany start to deliver a little bit more growth, then we maybe can see a little bit more then. I think we are well prepared in that part of the world due to work that we have done for the last, I have to say, maybe the last 5 years of streamlined organization, taking out structure, bigger span of control and lower levels in the organization, et cetera, in terms of management.

And there's an integration of those businesses into what I would call display technologies, which is a goal for the future for us to expand into. And we have already products that is going into equipment that are using OLED. So we are not behind in any ways. We have, on every -- I would say every equipment today that are using OLED, we have multiple applications in them and there's more to come in that area.

We have -- we are very strong in United States in our Consumer business. So we have a stronger and better penetration in United States than we have outside of United States. So that is also then talking to our opportunities as we move ahead to expand more with Consumer outside of United States. If you look upon United States specifically and you look upon data and facts, which will -- is a key indicator for us relative to potential growth rates, we all know that there is a challenge on IPI as we go into 2016. And the fact there is saying that it's a slow Q1, Q2, maybe Q3 and then Q4, it will pick up again on IPI year-over-year. If you look upon retail sales index, it's actually different. It's very robust as we go in already to Q1 and Q2 and for the rest of the year. So I would say that our business there is in a good position, and we feel very good about it. We have very good brands. We have very -- we add a lot of value into the channels, and we are managing a lot of categories in that business. The same go for Health Care. Health Care is the same. Health Care, for us -- I'm not talking U.S. versus outside of U.S. there. I'm talking about developed economies versus developing economies. And 80% of our portfolio in Health Care is in developed economies. Meaning, developing is still a huge opportunity for us, and we are growing very well there. And our margins are very high. So I think that's coming back to -- in times like this, where you see some challenges in some economies around the world, if that's in Industrial or electronics or even in safety, we have the advantage that we have domestic-driven businesses in Consumer and Health Care that is carries on. And you saw that this quarter again. Health Care had almost 5% organic local currency, or the strongest for the year and with margin expansion. It's just a fantastic business for us, and the same go for Consumer. So we feel very, very good about them and it's sustainable. I think that's the important thing. That it is a sustainable business model for us, based on world-class product solutions."

I think it would be very similar in Q1 versus Q4. There's some businesses doing very well. Automotive OEM and purification doing extremely well. But we have also to think about it in terms of growth on a global base. So United States, there was pressure this quarter, down 6, but we were growing in many other cases around the world. And I think that's important to think about in terms of us as a global growth company. So we had organic growth in India, China. We grew 6% in China. If you think about that, it's a big market, second biggest subsidiary for 3M outside of the United States and the second biggest economy in the world. Still, for us, our Industrial business in the quarter, 6% growth. We had 3% growth in Japan, and United States was an issue. So I think we have to balance it out in terms of how we look upon the future here. And we have decided and we are a global-growth company.

We had opportunity to see many of you last month at our investor day, where we laid out 3M's new 5-year plan. We also updated you on the 3M playbook and how it is being executed across our enterprise to deliver efficient growth both today and into the future. In the first quarter, the 3M team continued to execute our playbook and deliver another strong operational performance. We increased margins more than 4 [ph] percentage point and improved our cash flow generation by 20% year-over-year. At the same time, we continue to invest in the business including opening a new world-class laboratory in the United States while also returning cash to our shareholders. Looking at the numbers, we posted first quarter earnings of $2.05 per share, which is an increase of 11% year-over-year. Please note that this includes a $0.10 earnings benefit related to a new accounting standard that 3M adopted in the first quarter, and Nick will provide more details during his comments. Adjusting for this impact, we delivered Q1 earnings of $1.95 per share. Company-wide, organic growth was down slightly at minus 1%. Three of our business groups grew organically in the quarter led by health care at 6%, with strong organic growth across all its businesses. Our consumer business, which is the home to some of 3M's most iconic brand also delivered a good quarter of organic growth. 
I'm very pleased that our 2 domestic-driven businesses, Health Care and Consumer, continue to do well and are off to a very good start in 2016. Safety and Graphics also posted solid organic growth with particular strengths in commercial solutions and personal safety. Organic growth in our Industrial business was down low single digits which was similar to last quarter. And as expected, Electronics and Energy declined low double digits. Electronics and Energy continued to be impacted by softness in the consumer electronics markets, which we expect to persist through the first half of the year. 
Acquisitions net of divestitures added 2 percentage points to first quarter sales, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 3%. As a result, our company total sales was $7.4 billion, down 2% year-on-year. Our ability to consistently deliver premium margins remains a hallmark of 3M and is an important element of our focus on driving efficient growth. In the first quarter, we posted margins of 24%, up more than a full percentage point versus last year. Without the impact from last year's fourth quarter restructuring, we have expanded margins year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters. Also in the quarter, we returned nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes an 8% increase in our first quarter dividend which marks 3M's 58th consecutive year of dividend increases. All in all, we had a good start to the year, with results that were in line with our expectations. 
Please turn to Slide 4. In addition to a strong financial performance in the quarter, we also made good progress on our 3 key levers, starting with portfolio management. After strategic review of our Health Information Systems business, we decided that we could create the greatest value by retaining and further invest in that business. In fact, we plan to accelerate the investment across our entire global Health Care business, in research and development, health economics, and commercialization capabilities to build strings on strings in both developed and developing markets. In February, we saw the Polyfoam business, which was a small non-core segment, within our Industrial business group. Earlier, I mentioned the ongoing softness in the electronics markets. As you know, over the last few years, we have consolidated a number of businesses within Electronics and Energy, which has made us more relevant to our customers, more agile, and more efficient. Today, we're announcing further actions to build upon that work. This action will reduce 250 positions worldwide with the majority of reductions on the electronics side of the business and result in an estimated Q2 charge of $20 million. This will further position Electronics and Energy for long-term success, and going forward, this business will continue to stay close to customers, advancing technology capabilities and increase productivity. Investing in innovation is the second lever, and in the first quarter, we invest a nearly $0.5 billion in research and development. Research and development supports organic growth and premium returns, and as you recall, we continue to step up investment in R&D from 5.5% of sales closer to 6%. In March, we also opened our new laboratory in the United States, which many of you had opportunity to see at our Investor Day. It will house 750 off-scientists who will leverage our 46 technology platforms to create unique cutting edge solutions for our customers. Finally, in the first quarter, we continued to march forward with business transformation, which is our third lever. We had a successful ERP deployment in Germany and remain focused on executing the rollout plan across Europe. Business transformation, which starts and ends with our customers, is important for our future especially as it relates to efficient growth. We expect these efforts to result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion in working capital improvement. 
Overall, as I look at the quarter, we continue to execute the 3M playbook and deliver the strong performance in terms of both financial results and building our enterprise for the future. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick?"

I'll start on Slide 5 with a recap of our first quarter sales change. Organic local currency sales declined 0.8% in the first quarter, with volumes down 1.7%, partially offset by a 0.9% increase in selling prices.",2098,"Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 5 with a recap of our first quarter sales change. Organic local currency sales declined 0.8% in the first quarter, with volumes down 1.7%, partially offset by a 0.9% increase in selling prices. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 1.6 percentage points to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety, Membrana and Ivera Medical, along with the divestitures of Library Systems, Polyfoam and the license plate converting business in France. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 3%. In U.S. dollars, total sales declined 2.2% versus the first quarter of 2015. 
In the United States, organic growth was up 0.3% with strong performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely Health Care and Consumer. Industrial production in the U.S. declined 1.3% in Q1, which impacted the growth in parts of our Industrial business. Organic growth in Asia Pacific was down 5.6%. Three of 5 business groups posted positive growth in the region, again, led by Health Care and Consumer. Soft and market demand and excess channel inventories in Consumer Electronics resulted in a double-digit organic growth decline in Electronics and Energy. Within Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 4% in China/Hong Kong and declined 8% in Japan. Excluding our Electronics business, Japan and China/Hong Kong were both flat.  Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.7%, West Europe was up slightly, and the combination of Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa was up high single digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 4.2%. Mexico, again, had a strong quarter, with 10% organic growth, and Brazil also posted positive organic growth of 2%. 
Please turn to Slide 6 for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.4 billion, operating income increased more than 3% to $1.8 billion and earnings rose 10.8% to $2.05 per share. As Inge mentioned, we had another strong margin performance in the first quarter, up 130 basis points to 24.1%. Let's take a closer look at the first quarter margin improvement. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices added 110 basis points to first quarter margins. We continue to benefit from both lower commodity prices and from our global sourcing team's ongoing efforts to reduce costs. Lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by 100 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year's fourth quarter restructuring contributed 40 basis points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margin 10 basis points as we began to take actions in our lean manufacturing footprint and increased growth investments. Foreign currency net of hedge gains brought margins down another 10 basis points and first-year acquisitions reduced margins by 20 basis points. The year-on-year decline in organic volume reduced margins by 30 basis points. And finally, utilization and other was a net 50 basis point headwind to margins. This included the impact of lower asset utilization, particularly in our Electronics and Industrial businesses, which was partially offset by divestiture gains in the quarter. Also, we continue to increase investments across the business to drive growth and strength in our competitiveness going forward. All in, we have started the year with a positive note with respect to margins and continue to expect approximately 150 basis points of margin improvement for the full year, which reflects our focus on delivering efficient growth. 
Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look of earnings per share. As stated earlier, earnings for the first quarter were $2.05 per share, an increase of 10.8%. Margin expansion net of organic sales declines contributed $0.04 to earnings in the quarter. First-year acquisitions and day researchers added $0.07 to earnings per share. This result was driven by solid performances from Membrana, Capital Safety and Ivera, along with divestiture gains in the quarter. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduce pretax earnings by $48 million or the equivalent of $0.05 a share. Higher balance sheet leverage led to an increase in net interest expense year-on-year, reducing per-share earnings by $0.02. The first quarter tax rate was 26.8% versus 29.5% in the comparable quarter, which increased Q1 earnings by $0.07 per share. The lower Q1 tax rate includes the adoption of a new FASB accounting standard, which I'll walk through in a moment. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% year-on-year, which added $0.09 to first quarter earnings per share. 
Please turn to Slide 8. On March 30th of this year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards update related to employee share-based payments. This new standard changes the recording of additional tax savings or charges when employees realize benefits from stock-based compensation. The additional tax impact is a result of the change in the value of stock-based compensation. From the time it is granted to an employee to the time it is realized by the employee. Previously, these additional tax impacts were recognized in the equity section on the balance sheet. Going forward, it will be recognized on the income statement. All U.S. public companies are required to adopt the new accounting standard no later than the 2017 fiscal year. We chose to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 2016, which created a first quarter tax benefit of $0.10 per share, net of tax costs related to global cash optimization actions. For the full year, we expect no impact to our tax rate and earnings per share guidance as additional actions we chose to implement to further optimize our global cash position will increase our tax expense in the last 3 quarters of the year. 
Let's now turn to our first quarter cash flow performance on Slide 9. Overall, we posted another solid cash flow performance in Q1. Free cash flow conversion was 74%, up 8 percentage points versus the same period last year. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, a $180 million increase versus Q1 in 2015. The primary drivers of the increase were improved inventories and accounts receivable, along with lower cash taxes. Capital expenditures were $314 million as we continued to invest in the business to drive efficient growth. For the full year, we expect CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. The strength of our business model allows us to invest in growth and also return cash to shareholders. As you heard earlier, we increased our first quarter per-share dividend by 8%, which increased our payout to $672 million in the quarter. In addition to dividends, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through gross share repurchases. 
Let's now review our first quarter performance on a business by business basis. Please go to Slide 10. Our Industrial business group posted quarterly sales of $2.6 billion. First quarter organic growth in our Industrial business was down 1.9%, with mid-single-digit declines in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. As mentioned earlier, the U.S. Industrial production index was down 1.3% in the first quarter, which impacted parts of our Industrial business. Our Advanced Materials business declined low double digits, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas end market. Conversely, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits, continuing its strong track record of outpacing global car and light truck builds. We also posted positive organic growth in our Automotive Aftermarket business in the quarter. The acquisition of Membrana net of the Polyfoam divestiture, added 1.9% to Industrial sales growth. We are pleased with the smooth integration of Membrana into 3M, and the business continues to exceed its financial performance objectives. Industrial increased its margins 150 basis points to 23.9%, posting operating income of $617 million. 
Please turn to Slide 11. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were up 2.4% organically to $1.4 billion. Commercial solutions delivered solid organic growth with particular strength in Latin America and the U.S. Personal Safety, one of our Heartland businesses, also had a good quarter of organic growth led by EMEA and Asia Pacific. Our Roofing Granules business also posted strong growth in the quarter. Acquisitions net of the researchers added 4.5 percentage points to sales growth in the quarter. This result includes Capital Safety, along with the impact from the divestitures of library systems and the license plate converting business in France. Geographically, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was broad-based, paced by a mid-single-digit increase in Asia Pacific. Operating income for the business was $345 million, and operating margins were a solid 24.5%. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered an outstanding quarter from top to bottom. The business generated sales of $1.4 billion and led our company's organic growth at 6.2%. Growth was broad-based, with all businesses and geographic areas up mid-single digits or greater year-on-year. Health Information Systems and Food Safety both posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter, and our Medical Consumables and Oral Care businesses each delivered solid mid-single-digit growth in Q1. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 90 basis points to first quarter sales growth year-on-year. This business is performing very well and exceeding its financial performance objectives. Our Health Care business delivered 13% organic growth in developing markets in the quarter, with particular strength in China/Hong Kong, Mexico and Russia. Operating income was $455 million, up 12% versus last year's first quarter, and margins were strong at 32.9%. As you can see from this quarter's results, our Health Care business continued its track record of strong performance. And as Inge mentioned, we are increasing investments across the business to drive efficient growth into the future. 
Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13. First quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.1 billion, down 11.7% organically, and in line with what we communicated at our March Investor Day. On the Electronics side of the business, organic sales were down 18%. The decline was due to a combination of factors including soft end market demand, elevated channel inventory and a challenging year-on-year comparison. Our team remains focused on increasing relevance with customers and driving spec and wins wins to deliver organic growth as the industry improves. Our Energy related businesses were down 1% organically, with growth in Electrical Markets being offset by declines in Telcom as well as Renewable Energy. As a reminder, in last year's Q4, we took portfolio actions within the Renewable Energy business. These actions negatively impacted Q1 organic growth but have improved profitability in this business. Within Electrical Markets, our ACCR overhead conductor business posted strong double-digit growth. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double digits in Asia Pacific where our Electronics business is concentrated. First quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $208 million, with margins of 18.2%, down 330 basis points, largely volume-related. Looking towards the full year, we now expect Electronics and Energy to decline organically in the low to mid-single digit range. As Inge mentioned, we are taking actions in the second quarter to further position the business for long-term success. 
I'll finish with our Consumer business on Slide 14. Consumer had another solid quarter, with sales of $1 billion and organic growth increasing 2.8% year-on-year. Sales grew organically in 3 of our 4 businesses led by Home Improvement and Consumer Health Care. Across the bottom of this slide, you see just a few of the market-leading brands that are powering our Consumer portfolio. Within the Home Improvement business, our Command Damage-Free mounting products posted strong double-digit growth as accelerated investments continue to pay off. ScotchBlue Painter's Tape and Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter. Our Consumer Health Care business posted solid first quarter organic growth, as the growing trend of active lifestyles continue to drive strong demand for our ACE and Futuro braces and support products. Geographically, organic growth was paced by Asia Pacific, driven by double-digit growth in China/Hong Kong, along with solid mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. Operating income was $238 million, with operating margins of 22.7%, both similar to last year's first quarter. 
On Slide 15, we are reaffirming our 2016 planning estimates. We estimate earnings in the range of $8.10 to $8.45 per share, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be up 1% to 3%, with acquisitions net of divestitures adding 1% of sales. We estimate that foreign currency translation will reduce sales by 1% to 3%. Finally, our tax rate is still expected to be 29.5% to 30.5%, with free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. 
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

Well, first of all, it was a little bit -- the slowest business for us in the quarter, but not much of a surprise if you go back and think about our Investor Day when we talked about it in terms of what we expected for the first quarter. Now the electronic part was down 18%, which was, I would say, is all based on a weaker near-term demand in terms of consumer electronics. So from that perspective, not a surprise for us but I think as we look out for the next quarter, we have to expect in the second quarter mid-to-high single growth down. And I think for the year, low- to mid-single. So I think that's how you have to think about the business group. And I will say that in terms of the portfolio, this is a very, very good business for us because we have all the components in order for us to be competitive in this marketplace, and we have worked on the business in order to be more relevant now for 4 years. And as you can see, here in this quarter, we take some more actions in order to line up our business model versus what is required in that business. So I will say, first of all, all businesses, portfolio management is an ongoing process. We look upon that the whole time. But the fundamentals for us to be in this business is very, very good and very, very strong, it's just that we have to adjust as we go and on the fly and I think that's what we're doing here, right. But for me and for us, it's more a near-term weaker demand in consumer electronics as we speak."

It's both in developed and developing markets and we've seen in all businesses. And we will now continue to accelerate that investment as we move ahead. So it's not only health information systems that we decided to keep in our portfolio. Investing in, we will invest in all of our businesses. As I laid out, it is around research and development, it's about health economics and it's about commercialization capabilities. Those 3 things in the combination is very, very powerful for us. And think about it as well in terms of developed versus developing. Our position is very strong in the developed world, and we continue to take market share and we penetrate even deeper there. In developing, the field starts to open up for us because key opinion leaders are recommending our protocols, including our products, around the world. So we have a very strong position there. And you can think about this in terms of our fastest growing business with the highest margins. We are pleased with the margins but we are in that -- we will accelerate to the investment there to get growth up even further."

And the reason for that is everything you have to do around brand equity in Consumer take a little bit longer time. So when you compare the 2 of them, we will see a faster acceleration for Health Care versus Consumer, but both of them are growing very, very well. And I will not say that in terms of outcome, yes, we see both of them coming stronger now than versus a year ago. But we have been on this for quite some time. And it's often a realization of change of brand equity position for Consumer. And then it's a question about money availability for Health Care. So our solutions are very advanced, and is very much driven based on health economics. And as countries get bigger budget and can spend more into Health Care, they are shifting from less advanced solutions to solutions like 3M can provide. So that's what we believe, that both Health Care and Consumer has great future for us in that part of the world. And as you look upon our mix, there's also 2 of our businesses that mix in the portfolio, that we have less penetration and less sales in developing versus developed market for those 2 businesses. So the future look good. It's up to us now to execute and do that as fast and possible."

So you're talking about research and development, investment to that business and so forth. Advantage in that business is if you took, think about the electronics, very much of that is spec-ins right. So we work direct with our customers in order to make sure we find solutions for them. That's actually a very powerful model if you think about it. So we have 2 processes in the company, one called idea to innovation, i2i, which is more for consumables and then you have customer inspired innovation which is a model where you work direct with one specific customer. So if that is in aerospace, that is automotive, if that is consumer-electronics or wherever that it is right into one specific customer. The strengths of that model is that you know exactly the outcome of that model. You don't work on something that is broad-based from a market perspective that eventually will take place. You know it will take place in this customer inspired innovation. If you don't come to a solution, you kill it very early. So I'm very confident in that model. That is why that is very good business from 3M because we can provide through our technology platforms multiple solutions that will generate better and more competitive products for our customers. Answer for that I am very confident in the research and development into that model. And we can adjust, of course, based on what they are requiring. So that's an important element on the electronic side. On the Energy side, it's a model that we are using in the normal industrial production or in consumer, et cetera, where you have a bigger market space that you need to serve and when you get the input from customer panels, et cetera. So the business is always built on research and development. And that is the heartbeat of 3M. That is also why we're able to generate very good returns to our investors because we are not commoditized. We don't work with those customers in order to replace something that is already in their devices today. We try to move it to the next level together with them. That is the power of it."

We had opportunity to see many of you last month at our Investor Day, where we laid out 3M's new 5-year plan. We also updated you on the 3M playbook and how it is being executed across our enterprise to deliver efficient growth both today and into the future. 
In the first quarter, the 3M team continued to execute our playbook and delivered another strong operational performance. We increased margins more than a full percentage point and improved our cash flow generation by 20% year-over-year. At the same time, we continue to invest in the business, including opening a new world-class laboratory in the United States, while also returning cash to our shareholders. 
Looking at the numbers, we posted first quarter earnings of $2.05 per share, which is an increase of 11% year-over-year. Please note that this includes a $0.10 earnings benefit related to a new accounting standard that 3M adopted in the first quarter, and Nick will provide more details during his comments. Adjusting for this impact, we delivered Q1 earnings of $1.95 per share.  Company-wide organic growth was down slightly at minus 1%. 
Three of our business groups grew organically in the quarter, led by health care at 6%, with strong organic growth across all its businesses. Our consumer business, which is the home to some of 3M's most iconic brands, also delivered a good quarter of organic growth. 
I'm very pleased that our 2 domestic-driven businesses, Health Care and Consumer, continued to do well and are off to a very good start in 2016. Safety and Graphics also posted solid organic growth with particular strengths in commercial solutions and personal safety. 
Organic growth in our Industrial business was down low single digits, which was similar to last quarter. And as expected, Electronics and Energy declined low double digits. Electronics and Energy continued to be impacted by softness in the consumer electronics markets, which we expect to persist through the first half of the year. 
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 2 percentage points to first quarter sales, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 3%. As a result, our company total sales was $7.4 billion, down 2% year-on-year. Our ability to consistently deliver premium margins remains a hallmark of 3M, and it's an important element of our focus on driving efficient growth. 
In the first quarter, we posted margins of 24%, up more than a full percentage point versus last year. Without the impact from last year's fourth quarter restructuring, we have expanded margins year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters. Also in the quarter, we returned nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes an 8% increase in our first quarter dividend, which marked 3M's 58th consecutive year of dividend increases. All in all, we had a good start to the year, with results that were in line with our expectations. 
Please turn to Slide 4. In addition to a strong financial performance in the quarter, we also made good progress on our 3 key levers, starting with portfolio management. After strategic review of our health information systems business, we decided that we could create the greatest value by retaining and further invest in that business. In fact, we plan to accelerate the investment across our entire global health care business, in research and development, health economics and commercialization capabilities, to build strings on strings in both developed and developing markets. 
In February, we saw the Polyfoam business, which was a small noncore segment within our Industrial business group. Earlier, I mentioned the ongoing softness in the electronics markets. As you know, over the last few years, we have consolidated a number of businesses within Electronics and Energy, which has made us more relevant to our customers, more agile, and more efficient. Today, we are announcing further actions to build upon that work. This action will reduce 250 positions worldwide, with a majority of reductions on the electronics side of the business, and result in an estimated Q2 charge of $20 million. This will further position Electronics and Energy for long-term success, and going forward, this business will continue to stay close to customers, advance its technology capabilities and increase productivity. 
Investing in innovation is the second lever, and in the first quarter, we invest a nearly $0.5 billion in research and development. Research and development supports organic growth and premium returns, and as you recall, we continue to step up investment in R&D from 5.5% of sales closer to 6%. 
In March, we also opened our new laboratory in the United States, which many of you had opportunity to see at our Investor Day. It will house 750 off-scientists, who will leverage our 46 technology platforms to create unique cutting-edge solutions for our customers. 
Finally, in the first quarter, we continued to march forward with business transformation, which is our third lever. We had a successful ERP deployment in Germany and remain focused on executing rollout plan across Europe. Business transformation, which starts and ends with our customers, is important for our future especially as it relates to efficient growth. We expect these efforts to result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion in working capital improvement. 
Overall, as I look at the quarter, we continued to execute the 3M playbook and deliver the strong performance in terms of both financial results and building our enterprise for the future. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick?"

I'll start on Slide 5 with a recap of our first quarter sales change. Organic local currency sales declined 0.8% in the first quarter with volumes down 1.7%, partially offset by a 0.9% increase in selling prices",2088,"Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 5 with a recap of our first quarter sales change. 
Organic local currency sales declined 0.8% in the first quarter with volumes down 1.7%, partially offset by a 0.9% increase in selling prices. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 1.6 percentage points to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety, Membrana and Ivera Medical, along with the divestitures of Library Systems, Polyfoam and a license plate converting business in France. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 3%.  
In U.S. dollars, total sales declined 2.2% versus the first quarter of 2015.  In the United States, organic growth was up 0.3% with strong performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely Health Care and Consumer. 
Industrial production in the U.S. declined 1.3% in Q1, which impacted the growth in parts of our Industrial business. Organic growth in Asia Pacific was down 5.6%. Three of 5 business groups posted positive growth in the region, again, led by Health Care and Consumer. 
Soft end-market demand and excess channel inventories in consumer electronics resulted in a double-digit organic growth decline in Electronics and Energy. Within Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 4% in China/Hong Kong and declined 8% in Japan. Excluding our electronics business, Japan and China/Hong Kong were both flat.  
Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.7%. West Europe was up slightly. And the combination of Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa was up high single digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 4.2%. Mexico again had a strong quarter with 10% organic growth, and Brazil also posted positive organic growth of 2%. 
Please turn to Slide 6 for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.4 billion. Operating income increased more than 3% to $1.8 billion and earnings rose 10.8% to $2.05 per share. As Inge mentioned, we had another strong margin performance in the first quarter, up 130 basis points to 24.1%. 
Let's take a closer look at the first quarter margin improvements. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices added 110 basis points to first quarter margins. We continue to benefit from both lower commodity prices and from our Global Sourcing Team's ongoing efforts to reduce costs. Lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by 100 basis points. 
Productivity gains related to last year's fourth quarter restructuring contributed 40 basis points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margin 10 basis points, as we began to take actions in our lean manufacturing footprints and increased growth investments. 
Foreign currency net of hedge gains brought margins down another 10 basis points and first-year acquisitions reduced margins by 20 basis points. The year-on-year decline in organic volume reduced margins by 30 basis points. And finally, utilization and other was a net 50 basis point headwind to margins. This included the impact of lower asset utilization, particularly in our electronics and industrial businesses, which was partially offset by divestiture gains in the quarter. 
Also, we continue to increase investments across the business to drive growth and strengthen our competitiveness going forward. All in, we have started the year on a positive note with respect to margins and continue to expect approximately 150 basis points of margin improvement for the full year, which reflects our focus on delivering efficient growth. 
Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. As stated earlier, earnings for the first quarter were $2.05 per share, an increase of 10.8%. Margin expansion, net of organic sales declines, contributed $0.04 to earnings in the quarter. 
First year acquisitions and divestitures added $0.07 to earnings per share. This result was driven by solid performances from Membrana, Capital Safety and Ivera, along with divestiture gains in the quarter. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduce pretax earnings by $48 million or the equivalent of $0.05 a share. 
Higher balance sheet leverage led to an increase in net interest expense year-on-year, reducing per-share earnings by $0.02. The first quarter tax rate was 26.8% versus 29.5% in the comparable quarter, which increased Q1 earnings by $0.07 per share. The lower Q1 tax rate includes the adoption of a new FASB accounting standard, which I'll walk through in a moment. 
Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% year-on-year, which added $0.09 to first quarter earnings per share. 
Please turn to Slide 8. On March 30th of this year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards update related to employee share-based payments. This new standard changes the recording of additional tax savings or charges, when employees realize benefits from stock-based compensation. The additional tax impact is a result of the change in the value of stock-based compensation, from the time it is granted to an employee to the time it is realized by the employee. Previously, these additional tax impacts were recognized in the Equity section on the balance sheet. 
Going forward, it will be recognized on the income statement. All U.S. public companies are required to adopt the new accounting standard no later than the 2017 fiscal year. We chose to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 2016, which created a first quarter tax benefit of $0.10 per share, net of tax cost  related to global cash optimization actions. 
For the full year, we expect no impact to our tax rate and earnings per share guidance, as additional actions we chose to implement to further optimize our global cash position will increase our tax expense in the last 3 quarters of the year.  Let's now turn to our first quarter cash flow performance on Slide 9. 
Overall, we posted another solid cash flow performance in Q1. Free cash flow conversion was 74%, up 8 percentage points versus the same period last year. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, a $180 million increase versus Q1 in 2015. The primary drivers of the increase were improved inventories and accounts receivable, along with lower cash taxes. 
Capital expenditures were $314 million, as we continued to invest in the business to drive efficient growth. For the full year, we expect CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. 
The strength of our business model allows us to invest in growth and also return cash to shareholders. As you heard earlier, we increased our first quarter per-share dividend by 8%, which increased our payout to $672 million in the quarter. In addition to dividends, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through gross share repurchases. 
Let's now review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide 10. Our Industrial business group posted quarterly sales of $2.6 billion. First quarter organic growth in our Industrial business was down 1.9%, with mid-single-digit declines in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. As mentioned earlier, the U.S. industrial production index was down 1.3% in the first quarter, which impacted parts of our Industrial business. Our Advanced Materials business declined low double digits, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas end-market. Conversely, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits, continuing its strong track record of outpacing global car and light truck builds. 
We also posted positive organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business in the quarter. The acquisition of Membrana, net of the Polyfoam divestiture, added 1.9% to Industrial sales growth. We are pleased with the smooth integration of Membrana into 3M, and the business continues to exceed its financial performance objectives. Industrial increased its margins 150 basis points to 23.9%, posting operating income of $617 million. 
Please turn to Slide 11. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were up 2.4% organically to $1.4 billion. 
Commercial solutions delivered solid organic growth with particular strength in Latin America and the U.S. 
Personal Safety, one of our Heartland businesses, also had a good quarter of organic growth led by EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Our Roofing Granules business also posted strong growth in the quarter. 
Acquisitions net of divestitures added 4.5 percentage points to sales growth in the quarter. This result includes Capital Safety, along with the impact from the divestitures of library systems and the license plate converting business in France. Geographically, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was broad-based, paced by a mid-single-digit increase in Asia Pacific. Operating income for the business was $345 million, and operating margins were a solid 24.5%. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered an outstanding quarter from top to bottom. The business generated sales of $1.4 billion and led our company's organic growth at 6.2%. Growth was broad-based with all businesses and geographic areas up mid-single digits or greater year-on-year. 
Health Information Systems and Food Safety both posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter. And our medical consumables and oral care businesses, each delivered solid mid-single-digit growth in Q1. 
The Ivera Medical acquisition added 90 basis points to first quarter sales growth year-on-year. This business is performing very well and exceeding its financial performance objectives. 
Our Health Care business delivered 13% organic growth in developing markets in the quarter, with particular strength in China/Hong Kong, Mexico and Russia. Operating income was $455 million, up 12% versus last year's first quarter, and margins were strong at 32.9%. As you can see from this quarter's results, our Health Care business continued its track record of strong performance. And as Inge mentioned, we are increasing investments across the business to drive efficient growth into the future. 
Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13. First quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.1 billion, down 11.7% organically, and in line with what we communicated at our March Investor Day. On the Electronics side of the business, organic sales were down 18%. The decline was due to a combination of factors, including soft end-market demand, elevated channel inventory and a challenging year-on-year comparison. Our team remains focused on increasing relevance with customers and driving spec and wins to deliver organic growth, as the industry improves. 
Our energy-related businesses were down 1% organically with growth in electrical markets being offset by declines in telcom as well as renewable energy. As a reminder, in last year's Q4, we took portfolio actions within the renewable energy business. These actions negatively impacted Q1 organic growth but have improved profitability in this business. 
Within Electrical Markets, our ACCR overhead conductor business posted strong double-digit growth. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double digits in Asia Pacific, where our electronics business is concentrated. 
First quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $208 million, with margins of 18.2%, down 330 basis points, largely volume-related.  Looking towards the full year, we now expect Electronics and Energy to decline organically in the low- to mid-single-digit range. As Inge mentioned, we are taking actions in the second quarter to further position the business for long-term success. 
I'll finish with our Consumer business on Slide 14. Consumer had another solid quarter with sales of $1 billion and organic growth increasing 2.8% year-on-year. Sales grew organically in 3 of our 4 businesses, led by Home Improvement and Consumer Health Care. Across the bottom of this slide, you see just a few of the market-leading brands that are powering our Consumer portfolio. Within the Home Improvement business, our Command damage-free mounting products posted strong double-digit growth, as accelerated investments continue to pay off. ScotchBlue painter's tape and Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter. 
Our Consumer Health Care business posted solid first quarter organic growth, as the growing trend of active lifestyles continue to drive strong demand for our ACE and FUTURO braces and support products. Geographically, organic growth was paced by Asia Pacific, driven by double-digit growth in China/Hong Kong, along with solid mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. Operating income was $238 million with operating margins of 22.7%, both similar to last year's first quarter. 
On Slide 15, we are reaffirming our 2016 planning estimates. We estimate earnings in the range of $8.10 to $8.45 per share, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be up 1% to 3%, with acquisitions net of divestitures adding 1% of sales. We estimate that foreign currency translation will reduce sales by 1% to 3%. Finally, our tax rate is still expected to be 29.5% to 30.5% with free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. 
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

Now the electronic part was down 18%, which was, I would say, is all based on a weaker near-term demand in terms of consumer electronics. So from that perspective, not a surprise for us, but, I think, as we look out for the next quarter, we have to expect in the second quarter mid- to high single growth down, and I think for the year, low to mid-single. So I think that's how you have to think about the business group. And I will say that in terms of the portfolio, this is a very, very good business for us because we have all the components in order for us to be competitive in this marketplace. And we have worked on the business in order to be more relevant now for 4 years, and as you can see here in this quarter, we take some more actions in order to line up our business model versus what is required in that business. So I will say, first of all, all businesses -- portfolio management is an ongoing process. We look upon that the whole time. But the fundamental for us to be in this business is very, very good and very, very strong, is just that we have to adjust as we go and on the fly. And I think that's what we're doing here, right? But for me and for us, it's more a near-term weaker demand in consumer electronics as we speak."

And we will now continue to accelerate that investment as we move ahead. So it's not only health information systems that we decided to keep in our portfolio investing, it's we will invest in all of our businesses. And as I laid out, it is around research and development, it's about health economics, and it's about commercialization capabilities. Those 3 things in the combination is very, very powerful for us. And think about it as well in terms of developed versus developing, our position is very strong in the developed world, and we continue to take market share and we penetrate even deeper there. In developing, the field start to open up for us because key opinion leaders are recommending our protocols, including our products, around the world. So we have a very strong position there.

And the way we should think about this is in terms of the acceleration of growth, by definition, will go faster in Health Care than in Consumer. And the reason for that is everything you have to do around brand equity, in Consumer, take a little bit longer time. So when you compare the 2 of them, we would see a faster acceleration for Health Care versus Consumer, but both of them are growing very, very well. And I would not say that in terms of outcome, yes, we see both of them coming stronger now than versus a year ago. But we have been on this for quite some time, and it's often a realization of change of brand equity position for Consumer, and then it's a question about money availability for Health Care. So our solutions are very advanced and it's very much driven based on health economics. And as countries get bigger budget and can spend more into Health Care, they are shifting from less-advanced solution to solutions like 3M can provide. So that's what we believe that both Health Care and Consumer has a great future for us in that part of the world. And as you look up on our mix, there's also 2 of our businesses that mix in the portfolio, we have less penetration and less sales in developing versus developed market for those 2 businesses. So the future look good. It's up to us now to execute and do that as fast and as possible."

So you're talking about research and development, investment to that business and so forth. The advantage in that business is, if you took -- think about the electronics, very much of that is spec-ins, right? So we work direct with our customers in order to make sure we find solutions for them. That's actually a very powerful model if you think about it. So we have 2 processes in the company: one called Idea to Innovation, i2i, which is more for consumables; and then you have customer-inspired innovation, which is a model where you work direct with one specific customer. So if that is in aerospace, that is in automotive, if that's consumer electronics, or wherever that is, it's right into one specific customer. The strength of that model is that you know exactly the outcome of that model. You don't work on something that is broad-based from a market perspective that eventually will take place. You know it will take place in this customer-inspired innovation. And if you don't come to solution, you kill it very early. So I'm very confident in that model. And that is why that is very good business from 3M because we can provide, through our technology platforms, multiple solutions that will generate better and more competitive product for our customers. So the answer to that is, very confident in the research and development into that model. And we can adjust, of course, based on what they are requiring. So that's an important element on the electronic side. On the Energy side, it's a model that we are using in the normal industrial production or in consumer, et cetera, where you have a bigger market space that you need to serve and where you use -- where you get the input from customer panels, et cetera. So the business is always built on research and development. And that is the heartbeat of 3M. That is also why we are able to generate very good returns to our investors because we are not commoditized. We don't work with those customers in order to replace something that is already in their devices today. We try to move it to the next level together with them. That is the power of it."

We had opportunity to see many of you last month at our Investor Day, where we laid out 3M's new 5-year plan. We also updated you on the 3M playbook and how it is being executed across our enterprise to deliver efficient growth both today and into the future. 
In the first quarter, the 3M team continued to execute our playbook and delivered another strong operational performance. We increased margins more than a full percentage point and improved our cash flow generation by 20% year-over-year. At the same time, we continued to invest in the business, including opening a new world-class laboratory in the United States, while also returning cash to our shareholders. 
Looking at the numbers, we posted first quarter earnings of $2.05 per share, which is an increase of 11% year-over-year. Please note that this includes a $0.10 earnings benefit related to a new accounting standard that 3M adopted in the first quarter, and Nick will provide more details during his comments. Adjusting for this impact, we delivered Q1 earnings of $1.95 per share.  Company-wide organic growth was down slightly at minus 1%. 
Three of our business groups grew organically in the quarter, led by Health Care at 6%, with strong organic growth across all its businesses. Our Consumer business, which is the home to some of 3M's most iconic brands, also delivered a good quarter of organic growth. 
I'm very pleased that our 2 domestic-driven businesses, Health Care and Consumer, continued to do well and are off to a very good start in 2016. Safety and Graphics also posted solid organic growth with particular strength in commercial solutions and personal safety. 
Organic growth in our Industrial business was down low single digits, which was similar to last quarter. And as expected, Electronics and Energy declined low double digits. Electronics and Energy continued to be impacted by softness in the consumer electronics markets, which we expect to persist through the first half of the year. 
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 2 percentage points to first quarter sales, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 3%. As a result, our company total sales was $7.4 billion, down 2% year-on-year. Our ability to consistently deliver premium margins remains a hallmark of 3M, and it's an important element of our focus on driving efficient growth. 
In the first quarter, we posted margins of 24%, up more than a full percentage point versus last year. Without the impact from last year's fourth quarter restructuring, we have expanded margins year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters. Also in the quarter, we returned nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes an 8% increase in our first quarter dividend, which marked 3M's 58th consecutive year of dividend increases. All in all, we had a good start to the year, with results that were in line with our expectations. 
Please turn to Slide 4. In addition to a strong financial performance in the quarter, we also made good progress on our 3 key levers, starting with portfolio management. After strategic review of our health information systems business, we decided that we could create the greatest value by retaining and further invest in that business. In fact, we plan to accelerate the investment across our entire global Health Care business, in research and development, health economics and commercialization capabilities, to build strength on strength in both developed and developing markets. 
In February, we sold the Polyfoam business, which was a small noncore segment within our Industrial business group. Earlier, I mentioned the ongoing softness in the electronics markets. As you know, over the last few years, we have consolidated a number of businesses within Electronics and Energy, which has made us more relevant to our customers, more agile, and more efficient. Today, we are announcing further actions to build upon that work. These actions will reduce 250 positions worldwide, with a majority of reductions on the electronics side of the business, and result in an estimated Q2 charge of $20 million. This will further position Electronics and Energy for long-term success, and going forward, this business will continue to stay close to customers, advance its technology capabilities and increase productivity. 
Investing in innovation is the second lever, and in the first quarter, we invested nearly $0.5 billion in research and development. Research and development supports organic growth and premium returns, and as you recall, we continue to step up investment in R&D from 5.5% of sales closer to 6%. 
In March, we also opened our new laboratory in the United States, which many of you had opportunity to see at our Investor Day. It will house 750 of scientists, who will leverage our 46 technology platforms to create unique cutting-edge solutions for our customers. 
Finally, in the first quarter, we continued to march forward with business transformation, which is our third lever. We had a successful ERP deployment in Germany and remain focused on executing the rollout plan across Europe. Business transformation, which starts and ends with our customers, is important for our future, especially as it relates to efficient growth. We expect these efforts to result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion in working capital improvement. 
Overall, as I look at the quarter, we continued to execute the 3M playbook and delivered a strong performance in terms of both financial results and building our enterprise for the future. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick?"

I'll start on Slide 5 with a recap of our first quarter sales change. 
Organic local currency sales declined 0.8% in the first quarter with volumes down 1.7%, partially offset by a 0.9% increase in selling prices. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 1.6 percentage points to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety, Membrana and Ivera Medical, along with the divestitures of Library Systems, Polyfoam and the license plate converting business in France. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 3%.  
In U.S. dollars, total sales declined 2.2% versus the first quarter of 2015. In the United States, organic growth was up 0.3% with strong performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely Health Care and Consumer. 
Industrial production in the U.S. declined 1.3% in Q1, which impacted growth in parts of our Industrial business. Organic growth in Asia Pacific was down 5.6%. 3 of 5 business groups posted positive growth in the region, again, led by Health Care and Consumer. 
Soft end-market demand and excess channel inventories in consumer electronics resulted in a double-digit organic growth decline in Electronics and Energy. Within Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 4% in China/Hong Kong and declined 8% in Japan. Excluding our electronics business, Japan and China/Hong Kong were both flat.  
Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.7%. West Europe was up slightly. And the combination of Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa was up high single digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 4.2%. Mexico again had a strong quarter with 10% organic growth, and Brazil also posted positive organic growth of 2%. 
Please turn to Slide 6 for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.4 billion. Operating income increased more than 3% to $1.8 billion and earnings rose 10.8% to $2.05 per share. As Inge mentioned, we had another strong margin performance in the first quarter, up 130 basis points to 24.1%. 
Let's take a closer look at the first quarter margin improvements. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices added 110 basis points to first quarter margins. We continue to benefit from both lower commodity prices and from our Global Sourcing Team's ongoing efforts to reduce costs. Lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by 100 basis points. 
Productivity gains related to last year's fourth quarter restructuring contributed 40 basis points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margins 10 basis points, as we began to take actions in our lean manufacturing footprints and increased growth investments. 
Foreign currency net of hedge gains brought margins down another 10 basis points and first-year acquisitions reduced margins by 20 basis points. The year-on-year decline in organic volume reduced margins by 30 basis points. And finally, utilization and other was a net 50 basis point headwind to margins. This included the impact of lower asset utilization, particularly in our electronics and industrial businesses, which was partially offset by divestiture gains in the quarter. 
Also, we continue to increase investments across the business to drive growth and strengthen our competitiveness going forward. All-in, we have started the year on a positive note with respect to margins and continue to expect approximately 150 basis points of margin improvement for the full year, which reflects our focus on delivering efficient growth. 
Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. As stated earlier, earnings for the first quarter were $2.05 per share, an increase of 10.8%. Margin expansion, net of organic sales declines, contributed $0.04 to earnings in the quarter. 
First year acquisitions and divestitures added $0.07 to earnings per share. This result was driven by solid performances from Membrana, Capital Safety and Ivera, along with divestiture gains in the quarter. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by $48 million or the equivalent of $0.05 a share. 
Higher balance sheet leverage led to an increase in net interest expense year-on-year, reducing per-share earnings by $0.02. The first quarter tax rate was 26.8% versus 29.5% in the comparable quarter, which increased Q1 earnings by $0.07 per share. The lower Q1 tax rate includes the adoption of a new FASB accounting standard, which I'll walk through in a moment. 
Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% year-on-year, which added $0.09 to first quarter earnings per share. 
Please turn to Slide 8. On March 30th of this year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards update related to employee share-based payments. This new standard changes the recording of additional tax savings or charges when employees realize benefits from stock-based compensation. The additional tax impact is a result of the change in the value of stock-based compensation from the time it is granted to an employee to the time it is realized by the employee. Previously, these additional tax impacts were recognized in the equity section on the balance sheet. 
Going forward, it will be recognized on the income statement. All U.S. public companies are required to adopt the new accounting standard no later than the 2017 fiscal year. We chose to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 2016, which created a first quarter tax benefit of $0.10 per share net of tax cost related to global cash optimization actions. 
For the full year, we expect no impact to our tax rate and earnings per share guidance, as additional actions we chose to implement to further optimize our global cash position will increase our tax expense in the last 3 quarters of the year. Let's now turn to our first quarter cash flow performance on Slide 9. 
Overall, we posted another solid cash flow performance in Q1. Free cash flow conversion was 74%, up 8 percentage points versus the same period last year. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, a $180 million increase versus Q1 in 2015. The primary drivers of the increase were improved inventories and accounts receivable, along with lower cash taxes. 
Capital expenditures were $314 million, as we continued to invest in the business to drive efficient growth. For the full year, we expect CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. 
The strength of our business model allows us to invest in growth and also return cash to shareholders. As you heard earlier, we increased our first quarter per-share dividend by 8%, which increased our payout to $672 million in the quarter. In addition to dividends, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through gross share repurchases. 
Let's now review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide 10. Our Industrial Business Group posted quarterly sales of $2.6 billion. First quarter organic growth in our Industrial business was down 1.9%, with mid-single-digit declines in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. As mentioned earlier, the U.S. industrial production index was down 1.3% in the first quarter, which impacted parts of our Industrial business. Our Advanced Materials business declined low double digits, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas end-market. Conversely, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits, continuing its strong track record of outpacing global car and light truck builds. 
We also posted positive organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business in the quarter. The acquisition of Membrana, net of the Polyfoam divestiture, added 1.9% to Industrial sales growth. We are pleased with the smooth integration of Membrana into 3M, and the business continues to exceed its financial performance objectives. Industrial increased its margins 150 basis points to 23.9%, posting operating income of $617 million. 
Please turn to Slide 11. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were up 2.4% organically to $1.4 billion. 
Commercial solutions delivered solid organic growth with particular strength in Latin America and the U.S. 
Personal Safety, one of our Heartland businesses, also had a good quarter of organic growth led by EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Our roofing granules business also posted strong growth in the quarter. 
Acquisitions net of divestitures added 4.5 percentage points to sales growth in the quarter. This result includes Capital Safety, along with the impact from the divestitures of Library Systems and the license plate converting business in France. Geographically, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was broad-based, paced by a mid-single-digit increase in Asia Pacific. Operating income for the business was $345 million, and operating margins were a solid 24.5%. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered an outstanding quarter from top to bottom. The business generated sales of $1.4 billion and led our company's organic growth at 6.2%. Growth was broad-based with all businesses and geographic areas up mid-single digits or greater year-on-year. 
Health Information Systems and Food Safety both posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter. And our medical consumables and oral care businesses each delivered solid mid-single-digit growth in Q1. 
The Ivera Medical acquisition added 90 basis points to first quarter sales growth year-on-year. This business is performing well and exceeding its financial performance objectives. 
Our Health Care business delivered 13% organic growth in developing markets in the quarter, with particular strength in China/Hong Kong, Mexico and Russia. Operating income was $455 million, up 12% versus last year's first quarter, and margins were strong at 32.9%. As you can see from this quarter's results, our Health Care business continued its track record of strong performance. And as Inge mentioned, we are increasing investments across the business to drive efficient growth into the future. 
Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13. First quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.1 billion, down 11.7% organically and in line with what we communicated at our March Investor Day. On the Electronics side of the business, organic sales were down 18%. The decline was due to a combination of factors, including soft end-market demand, elevated channel inventory and a challenging year-on-year comparison. Our team remains focused on increasing relevance with customers and driving spec and wins to deliver organic growth, as the industry improves. 
Our energy-related businesses were down 1% organically with growth in electrical markets being offset by declines in telcom as well as renewable energy. As a reminder, in last year's Q4, we took portfolio actions within the renewable energy business. These actions negatively impacted Q1 organic growth but have improved profitability in this business. 
Within Electrical Markets, our ACCR overhead conductor business posted strong double-digit growth. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double digits in Asia Pacific, where our electronics business is concentrated. 
First quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $208 million, with margins of 18.2%, down 330 basis points, largely volume-related. Looking toward the full year, we now expect Electronics and Energy to decline organically in the low- to mid-single-digit range. As Inge mentioned, we are taking actions in the second quarter to further position the business for long-term success. 
I'll finish with our Consumer business on Slide 14. Consumer had another solid quarter with sales of $1 billion and organic growth increasing 2.8% year-on-year. Sales grew organically in 3 of our 4 businesses, led by Home Improvement and Consumer Health Care. Across the bottom of this slide, you see just a few of the market-leading brands that are powering our Consumer portfolio. Within the Home Improvement business, our Command damage-free mounting products posted strong double-digit growth, as accelerated investments continue to pay off. ScotchBlue painter's tape and Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter. 
Our Consumer Health Care business posted solid first quarter organic growth, as the growing trend of active lifestyles continue to drive strong demand for our ACE and FUTURO braces and support products. Geographically, organic growth was paced by Asia Pacific, driven by double-digit growth in China/Hong Kong, along with solid mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. Operating income was $238 million with operating margins of 22.7%, both similar to last year's first quarter. 
On Slide 15, we are reaffirming our 2016 planning estimates. We estimate earnings in the range of $8.10 to $8.45 per share, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be up 1% to 3%, with acquisitions net of divestitures adding 1% to sales. We estimate that foreign currency translation will reduce sales by 1% to 3%. Finally, our tax rate is still expected to be 29.5% to 30.5% with free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. 
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

Can you talk a little bit about your expectations and the cadence for the remainder of the year just in -- particularly in light of some of the commentary regarding slower smartphone shipments? So that's kind of the near-term question. And then longer-term question is -- maybe we can talk about this in the context of your portfolio. Inge, you've done a lot to restructure your portfolio since you took over. I'm just curious, like, whether this is a business that you're going to continue to reevaluate as we move forward."

Well, first of all, it was a little bit -- the slowest business for us in the quarter, but not much of a surprise if you go back and think about our Investor Day, when we talked about it in terms of what we expected for the first quarter. Now the electronic part was down 18%, which was, I would say, is all based on a weaker near-term demand in terms of consumer electronics. So from that perspective, not a surprise for us, but I think, as we look out for the next quarter, we have to expect in the second quarter mid- to high single growth down, and I think for the year, low to mid-single. So I think that's how you have to think about the business group. And I will say that in terms of the portfolio, this is a very, very good business for us because we have all the components in order for us to be competitive in this marketplace. And we have worked on that business in order to be more relevant now for 4 years, and as you can see here in this quarter, we take some more actions in order to line up our business model versus what is required in that business. So I will say, first of all, all businesses -- portfolio management is an ongoing process. We look upon that the whole time. But the fundamentals for us to be in this business is very, very good and very, very strong. It's just that we have to adjust as we go and on the fly. And I think that's what we're doing here, right? But for me and for us, it's more a near-term weaker demand in consumer electronics as we speak."

And we will now continue to accelerate that investment as we move ahead. So it's not only health information systems that we decided to keep in our portfolio investing, it's -- we will invest in all the businesses. And as I laid out, it is around research and development, it's about health economics and it's about commercialization capabilities. Those 3 things in the combination is very, very powerful for us. And think about it as well in terms of developed versus developing. Our position is very strong in the developed world, and we continue to take market share and we penetrate even deeper there. In developing, the field start to open up for us because key opinion leaders are recommending our protocols, including our products, around the world. So we have a very strong position there. And you can think about this in terms of our fastest growing business with a highest margin, we are pleased with where the margins are.

And the way we should think about this is in terms of the acceleration of growth, by definition, will go faster in Health Care than in Consumer. And the reason for that is everything you have to do around brand equity in Consumer take a little bit longer time. So when you compare the 2 of them, we would see a faster acceleration for Health Care versus Consumer, but both of them are growing very, very well. And I would not say that in terms of outcome, yes, we see both of them coming stronger now than versus a year ago. But we have been on this for quite some time, and it's often a realization of change of brand equity position for Consumer, and then it's a question about money availability for Health Care. So our solutions are very advanced and it's very much driven based on health economics. And as countries get bigger budget and can spend more into Health Care, they are shifting from less-advanced solution to solutions like 3M can provide. So that's why we believe that both Health Care and Consumer has a great future for us in that part of the world. And as you look upon our mix, those are also 2 of our businesses that the mix in the portfolio, we have less penetration and less sales in developing versus developed market for those 2 businesses. So the future look good. It's up to us now to execute and do that as fast as possible."

So you're talking about research and development, investment into that business and so forth. The advantage in that business is, if you took -- think about the electronics, very much of that is spec-ins, right? So we work direct with our customers in order to make sure we find solutions for them. That's actually a very powerful model if you think about it. So we have 2 processes in the company: one called Idea to Innovation, i2i, which is more for consumables; and then you have customer-inspired innovation, which is a model where you work direct with one specific customer. So if that is in aerospace, that is in automotive, if that's consumer electronics, or wherever that is, it's right into one specific customer. The strength of that model is that you know exactly the outcome of that model. You don't work on something that is broad-based from a market perspective that eventually will take place. You know it will take place in this customer-inspired innovation. And if you don't come to solution, you kill it very early. So I'm very confident in that model. And that is why that is a very good business from 3M because we can provide, through our technology platforms, multiple solutions that will generate better and more competitive products for our customers. So the answer to that is, very confident in the research and development into that model. And we can adjust, of course, based on what they are requiring. So that's an important element on the electronic side. On the Energy side, it's a model that we are using in the normal industrial production or in consumer, et cetera, where you have a bigger market space that you need to serve and where you use -- where you get the input from customer panels, et cetera. So the business is always built on research and development. And that is the heartbeat of 3M. That is also why we are able to generate very good returns to our investors because we are not commoditized. We don't work with those customers in order to replace something that is already in their devices today. We try to move it to the next level together with them. That is the power of it."

We delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, marked by our highest quarterly earnings per share in 3M history, driven by increased margins. At the same time, we were active in deploying capital to both invest in the long-term success of our enterprise and return cash to our shareholders. 
Looking at the numbers, earnings were $2.08 per share, up 3% year-over-year. Organic sales were down slightly at minus 20 basis points. Our 2 domestic-driven businesses once again paced our company's organic growth in the quarter. Posted 5% growth with positive growth in all businesses and geographic areas, and consumer grew 3%, driven by strong performance in our Command, Filtrete and Post-It products. 
Safety and Graphics also delivered solid growth while Industrial was down slight low single-digits. Organic growth in Electronics and Energy declined in the high single-digits, as we communicated during the second quarter. That business continues to be impacted by weaker demand and elevated channel inventories in the consumer electronics markets. 
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added more than 1 percentage point to our sales while the strong U.S. dollars reduced sales by similar amounts. As a result, we delivered total sales of $7.7 billion in the quarter.
In a global environment that remains uncertain, our team continues to focus on driving efficient growth and premium returns. In the second quarter, we delivered healthy margins or 24.4%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. 4 of our 5 business groups posted margins above 23%, including Health Care at 33% and Safety and Graphics at 27%, demonstrating the breadth of our strength.
Our ability to generate premium returns, along with strong free cash flow enable us to consistently invest in the business while also return cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested 10% of sales into the combination of research and development and capital expenditure, which is important to our business model and boost our foundation for the future. Also with an eye on the future, we continued to make good progress on business transformation, which is 1 of our 3 key levers.
At our Investor Day in March, you heard me talk about customer first, an initiative that is ingrained in everything we do, including business transformation. It is all about making it easier and quicker business for our customers to do business with us everywhere around the world. To date. We have the play our ERP system, which is the backbone of our business transformation in a dozen countries, as well as in 4 of our largest European distribution centers.
Most recently, in the second quarter, we had 2 successful rollouts in West Europe, specifically in our operations in Austria and Switzerland. We have also expanded the scale and impact of our 3 global service centers located in Costa Rica, Poland and Philippines. To these centers, we are building a platform for operational efficiencies today and into the future. 
Business transformation is strengthening our company. It starts and ends with our customers and has significant long-term benefits. We expect to result a $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and $0.5 billion reduction in working capital. 
In summary, we had a good performance in the second quarter in terms of increased margins, strong earnings and investments in the business, while also returning $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through more of the details. Nick?"

This includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana, net of 3 small divestitures. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.5%. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 0.3% versus the second quarter of 2015. Organic growth in the United States was up 0.4% with solid performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely Health Care and Consumer, as well as in Safety and Graphics. Similar to first quarter, U.S. manufacturing activity remained soft in Q2. This, combined with continued weakness in the oil and gas end market, impacted portions of our Industrial business.
In Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 5.4%. Strong growth from our Health Care and consumer businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics and Energy, as we continue to experience soft end-market demand and channel inventory adjustments in Consumer Electronics. 
Within Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 1% in Japan and 7% in China/Hong Kong. Excluding our electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 2% and China/Hong Kong, down 2%.
Moving to EMEA. We posted organic growth of 3% in the quarter, led by West Europe. We delivered growth across all businesses in West Europe. From a country perspective, growth was led by Germany and France. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 4.8% with Canada up 6% and Mexico up 5%, while Brazil declined 2%.
Please turn to Slide 5 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion and earnings were $2.08 per share. Operating margins improved by 50 basis points year-on-year to 24.4%, an all-time record margin for the second quarter. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 130 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 110 basis points.
Productivity gains related to last year's fourth quarter restructuring expanded margins by an additional 40 basis points. Lower year-on-year organic volumes, inventory declines and related utilization impacts reduced margins by 110 basis points. The lower utilization was most pronounced in electronics and to a lesser extent, industrial. Foreign currency translation impacts, net of hedge gains, decreased margins by 30 basis points. Strategic investments also reduced margins by 30 basis points, as we accelerated growth investments and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint. As a reminder, we expect the impact of strategic investments to increase in the second half of the year.
Finally, legal and other factors reduced margins by 60 basis points in the quarter, 50 basis points of which related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling on a long-standing insurance claim. For reference, our Q2 corporate and unallocated expense was up $47 million sequentially, primarily due to this unfavorable arbitration ruling. For the full year, we expect corporate and unallocated expense to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million.
Let's now turn to Slide 6 for a look at EPS. We posted earnings of $2.08 per share in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year. Margin expansion, net of organic sales declines, contributed $0.04 to our earnings per share improvement. First year acquisitions and divestitures added another $0.03 to earnings, driven by solid performances from both Capital Safety and Membrana. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $40 million or the equivalent of $0.04 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 29.6% versus 28.1% in last year's comparable quarter, which decreased Q2 earnings by $0.04. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-on-year, which added $0.07 to second quarter EPS.
Please turn to Slide 7 for a look at our cash flow performance. Operating cash flow was $1.3 billion in the second quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Our strong cash flow enables us to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. CapEx investments in Q2 totaled $323 million, and we continue to expect full year CapEx in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. These investments drive organic growth, strengthened our manufacturing technologies and support business transformation. 
Free cash flow conversion was 75% in the quarter, similar to last year. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders, including $672 million in dividends, up $26 million year-on-year. We also returned $828 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Through the first half of 2016, we have repurchased $2.1 billion of our own shares. We continue to anticipate full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion.
Let's now review each of our business groups starting on Slide 8. Our Industrial Business Group posted sales of $2.6 billion in the second quarter. Organic growth was down 1.4%, reflecting the continued economic challenges in the global industrial sector. Positive Q2 growth in Latin America/Canada and EMEA was more than offset by declines in Asia Pacific and the U.S. 
As mentioned earlier, manufacturing activity in the U.S. remained soft in Q2, which impacted parts of our Industrial business. Looking across our Industrial Business Group, our automotive OEM business grew high single-digits again this quarter and continued to outpace global car and light truck builds.
We also posted mid single-digit organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business, which is gaining share in the collision and auto care markets. Advanced materials declined year-on-year, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market. On a related positive note, this business was recently awarded a $93 million body-armor contract from the U.S. Defense logistics agency to be realized over the next 18 months. 
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 2.6% to industrial sales growth in the quarter. This figure represents the Membrana acquisition net of the recent Polyfoam divestiture. Membrana continues to deliver strong results, exceeding its financial objectives since acquisition. The business continues to expand its geographic presence, which includes recent contract wins with 2 life science customers in China. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $615 million in Q2 and margins rose 30 basis points to 23.4%. Please turn to Slide 9.
Safety and Graphics delivered a solid quarter with sales of $1.5 billion and organic growth of 2.3%. Our roofing granules business posted another strong quarter of double-digit organic growth, as demand increased in the replacement Schinkel market. Commercial solutions also delivered a solid quarter with notable strength in EMEA and the U.S. Within this business, new product sales in architectural markets and floor care products boosted the organic growth.
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 4.6% to sales growth in the quarter. This figure includes Capital Safety net of 2 small divestitures. The Capital Safety business is already benefiting from access to our company's 46 core technology platforms. For example, the team recently leveraged 2 of those platforms to create and launch a new detachable,, self rescue fall protection device.
On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was led by Latin America/Canada and the U.S. at mid single-digits, while Asia Pacific declined year-on-year. 
Operating income was $411 million and operating margins increased 2 percentage points to 27.4%. Profits in this business continued to be boosted by recent portfolio management actions along with solid productivity efforts. Please turn to Slide 10. 
Our Health Care business delivered another strong quarter across the entire portfolio. Sales increased 3% to $1.4 billion and organic growth was 4.9%, which once again led the company. As Inge mentioned, organic growth was broad-based with all businesses and geographic areas up year-on-year. 
By geography, Latin America/Canada and Asia Pacific each posted high single-digit growth in the quarter. Health Care also generated high single-digit organic growth in developing countries with strong contributions from China/Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mexico. Looking by business, organic growth was led by food safety, Health Information Systems and medical consumables. Operating income was $460 million, up 4.3% year-over-year, and margins remained strong at 32.7%.
Next, I'll cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Second quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.2 billion, down 9.1% organically. Organic sales on the electronics side of the business were down 14%. We continue to be impacted by weak end market demand across most consumer electronic applications. At the same time, channel inventories continued to adjust, and we expect these challenges to persist into the second half of the year. 
Our energy-related businesses declined 2% organically with growth in Telcom being more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double-digits in Asia Pacific, impacted by the declines in electronics. 
Second quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $229 million with margins of 19.3%. As mentioned earlier, during Q2, we took actions within Electronics and Energy to better position the business going forward. These actions reduced Q2 margins in this business by 80 basis points. Adjusting for these actions, underlying margins were 20.1%. In light of continued end-market challenges, we now expect full year 2016 organic sales in Electronics and Energy to decline by high single-digits. Please turn to Slide 12, where I will cover our consumer business.
Consumer had another solid quarter with sales of $1.1 billion and organic growth of 2.7%. Organic sales growth was led by our home improvement and Consumer Health Care businesses. Recent accelerated growth investments in command damage free mounting products and ScotchBlue Painter's Tape continued to pay off, driving strong double-digit organic growth in both cases. 
Filtrete filters continued to gain share and delivered strong growth in the quarter. In our Consumer Health Care business, we are driving strong growth in our Futuro line of compression solutions, health braces and support. 
The back-to-school season got off to a good start in the second quarter, led by strong sales of Post-It and command solutions. Geographically, consumers organic growth was led by Asia Pacific, along with solid growth in the U.S. Operating income was $281 million with operating margins of 24.9%. Solid organic growth, prioritization of investments and productivity efforts contributed to strong margin performance in the quarter. 
That wraps up my formal comments. Now I will turn the call back over to Inge."

As I look across our enterprise, each of our businesses is facing slightly different market realities, yet all of them are executing very well. 6 months into the year, 4 of our 5 business groups are growing in line with our expectations entering the year. And for reasons we have stated, Electronics and Energy is growing below those expectations. 
As a result, today, we're updating our planning estimates for 2016. Organic growth is now estimated to be 0% to 1% against previous guidance of 1% to 3%. With respect to earnings per share, we are raising the low end of our guidance from 8 10 to 8 15 and adjusting the high end from 8 45 to 8 30, resulting in an expected increase of 8% to 10% year-on-year.
We anticipate foreign currency to reduce 2016 sales by 1% to 2%. This is a prior estimate reduction of 1% to 3%. And our full year tax rate is now expected to be 29% to 29.5% versus a previous range of 29.5% to 30.5%. 
Finally, there's no change to our free cash flow conversion range, which remains 95% to 105%. With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions."

For the second quarter, then I'll expand it to talk about for the total year for price raw materials. We, as I said earlier, saw 130 basis points of margin expansion from that, up slightly from where we were in the first quarter. Of that 130, 90 basis points is related to lower year-on-year commodity prices and the other 40 is coming from our pricing growth that we see not related to FX movement. Our total price's growth that we posted to this year, we still see the majority of that coming from adjustments we're making in pricing related to FX movement. But once we strip that out, we still see 40 basis points of core price growth that we're seeing in our business. And we don't see a reason for that to change as we look into the second half. If I -- if you remember, Andrew, over a long period of time, we see our range for that core price growth being between 30 and 50 basis points. So as I look at this for the total year, we now expect the combination of price raw materials to be benefiting our margin by approximately 100 basis points. 6 months ago, I was saying I expected it to be about 50 basis points. But we're seeing some improvements in commodity prices from what we were anticipating for the second half of the year and pricing is slightly better than what we had expected."

And nothing changed there by definition this quarter more than more pressure in electronics. Consumer and Health Care is doing very well for us. So when you look into that, consumer had 9% growth and Health Care 11% growth. So both, if you look up on that, it's like 9% to 11% growth in domestic businesses. That's very good. Also, when you look upon this industrial, industrial improved a little bit. But to be honest, I'm not happy with the growth rate we see for industrial in China. So we need to see more from industrial, and I think it's coming as we move ahead. China for us, and I talked for 3M now, we have been very, very precisely driving our productivity improvement there for the last, I would say, 4, 6 quarters, we have focused a lot on productivity improvement.

There's no reason for us to change strategy around Europe. Our strategy have always been to have localization in terms of execution based on languages. And number two, build up a very strong backbone relative to resources, what we now do with ERP. And we have worked for a long time in order to reduce the layers and organization and management groups. And we have regionalized Europe over 3 years ago. So we don't have subsidiaries in every country any longer. We work on regions. So we have reduced the costs very much in terms of administration, helping the businesses with execution centrally and then execute locally with the teams in every country. There is no reason for us to change the strategy in Europe based on the outcome of the Brexit. No reason for us to do that.

But as you know, volatility also have an upside, and that we would be there to capitalize on that when it come. I don't think we would see anything this year in terms of change. So I think we have to wait in some time in '17 before we will see growth specifically in Consumer electronics taking place. Now there's something called automotive electronics that's accelerating more and more. We make specific investment there in order to capture that as we move ahead. So I will say that it's a volatile market, as we speak. The team is doing an outstanding job. And you saw again here, we had 80 basis point in terms of restructuring for the quarter. You take that out, they were running over 20% again in the quarter. So despite pressure on volume, the structure is down now to be able to deliver around 20% operating income for the company.

If we net the ASU, we net the cash repatriation. And in the third piece of that, I'll remind you of it, it also has an impact in our share count. It increases our number of shares outstanding, of diluted shares outstanding. So the net impact is we now see as approximately $0.10 for the total year. For the second quarter, the roughly 150 basis points lower than we saw in our tax rate from what I had originally guided. All of that is coming from the increased employee stock options that we saw in the second quarter.

We delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, marked by our highest quarterly earnings per share in 3M history, driven by increased margins. At the same time, we were active in deploying capital to both invest in the long-term success of our enterprise and return cash to our shareholders. 
Looking at the numbers, earnings were $2.08 per share, up 3% year-over-year. Organic sales were down slightly at minus 20 basis points. Our 2 domestic-driven businesses once again paced our company's organic growth in the quarter. Health Care posted 5% growth with positive growth in all businesses and geographic areas, and Consumer grew 3%, driven by strong performance in our Command, Filtrete and Post-It products. 
Safety and Graphics also delivered solid growth, while Industrial was down slight low single digits. Organic growth in Electronics and Energy declined in the high single digits, as we communicated during the second quarter. That business continues to be impacted by weaker demand and elevated channel inventories in the consumer electronics markets. 
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added more than 1 percentage point to our sales while the strong U.S. dollar reduced sales by similar amounts. As a result, we delivered total sales of $7.7 billion in the quarter.
In a global environment that remains uncertain, our team continues to focus on driving efficient growth and premium returns. In the second quarter, we delivered healthy margins of 24.4%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. 4 of our 5 business groups posted margins above 23%, including Health Care at 33% and Safety and Graphics at 27%, demonstrating the breadth of our strength.
Our ability to generate premium returns, along with strong free cash flow enable us to consistently invest in the business while also return cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested 10% of sales into the combination of research and development and capital expenditure, which is important to our business model and bolsters our foundation for the future. Also, with an eye on the future, we continued to make good progress on business transformation, which is 1 of our 3 key levers.
At our Investor Day in March, you heard me talk about customer first, an initiative that is ingrained in everything we do, including business transformation. It is all about making it easier and quicker for our customers to do business with us everywhere around the world. To date, we have deployed our ERP system, which is the backbone of our business transformation in a dozen countries, as well as in 4 of our largest European distribution centers.
Most recently, in the second quarter, we had 2 successful rollouts in West Europe, specifically in our operations in Austria and Switzerland. We have also expanded the scale and impact of our 3 global service centers located in Costa Rica, Poland and Philippines. To these centers, we are building a platform for operational efficiencies today and into the future. 
Business transformation is strengthening our company. It starts and ends with our customers and has significant long-term benefits. We expect to result a $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and $0.5 billion reduction in working capital. 
In summary, we had a good performance in the second quarter in terms of increased margins, strong earnings and investments in the business, while also returning $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through more of the details. Nick?"

Organic local currency sales declined 0.2% in the second quarter with volumes down 1.3% and selling prices up 1.1%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 1.4 percentage points to our sales. This includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana, net of 3 small divestitures. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.5%. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 0.3% versus the second quarter of 2015. Organic growth in the United States was up 0.4% with solid performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely Health Care and Consumer, as well as in Safety and Graphics. Similar to first quarter, U.S. manufacturing activity remained soft in Q2. This, combined with continued weakness in the oil and gas end market, impacted portions of our Industrial business.
In Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 5.4%. Strong growth from our Health Care and Consumer businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics and Energy, as we continue to experience soft end-market demand and channel inventory adjustments in consumer electronics. 
Within Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 1% in Japan and 7% in China/Hong Kong. Excluding our electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 2% and China/Hong Kong, down 2%.
Moving to EMEA. We posted organic growth of 3% in the quarter, led by West Europe. We delivered growth across all businesses in West Europe. From a country perspective, growth was led by Germany and France. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 4.8% with Canada up 6% and Mexico up 5%, while Brazil declined 2%.
Please turn to Slide 5 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion and earnings were $2.08 per share. Operating margins improved by 50 basis points year-on-year to 24.4%, an all-time record margin for the second quarter. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 130 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 110 basis points.
Productivity gains related to last year's fourth quarter restructuring expanded margins by an additional 40 basis points. Lower year-on-year organic volumes, inventory declines and related utilization impacts reduced margins by 110 basis points. The lower utilization was most pronounced in electronics, and to a lesser extent, Industrial. Foreign currency translation impacts, net of hedge gains, decreased margins by 30 basis points. Strategic investments also reduced margins by 30 basis points as we accelerated growth investments and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint. As a reminder, we expect the impact of strategic investments to increase in the second half of the year.
Finally, legal and other factors reduced margins by 60 basis points in the quarter, 50 basis points of which related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling on a long-standing insurance claim. For reference, our Q2 corporate and unallocated expense was up $47 million sequentially, primarily due to this unfavorable arbitration ruling. For the full year, we expect corporate and unallocated expense to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million.
Let's now turn to Slide 6 for a look at EPS. We posted earnings of $2.08 per share in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year. Margin expansion, net of organic sales declines, contributed $0.04 to our earnings per share improvement. First year acquisitions and divestitures added another $0.03 to earnings, driven by solid performances from both Capital Safety and Membrana. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $40 million or the equivalent of $0.04 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 29.6% versus 28.1% in last year's comparable quarter, which decreased Q2 earnings by $0.04. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-on-year, which added $0.07 to second quarter EPS.
Please turn to Slide 7 for a look at our cash flow performance. Operating cash flow was $1.3 billion in the second quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Our strong cash flow enables us to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. CapEx investments in Q2 totaled $323 million, and we continue to expect full year CapEx in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. These investments drive organic growth, strengthen our manufacturing technologies and support business transformation. 
Free cash flow conversion was 75% in the quarter, similar to last year. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders, including $672 million in dividends, up $26 million year-on-year. We also returned $828 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Through the first half of 2016, we have repurchased $2.1 billion of our own shares. We continue to anticipate full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion.
Let's now review each of our business groups, starting on Slide 8. Our Industrial Business Group posted sales of $2.6 billion in the second quarter. Organic growth was down 1.4%, reflecting the continued economic challenges in the global industrial sector. Positive Q2 growth in Latin America/Canada and EMEA was more than offset by declines in Asia Pacific and the U.S. 
As mentioned earlier, manufacturing activity in the U.S. remained soft in Q2, which impacted parts of our Industrial business. Looking across our Industrial Business Group, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter and continued to outpace global car and light truck builds.
We also posted mid-single-digit organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business, which is gaining share in the collision and auto care markets. Advanced materials declined year-on-year, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market. On a related positive note, this business was recently awarded a $93 million body-armor contract from the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency to be realized over the next 18 months. 
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 2.6% to Industrial sales growth in the quarter. This figure represents the Membrana acquisition, net of the recent Polyfoam divestiture. Membrana continues to deliver strong results, exceeding its financial objective since acquisition. The business continues to expand its geographic presence, which includes recent contract wins with 2 life science customers in China. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $615 million in Q2 and margins rose 30 basis points to 23.4%.
Please turn to Slide 9. Safety and Graphics delivered a solid quarter with sales of $1.5 billion and organic growth of 2.3%. Our roofing granules business posted another strong quarter of double-digit organic growth, as demand increased in the replacement shingle market. Commercial solutions also delivered a solid quarter with notable strength in EMEA and the U.S. Within this business, new product sales in architectural markets and floor care products boosted the organic growth.
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 4.6% to sales growth in the quarter. This figure includes Capital Safety net of 2 small divestitures. The Capital Safety business is already benefiting from access to our company's 46 core technology platforms. For example, the team recently leveraged 2 of those platforms to create and launch a new detachable, self-rescue fall protection device.
On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was led by Latin America/Canada and the U.S. at mid-single digits, while Asia Pacific declined year-on-year. 
Operating income was $411 million and operating margins increased 2 percentage points to 27.4%. Profits in this business continued to be boosted by recent portfolio management actions, along with solid productivity efforts.
Please turn to Slide 10. Our Health Care business delivered another strong quarter across the entire portfolio. Sales increased 3% to $1.4 billion and organic growth was 4.9%, which once again led the company. As Inge mentioned, organic growth was broad based with all businesses and geographic areas up year-on-year. 
By geography, Latin America/Canada and Asia Pacific each posted high single-digit growth in the quarter. Health Care also generated high single-digit organic growth in developing countries with strong contributions from China/Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mexico. Looking by business, organic growth was led by food safety, health information systems and medical consumables. Operating income was $460 million, up 4.3% year-over-year, and margins remained strong at 32.7%.
Next, I'll cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Second quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.2 billion, down 9.1% organically. Organic sales on the electronics side of the business were down 14%. We continue to be impacted by weak end-market demand across most consumer electronic applications. At the same time, channel inventories continued to adjust, and we expect these challenges to persist into the second half of the year. 
Our energy-related businesses declined 2% organically with growth in telecom being more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double digits in Asia Pacific, impacted by the declines in electronics. 
Second quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $229 million with margins of 19.3%. As mentioned earlier, during Q2, we took actions within Electronics and Energy to better position the business going forward. These actions reduced Q2 margins in this business by 80 basis points. Adjusting for these actions, underlying margins were 20.1%. In light of continued end-market challenges, we now expect full year 2016 organic sales in Electronics and Energy to decline by high single digits.
Please turn to Slide 12, where I will cover our consumer business.  Consumer had another solid quarter with sales of $1.1 billion and organic growth of 2.7%. Organic sales growth was led by our home improvement and consumer health care businesses. Recent accelerated growth investments in Command damage-free mounting products and ScotchBlue Painter's Tape continued to pay off, driving strong double-digit organic growth in both cases. 
Filtrete filters continued to gain share and delivered strong growth in the quarter. In our consumer health care business, we are driving strong growth in our FUTURO line of compression solutions, health braces and support. 
The back-to-school season got off to a good start in the second quarter, led by strong sales of Post-It and Command solutions. Geographically, consumers' organic growth was led by Asia Pacific, along with solid growth in the U.S. Operating income was $281 million with operating margins of 24.9%. Solid organic growth, prioritization of investments and productivity efforts contributed to strong margin performance in the quarter. 
That wraps up my formal comments. Now I will turn the call back over to Inge. Inge?"

As I look across our enterprise, each of our businesses is facing slightly different market realities, yet all of them are executing very well. 6 months into the year, 4 of our 5 business groups are growing in line with our expectations entering the year. And for reasons we have stated, Electronics and Energy is growing below those expectations. 
As a result, today, we're updating our planning estimates for 2016. Organic growth is now estimated to be 0% to 1% against previous guidance of 1% to 3%. With respect to earnings per share, we are raising the low end of our guidance from $8.10 to $8.15 and adjusting the high end from $8.45 to $8.30, resulting in an expected increase of 8% to 10% year-on-year.
We anticipate foreign currency to reduce 2016 sales by 1% to 2%. This is a prior estimate reduction of 1% to 3%. And our full year tax rate is now expected to be 29% to 29.5% versus a previous range of 29.5% to 30.5%. 
Finally, there's no change to our free cash flow conversion range, which remains 95% to 105%. With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions."

For the second quarter and then I'll expand it to talk about the total year for price raw materials, we, as I said earlier, saw 130 basis points of margin expansion from that, up slightly from where we were in the first quarter. Of that 130, 90 basis points is related to lower year-on-year commodity prices and the other 40 is coming from our pricing growth that we see not related to FX movement. Our total price's growth that we posted to this year, we still see the majority of that coming from adjustments we're making in pricing related to FX movement. But once we strip that out, we still see 40 basis points of core price growth that we're seeing in our business. And we don't see a reason for that to change as we look into the second half. If I -- if you remember, Andrew, over a long period of time, we see our range for that core price growth being between 30 and 50 basis points. So as I look at this for the total year, we now expect the combination of price raw materials to be benefiting our margin by approximately 100 basis points. 6 months ago, I was saying I expected it to be about 50 basis points. But we're seeing some improvements in commodity prices from what we were anticipating for the second half of the year, and pricing is slightly better than what we had expected."

Nothing's changed there by definition this quarter more than more pressure in electronics. Consumer and Health Care is doing very well for us. So when you look into that, Consumer had 9% growth and Health Care, 11% growth. So both, if you look upon that, it's like 9% to 11% growth in domestic businesses. That's very good. Also, when you look upon Industrial, Industrial improved a little bit. But to be honest, I'm not happy with the growth rate we see for Industrial in China. So we need to see more from Industrial, and I think it's coming as we move ahead. China for us, and I talk for 3M now, we have been very, very precisely driving our productivity improvement there for the last, I would say, 4, 6 quarters.

There's no reason for us to change strategy around Europe. Our strategy have always been to have localization in terms of execution based on languages. And number two, build up a very strong backbone relative to resources, what we now do with ERP. And we have worked for a long time in order to reduce the layers and organization and management groups. And we have regionalized Europe over 3 years ago. So we don't have subsidiaries in every country any longer. We work on regions. So we have reduced the costs very much in terms of administration, helping the businesses with execution centrally and then execute locally with the teams in every country. There is no reason for us to change the strategy in Europe based on the outcome of the Brexit. No reason for us to do that. The other thing that is very nice for us to see is the margin expansion that is coming for us in West Europe as well.

I think the guys have done a fantastic job relative to sort out low-margin businesses that were inside of certain division in that group. And we also, as you know, we divested some businesses, which was a converter business in France relative to license plate that was not strategically important. And by the way, we are not the converter in that industry.

We are a material science company and the strings of all capabilities in that market is very, very strong. So from a strategic perspective, there is no question mark for me. And when you look upon the 4 fundamentals that we have in the company terms of technology, manufacturing capabilities and geographical reach plus brand equity, it's very, very good for us.

So the question to -- or the answer to that question is yes, there is a place for us to be. And as you have seen, we have adjusted our structure the whole time as that market is a little bit volatile. But as you know, volatility also have an upside and that we will be there to capitalize on that when it comes. I don't think we would see anything this year in terms of change. So I think we have to wait into -- some time in '17 before we will see growth specifically in consumer electronics taking place. Now there is something called automotive electronics that is accelerating more and more. We make specific investment there in order to capture that as we move ahead. So I will say that it's a volatile market, as we speak. The team is doing an outstanding job. And you saw again here, we had 80 basis point in terms of restructuring for the quarter. You take that out, they were running over 20% again in the quarter. So despite pressure on volume, the structure is down now to be able to deliver around 20% operating income for the company. That -- for me, that's good. So I complement that team for what they are doing in terms of efficiency in a tougher situation, and they're all preparing for when the upturn is coming. And I would like it to come soon, but I don't think we can see it in '16, right? But '17 will soon be here anyhow."

But with our cash repatriation, it will end up being neutral for the year. We now, for the year, see a total benefit of approximately $0.10 of net all in. If we net the ASU, we net the cash repatriation. And the third piece of that, I'll remind you of it, it also has an impact on our share count. It increases our number of shares outstanding, of diluted shares outstanding. So the net impact is, we now see, is approximately $0.10 for the total year. For the second quarter, the roughly 150 basis points lower that we saw in our tax rate from what I had originally guided, all of that is coming from the increased employee stock options that we saw in the second quarter. Nothing has changed on our plans that we communicated for cash repatriation and cash movements around the world."

Canada was one of the first places we have implemented that program, which is now more than 2 years ago. And it's working well for us in Canada. And when you can provide in the marketplace product that is adding value and provide good service that is based on the demand from the customer, going into an ERP business, result is coming. So there's a couple of things. Good growth, margin expansion and, I guess, that team should be complemented for the way they operate today and the way they took on the ERP system as one of the first places for us on a global base to execute that and actually helped us a lot in terms of the rollout that you see now in Europe. So yes, it's a very, very nice result. Is it a surprise? No, it's not, it's not.

We delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, marked by our highest quarterly earnings per share in 3M history, driven by increased margins. At the same time, we were active in deploying capital to both invest in the long-term success of our enterprise and return cash to our shareholders. 
Looking at the numbers, earnings were $2.08 per share, up 3% year-over-year. Organic sales were down slightly at minus 20 basis points. Our 2 domestic-driven businesses once again paced our company's organic growth in the quarter. Health Care posted 5% growth with positive growth in all businesses and geographic areas, and Consumer grew 3%, driven by strong performance in our Command, Filtrete and Post-It products. 
Safety and Graphics also delivered solid growth, while Industrial was down slight low single digits. Organic growth in Electronics and Energy declined in the high single digits, as we communicated during the second quarter. That business continues to be impacted by weaker demand and elevated channel inventories in the consumer electronics markets. 
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added more than 1 percentage point to our sales while the strong U.S. dollar reduced sales by similar amounts. As a result, we delivered total sales of $7.7 billion in the quarter.
In a global environment that remains uncertain, our team continues to focus on driving efficient growth and premium returns. In the second quarter, we delivered healthy margins of 24.4%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. 4 of our 5 business groups posted margins above 23%, including Health Care at 33% and Safety and Graphics at 27%, demonstrating the breadth of our strength.
Our ability to generate premium returns, along with strong free cash flow, enable us to consistently invest in the business while also return cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested 10% of sales into the combination of research and development and capital expenditure, which is important to our business model and bolsters our foundation for the future. Also, with an eye on the future, we continued to make good progress on business transformation, which is 1 of our 3 key levers.
At our Investor Day in March, you heard me talk about customer first, an initiative that is ingrained in everything we do, including business transformation. It is all about making it easier and quicker for our customers to do business with us everywhere around the world. To date, we have deployed our ERP system, which is the backbone of our business transformation in a dozen countries, as well as in 4 of our largest European distribution centers.
Most recently, in the second quarter, we had 2 successful rollouts in West Europe, specifically in our operations in Austria and Switzerland. We have also expanded the scale and impact of our 3 global service centers located in Costa Rica, Poland and Philippines. To these centers, we are building a platform for operational efficiencies today and into the future. 
Business transformation is strengthening our company. It starts and ends with our customers and has significant long-term benefits. We expect to result a $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and $0.5 billion reduction in working capital. 
In summary, we had a good performance in the second quarter in terms of increased margins, strong earnings and investments in the business, while also returning $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through more of the details. Nick?"

Organic local currency sales declined 0.2% in the second quarter with volumes down 1.3% and selling prices up 1.1%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 1.4 percentage points to our sales. This includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana, net of 3 small divestitures. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.5%. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 0.3% versus the second quarter of 2015. Organic growth in the United States was up 0.4% with solid performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely Health Care and Consumer, as well as in Safety and Graphics. Similar to first quarter, U.S. manufacturing activity remained soft in Q2. This, combined with continued weakness in the oil and gas end market, impacted portions of our Industrial business.
In Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 5.4%. Strong growth from our Health Care and Consumer businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics and Energy, as we continue to experience soft end-market demand and channel inventory adjustments in consumer electronics. 
Within Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 1% in Japan and 7% in China/Hong Kong. Excluding our electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 2% and China/Hong Kong, down 2%.
Moving to EMEA. We posted organic growth of 3% in the quarter, led by West Europe. We delivered growth across all businesses in West Europe. From a country perspective, growth was led by Germany and France. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 4.8% with Canada up 6% and Mexico up 5%, while Brazil declined 2%.
Please turn to Slide 5 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion and earnings were $2.08 per share. Operating margins improved by 50 basis points year-on-year to 24.4%, an all-time record margin for the second quarter. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 130 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 110 basis points.
Productivity gains related to last year's fourth quarter restructuring expanded margins by an additional 40 basis points. Lower year-on-year organic volumes, inventory declines and related utilization impacts reduced margins by 110 basis points. The lower utilization was most pronounced in electronics, and to a lesser extent, Industrial. Foreign currency translation impacts, net of hedge gains, decreased margins by 30 basis points. Strategic investments also reduced margins by 30 basis points as we accelerated growth investments and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint. As a reminder, we expect the impact of strategic investments to increase in the second half of the year.
Finally, legal and other factors reduced margins by 60 basis points in the quarter, 50 basis points of which related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling on a long-standing insurance claim. For reference, our Q2 corporate and unallocated expense was up $47 million sequentially, primarily due to this unfavorable arbitration ruling. For the full year, we expect corporate and unallocated expense to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million.
Let's now turn to Slide 6 for a look at EPS. We posted earnings of $2.08 per share in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year. Margin expansion, net of organic sales declines, contributed $0.04 to our earnings per share improvement. First year acquisitions and divestitures added another $0.03 to earnings, driven by solid performances from both Capital Safety and Membrana. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $40 million or the equivalent of $0.04 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 29.6% versus 28.1% in last year's comparable quarter, which decreased Q2 earnings by $0.04. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-on-year, which added $0.07 to second quarter EPS.
Please turn to Slide 7 for a look at our cash flow performance. Operating cash flow was $1.3 billion in the second quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Our strong cash flow enables us to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. CapEx investments in Q2 totaled $323 million, and we continue to expect full year CapEx in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. These investments drive organic growth, strengthen our manufacturing technologies and support business transformation. 
Free cash flow conversion was 75% in the quarter, similar to last year. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders, including $672 million in dividends, up $26 million year-on-year. We also returned $828 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Through the first half of 2016, we have repurchased $2.1 billion of our own shares. We continue to anticipate full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion.
Let's now review each of our business groups, starting on Slide 8. Our Industrial Business Group posted sales of $2.6 billion in the second quarter. Organic growth was down 1.4%, reflecting the continued economic challenges in the global industrial sector. Positive Q2 growth in Latin America/Canada and EMEA was more than offset by declines in Asia Pacific and the U.S. 
As mentioned earlier, manufacturing activity in the U.S. remained soft in Q2, which impacted parts of our Industrial business. Looking across our Industrial Business Group, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter and continued to outpace global car and light truck builds.
We also posted mid-single-digit organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business, which is gaining share in the collision and auto care markets. Advanced materials declined year-on-year, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market. On a related positive note, this business was recently awarded a $93 million body-armor contract from the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency to be realized over the next 18 months. 
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 2.6% to Industrial sales growth in the quarter. This figure represents the Membrana acquisition, net of the recent Polyfoam divestiture. Membrana continues to deliver strong results, exceeding its financial objective since acquisition. The business continues to expand its geographic presence, which includes recent contract wins with 2 life science customers in China. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $615 million in Q2 and margins rose 30 basis points to 23.4%.
Please turn to Slide 9. Safety and Graphics delivered a solid quarter with sales of $1.5 billion and organic growth of 2.3%. Our roofing granules business posted another strong quarter of double-digit organic growth, as demand increased in the replacement shingle market. Commercial solutions also delivered a solid quarter with notable strength in EMEA and the U.S. Within this business, new product sales in architectural markets and floor care products boosted the organic growth.
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 4.6% to sales growth in the quarter. This figure includes Capital Safety net of 2 small divestitures. The Capital Safety business is already benefiting from access to our company's 46 core technology platforms. For example, the team recently leveraged 2 of those platforms to create and launch a new detachable, self-rescue fall protection device.
On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was led by Latin America/Canada and the U.S. at mid-single digits, while Asia Pacific declined year-on-year. 
Operating income was $411 million and operating margins increased 2 percentage points to 27.4%. Profits in this business continued to be boosted by recent portfolio management actions, along with solid productivity efforts.
Please turn to Slide 10. Our Health Care business delivered another strong quarter across the entire portfolio. Sales increased 3% to $1.4 billion and organic growth was 4.9%, which once again led the company. As Inge mentioned, organic growth was broad-based with all businesses and geographic areas up year-on-year. 
By geography, Latin America/Canada and Asia Pacific each posted high single-digit growth in the quarter. Health Care also generated high single-digit organic growth in developing countries with strong contributions from China/Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mexico. Looking by business, organic growth was led by food safety, health information systems and medical consumables. Operating income was $460 million, up 4.3% year-over-year, and margins remained strong at 32.7%.
Next, I'll cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Second quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.2 billion, down 9.1% organically. Organic sales on the electronics side of the business were down 14%. We continue to be impacted by weak end-market demand across most consumer electronic applications. At the same time, channel inventories continue to adjust, and we expect these challenges to persist into the second half of the year. 
Our energy-related businesses declined 2% organically with growth in telecom being more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double digits in Asia Pacific, impacted by the declines in electronics. 
Second quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $229 million with margins of 19.3%. As mentioned earlier, during Q2, we took actions within Electronics and Energy to better position the business going forward. These actions reduced Q2 margins in this business by 80 basis points. Adjusting for these actions, underlying margins were 20.1%. In light of continued end-market challenges, we now expect full year 2016 organic sales in Electronics and Energy to decline by high single digits.
Please turn to Slide 12, where I will cover our consumer business.  Consumer had another solid quarter with sales of $1.1 billion and organic growth of 2.7%. Organic sales growth was led by our home improvement and consumer health care businesses. Recent accelerated growth investments in Command damage-free mounting products and ScotchBlue Painter's Tape continued to pay off, driving strong double-digit organic growth in both cases. 
Filtrete filters continued to gain share and delivered strong growth in the quarter. In our consumer health care business, we are driving strong growth in our FUTURO line of compression solutions, health braces and supports. 
The back-to-school season got off to a good start in the second quarter, led by strong sales of Post-It and Command solutions. Geographically, consumers' organic growth was led by Asia Pacific, along with solid growth in the U.S. Operating income was $281 million with operating margins of 24.9%. Solid organic growth, prioritization of investments and productivity efforts contributed to strong margin performance in the quarter. 
That wraps up my formal comments. Now I will turn the call back over to Inge. Inge?"

As a result, today, we're updating our planning estimates for 2016. Organic growth is now estimated to be 0% to 1% against previous guidance of 1% to 3%. With respect to earnings per share, we are raising the low end of our guidance from $8.10 to $8.15 and adjusting the high end from $8.45 to $8.30, resulting in an expected increase of 8% to 10% year-on-year.
We anticipate foreign currency to reduce 2016 sales by 1% to 2%. This is a prior estimate reduction of 1% to 3%. And our full year tax rate is now expected to be 29% to 29.5% versus a previous range of 29.5% to 30.5%. 
Finally, there's no change to our free cash flow conversion range, which remains 95% to 105%. With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions."

For the second quarter and then I'll expand it to talk about the total year for price raw materials, we, as I said earlier, saw 130 basis points of margin expansion from that, up slightly from where we were in the first quarter. Of that 130, 90 basis points is related to lower year-on-year commodity prices and the other 40 is coming from our pricing growth that we see not related to FX movement. Our total price growth that we posted this year, we still see the majority of that coming from adjustments we're making in pricing related to FX movement. But once we strip that out, we still see 40 basis points of core price growth that we're seeing in our business. And we don't see a reason for that to change as we look into the second half. If I -- if you remember, Andrew, over a long period of time, we see our range for that core price growth being between 30 and 50 basis points. So as I look at this for the total year, we now expect the combination of price raw materials to be benefiting our margin by approximately 100 basis points. 6 months ago, I was saying I expected it to be about 50 basis points. But we're seeing some improvements in commodity prices from what we were anticipating for the second half of the year, and pricing is slightly better than what we had expected."

Nothing's changed there by definition this quarter more than more pressure in electronics. Consumer and Health Care is doing very well for us. So when you look into that, Consumer had 9% growth and Health Care, 11% growth. So both, if you look upon that, it's like 9% to 11% growth in domestic businesses. That's very good. Also, when you look upon Industrial, Industrial improved a little bit. But to be honest, I'm not happy with the growth rate we see for Industrial in China. So we need to see more from Industrial, and I think it's coming as we move ahead. China for us, and I talk for 3M now, we have been very, very precisely driving our productivity improvement there for the last, I would say, 4, 6 quarters.

There's no reason for us to change strategy around Europe. Our strategy have always been to have localization in terms of execution based on languages. And number two, build up a very strong backbone relative to resources, what we now do with ERP. And we have worked for a long time in order to reduce the layers and organization and management groups. And we have regionalized Europe over 3 years ago. So we don't have subsidiaries in every country any longer. We work on regions. So we have reduced the costs very much in terms of administration, helping the businesses with execution centrally and then execute locally with the teams in every country. There is no reason for us to change the strategy in Europe based on the outcome of the Brexit. No reason for us to do that. The other thing that is very nice for us to see is the margin expansion that is coming for us in West Europe as well.

When we started that process quite some year back, when we start really to look upon what we call underperforming businesses, which is the standard is very high, as you know, inside of 3M when you're running at those type of margins. I think the guys have done a fantastic job relative to sort out low-margin businesses that were inside of certain division in that group. And we also, as you know, we divested some businesses, which was a converter business in France relative to license plate that was not strategically important. And by the way, we are not the converter in that industry. So I think that when you start to add things together, we're building out the strength in position with addition of Capital Safety to our personal safety business. And then you look upon the whole graphic side and the transportation side in terms of the work they have done in order to work on the mix. That is the outcome of the results.

We are a material science company and the strings of all capabilities in that market is very, very strong. So from a strategic perspective, there is no question mark for me. And when you look upon the 4 fundamentals that we have in the company in terms of technology, manufacturing capabilities and geographical reach plus brand equity, it's very, very good for us. And as we all know, in terms of electronics, it's growing, generally speaking, and we are all touched by it every day in what we do. So that is what 3M should be. So the question to -- or the answer to that question is yes, there is a place for us to be. And as you have seen, we have adjusted our structure the whole time as that market is a little bit volatile. But as you know, volatility also have an upside and that we will be there to capitalize on that when it comes. I don't think we would see anything this year in terms of change. So I think we have to wait into some time in '17 before we will see growth specifically in consumer electronics taking place. Now there is something called automotive electronics that is accelerating more and more. We make specific investment there in order to capture that as we move ahead. So I will say that it's a volatile market, as we speak. The team is doing an outstanding job. And you saw again here, we had 80 basis point in terms of restructuring for the quarter. You take that out, they were running over 20% again in the quarter. So despite pressure on volume, the structure is down now to be able to deliver around 20% operating income for the company. That -- for me, that's good. So I complement that team for what they are doing in terms of efficiency in a tougher situation, and they're all preparing for when the upturn is coming. And I would like it to come soon, but I don't think we can see it in '16, right? But '17 will soon be here anyhow."

Canada was one of the first places we have implemented that program, which is now more than 2 years ago. And it's working well for us in Canada. And when you can provide in the marketplace product that is adding value and provide good service that is based on the demand from the customer, going into an ERP business, result is coming. So there's a couple of things. Good growth, margin expansion and, I guess, that team should be complemented for the way they operate today and the way they took on the ERP system as one of the first places for us on a global base to execute that and actually helped us a lot in terms of the rollout that you see now in Europe. So yes, it's a very, very nice result. Is it a surprise? No, it's not, it's not.

We delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, marked by our highest quarterly earnings per share in 3M history, driven by increased margins. At the same time, we were active in deploying capital to both invest in the long-term success of our enterprise and return cash to our shareholders. 
Looking at the numbers, earnings were $2.08 per share, up 3% year-over-year. Organic sales were down slightly at minus 20 basis points. Our 2 domestic-driven businesses once again paced our company's organic growth in the quarter. Health Care posted 5% growth with positive growth in all businesses and geographic areas, and Consumer grew 3%, driven by strong performance in our Command, Filtrete and Post-It products. 
Safety and Graphics also delivered solid growth, while Industrial was down slight low single digits. Organic growth in Electronics and Energy declined in the high single digits, as we communicated during the second quarter. That business continues to be impacted by weaker demand and elevated channel inventories in the consumer electronics markets. 
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added more than 1 percentage point to our sales while the strong U.S. dollar reduced sales by similar amounts. As a result, we delivered total sales of $7.7 billion in the quarter.
In a global environment that remains uncertain, our team continues to focus on driving efficient growth and premium returns. In the second quarter, we delivered healthy margins of 24.4%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. 4 of our 5 business groups posted margins above 23%, including Health Care at 33% and Safety and Graphics at 27%, demonstrating the breadth of our strength.
Our ability to generate premium returns, along with strong free cash flow, enable us to consistently invest in the business while also return cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested 10% of sales into the combination of research and development and capital expenditure, which is important to our business model and bolsters our foundation for the future. Also, with an eye on the future, we continued to make good progress on business transformation, which is 1 of our 3 key levers.
At our Investor Day in March, you heard me talk about customer first, an initiative that is ingrained in everything we do, including business transformation. It is all about making it easier and quicker for our customers to do business with us everywhere around the world. To date, we have deployed our ERP system, which is the backbone of our business transformation in a dozen countries, as well as in 4 of our largest European distribution centers.
Most recently, in the second quarter, we had 2 successful rollouts in West Europe, specifically in our operations in Austria and Switzerland. We have also expanded the scale and impact of our 3 global service centers located in Costa Rica, Poland and Philippines. To these centers, we are building a platform for operational efficiencies today and into the future. 
Business transformation is strengthening our company. It starts and ends with our customers and has significant long-term benefits. We expect to result a $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and $0.5 billion reduction in working capital. 
In summary, we had a good performance in the second quarter in terms of increased margins, strong earnings and investments in the business, while also returning $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through more of the details. Nick?"

Organic local currency sales declined 0.2% in the second quarter with volumes down 1.3% and selling prices up 1.1%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 1.4 percentage points to our sales. This includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana, net of 3 small divestitures. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.5%. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 0.3% versus the second quarter of 2015. Organic growth in the United States was up 0.4% with solid performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely Health Care and Consumer, as well as in Safety and Graphics. Similar to first quarter, U.S. manufacturing activity remained soft in Q2. This, combined with continued weakness in the oil and gas end market, impacted portions of our Industrial business.
In Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 5.4%. Strong growth from our Health Care and Consumer businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics and Energy, as we continue to experience soft end-market demand and channel inventory adjustments in consumer electronics. 
Within Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 1% in Japan and 7% in China/Hong Kong. Excluding our electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 2% and China/Hong Kong, down 2%.
Moving to EMEA. We posted organic growth of 3% in the quarter, led by West Europe. We delivered growth across all businesses in West Europe. From a country perspective, growth was led by Germany and France. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 4.8% with Canada up 6% and Mexico up 5%, while Brazil declined 2%.
Please turn to Slide 5 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion and earnings were $2.08 per share. Operating margins improved by 50 basis points year-on-year to 24.4%, an all-time record margin for the second quarter. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 130 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 110 basis points.
Productivity gains related to last year's fourth quarter restructuring expanded margins by an additional 40 basis points. Lower year-on-year organic volumes, inventory declines and related utilization impacts reduced margins by 110 basis points. The lower utilization was most pronounced in electronics, and to a lesser extent, Industrial. Foreign currency translation impacts, net of hedge gains, decreased margins by 30 basis points. Strategic investments also reduced margins by 30 basis points as we accelerated growth investments and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint. As a reminder, we expect the impact of strategic investments to increase in the second half of the year.
Finally, legal and other factors reduced margins by 60 basis points in the quarter, 50 basis points of which related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling on a long-standing insurance claim. For reference, our Q2 corporate and unallocated expense was up $47 million sequentially, primarily due to this unfavorable arbitration ruling. For the full year, we expect corporate and unallocated expense to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million.
Let's now turn to Slide 6 for a look at EPS. We posted earnings of $2.08 per share in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year. Margin expansion, net of organic sales declines, contributed $0.04 to our earnings per share improvement. First year acquisitions and divestitures added another $0.03 to earnings, driven by solid performances from both Capital Safety and Membrana. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pretax earnings by $40 million or the equivalent of $0.04 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 29.6% versus 28.1% in last year's comparable quarter, which decreased Q2 earnings by $0.04. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-on-year, which added $0.07 to second quarter EPS.
Please turn to Slide 7 for a look at our cash flow performance. Operating cash flow was $1.3 billion in the second quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Our strong cash flow enables us to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. CapEx investments in Q2 totaled $323 million, and we continue to expect full year CapEx in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. These investments drive organic growth, strengthen our manufacturing technologies and support business transformation. 
Free cash flow conversion was 75% in the quarter, similar to last year. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders, including $672 million in dividends, up $26 million year-on-year. We also returned $828 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Through the first half of 2016, we have repurchased $2.1 billion of our own shares. We continue to anticipate full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion.
Let's now review each of our business groups, starting on Slide 8. Our Industrial Business Group posted sales of $2.6 billion in the second quarter. Organic growth was down 1.4%, reflecting the continued economic challenges in the global industrial sector. Positive Q2 growth in Latin America/Canada and EMEA was more than offset by declines in Asia Pacific and the U.S. 
As mentioned earlier, manufacturing activity in the U.S. remained soft in Q2, which impacted parts of our Industrial business. Looking across our Industrial Business Group, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter and continued to outpace global car and light truck builds.
We also posted mid-single-digit organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business, which is gaining share in the collision and auto care markets. Advanced materials declined year-on-year, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market. On a related positive note, this business was recently awarded a $93 million body-armor contract from the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency to be realized over the next 18 months. 
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 2.6% to Industrial sales growth in the quarter. This figure represents the Membrana acquisition, net of the recent Polyfoam divestiture. Membrana continues to deliver strong results, exceeding its financial objective since acquisition. The business continues to expand its geographic presence, which includes recent contract wins with 2 life science customers in China. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $615 million in Q2 and margins rose 30 basis points to 23.4%.
Please turn to Slide 9. Safety and Graphics delivered a solid quarter with sales of $1.5 billion and organic growth of 2.3%. Our roofing granules business posted another strong quarter of double-digit organic growth, as demand increased in the replacement shingle market. Commercial solutions also delivered a solid quarter with notable strength in EMEA and the U.S. Within this business, new product sales in architectural markets and floor care products boosted the organic growth.
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 4.6% to sales growth in the quarter. This figure includes Capital Safety net of 2 small divestitures. The Capital Safety business is already benefiting from access to our company's 46 core technology platforms. For example, the team recently leveraged 2 of those platforms to create and launch a new detachable, self-rescue fall protection device.
On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was led by Latin America/Canada and the U.S. at mid-single digits, while Asia Pacific declined year-on-year. 
Operating income was $411 million and operating margins increased 2 percentage points to 27.4%. Profits in this business continued to be boosted by recent portfolio management actions, along with solid productivity efforts.
Please turn to Slide 10. Our Health Care business delivered another strong quarter across the entire portfolio. Sales increased 3% to $1.4 billion and organic growth was 4.9%, which once again led the company. As Inge mentioned, organic growth was broad-based with all businesses and geographic areas up year-on-year. 
By geography, Latin America/Canada and Asia Pacific each posted high single-digit growth in the quarter. Health Care also generated high single-digit organic growth in developing countries with strong contributions from China/Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mexico. Looking by business, organic growth was led by food safety, health information systems and medical consumables. Operating income was $460 million, up 4.3% year-over-year, and margins remained strong at 32.7%.
Next, I'll cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Second quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.2 billion, down 9.1% organically. Organic sales on the electronics side of the business were down 14%. We continue to be impacted by weak end-market demand across most consumer electronic applications. At the same time, channel inventories continue to adjust, and we expect these challenges to persist into the second half of the year. 
Our energy-related businesses declined 2% organically with growth in telecom being more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double digits in Asia Pacific, impacted by the declines in electronics. 
Second quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $229 million with margins of 19.3%. As mentioned earlier, during Q2, we took actions within Electronics and Energy to better position the business going forward. These actions reduced Q2 margins in this business by 80 basis points. Adjusting for these actions, underlying margins were 20.1%. In light of continued end-market challenges, we now expect full year 2016 organic sales in Electronics and Energy to decline by high single digits.
Please turn to Slide 12, where I will cover our consumer business. Consumer had another solid quarter with sales of $1.1 billion and organic growth of 2.7%. Organic sales growth was led by our home improvement and consumer health care businesses. Recent accelerated growth investments in Command damage-free mounting products and ScotchBlue Painter's Tape continued to pay off, driving strong double-digit organic growth in both cases. 
Filtrete filters continued to gain share and delivered strong growth in the quarter. In our consumer health care business, we are driving strong growth in our FUTURO line of compression solutions, health braces and supports. 
The back-to-school season got off to a good start in the second quarter, led by strong sales of Post-It and Command solutions. Geographically, consumers' organic growth was led by Asia Pacific, along with solid growth in the U.S. Operating income was $281 million with operating margins of 24.9%. Solid organic growth, prioritization of investments and productivity efforts contributed to strong margin performance in the quarter. 
That wraps up my formal comments. Now I will turn the call back over to Inge. Inge?"

As I look across our enterprise, each of our businesses is facing slightly different market realities, yet all of them are executing very well. 6 months into the year, 4 of our 5 business groups are growing in line with our expectations entering the year. And for reasons we have stated, Electronics and Energy is growing below those expectations. 
As a result, today, we're updating our planning estimates for 2016. Organic growth is now estimated to be 0% to 1% against previous guidance of 1% to 3%. With respect to earnings per share, we are raising the low end of our guidance from $8.10 to $8.15 and adjusting the high end from $8.45 to $8.30, resulting in an expected increase of 8% to 10% year-on-year.
We anticipate foreign currency to reduce 2016 sales by 1% to 2%. This is a prior estimate reduction of 1% to 3%. And our full year tax rate is now expected to be 29% to 29.5% versus a previous range of 29.5% to 30.5%.

If I -- if you remember, Andrew, over a long period of time, we see our range for that core price growth being between 30 and 50 basis points. So as I look at this for the total year, we now expect the combination of price raw materials to be benefiting our margin by approximately 100 basis points. 6 months ago, I was saying I expected it to be about 50 basis points. But we're seeing some improvements in commodity prices from what we were anticipating for the second half of the year, and pricing is slightly better than what we had expected."

We have a bigger portion there, which is electronics and Industrial. And for reason that we know relative to that market, had been slower maybe the last 2 years now when we start to look upon it. Nothing's changed there by definition this quarter more than more pressure in electronics. Consumer and Health Care is doing very well for us. So when you look into that, Consumer had 9% growth and Health Care, 11% growth. So both, if you look upon that, it's like 9% to 11% growth in domestic businesses. That's very good. Also, when you look upon Industrial, Industrial improved a little bit. But to be honest, I'm not happy with the growth rate we see for Industrial in China. So we need to see more from Industrial, and I think it's coming as we move ahead. China for us, and I talk for 3M now, we have been very, very precisely driving our productivity improvement there for the last, I would say, 4, 6 quarters.

So we had Industrial with 3%. We had SGBG, 2%; got Health Care, 5%. We had EEBG, 5%. And we had consumer, 2%. If you think about Europe and put that in perspective is what we have to do. There's no reason for us to change strategy around Europe. Our strategy have always been to have localization in terms of execution based on languages. And number two, build up a very strong backbone relative to resources, what we now do with ERP. And we have worked for a long time in order to reduce the layers and organization and management groups. And we have regionalized Europe over 3 years ago. So we don't have subsidiaries in every country any longer. We work on regions. So we have reduced the costs very much in terms of administration, helping the businesses with execution centrally and then execute locally with the teams in every country. There is no reason for us to change the strategy in Europe based on the outcome of the Brexit. No reason for us to do that. The other thing that is very nice for us to see is the margin expansion that is coming for us in West Europe as well. And as I said before, when some of you have asked around which business group can add more margin expansion to you as we move forward, my answer always been all of them because all of them are part of West Europe. And West Europe's margins are now starting to increase in a nice way. So we're very pleased with the performance there. There is issues in Europe. But there's issues everywhere around the world and you have just to stay the course.

Well, first of all, we have done a lot in that business relative to the portfolio and it's an ongoing process. And I think that is now what we see the benefit on. When we started that process quite some year back, when we start really to look upon what we call underperforming businesses, which is the standard is very high, as you know, inside of 3M when you're running at those type of margins. I think the guys have done a fantastic job relative to sort out low-margin businesses that were inside of certain division in that group. And we also, as you know, we divested some businesses, which was a converter business in France relative to license plate that was not strategically important. And by the way, we are not the converter in that industry. So I think that when you start to add things together, we're building out the strength in position with addition of Capital Safety to our personal safety business. And then you look upon the whole graphic side and the transportation side in terms of the work they have done in order to work on the mix. That is the outcome of the results. We expect this business to continue to grow and accelerate growth, in fact, and we should be able to run the margins around this area at this point in time as we move forward. I'm pleased, our leader there, Frank Little, he had told me that he's very confident that he can do that."

We are a material science company and the strings of all capabilities in that market is very, very strong. So from a strategic perspective, there is no question mark for me. And when you look upon the 4 fundamentals that we have in the company in terms of technology, manufacturing capabilities and geographical reach plus brand equity, it's very, very good for us. And as we all know, in terms of electronics, it's growing, generally speaking, and we are all touched by it every day in what we do. So that is what 3M should be. So the question to -- or the answer to that question is yes, there is a place for us to be. And as you have seen, we have adjusted our structure the whole time as that market is a little bit volatile. But as you know, volatility also have an upside and that we will be there to capitalize on that when it comes. I don't think we would see anything this year in terms of change. So I think we have to wait into some time in '17 before we will see growth specifically in consumer electronics taking place. Now there is something called automotive electronics that is accelerating more and more. We make specific investment there in order to capture that as we move ahead. So I will say that it's a volatile market, as we speak. The team is doing an outstanding job. And you saw again here, we had 80 basis point in terms of restructuring for the quarter. You take that out, they were running over 20% again in the quarter. So despite pressure on volume, the structure is down now to be able to deliver around 20% operating income for the company. That -- for me, that's good. So I complement that team for what they are doing in terms of efficiency in a tougher situation, and they're all preparing for when the upturn is coming. And I would like it to come soon, but I don't think we can see it in '16, right? But '17 will soon be here anyhow."

And one thing I see, business transformation starts and end with the customer, starts and end with the customer. Canada was one of the first places we have implemented that program, which is now more than 2 years ago. And it's working well for us in Canada. And when you can provide in the marketplace product that is adding value and provide good service that is based on the demand from the customer, going into an ERP business, result is coming. So there's a couple of things. Good growth, margin expansion and, I guess, that team should be complemented for the way they operate today and the way they took on the ERP system as one of the first places for us on a global base to execute that and actually helped us a lot in terms of the rollout that you see now in Europe. So yes, it's a very, very nice result. Is it a surprise? No, it's not, it's not. It's based on very good relation with customers, total dedication to what we call customer first and then the ERP system help the customer and us in order to lay out the demand plans and then for us is to deliver on it."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, our company delivered increased earnings, robust cash flow and a broad-based margin performance with each of our business groups posting margins greater than 22%",760,"Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, our company delivered increased earnings, robust cash flow and a broad-based margin performance with each of our business groups posting margins greater than 22%. At the same time, we continued to execute on business transformation, took actions to strengthen the portfolio and increased investment in future growth. The third quarter also marked our company's 100 straight year of paying dividends, which we increased for each of the last 58 years.
With respect to EPS, our team posted earnings of $2.15 per share, up 5% year-on-year. We delivered total sales of $7.7 billion, flat versus last year's third quarter. Organic growth was down 80 basis points while a combined impact from acquisitions and FX increased sales by similar amount. 
Looking closer at the organic growth, we once again delivered positive growth from 3 business groups: Consumer, Safety and Graphics and Health Care. Consumer paced our company's growth at 3% with positive growth in all businesses. Safety and Graphics grew 2% organically, led by roofing granules and commercial solutions. Organic growth in our Health Care business was 1.5%, which was tempered versus recent quarters due to some softness in the U.S. Health Care market. Industrials organic growth declined 1%, and we continue to anticipate growth in this business to turn positive in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, Electronics and Energy was down 8% in the quarter, in line with what we indicated during our last earnings call. Even in a challenging macro environment, the strings of our business model has enabled us to deliver premium returns and generate healthy cash flow.
Company-wide, we increased margins 40 basis points to nearly 25%, ranging from 32% in Health Care to just shy of 23% in Industrial. At the same time, we increased free cash flow by 19% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 117%. Our strong cash flow allow us to invest in the business while also returning cash to shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders to share repurchases and dividends. We also continue to build our enterprise for the future, and I will make some comments on our recent progress. 
Please move to Slide 5. You have heard me talk many times about the 3M playbook, which is the key enabler for our short and long-term success. The playbook includes 3 levers that are creating value for enterprise and that we continue to make good progress on. 2 of the levers, investing and innovation and portfolio management, are important to our long-term growth objectives. 
In addition to ongoing investment in research and development, we continue to prioritize our portfolio and make targeted investments to support organic growth. We also drive growth to acquisitions, which complement organic growth and enhance our technology capabilities as well as partnerships, which combine all strings with those of other organizations.
Most recently, we finalized an acquisition and established 1 partnership, both related to Health Care. You will recall that in February, we decided to retain and further invest in our health information system business. To bolster our technology capabilities in that area, in September, we acquired Semfinder, a medical coding company based in Switzerland. This acquisition helps us accelerate penetration in international markets, which is important as more countries move towards electronic medical records.
To further strengthen health information systems, earlier this month, we announced the collaboration with Verily, the life science business of the Alphabet company. This is a partnership between 2 highly creative and innovative companies that will leverage our expertise in Health Care coding with their expertise in data analytics and software. Ultimately, we will develop tools to help providers increase the quality and affordability of Health Care, which comes back to our company's vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life. 
Beyond growth investments, we are taking other recent action to prepare 3M for the future. 3 weeks ago, we finalized the sale of a noncore protective films business that will further enhance and focus our industrial portfolio. We're also making solid progress on our third lever, business transformation with 2 recent ERP rollouts in West Europe. As a reminder, we have now deployed ERP in 15 countries and in 4 of our largest European distribution centers.
In summary, I'm pleased with our team's performance in the quarter in terms of controlling what we can control while also building for the future. 
With that, I turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick?"

Our acquisitions of",1654,"Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6 for a recap of our Q3 sales performance.
Organic local-currency sales declined 80 basis points in the third quarter with volumes down 1.4% and selling prices up 0.6%. Our acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana, net of 3 small divestitures, added 0.3 percentage points to sales. And foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.5%. In U.S. dollar terms, worldwide sales were flat versus the third quarter of last year.
Looking at organic growth by geography. The United States declined 0.3% in Q3. Our Consumer and Safety and Graphics businesses generated positive organic growth, which offset declines in Industrial and Electronics and Energy. In Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 2.2%. Solid growth from our Consumer, Health Care and Safety and Graphics businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics and Energy.
Organic growth increased 1% in Japan and declined 2% in China/Hong Kong. Excluding electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 1%, and China/Hong Kong grew more than 4%. 
Let's now take a look at the EMEA region starting with West Europe. West Europe delivered 1% organic growth, led by Germany, Sweden and Spain. From a business perspective, growth was led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa declined year-on-year impacted by ongoing challenges in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. In total, organic growth across EMEA declined 1% in the quarter. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 1.2%. Mexico grew 5%. And Brazil rose 2%, while Canada declined 3%.
Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Third quarter sales were $7.7 billion, and we generated record third quarter earnings of $2.15 per share. GAAP operating margins were again strong at 24.7%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 100 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 90 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year's Q4 restructuring expanded margins by 40 basis points in Q3. 
Looking at headwinds. First-year acquisitions reduced margins 10 basis points. This includes the impact of Capital Safety and Membrana. We continue to accelerate strategic growth investments across the portfolio and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint, which reduced margins by 40 basis points. The impact of lower year-on-year foreign currency hedge gains decreased margins by 50 basis points. 
And finally, organic volume declines, along with related utilization impacts, reduced margins by 90 basis points. Most impacted were our Industrial and Electronics and Energy businesses.
Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a look at EPS. Earnings per share in the third quarter were $2.15, an increase of 4.9% versus the third quarter of 2015. Margin expansion, net of organic sales declines added $0.05 to earnings per share in Q3. Foreign currency impacts, net of lower year-on-year hedged gains, reduced pretax earnings by $20 million or the equivalent to $0.02 a share. The third quarter tax rate was 28.5% versus 29.6% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Favorable developments and international tax audits had a positive impact on the Q3 rate.
And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2% year-on-year, which added $0.04 to third quarter EPS. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. We generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, a $244 million increase year-over-year. Lower cash taxes drove the increase, offset in part by higher year-on-year pension contributions. Q3 CapEx investments were $347 million, in line with last year's third quarter. And we now expect full year CapEx in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion.
Third quarter free cash flow conversion was 117%, up 16 percentage points versus the same period last year. And for the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in a range of 95% to 105%. As a reminder, our fourth quarter conversion is typically the strongest of the year.
In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders in Q3, including $670 million in dividends, up $35 million year-on-year. We also returned $774 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases or $2.8 billion year-to-date. We now expect our full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion versus a prior range of $4 billion to $6 billion.
Let's now review each of our business groups starting on Slide 10. Our Industrial business posted sales of $2.6 billion in the third quarter with an organic growth decline of 1.1% year-on-year. Our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter, continuing its long track record of increasing market penetration and outpacing the rate of global car and light truck builds. 
We also posted positive organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business. Advanced materials declined double digits year-on-year, impacted by persistent weakness in the oil and gas market. 
Looking by geography, industrial's positive organic growth in Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in Latin America and the U.S. Third quarter organic growth in our U.S. Industrial business improved slightly versus the first half of 2016. And we expect to see further improvement in Q4. 
The Membrana acquisition, net of 1 small divestiture, added 1.4% to industrial sales growth in the quarter. Membrana continues to exceed our sales and profit expectations. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $591 million in Q3 and margins were up 30 basis points to 22.9%. 
Please turn to Slide 11. Third quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion with organic growth of 2%. Q3 organic growth was led by our roofing granules and commercial solutions businesses. Roofing granules posted another strong double-digit increase in the third quarter. Demand in this market has been strong throughout 2016. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was led by Latin America/Canada, which increased mid single digits, followed by positive growth in Asia Pacific and the U.S. Operating income was $364 million and operating margins were once again strong at 25.1%, up 220 basis points year-over-year.
Q3 margin expansion was boosted by lower year-over-year acquisition costs related to Capital Safety and solid productivity efforts across the portfolio. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter. Organic growth was up 1.5% led by a double-digit increase in food safety, along with positive contributions from drug delivery systems, critical and chronic care and health information systems. Organic growth in oral care solutions was flat, which was impacted by soft market conditions in the U.S. On a geographic basis, Health Care delivered mid single-digit growth in Asia Pacific. Latin America/Canada and EMEA both posted low single-digit growth, while the U.S. was flat.
Organic growth was up low single digits in developing countries, a bit softer than recent quarters. Health Care organic growth in Q3 was below recent trends, and we expect soft market conditions to persist in the near term. Health Care's operating income was $429 million and margins remained strong at 31.5%. Importantly, we generated these returns while continuing to increase growth investments across the business. 
Next, I'll cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13.  Third quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.3 billion, down 8.1% organically. Organic sales declined 8% in our electronics-related businesses. Market challenges persisted across most consumer electronics applications, which impacted volume growth. Channel inventory levels have improved versus earlier in the year, but further adjustments occurred in Q3. Our team continues to focus on driving spec-in wins and increasing customer relevance across all consumer electronics OEMs.
Our energy-related businesses declined 9% organically. Electrical Markets declined high single digits, and renewable energy was down double digits. As a reminder, we exited our renewable energy back sheet business last December, which reduced energy-related organic growth by nearly 300 basis points in the third quarter. Our third quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $312 million. And even in a challenging growth environment, our team delivered healthy margins of 24.2%. 
Please turn to Slide 14, where I will cover our Consumer business. Consumer had another strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and organic growth of 2.9%, which led the company. Geographically, consumers' organic growth was led by Asia Pacific and the U.S., both up mid single digits, along with solid growth in Latin America/Canada. Looking by business, organic growth was positive across the entire consumer portfolio, paced by a mid single-digit increase in our Home Improvement business. Within home improvement, our Command mounting products, ScotchBlue Painter's Tape and Filtrete filters, once again, posted strong organic growth. We continue to accelerate growth investments to enhance the value of these important brands.
Consumer-generated operating income of $317 million with margins of 26.2%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Positive organic growth, portfolio prioritization and ongoing productivity efforts drove the margin improvement. 
Please turn to Slide 15 for an update on our 2016 planning estimates. We now expect 2016 GAAP earnings in the range of $8.15 to $8.20 per share versus a prior range of $8.15 to $8.30. The narrowed range equates to approximately 8% EPS growth year-over-year. For full year, organic sales growth is now expected to be approximately flat at the low end of our previous range of flat to up 1%. Foreign currency translation is now anticipated to reduce sales by approximately 1% versus the prior range of down 1% to 2%.
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, will add 1% to full year sales growth. The full year tax rate is now expected to be approximately 29% versus a prior range of 29% to 29.5%. Lastly, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105% for the full year.
With that, we thank you for your attention, and we'll now take your questions."

And then as you know, things are going on in Central/East Europe, specifically in Turkey [indiscernible], generally speaking. So when you look upon it from a business perspective, if you tempered in United States, which we did, that would go all businesses, right? They are trying -- I think try to move some purchases forward maybe 1 to 2 quarter. That's what we're talking about the like mid-term or short-term tempering. So I will say all businesses, except one, which is oral care, had positive organic local currency growth. And oral care was flat. So still show growth, but it was tempered. And by definition, I'm not concerned at all relative to the future of that business. And we continue to invest for the future. We've done quite some investment, as you know, the last couple of years, right? So there is no concern. It was just that it slowed down, and it was basically in the last months of the quarter."

And in Q3, we -- the market was trading at near all-time highs. And you've heard me say this before that one of the factors that in,fluences our repurchase activity is relative value and price. And as you know, that's why we stepped up our activity earlier in the year in the first quarter. So over time, the pace of our repurchases is dependent on other demands on capital, such as M&A, along with the relative value of the stock. And those things are what's impacting us, now putting the guidance at $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion for the year."

And on December 13, we'll provide more details on that at our outlook meeting. At a high level, Andy, we expect an external growth market to continue moving sideways in '17. That's the overall external picture we're anticipating. From a business perspective, we do expect our Industrial and Electronics and Energy businesses to have improved growth rates in 2017 versus what we've been seeing in 2016. And then to part [ph] your question on margins, Andy, we're still expecting price raw materials to be positive to earnings and to margins in 2017. Probably at a lower level of contribution to margin enhancement than what we've seen in 2016. And then business transformation, I expect that to have a increased positive impact on our earnings per share and margin in 2017. I think you've heard me say that we expected and we're realizing approximately $50 million of operating income benefit from business transformation as part of -- in 2016. And that's part of our journey moving to $500 million to $700 million of savings by 2020. And I'd expect 2017 to be a continued progression on that path. That said, we are, as you mentioned, we're going to have a couple of headwinds. Pension is likely to be a headwind for us. If I were to take current rates where they are, I'm estimating this will be about $150 million headwind for 3M in 2017. And FX will likely be a headwind for us, not so much based on movements in exchange rates, but the fact that we won't be repeating some of the hedging gains that we experienced in 2016. All in, those lower hedge gains will probably hurt our margins by about $100 million. So all in, Andy, that's the puts and takes of a preview of what I expect we'll be talking about in the 1.5 months."

I'm very confident in our Industrial business group relative to growth going forward. And the reason for that is we have worked now for quite some time, not only in the Industrial, but in all business group in order to make sure that we get the portfolio that is relevant for us in order to serve our customers. We have seen, during the last couple of years, some heavy lifting going on in the portfolio work, not only in Electronic and Energy, but in Safety and Graphics and in Industrial as well. So when I look upon it, we are moving the company to spaces and places where we are more relevant and that we can also capitalize on technology conversion. Meaning, also driving better margin for us. So in fact, we have fired some of our portfolios over the years, right? So -- and it takes some time as you go through that process, right?

Going forward, as we have shift the portfolio there as well, we will, as we go, start to see some positive evolution relative to growth rate because we are moving to segments that are growing faster and where we are more relevant.

It's slightly less than versus LED, but we are still in that business, and it's expanding in a way.

So I think that what we have talked about for quite some time about so it's not really a shift. It's to grow our domestic businesses. It's coming. But on the other hand,, it's a little bit slower, I think and we think versus the original plan. But if you think about the other business, if you take the electronic part, right, which is very much in Asia and in China, we had a 4% growth in China. You will like it to be 12%, but it's 4%. And it's the biggest subsidiary outside of the United States for us. So I am slightly positive as we move ahead relative to China. Now that team is driving productivity big time, right? That's the model there today versus 5 years ago, it's different. Everything was about growth, right? We grew 15% to 20% year-over-year. We don't any longer. We grow 4%. So now productivity is a key element for us, and I think that's important. We have good margins and we continue to expand margin there. So I hope that helps in terms of explaining China."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, our company delivered increased earnings, robust cash flow and a broad-based margin performance with each of our business groups posting margins greater than 22%",760,"Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, our company delivered increased earnings, robust cash flow and a broad-based margin performance with each of our business groups posting margins greater than 22%. At the same time, we continued to execute on business transformation, took actions to strengthen the portfolio and increased investment in future growth. The third quarter also marked our company's 100 straight year of paying dividends, which we increased for each of the last 58 years.
With respect to EPS, our team posted earnings of $2.15 per share, up 5% year-on-year. We delivered total sales of $7.7 billion, flat versus last year's third quarter. Organic growth was down 80 basis points while a combined impact from acquisitions and FX increased sales by similar amount. 
Looking closer at the organic growth, we once again delivered positive growth from 3 business groups: Consumer, Safety and Graphics and Health Care. Consumer paced our company's growth at 3% with positive growth in all businesses. Safety and Graphics grew 2% organically, led by roofing granules and commercial solutions. Organic growth in our Health Care business was 1.5%, which was tempered versus recent quarters due to some softness in the U.S. Health Care market. Industrials organic growth declined 1%, and we continue to anticipate growth in this business to turn positive in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, Electronics and Energy was down 8% in the quarter, in line with what we indicated during our last earnings call. Even in a challenging macro environment, the strings of our business model has enabled us to deliver premium returns and generate healthy cash flow.
Company-wide, we increased margins 40 basis points to nearly 25%, ranging from 32% in Health Care to just shy of 23% in Industrial. At the same time, we increased free cash flow by 19% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 117%. Our strong cash flow allow us to invest in the business while also returning cash to shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders to share repurchases and dividends. We also continue to build our enterprise for the future, and I will make some comments on our recent progress. 
Please move to Slide 5. You have heard me talk many times about the 3M playbook, which is the key enabler for our short and long-term success. The playbook includes 3 levers that are creating value for enterprise and that we continue to make good progress on. 2 of the levers, investing and innovation and portfolio management, are important to our long-term growth objectives. 
In addition to ongoing investment in research and development, we continue to prioritize our portfolio and make targeted investments to support organic growth. We also drive growth to acquisitions, which complement organic growth and enhance our technology capabilities as well as partnerships, which combine all strings with those of other organizations.
Most recently, we finalized an acquisition and established 1 partnership, both related to Health Care. You will recall that in February, we decided to retain and further invest in our health information system business. To bolster our technology capabilities in that area, in September, we acquired Semfinder, a medical coding company based in Switzerland. This acquisition helps us accelerate penetration in international markets, which is important as more countries move towards electronic medical records.
To further strengthen health information systems, earlier this month, we announced the collaboration with Verily, the life science business of the Alphabet company. This is a partnership between 2 highly creative and innovative companies that will leverage our expertise in Health Care coding with their expertise in data analytics and software. Ultimately, we will develop tools to help providers increase the quality and affordability of Health Care, which comes back to our company's vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life. 
Beyond growth investments, we are taking other recent action to prepare 3M for the future. 3 weeks ago, we finalized the sale of a noncore protective films business that will further enhance and focus our industrial portfolio. We're also making solid progress on our third lever, business transformation with 2 recent ERP rollouts in West Europe. As a reminder, we have now deployed ERP in 15 countries and in 4 of our largest European distribution centers.
In summary, I'm pleased with our team's performance in the quarter in terms of controlling what we can control while also building for the future. 
With that, I turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick?"

Our acquisitions of",1650,"Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6 for a recap of our Q3 sales performance.
Organic local-currency sales declined 80 basis points in the third quarter with volumes down 1.4% and selling prices up 0.6%. Our acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana, net of 3 small divestitures, added 0.3 percentage points to sales. And foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.5%. In U.S. dollar terms, worldwide sales were flat versus the third quarter of last year.
Looking at organic growth by geography. The United States declined 0.3% in Q3. Our Consumer and Safety and Graphics businesses generated positive organic growth, which offset declines in Industrial and Electronics and Energy. In Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 2.2%. Solid growth from our Consumer, Health Care and Safety and Graphics businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics and Energy.
Organic growth increased 1% in Japan and declined 2% in China/Hong Kong. Excluding electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 1%, and China/Hong Kong grew more than 4%. 
Let's now take a look at the EMEA region starting with West Europe. West Europe delivered 1% organic growth, led by Germany, Sweden and Spain. From a business perspective, growth was led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa declined year-on-year impacted by ongoing challenges in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. In total, organic growth across EMEA declined 1% in the quarter. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 1.2%. Mexico grew 5%. And Brazil rose 2%, while Canada declined 3%.
Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Third quarter sales were $7.7 billion, and we generated record third quarter earnings of $2.15 per share. GAAP operating margins were again strong at 24.7%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 100 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 90 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year's Q4 restructuring expanded margins by 40 basis points in Q3. 
Looking at headwinds. First-year acquisitions reduced margins 10 basis points. This includes the impact of Capital Safety and Membrana. We continue to accelerate strategic growth investments across the portfolio and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint, which reduced margins by 40 basis points. The impact of lower year-on-year foreign currency hedge gains decreased margins by 50 basis points. 
And finally, organic volume declines, along with related utilization impacts, reduced margins by 90 basis points. Most impacted were our Industrial and Electronics and Energy businesses.
Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a look at EPS. Earnings per share in the third quarter were $2.15, an increase of 4.9% versus the third quarter of 2015. Margin expansion, net of organic sales declines added $0.05 to earnings per share in Q3. Foreign currency impacts, net of lower year-on-year hedged gains, reduced pretax earnings by $20 million or the equivalent to $0.02 a share. The third quarter tax rate was 28.5% versus 29.6% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Favorable developments and international tax audits had a positive impact on the Q3 rate.
And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2% year-on-year, which added $0.04 to third quarter EPS. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. We generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, a $244 million increase year-over-year. Lower cash taxes drove the increase, offset in part by higher year-on-year pension contributions. Q3 CapEx investments were $347 million, in line with last year's third quarter. And we now expect full year CapEx in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion.
Third quarter free cash flow conversion was 117%, up 16 percentage points versus the same period last year. And for the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in a range of 95% to 105%. As a reminder, our fourth quarter conversion is typically the strongest of the year.
In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders in Q3, including $670 million in dividends, up $35 million year-on-year. We also returned $774 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases or $2.8 billion year-to-date. We now expect our full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion versus a prior range of $4 billion to $6 billion.
Let's now review each of our business groups starting on Slide 10. Our Industrial business posted sales of $2.6 billion in the third quarter with an organic growth decline of 1.1% year-on-year. Our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter, continuing its long track record of increasing market penetration and outpacing the rate of global car and light truck builds. 
We also posted positive organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business. Advanced materials declined double digits year-on-year, impacted by persistent weakness in the oil and gas market. 
Looking by geography, industrial's positive organic growth in Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in Latin America and the U.S. Third quarter organic growth in our U.S. Industrial business improved slightly versus the first half of 2016. And we expect to see further improvement in Q4. 
The Membrana acquisition, net of 1 small divestiture, added 1.4% to industrial sales growth in the quarter. Membrana continues to exceed our sales and profit expectations. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $591 million in Q3 and margins were up 30 basis points to 22.9%. 
Please turn to Slide 11. Third quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion with organic growth of 2%. Q3 organic growth was led by our roofing granules and commercial solutions businesses. Roofing granules posted another strong double-digit increase in the third quarter. Demand in this market has been strong throughout 2016. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was led by Latin America/Canada, which increased mid-single digits, followed by positive growth in Asia Pacific and the U.S. Operating income was $364 million and operating margins were once again strong at 25.1%, up 220 basis points year-over-year.
Q3 margin expansion was boosted by lower year-over-year acquisition costs related to Capital Safety and solid productivity efforts across the portfolio. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter. Organic growth was up 1.5% led by a double-digit increase in food safety, along with positive contributions from drug delivery systems, critical and chronic care and health information systems. Organic growth in oral care solutions was flat, which was impacted by soft market conditions in the U.S. On a geographic basis, Health Care delivered mid-single-digit growth in Asia Pacific. Latin America/Canada and EMEA both posted low single-digit growth, while the U.S. was flat.
Organic growth was up low single digits in developing countries, a bit softer than recent quarters. Health Care organic growth in Q3 was below recent trends, and we expect soft market conditions to persist in the near term. Health Care's operating income was $429 million and margins remained strong at 31.5%. Importantly, we generated these returns while continuing to increase growth investments across the business. 
Next, I'll cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13.  Third quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.3 billion, down 8.1% organically. Organic sales declined 8% in our electronics-related businesses. Market challenges persisted across most consumer electronics applications, which impacted volume growth. Channel inventory levels have improved versus earlier in the year, but further adjustments occurred in Q3. Our team continues to focus on driving spec-in wins and increasing customer relevance across all consumer electronics OEMs.
Our energy-related businesses declined 9% organically. Electrical Markets declined high single digits, and renewable energy was down double digits. As a reminder, we exited our renewable energy back sheet business last December, which reduced energy-related organic growth by nearly 300 basis points in the third quarter. Our third quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $312 million. And even in a challenging growth environment, our team delivered healthy margins of 24.2%. 
Please turn to Slide 14, where I will cover our Consumer business. Consumer had another strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and organic growth of 2.9%, which led the company. Geographically, consumers' organic growth was led by Asia Pacific and the U.S., both up mid-single digits, along with solid growth in Latin America/Canada. Looking by business, organic growth was positive across the entire consumer portfolio, paced by a mid-single-digit increase in our Home Improvement business. Within home improvement, our Command mounting products, ScotchBlue Painter's Tape and Filtrete filters, once again, posted strong organic growth. We continue to accelerate growth investments to enhance the value of these important brands.
Consumer-generated operating income of $317 million with margins of 26.2%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Positive organic growth, portfolio prioritization and ongoing productivity efforts drove the margin improvement. 
Please turn to Slide 15 for an update on our 2016 planning estimates. We now expect 2016 GAAP earnings in the range of $8.15 to $8.20 per share versus a prior range of $8.15 to $8.30. The narrowed range equates to approximately 8% EPS growth year-over-year. For full year, organic sales growth is now expected to be approximately flat at the low end of our previous range of flat to up 1%. Foreign currency translation is now anticipated to reduce sales by approximately 1% versus the prior range of down 1% to 2%.
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, will add 1% to full year sales growth. The full year tax rate is now expected to be approximately 29% versus a prior range of 29% to 29.5%. Lastly, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105% for the full year.
With that, we thank you for your attention, and we'll now take your questions."

They are trying -- I think try to move some purchases forward maybe 1 to 2 quarter. That's what we're talking about the like mid-term or short-term tempering. So I will say all businesses, except one, which is oral care, had positive organic local currency growth. And oral care was flat. So still show growth, but it was tempered. And by definition, I'm not concerned at all relative to the future of that business. And we continue to invest for the future. We've done quite some investment, as you know, the last couple of years, right? So there is no concern. It was just that it slowed down, and it was basically in the last months of the quarter."

That's the overall external picture we're anticipating. From a business perspective, we do expect our Industrial and Electronics and Energy businesses to have improved growth rates in 2017 versus what we've been seeing in 2016. And then to -- part of your question on margins, Andy, we're still expecting price raw materials to be positive to earnings and to margins in 2017. Probably at a lower level of contribution to margin enhancement than what we've seen in 2016. And then business transformation, I expect that to have a increased positive impact on our earnings per share and margin in 2017. I think you've heard me say that we expected and we're realizing approximately $50 million of operating income benefit from business transformation as part of -- in 2016. And that's part of our journey moving to $500 million to $700 million of savings by 2020. And I'd expect 2017 to be a continued progression on that path. That said, we are, as you mentioned, we're going to have a couple of headwinds. Pension is likely to be a headwind for us. If I were to take current rates where they are, I'm estimating this will be about $150 million headwind for 3M in 2017. And FX will likely be a headwind for us, not so much based on movements in exchange rates, but the fact that we won't be repeating some of the hedging gains that we experienced in 2016. All in, those lower hedge gains will probably hurt our margins by about $100 million. So all in, Andy, that's the puts and takes of a preview of what I expect we'll be talking about in the 1.5 months."

And the reason for that is we have worked now for quite some time, not only in the Industrial, but in all business group in order to make sure that we get the portfolio that is relevant for us in order to serve our customers. We have seen, during the last couple of years, some heavy lifting going on in the portfolio work, not only in Electronic and Energy, but in Safety and Graphics and in Industrial as well.

So if you look upon it, it will be around automotive, electrification, data centers, sustainability, chemistry and grade automation. That will be a shift as you go relative to where you today can look upon. It's very much design-in assembly. So we have a range in a 5-year plan, as you know, of 0 to 4.

If you take in electronics into it, which actually was down 11%, we were down 2 percentage for China. Now, if there is a clear improvement is what I will consider domestic-driven businesses. So if you take the 5 business groups first in China: SGBG grew 18%; Consumer, 12%; Health Care, 8%; and Industrial 2%; and then Electronics and Energy was down. But if you think about that, we had 4 or 5 business groups in China growing. And it was very much in consumer, health care, automotive aftermarket, automotive OEM and personal safety. So I think that what we have talked about for quite some time about -- so it's not really a shift. It's like, to grow out the domestic businesses. It's coming, but on the other hand, it's a little bit slower, I think and we think, versus the original plan. But if you think about the old business, if you take the electronic part, which is very much in Asia and in China, we had a 4% growth in China. You will like it to be 12%, but it's 4%. And it's the biggest subsidiary outside of United States for us. So I am slightly positive as we move ahead relative to China. Now that team is driving productivity big time, right? That's the model there today versus 5 years ago, it's different. Everything was about growth, right? We grew 15% to 20% year-over-year. We don't any longer. We grow 4%. So now productivity is a key element for us, and I think that's important. We have good margins, and we continue to expand margin there. So I hope that helps in terms of explaining China."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, our company delivered increased earnings, robust cash flow and a broad-based margin performance with each of our business groups posting margins greater than 22%",760,"Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, our company delivered increased earnings, robust cash flow and a broad-based margin performance with each of our business groups posting margins greater than 22%. At the same time, we continued to execute on business transformation, took actions to strengthen the portfolio and increased investment in future growth. The third quarter also marked our company's 100 straight year of paying dividends, which we increased for each of the last 58 years.
With respect to EPS, our team posted earnings of $2.15 per share, up 5% year-on-year. We delivered total sales of $7.7 billion, flat versus last year's third quarter. Organic growth was down 80 basis points while a combined impact from acquisitions and FX increased sales by similar amount. 
Looking closer at the organic growth, we once again delivered positive growth from 3 business groups: Consumer, Safety and Graphics and Health Care. Consumer paced our company's growth at 3% with positive growth in all businesses. Safety and Graphics grew 2% organically, led by roofing granules and commercial solutions. Organic growth in our Health Care business was 1.5%, which was tempered versus recent quarters due to some softness in the U.S. Health Care market. Industrials organic growth declined 1%, and we continue to anticipate growth in this business to turn positive in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, Electronics and Energy was down 8% in the quarter, in line with what we indicated during our last earnings call. Even in a challenging macro environment, the strings of our business model has enabled us to deliver premium returns and generate healthy cash flow.
Company-wide, we increased margins 40 basis points to nearly 25%, ranging from 32% in Health Care to just shy of 23% in Industrial. At the same time, we increased free cash flow by 19% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 117%. Our strong cash flow allow us to invest in the business while also returning cash to shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders to share repurchases and dividends. We also continued to build our enterprise for the future, and I will make some comments on our recent progress. 
Please move to Slide 5. You have heard me talk many times about the 3M playbook, which is the key enabler for our short and long-term success. The playbook includes 3 levers that are creating value for enterprise and that we continue to make good progress on. 2 of the levers, investing and innovation and portfolio management, are important to our long-term growth objectives. 
In addition to ongoing investment in research and development, we continue to prioritize our portfolio and make targeted investments to support organic growth. We also drive growth through acquisitions, which complement organic growth and enhance our technology capabilities as well as partnerships, which combine all strings with those of other organizations.
Most recently, we finalized an acquisition and established 1 partnership, both related to Health Care. You will recall that in February, we decided to retain and further invest in our health information system business. To bolster our technology capabilities in that area, in September, we acquired Semfinder, a medical coding company based in Switzerland. This acquisition helps us accelerate penetration in international markets, which is important as more countries move towards electronic medical records.
To further strengthen health information systems, earlier this month, we announced the collaboration with Verily, the life science business of the Alphabet company. This is a partnership between 2 highly creative and innovative companies that will leverage our expertise in Health Care coding with their expertise in data analytics and software. Ultimately, we will develop tools to help providers increase the quality and affordability of Health Care, which comes back to our company's vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life. 
Beyond growth investments, we are taking other recent action to prepare 3M for the future. 3 weeks ago, we finalized the sale of a noncore protective films business that will further enhance and focus our industrial portfolio. We're also making solid progress on our third lever, business transformation with 2 recent ERP rollouts in West Europe. As a reminder, we have now deployed ERP in 15 countries and in 4 of our largest European distribution centers.
In summary, I'm pleased with our team's performance in the quarter in terms of controlling what we can control while also building for the future. 
With that, I turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick?"

Our acquisitions of",1650,"Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6 for a recap of our Q3 sales performance.
Organic local-currency sales declined 80 basis points in the third quarter with volumes down 1.4% and selling prices up 0.6%. Our acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana, net of 3 small divestitures, added 0.3 percentage points to sales. And foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.5%. In U.S. dollar terms, worldwide sales were flat versus the third quarter of last year.
Looking at organic growth by geography. The United States declined 0.3% in Q3. Our Consumer and Safety and Graphics businesses generated positive organic growth, which offset declines in Industrial and Electronics and Energy. In Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 2.2%. Solid growth from our Consumer, Health Care and Safety and Graphics businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics and Energy.
Organic growth increased 1% in Japan and declined 2% in China/Hong Kong. Excluding electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 1%, and China/Hong Kong grew more than 4%. 
Let's now take a look at the EMEA region starting with West Europe. West Europe delivered 1% organic growth, led by Germany, Sweden and Spain. From a business perspective, growth was led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa declined year-on-year impacted by ongoing challenges in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. In total, organic growth across EMEA declined 1% in the quarter. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 1.2%. Mexico grew 5%. And Brazil rose 2%, while Canada declined 3%.
Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Third quarter sales were $7.7 billion, and we generated record third quarter earnings of $2.15 per share. GAAP operating margins were again strong at 24.7%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 100 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 90 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year's Q4 restructuring expanded margins by 40 basis points in Q3. 
Looking at headwinds. First-year acquisitions reduced margins 10 basis points. This includes the impact of Capital Safety and Membrana. We continue to accelerate strategic growth investments across the portfolio and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint, which reduced margins by 40 basis points. The impact of lower year-on-year foreign currency hedge gains decreased margins by 50 basis points. 
And finally, organic volume declines, along with related utilization impacts, reduced margins by 90 basis points. Most impacted were our Industrial and Electronics and Energy businesses.
Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a look at EPS. Earnings per share in the third quarter were $2.15, an increase of 4.9% versus the third quarter of 2015. Margin expansion, net of organic sales declines added $0.05 to earnings per share in Q3. Foreign currency impacts, net of lower year-on-year hedged gains, reduced pretax earnings by $20 million or the equivalent to $0.02 a share. The third quarter tax rate was 28.5% versus 29.6% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Favorable developments and international tax audits had a positive impact on the Q3 rate.
And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2% year-on-year, which added $0.04 to third quarter EPS. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. We generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, a $244 million increase year-over-year. Lower cash taxes drove the increase, offset in part by higher year-on-year pension contributions. Q3 CapEx investments were $347 million, in line with last year's third quarter. And we now expect full year CapEx in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion.
Third quarter free cash flow conversion was 117%, up 16 percentage points versus the same period last year. And for the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in a range of 95% to 105%. As a reminder, our fourth quarter conversion is typically the strongest of the year.
In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders in Q3, including $670 million in dividends, up $35 million year-on-year. We also returned $774 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases or $2.8 billion year-to-date. We now expect our full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion versus a prior range of $4 billion to $6 billion.
Let's now review each of our business groups starting on Slide 10. Our Industrial business posted sales of $2.6 billion in the third quarter with an organic growth decline of 1.1% year-on-year. Our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter, continuing its long track record of increasing market penetration and outpacing the rate of global car and light truck builds. 
We also posted positive organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business. Advanced materials declined double digits year-on-year, impacted by persistent weakness in the oil and gas market. 
Looking by geography, industrial's positive organic growth in Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in Latin America and the U.S. Third quarter organic growth in our U.S. Industrial business improved slightly versus the first half of 2016. And we expect to see further improvement in Q4. 
The Membrana acquisition, net of 1 small divestiture, added 1.4% to industrial sales growth in the quarter. Membrana continues to exceed our sales and profit expectations. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $591 million in Q3 and margins were up 30 basis points to 22.9%. 
Please turn to Slide 11. Third quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion with organic growth of 2%. Q3 organic growth was led by our roofing granules and commercial solutions businesses. Roofing granules posted another strong double-digit increase in the third quarter. Demand in this market has been strong throughout 2016. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was led by Latin America/Canada, which increased mid-single digits, followed by positive growth in Asia Pacific and the U.S. Operating income was $364 million and operating margins were once again strong at 25.1%, up 220 basis points year-over-year.
Q3 margin expansion was boosted by lower year-over-year acquisition costs related to Capital Safety and solid productivity efforts across the portfolio. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter. Organic growth was up 1.5% led by a double-digit increase in food safety, along with positive contributions from drug delivery systems, critical and chronic care and health information systems. Organic growth in oral care solutions was flat, which was impacted by soft market conditions in the U.S. On a geographic basis, Health Care delivered mid-single-digit growth in Asia Pacific. Latin America/Canada and EMEA both posted low single-digit growth, while the U.S. was flat.
Organic growth was up low single digits in developing countries, a bit softer than recent quarters. Health Care organic growth in Q3 was below recent trends, and we expect soft market conditions to persist in the near term. Health Care's operating income was $429 million and margins remained strong at 31.5%. Importantly, we generated these returns while continuing to increase growth investments across the business. 
Next, I'll cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13.  Third quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.3 billion, down 8.1% organically. Organic sales declined 8% in our electronics-related businesses. Market challenges persisted across most consumer electronics applications, which impacted volume growth. Channel inventory levels have improved versus earlier in the year, but further adjustments occurred in Q3. Our team continues to focus on driving spec-in wins and increasing customer relevance across all consumer electronics OEMs.
Our energy-related businesses declined 9% organically. Electrical Markets declined high single digits, and renewable energy was down double digits. As a reminder, we exited our renewable energy back sheet business last December, which reduced energy-related organic growth by nearly 300 basis points in the third quarter. Our third quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $312 million. And even in a challenging growth environment, our team delivered healthy margins of 24.2%. 
Please turn to Slide 14, where I will cover our Consumer business. Consumer had another strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and organic growth of 2.9%, which led the company. Geographically, consumers' organic growth was led by Asia Pacific and the U.S., both up mid-single digits, along with solid growth in Latin America/Canada. Looking by business, organic growth was positive across the entire consumer portfolio, paced by a mid-single-digit increase in our Home Improvement business. Within home improvement, our Command mounting products, ScotchBlue Painter's Tape and Filtrete filters, once again, posted strong organic growth. We continue to accelerate growth investments to enhance the value of these important brands.
Consumer-generated operating income of $317 million with margins of 26.2%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Positive organic growth, portfolio prioritization and ongoing productivity efforts drove the margin improvement. 
Please turn to Slide 15 for an update on our 2016 planning estimates. We now expect 2016 GAAP earnings in the range of $8.15 to $8.20 per share versus a prior range of $8.15 to $8.30. The narrowed range equates to approximately 8% EPS growth year-over-year. For full year, organic sales growth is now expected to be approximately flat at the low end of our previous range of flat to up 1%. Foreign currency translation is now anticipated to reduce sales by approximately 1% versus the prior range of down 1% to 2%.
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, will add 1% to full year sales growth. The full year tax rate is now expected to be approximately 29% versus a prior range of 29% to 29.5%. Lastly, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105% for the full year.
With that, we thank you for your attention, and we'll now take your questions."

So when you look upon it from a business perspective, if you tempered in United States, which we did, that would go all businesses, right? They are trying -- I think try to move some purchases forward maybe 1 to 2 quarter. That's what we're talking about the like mid-term or short-term tempering. So I will say all businesses, except one, which is oral care, had positive organic local currency growth. And oral care was flat. So still show growth, but it was tempered. And by definition, I'm not concerned at all relative to the future of that business. And we continue to invest for the future. We've done quite some investment, as you know, in the last couple of years, right? So there is no concern. It was just that it slowed down, and it was basically in the last months of the quarter."

From a business perspective, we do expect our Industrial and Electronics and Energy businesses to have improved growth rates in 2017 versus what we've been seeing in 2016. And then to -- part of your question on margins, Andy, we're still expecting price raw materials to be positive to earnings and to margins in 2017. Probably at a lower level of contribution to margin enhancement than what we've seen in 2016. And then business transformation, I expect that to have an increased positive impact on our earnings per share and margin in 2017. I think you've heard me say that we expected and we're realizing approximately $50 million of operating income benefit from business transformation as part of -- in 2016. And that's part of our journey moving to $500 million to $700 million of savings by 2020. And I'd expect 2017 to be a continued progression on that path. That said, we are, as you mentioned, we're going to have a couple of headwinds. Pension is likely to be a headwind for us. If I were to take current rates where they are, I'm estimating this will be about $150 million headwind for 3M in 2017. And FX will likely be a headwind for us, not so much based on movements in exchange rates, but the fact that we won't be repeating some of the hedging gains that we experienced in 2016. All in, those lower hedge gains will probably hurt our margins by about $100 million. So all in, Andy, that's the puts and takes of a preview of what I expect we'll be talking about in the 1.5 months."

And the reason for that is we have worked now for quite some time, not only in the Industrial, but in all business group in order to make sure that we get the portfolio that is relevant for us in order to serve our customers. We have seen, during the last couple of years, some heavy lifting going on in the portfolio work, not only in Electronic and Energy, but in Safety and Graphics and in Industrial as well. So when I look upon it, we are moving the company to spaces and places where we are more relevant and that we can also capitalize on technology conversion. Meaning, also driving better margin for us.

That will be a shift as you go relative to where you today can look upon. It's very much design-in assembly. So we have a range in a 5-year plan, as you know, of 0 to 4.

So we saw third quarter as another consistent quarter in that trend. In regards to the U.S, we are down slightly in price. That's really consistent with where we've been for the total year in the U.S. with prices more or less flat. And there's selected businesses at any given time where we're choosing to raise price. Somewhere we're choosing to lower price based on competition. And in the case of the U.S, there's been selected cases where we've adjusted our pricing in our strategies to gain market share."

So we will go as fast as we can, but we are not taking any risks relative to be able to serve our customers. I think that's the important element. We are here to deliver to you what you expect. But we're also here, of course, to deliver to our customers. So I think you have this balance always when you implement new initiatives that you will like to go fast. But you have to make sure that you really understand the implication with the customer. So I think that's the answer to your question that, I and the team here, we are pushing as hard as we can to come as fast as possible to the most effective model. But you have always to think about customer first when you make those changes. But by definition, what you think about what we do in West Europe now, in terms of our inventories and so forth, yes, of course, it will be less SKUs because you consolidate inventories at fewer places, et cetera. And that will roll out. And I'm sure that you have heard and I know you have, relative to our footprint initiatives that is in both terms of manufacturing sites and in terms of distribution centers. So the answer is we are going as fast as we can, but we are not jeopardizing our service level to the customers."

So -- but if you look upon it, for 10 years, we have been able to do that. With all initiatives that we are taking in the company relative to the portfolio, relative to improved commercialization processes, et cetera, we should be able to do slightly better than that as we move ahead. I don't make a distinction in between certain segment that some will outperform more than others. We should be able to outperform at least 1.5x, maybe 1.7x as we move ahead in every segment we compete in because that is the expectation. That's why we are there. If we don't do that, we are not relevant in that segment to our customers and then we have to do something different. So the other comment I would like to make is we cannot predict when a turnaround is coming in the economy. We cannot predict, I don't think anyone can. One thing I would like you to know, we are ready. We are ready. With everything we have done the last couple of years in terms of the portfolio, in terms of the structure, in terms of stepping up the investment in research and development from 5.5% closer to 6% and the supply chain model enabled by business transformation, that all start and end with a customers, we are ready.

If you take in electronics into it, which actually was down 11%, we were down 2 percentage for China. Now, if there is a clear improvement is what I will consider domestic-driven businesses. So if you take the 5 business groups first in China: SGBG grew 18%; Consumer, 12%; Health Care, 8%; and Industrial 2%; and then Electronics and Energy was down. But if you think about that, we had 4 or 5 business groups in China growing. And it was very much in consumer, health care, automotive aftermarket, automotive OEM and personal safety. So I think that what we have talked about for quite some time about -- so it's not really a shift. It's like, to grow out the domestic businesses. It's coming, but on the other hand, it's a little bit slower, I think and we think, versus the original plan. But if you think about the old business, if you take the electronic part, which is very much in Asia and in China, we had a 4% growth in China. You will like it to be 12%, but it's 4%. And it's the biggest subsidiary outside of United States for us. So I am slightly positive as we move ahead relative to China. Now that team is driving productivity big time, right? That's the model there today versus 5 years ago, it's different. Everything was about growth, right? We grew 15% to 20% year-over-year. We don't any longer. We grow 4%. So now productivity is a key element for us, and I think that's important. We have good margins, and we continue to expand margin there. So I hope that helps in terms of explaining China."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, our company delivered increased earnings, robust cash flow and a broad-based margin performance with each of our business groups posting margins greater than 22%",760,"Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, our company delivered increased earnings, robust cash flow and a broad-based margin performance with each of our business groups posting margins greater than 22%. At the same time, we continued to execute on business transformation, took actions to strengthen the portfolio and increased investment in future growth. The third quarter also marked our company's 100 straight year of paying dividends, which we increased for each of the last 58 years.
With respect to EPS, our team posted earnings of $2.15 per share, up 5% year-on-year. We delivered total sales of $7.7 billion, flat versus last year's third quarter. Organic growth was down 80 basis points while a combined impact from acquisitions and FX increased sales by similar amount. 
Looking closer at the organic growth, we once again delivered positive growth from 3 business groups: Consumer, Safety and Graphics and Health Care. Consumer paced our company's growth at 3% with positive growth in all businesses. Safety and Graphics grew 2% organically, led by roofing granules and commercial solutions. Organic growth in our Health Care business was 1.5%, which was tempered versus recent quarters due to some softness in the U.S. Health Care market. Industrials organic growth declined 1%, and we continue to anticipate growth in this business to turn positive in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, Electronics and Energy was down 8% in the quarter, in line with what we indicated during our last earnings call. Even in a challenging macro environment, the strings of our business model has enabled us to deliver premium returns and generate healthy cash flow.
Company-wide, we increased margins 40 basis points to nearly 25%, ranging from 32% in Health Care to just shy of 23% in Industrial. At the same time, we increased free cash flow by 19% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 117%. Our strong cash flow allow us to invest in the business while also returning cash to shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders to share repurchases and dividends. We also continued to build our enterprise for the future, and I will make some comments on our recent progress. 
Please move to Slide 5. You have heard me talk many times about the 3M playbook, which is the key enabler for our short and long-term success. The playbook includes 3 levers that are creating value for enterprise and that we continue to make good progress on. 2 of the levers, investing and innovation and portfolio management, are important to our long-term growth objectives. 
In addition to ongoing investment in research and development, we continue to prioritize our portfolio and make targeted investments to support organic growth. We also drive growth through acquisitions, which complement organic growth and enhance our technology capabilities as well as partnerships, which combine all strings with those of other organizations.
Most recently, we finalized an acquisition and established 1 partnership, both related to Health Care. You will recall that in February, we decided to retain and further invest in our health information system business. To bolster our technology capabilities in that area, in September, we acquired Semfinder, a medical coding company based in Switzerland. This acquisition helps us accelerate penetration in international markets, which is important as more countries move towards electronic medical records.
To further strengthen health information systems, earlier this month, we announced the collaboration with Verily, the life science business of the Alphabet company. This is a partnership between 2 highly creative and innovative companies that will leverage our expertise in Health Care coding with their expertise in data analytics and software. Ultimately, we will develop tools to help providers increase the quality and affordability of Health Care, which comes back to our company's vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life. 
Beyond growth investments, we are taking other recent action to prepare 3M for the future. 3 weeks ago, we finalized the sale of a noncore protective films business that will further enhance and focus our industrial portfolio. We're also making solid progress on our third lever, business transformation with 2 recent ERP rollouts in West Europe. As a reminder, we have now deployed ERP in 15 countries and in 4 of our largest European distribution centers.
In summary, I'm pleased with our team's performance in the quarter in terms of controlling what we can control while also building for the future. 
With that, I turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick?"

Our acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana, net of 3 small divestitures, added 0.3 percentage points to sales. And foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.5%. In U.S. dollar terms, worldwide sales were flat versus the third quarter of last year.
Looking at organic growth by geography. The United States declined 0.3% in Q3. Our Consumer and Safety and Graphics businesses generated positive organic growth, which offset declines in Industrial and Electronics and Energy. In Asia Pacific, organic growth was down 2.2%. Solid growth from our Consumer, Health Care and Safety and Graphics businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics and Energy.
Organic growth increased 1% in Japan and declined 2% in China/Hong Kong. Excluding electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 1%, and China/Hong Kong grew more than 4%. 
Let's now take a look at the EMEA region starting with West Europe. West Europe delivered 1% organic growth, led by Germany, Sweden and Spain. From a business perspective, growth was led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa declined year-on-year impacted by ongoing challenges in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. In total, organic growth across EMEA declined 1% in the quarter. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 1.2%. Mexico grew 5%. And Brazil rose 2%, while Canada declined 3%.
Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Third quarter sales were $7.7 billion, and we generated record third quarter earnings of $2.15 per share. GAAP operating margins were again strong at 24.7%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 100 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 90 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year's Q4 restructuring expanded margins by 40 basis points in Q3. 
Looking at headwinds. First-year acquisitions reduced margins 10 basis points. This includes the impact of Capital Safety and Membrana. We continue to accelerate strategic growth investments across the portfolio and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint, which reduced margins by 40 basis points. The impact of lower year-on-year foreign currency hedge gains decreased margins by 50 basis points. 
And finally, organic volume declines, along with related utilization impacts, reduced margins by 90 basis points. Most impacted were our Industrial and Electronics and Energy businesses.
Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a look at EPS. Earnings per share in the third quarter were $2.15, an increase of 4.9% versus the third quarter of 2015. Margin expansion, net of organic sales declines added $0.05 to earnings per share in Q3. Foreign currency impacts, net of lower year-on-year hedged gains, reduced pretax earnings by $20 million or the equivalent to $0.02 a share. The third quarter tax rate was 28.5% versus 29.6% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Favorable developments and international tax audits had a positive impact on the Q3 rate.
And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2% year-on-year, which added $0.04 to third quarter EPS. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. We generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, a $244 million increase year-over-year. Lower cash taxes drove the increase, offset in part by higher year-on-year pension contributions. Q3 CapEx investments were $347 million, in line with last year's third quarter. And we now expect full year CapEx in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion.
Third quarter free cash flow conversion was 117%, up 16 percentage points versus the same period last year. And for the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in a range of 95% to 105%. As a reminder, our fourth quarter conversion is typically the strongest of the year.
In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders in Q3, including $670 million in dividends, up $35 million year-on-year. We also returned $774 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases or $2.8 billion year-to-date. We now expect our full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion versus a prior range of $4 billion to $6 billion.
Let's now review each of our business groups starting on Slide 10. Our Industrial business posted sales of $2.6 billion in the third quarter with an organic growth decline of 1.1% year-on-year. Our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter, continuing its long track record of increasing market penetration and outpacing the rate of global car and light truck builds. 
We also posted positive organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business. Advanced materials declined double digits year-on-year, impacted by persistent weakness in the oil and gas market. 
Looking by geography, industrial's positive organic growth in Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in Latin America and the U.S. Third quarter organic growth in our U.S. Industrial business improved slightly versus the first half of 2016. And we expect to see further improvement in Q4. 
The Membrana acquisition, net of 1 small divestiture, added 1.4% to industrial sales growth in the quarter. Membrana continues to exceed our sales and profit expectations. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $591 million in Q3 and margins were up 30 basis points to 22.9%. 
Please turn to Slide 11. Third quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion with organic growth of 2%. Q3 organic growth was led by our roofing granules and commercial solutions businesses. Roofing granules posted another strong double-digit increase in the third quarter. Demand in this market has been strong throughout 2016. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was led by Latin America/Canada, which increased mid-single digits, followed by positive growth in Asia Pacific and the U.S. Operating income was $364 million and operating margins were once again strong at 25.1%, up 220 basis points year-over-year.
Q3 margin expansion was boosted by lower year-over-year acquisition costs related to Capital Safety and solid productivity efforts across the portfolio. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter. Organic growth was up 1.5% led by a double-digit increase in food safety, along with positive contributions from drug delivery systems, critical and chronic care and health information systems. Organic growth in oral care solutions was flat, which was impacted by soft market conditions in the U.S. On a geographic basis, Health Care delivered mid-single-digit growth in Asia Pacific. Latin America/Canada and EMEA both posted low single-digit growth, while the U.S. was flat.
Organic growth was up low single digits in developing countries, a bit softer than recent quarters. Health Care organic growth in Q3 was below recent trends, and we expect soft market conditions to persist in the near term. Health Care's operating income was $429 million and margins remained strong at 31.5%. Importantly, we generated these returns while continuing to increase growth investments across the business. 
Next, I'll cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13.  Third quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.3 billion, down 8.1% organically. Organic sales declined 8% in our electronics-related businesses. Market challenges persisted across most consumer electronics applications, which impacted volume growth. Channel inventory levels have improved versus earlier in the year, but further adjustments occurred in Q3. Our team continues to focus on driving spec-in wins and increasing customer relevance across all consumer electronics OEMs.
Our energy-related businesses declined 9% organically. Electrical Markets declined high single digits, and renewable energy was down double digits. As a reminder, we exited our renewable energy back sheet business last December, which reduced energy-related organic growth by nearly 300 basis points in the third quarter. Our third quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $312 million. And even in a challenging growth environment, our team delivered healthy margins of 24.2%. 
Please turn to Slide 14, where I will cover our Consumer business. Consumer had another strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and organic growth of 2.9%, which led the company. Geographically, consumers' organic growth was led by Asia Pacific and the U.S., both up mid-single digits, along with solid growth in Latin America/Canada. Looking by business, organic growth was positive across the entire consumer portfolio, paced by a mid-single-digit increase in our Home Improvement business. Within home improvement, our Command mounting products, ScotchBlue Painter's Tape and Filtrete filters, once again, posted strong organic growth. We continue to accelerate growth investments to enhance the value of these important brands.
Consumer-generated operating income of $317 million with margins of 26.2%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Positive organic growth, portfolio prioritization and ongoing productivity efforts drove the margin improvement. 
Please turn to Slide 15 for an update on our 2016 planning estimates. We now expect 2016 GAAP earnings in the range of $8.15 to $8.20 per share versus a prior range of $8.15 to $8.30. The narrowed range equates to approximately 8% EPS growth year-over-year. For full year, organic sales growth is now expected to be approximately flat at the low end of our previous range of flat to up 1%. Foreign currency translation is now anticipated to reduce sales by approximately 1% versus the prior range of down 1% to 2%.
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, will add 1% to full year sales growth. The full year tax rate is now expected to be approximately 29% versus a prior range of 29% to 29.5%. Lastly, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105% for the full year.
With that, we thank you for your attention, and we'll now take your questions."

And then as you know, things are going on in Central/East Europe, specifically in Turkey, the template, generally speaking. So when you look upon it from a business perspective, if you tempered in United States, which we did, that would go all businesses, right? They are trying -- I think try to move some purchases forward maybe 1 to 2 quarter. That's what we're talking about the like mid-term or short-term tempering. So I will say all businesses, except one, which is oral care, had positive organic local currency growth. And oral care was flat. So still show growth, but it was tempered. And by definition, I'm not concerned at all relative to the future of that business. And we continue to invest for the future. We've done quite some investment, as you know, in the last couple of years, right? So there is no concern. It was just that it slowed down, and it was basically in the last months of the quarter."

That's the overall external picture we're anticipating. From a business perspective, we do expect our Industrial and Electronics and Energy businesses to have improved growth rates in 2017 versus what we've been seeing in 2016. And then to -- part of your question on margins, Andy, we're still expecting price raw materials to be positive to earnings and to margins in 2017. Probably at a lower level of contribution to margin enhancement than what we've seen in 2016. And then business transformation, I expect that to have an increased positive impact on our earnings per share and margin in 2017. I think you've heard me say that we expected and we're realizing approximately $50 million of operating income benefit from business transformation as part of -- in 2016. And that's part of our journey moving to $500 million to $700 million of savings by 2020. And I'd expect 2017 to be a continued progression on that path. That said, we are, as you mentioned, we're going to have a couple of headwinds. Pension is likely to be a headwind for us. If I were to take current rates where they are, I'm estimating this will be about $150 million headwind for 3M in 2017. And FX will likely be a headwind for us, not so much based on movements in exchange rates, but the fact that we won't be repeating some of the hedging gains that we experienced in 2016. All in, those lower hedge gains will probably hurt our margins by about $100 million. So all in, Andy, that's the puts and takes of a preview of what I expect we'll be talking about in the 1.5 months."

And the reason for that is we have worked now for quite some time, not only in the Industrial, but in all business group in order to make sure that we get the portfolio that is relevant for us in order to serve our customers. We have seen, during the last couple of years, some heavy lifting going on in the portfolio work, not only in Electronic and Energy, but in Safety and Graphics and in Industrial as well. So when I look upon it, we are moving the company to spaces and places where we are more relevant and that we can also capitalize on technology conversion. Meaning, also driving better margin for us.

Going forward, as we have shift the portfolio there as well, we will, as we go, start to see some positive evolution relative to growth rate because we are moving to segments that are growing faster and where we are more relevant. So if you look upon it, it will be around automotive, electrification, data centers, sustainability, chemistry and grade automation. That will be a shift as you go relative to where you today can look upon. It's very much design-in assembly. So we have a range in a 5-year plan, as you know, of 0 to 4.

And I think we have just to wait out for the geopolitical situation to be settled before we start to see some big growth coming back there. Impact on West Europe, we had a very good quarter, last quarter in West Europe. I'm pleased with the quarter this quarter as well. Slightly slower growth, but still Germany had 3% both in the quarter coming on a quarter last quarter that was 6%. So you add them together because a quarter or a year doesn't start and end with a date, right? So you look upon that. You take the biggest economy in West Europe, Germany, 6% or 3%. Let's say, they are going now around 4% and the business transformation is helping them. So I think the biggest concern, generally speaking, will then be Central, East Europe and Middle East/Africa in terms of growth rate at this point in time. I visited, and Nick as well, Europe just a couple of weeks ago. And there's good momentum in the market. They are very much driven by automotive, by the way. So if automotive is doing well, we are doing well as well. So what you saw this time, good growth in Sweden, good growth in Spain; Germany, 3%, its better growth than United States."

So -- and as you can see now, the margin in that business, EEBG as a business group, is on a very respectable level. So I will not be concerned of the -- on the cost side of the assets. On the technology transition, as I've said before, always when there is a technology transition, you can, short term, lose a little bit and then come back. I think it's important to know both in LED and OLED, we are providing solutions to those devices also that has OLED. It's slightly less than versus LED, but we are still in that business, and it's expanding in a way. I will say going into next year, I will look upon it maybe similar to 2016 as we roll into the year. But we have worked on that for a long time. This is not a surprise for us. So that means that technology is used in the pipeline. And as I said, technology transition is always giving you either short-term uptick immediately or you have to have a little bit of drag. But it will not be very, very long."

I think we are in a situation now where we can work a model of do it when we can versus when we must. And I think that's an important differentiation to think about it. And everything we are doing now with the type of centralization, if you like, even if it's on a regional base, will help us a lot. And we are, yes, marching forward on that. Marching forward in order to make sure that we build an organization for the future for 3M that both can grow and is becoming even more effective relative to operational excellence in the company. So we will go as fast as we can, but we are not taking any risks relative to be able to serve our customers. I think that's the important element. We are here to deliver to you what you expect. But we're also here, of course, to deliver to our customers. So I think you have this balance always when you implement new initiatives that you will like to go fast. But you have to make sure that you really understand the implication with the customer. So I think that's the answer to your question that, I and the team here, we are pushing as hard as we can to come as fast as possible to the most effective model. But you have always to think about customer first when you make those changes. But by definition, what you think about what we do in West Europe now, in terms of our inventories and so forth, yes, of course, it will be less SKUs because you consolidate inventories at fewer places, et cetera. And that will roll out. And I'm sure that you have heard and I know you have, relative to our footprint initiatives that is in both terms of manufacturing sites and in terms of distribution centers. So the answer is we are going as fast as we can, but we are not jeopardizing our service level to the customers."

With all initiatives that we are taking in the company relative to the portfolio, relative to improved commercialization processes, et cetera, we should be able to do slightly better than that as we move ahead. I don't make a distinction in between certain segment that some will outperform more than others. We should be able to outperform at least 1.5x, maybe 1.7x as we move ahead in every segment we compete in because that is the expectation. That's why we are there. If we don't do that, we are not relevant in that segment to our customers and then we have to do something different. So the other comment I would like to make is we cannot predict when a turnaround is coming in the economy. We cannot predict, I don't think anyone can. One thing I would like you to know, we are ready. We are ready. With everything we have done the last couple of years in terms of the portfolio, in terms of the structure, in terms of stepping up the investment in research and development from 5.5% closer to 6% and the supply chain model enabled by business transformation, that all start and end with a customers, we are ready.

If you take in electronics into it, which actually was down 11%, we were down 2 percentage for China. Now, if there is a clear improvement is what I will consider domestic-driven businesses. So if you take the 5 business groups first in China: SGBG grew 18%; Consumer, 12%; Health Care, 8%; and Industrial 2%; and then Electronics and Energy was down. But if you think about that, we had 4 or 5 business groups in China growing. And it was very much in consumer, health care, automotive aftermarket, automotive OEM and personal safety. So I think that what we have talked about for quite some time about -- so it's not really a shift. It's like, to grow out the domestic businesses. It's coming, but on the other hand, it's a little bit slower, I think and we think, versus the original plan. But if you think about the old business, if you take the electronic part, which is very much in Asia and in China, we had a 4% growth in China. You will like it to be 12%, but it's 4%. And it's the biggest subsidiary outside of United States for us. So I am slightly positive as we move ahead relative to China. Now that team is driving productivity big time, right? That's the model there today versus 5 years ago, it's different. Everything was about growth, right? We grew 15% to 20% year-over-year. We don't any longer. We grow 4%. So now productivity is a key element for us, and I think that's important. We have good margins, and we continue to expand margin there. So I hope that helps in terms of explaining China."
