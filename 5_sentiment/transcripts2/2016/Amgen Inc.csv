It was another year of consistent and reliable performance as we delivered patients and s",819,"Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and let me add my welcome to those of you who are joining our call.
Let me start off by saying that 2015 was an exceptional year for Amgen. It was another year of consistent and reliable performance as we delivered patients and shareholders. But I think you can see that first in our financial results. 8% revenue growth in 2015 reflects the strength and breadth of our products and our 19% adjusted earnings growth reflects the operating leverage we've created through our successful and ongoing transformation efforts.
The momentum of our products can be seen in the 17% growth we recorded from our in-line brands including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate. Together, these brands generated $11 billion for us.
Our legacy medicines also performed well and these continue to be strong cash flow generators for us and we remain positioned to compete as new players enter the market.
While delivering these solid results for the year, we also made important groundwork for our future growth with 4 innovative launches in oncology and 2 in cardiovascular disease over the past 12 months. As we've said before, we expect to Propafa [ph] and Propolos [ph] to be significant opportunities for us and see these as great examples of innovative medicines that address big unmet needs on providing significant clinical benefits and demonstrable value propositions for patients and providers. The importance of having value proposition such as these is only set to grow through the innovative biopharmaceutical industry and we're well-positioned to embrace that reality in our pipeline.
Developing innovative medicines to address serious illnesses is at the core of what we do. Behind our 6 new product launches,  are a number of additional exciting innovative pipeline opportunities, notably on the Sozomab [ph] on bone and health and AMG 334 which is directed in migraine in the neuroscience area. Also notice our oncology product, etelcalcetide, which is under regulatory review and Omecamtiv mecarbil, which is an intriguing opportunity for us in cardiovascular disease.
In addition to our own pipeline of molecules, we expect to remain active in business development. When it comes to later stage opportunities, we would expect this to revolve around our 6 core areas which are hematology oncology, cardiovascular inflammation, bone health, nephrology and science. Focus will remain important to us and you'll see that reflected in our decision this week to help license our respiratory molecule, AMG 282. While we're intrigued by the genetics behind this target and the potential for the molecule in Asthma and COPD, we feel the commercialization of it can be better optimized by Genentech, given their established presence in this field.
We continue to expand our global geographic reach, now with full ownership of our products in new markets and the very exciting approval of Repatha in Japan with our partner Astellas, which represents our first product approval for this Japanese partnership. Our biosimilars program is also making tangible progress, with 1 under regulatory review, 1 having completed Phase III and another 4, which Phase III results are expected later this year. 
We're making significant progress with our transformation efforts here at Amgen. We've already reduced gross costs by $700 million, enabling our 2015 adjusted operating margin to grow by some full points. We'll make further progress in 2016, and we're expecting another $400 million of gross savings as we expect to reduce adjusted operating expenses year-over-year.
Our transformation has also made us more agile and you see the benefits that in our competitive performance across our products. 
In manufacturing, our teams are significant contributors to our transformation efforts, driving down our cost of sales and making final preparations for the licensure of our next-generation manufacturing facility in Singapore. Improved drug delivery systems are an important differentiator of our medicines and we're delivering solid results with them. The Neulasta Onpro Kit has been extreme successful in the marketplace and we filed our Repatha [ph] 1x monthly dozing option globally. We'll continue to innovate the patient and provide our friendly systems to help differentiate our products.
We also remain focus on smart capital allocation, through a combination of share buybacks, dividend and value creating business development activities that are aligned with our overall strategy we expect to drive shareholder value. We established a set of targeted financial commitments through 2018. these metrics are chosen in part to provide evidence that we are making clear progress on our strategy  through a period of patent exploration and new patent launches. I'm pleased to report that as we closed 2015, we've made significant progress towards accomplishing these longer-term metrics.
Finally, as we enter 2016, our position is strong, our strategy is clear and we're excited about the year ahead. I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to deliver for patients and for our shareholders. 
David, over to you."

Turning to the fourth quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues of $5.5 billion grew 4% year-over-year were the 3% increase in product sales. Other revenues at $207 million increased $50 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting an increased in royalty income and a milestone payment recognized in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income at $2.4 billion grew 16% from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 5 percentage points to 44% for the quarter, reflecting the continued benefits of our transformation program. On an adjusted basis, total operating expenses decreased 4% year-over-year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 2 percentage points.
Cost of sales margin at 14.3% improved by 1.6 percentage points, driven by lower manufacturing costs, higher net selling price and lower royalties
Research and development expenses at $1.1 billion were down 10% year-over-year, reflecting the Q4 2014 upfront payment to Kite [ph] Pharma, of $60 million for our cancer immunotherapy collaboration, as well as the benefit of R&D expense savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
SG&A expenses were up 3% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting incremental expenses in Q4 for new product launches, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Other income and expenses improved by $53 million year-over-year to a net expense of $120 million in the quarter, primarily due to cash investment portfolio activities as well as higher interest income due to higher cash balances this year.
The tax rate was 11.6% for the quarter, a 1.4 percentage point increase versus Q4 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to a decreased benefit from the R&D tax credit in 2015 versus 2014 due to higher pretax income and reduced R&D expenses.
As a result, adjusted net income increased 19% and adjusted earnings per share increased 21%.
You will find a summary of our full year 2015 results on Page 6 of the presentation. Our 2015 full-year revenues grew 8% to $21.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $10.38 per share. For the full year, adjusted operating income grew to $10.1 billion, a 19% increase based on the combination of solid revenue growth along with flat operating expenses.
Operating margin improved by 4 percentage points to 48%.  On an adjusted basis, cost of sales margin improved by 1.3 percentage points year-over-year for 14.5%, driven by lower royalties, higher unit selling price and lower manufacturing costs.
Research and development expenses decreased 5%, driven by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. And SG&A expenses were up 6%, primarily due to increased commercial expenses for new product launches, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Other income and expenses improved by $114 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher interest income due to higher cash balances, partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher debt balances.
The tax rate was 16.8% for the full year, up 1.9 percentage points versus 2014. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. For the full year 2015, we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow versus $7.8 billion last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales and profitability. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, total cash and investments increased to $31.4 billion. This balance included over $2 billion in the U.S. and $29 billion outside the U.S.
Total debt outstanding increased slightly to $31.6 billion. As a result, net debt decreased by $3.5 billion to $200 million at year-end 2015. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and an average maturity of 10 years.
Additionally, for 2015, we increased our dividend per share by 30% to $0.79 per quarter, with payments totaling $2.4 billion. We also announced a 27% increase to the dividend to $1 per share for our first quarter 2016 payment.
Finally, at our 2014 business review, we indicated the intent to repurchase shares totaling up to $2 billion by the end of 2015, which we have now accomplished, with repurchases of approximately 13 million shares since Q4 of 2014.
At the end of 2015, we had approximately $4.9 billion remaining under our board authorized share repurchase program. We intend to repurchase an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of shares in 2016 and are on track to deliver our capital allocation commitments to shareholders.
I will now turn to guidance for 2016, summarized on Page 8. As you will recall, we provided preliminary 2016 guidance on our October earnings call. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects an improved revenue outlook due to the revised timing of new biosimilar competition, as well as the inclusion of the R&D tax credit which has been permanently extended.
With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is $22 billion to $22.5 billion versus prior guidance of $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion, and our adjusted earnings per share guidance was $10.60 to $11 per share. In addition, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to improve by 1 percentage point versus prior guidance to 19.5% to 20.5%. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.
As a result of our strong progress in 2015 and the 2016 outlook, we remain confident we will meet or exceed commitments provided for the 2014 to '18 period, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth, adjusted operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%, $1.5 billion to transformation savings with a net $800 million reduction in operating expense and return to shareholders of at least 60% of adjusted net income during the period.
We also previously guided for total restructuring expense related to the transformation program of $935 million to $1.35 billion during the periods through 2018. Based on better than anticipated results from the exit of 2 of our closed facilities, we now expect to incur a total of $800 million to $900 million in restructuring expense through 2018 with nearly $700 million recognized already in 2014 and '15.
In summary, we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2015 and we are increasingly confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2016 and beyond.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

Globally, product sales grew 3% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, and 8% for the full year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-year growth in the quarter and 12% for the full year.
The fourth quarter included the negative $100 million impact related to the large Quarter 3 end customer purchases that I described in our last earnings call. Foreign exchange negatively impacted year-over-year sales by 2 percentage points in both the fourth quarter and the full year.
Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, our international business was up 5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, and up 6% for the full year.
By any measure, 2015 was a success from an operating execution standpoint. Our growth products led the way with a continued meaningful growth. We also lay the foundation for future success with our new product launches as well as further expansion to new countries, while conforming our customer facing model and delivering significant cost savings, which we reinvested in the launches.
Let me now start the with an update on our new cardiovascular franchise where we had 2 launches in 2015. Repatha of course, being the biggest opportunity. Repatha is off to a strong competitive start. In the U.S., Repatha relative share of this segment is reflected in my mind of our launch preparations and execution in the field. Brand recognition amongst cardiologists and primary care physicians is strong. And Repatha single-dose delivering intensive and predictable LDLC loth [ph] reductions is resonating well with prescribers.
We've made good progress with our pay and negotiations. More than 80% of commercial lines currently have access to Repatha. This strict pay utilization management criteria are limiting the uptick, as you see in the IMS scripts. We continue to work with payers on evaluating the utilization management criteria to ensure that appropriate patients are able to receive Repatha through these plans.
In Europe, reimbursement negotiations are ongoing and we expect to add reimbursement in many countries over the course of the year. I'm pleased to report that earlier this month we secured national reimbursement in Spain well ahead of expectations. In Japan, Repatha was approved last week, along with our partner Astellas, we are looking forward to launching the product in the next few months after securing reimbursement.
Sean will discuss our current imaging and cardiovascular outcome study shortly, and we look forward to data from these 2 trials strengthening Repatha's profile.
Also in cardiovascular disease, our innovative heart failure medicine, Coronal [ph], is making steady progress with prescribers after its launch early in 2015.
Let me now move to oncology, starting with our other large new opportunity, Kyprolis. Kyprolis grew 63% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. As our orders indicate that we have more than doubled KRD patient share in new to treatment second line patients since our label expansions, based on the ASPIRE data. We're very excited too about the recent FDA approval to add ENDEAVOR data to our U.S. label, demonstrating that the Kyprolis has doubled progression free survival versus uptake. Our teams are trained and in the marketplace as they are to the ENDEAVOR approval.
With both the ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data now in our U.S. label, we have strengthened Kyprolis profile as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. Kyprolis is now the only approved therapy for repressed multiple myeloma with proven efficacy as a single agent, doublet or triplet combination, with different doses to meet individual patient needs. So we'll continue to grow as we treat more second line patients and they'll stay on therapy longer, driven by the deep, doable responses to Kyprolis.
In Europe, Kyprolis was approved in November for second line therapy based on the ASPIRE data. We are launching across Europe on the country by country basis as reimbursement is secured. Even though we reimbursed in Germany and the launch there is underway.
Continuing now with oncology, XGEVA grew 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and delivered $1.4 billion in sales for the year, driven by unit share gains in both U.S. and Europe. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by some large presences in the third quarter. We continue to focus on XGEVA superior clinical profile versus the competition.
Vectibix grew 2% year-over-year but has a 10% unit growth. With over 60% of Vectibix sales outside the U.S., foreign-exchange negatively impacted Vectibix growth by about 7 percentage points. Nplate continued solid growth of about 15% year-over-year driven by 17% unit growth.
Turning now to the [indiscernible] franchise. The launch of the Neulasta on probe kit continued its strong momentum in achieving 24% share of all Neulasta sales in the fourth quarter. This innovative delivery system is applied during a patient's chemotherapy visit so they can avoid returning to the doctor next day as this is the normal requirement from Neulasta injections. This will also be an important differentiator versus future long acting prograstin [ph] by similar competition.  Quarter-over-quarter, Neulasta was negatively impacted by the burn off, of some larger U.S. customer purchases in the third quarter that we described in our last call.  We expect Neulasta to grow modestly in 2016, as we don't expect a biosimilar launch in the U.S. at the end of the year at the earliest.
IMLYGIC declined 4% year-over-year. Sequentially, if it lost 3 points of market share in the U.S. split between the biosimilar and the branded competitors, but still retains 76% in share. Share loss of the last year resulted in a 11% unit decline in the U.S. But the U.S. sales also benefited from a revision to accounting estimates in Quarter 4.
As I said previously, we will compete, account by account, using our many years of experience competing in biosimilars in Europe and branded competitors globally, but do expect some share loss.
Relaunch to other medicines in oncology, BLINCYTO which continues to make inroads in pay off patients and IMLYGIC, which we are pleased with the initial response from key institutions with mixed indication, as well as future potential in combination with other immunotherapies.
Let me now turn to information with Enbrel. On Slide number 19, you'll see Enbrel grew 8% year-over-year driven by net selling price. You'll recall net selling price includes the impact from list price changes as well as contracting and access change that occurred over the past 12 months. Year-over-year, second [ph] growth remained strong, as rheumatology grew 27% and dermatology grew 46% on the value basis.
Quarter-on-quarter, our rheumatology value share was stable at 28%, while our share in dermatology declined 2 percentage points to 22% due to intensive line competition from new therapies.
I'll remind you that dermatology accounts for about 80% of Enbrel sales.
Given Enbrel's exclusivity through 2029, we continue to invest in the brand as the outlook for further growth remains strong.
I'll now move to bone health and Prolia. Prolia grew 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, with about 20% unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe delivering $1.3 billion of sales for the year. Growth is driven by continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe and expect this momentum to continue in 2016.
With our recent agreement with GSK, we look forward to transitioning Prolia, as well as XGEVA and Vectibix back under Amgen's control in 48 countries and continuing to drive growth. This is another important step in delivering our international expansion strategy.
We're also looking forward to a potential important addition to our bone health franchise, with romosozumab, which is now in its Phase III data and Sean will be discussing them in a moment.
Turning now to our nephrology franchise starting with EPOGEN. EPOGEN declined 37% year-over-year driven by a shift in ESA use. This decline has 3 primary components: First, around 30% of the declines is due to a shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting. We continue to see uptick of Aranesp with medium-size and independent dialysis centers. Second, roughly 20% either resulted the burn off from the large customer purchase in Quarter 3 as we discussed in our last call. The remaining 50% of the decline comes from the shift from placera [ph] at percenias [ph]. Percenias represents about 1/3 of the U.S. dialysis business. In October , they disclosed that just over half of the dialysis patients utilizing ESA has switched to Mecera[ph] . EPOGEN sales in 2016 are likely to be impacted by further share declines in Percenias and a potential for business switching to Aranesp.
Just a reminder, we have a very good business partnership with Aveda and our agreement will then extend to 2018, to purchase at least 90% of the ESAs from Amgen.
Aranesp sales increased 4% year-over-year with a 25% unit growth in the U.S., driven by the continued shift in dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp. International sales were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates.
Sensipar grew 21% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and delivered $1.4 billion of sales for the year, driven by net selling price and unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe, with good growth prospects for 2016.
Our oncology franchise had another exciting opportunity with across the bulk of the new plate name for evolocumab our intravenous cousin the medic currently and the regulator you review in both the U.S. and Europe. 
I'd like to close by outlining our expectations for 2016. We do not expect Neulasta or EPOGEN biosimilars in the U.S. until the end of 2016 at the earliest. Assuming potential competitors provide us 180 days [indiscernible] between approval and launch.
EPOGEN is likely to face continued competition at Percenias and a conversion to Aranesp. NEUPOGEN continues to face headwinds with new competition, while we expect Neulasta sales to continue to grow given the assumed a delay of the U.S. biosimilar competition. We expect Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate will all see continued growth in 2016, and our recently launched products, notably Repatha and Kyprolis, will contribute meaningful growth in 2016.
Kyprolis has improved label in the U.S., coupled with our launches around the world, will continue to drive solid growth. Repatha growth is expected to be steady in the near term with breakaway potential once we have the outcomes study our label.
The sure has been a busy and very exciting time for our teams across the world, and I'd like to thank them for their hard work and dedication to delivering to patients. Let me now slide off to Sean."

And 2016 promises to be another very busy year. We've already announced 2 regulatory approvals and a lot more are in the events to come.
Beginning with our cardiovascular franchise. Lastly, and that was approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia our patients have risk of high risk of cardiovascular events were not pathically responding to statins. This is the first approval of the PCSK9 inhibitor in Japan and the very first approval of our -- by our joint venture of Amgen and Astellas Biopharma. I'm also very happy to report that our outcome study remains on track as we continue to expect the data in the second half of this year, along with the results of our coronary imaging study for conducting with treatment of the clinic. We believe that demonstrating the reduction for Repatha will resonate with cardiologists and complement outcomes data.
We've also been reviewing in detail along with our partners in Cytokinetics [ph] and Serbier [ph] the Phase II data from Omaha, Kansas [indiscernible], our novel activator for heart failure but we've been extremely encouraged by the feedback we received from our discussions with experts in the field as we prepare with the regulators to discuss a potential path forward.
Turning to oncology, last week in the U.S., we also received a new indication for Kyprolis, in combination with dexamethasone in the relapse multiple myeloma setting. This was based on the ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated a clear superiority over Belcade [ph] as Kyprolis doubled the amount of progression free survival. This FDA division -- decision also converted the initial accelerated approval to full approval and that is important thus flexibility. The Kyprolis ENDEAVOR data are currently under review in the EU.
Subsequent analysis of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR were presented at the American Society of Hematology Meeting last month and the response from physicians reinforced our view that Kyprolis will be a backbone on multiple myeloma therapy, as physicians pursue deeper, more durable responses for their patients in search of cure. In support of this, we're exploring the use of Kyprolis in combination with newer therapies for multiple myeloma and announced an initial agreement made last year, in which we are providing Johnson [ph] for combination study with [indiscernible] evolocumab [ph] 
In the fourth quarter, we also received 3 marketing authorizations in Europe, including Kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone [ph] for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data, IMLYGIC was approved for the treatment of adults with under receptible melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic with no bone, brain, long or other visceral disease and BLINCYTO was approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome negative relapsed to refractory B cell precursor [indiscernible] leukemia. 
We recently conducted an analysis of the events occurring in our large ongoing Phase III trial of XGEVA in the setting of skeletal related events prevention in multiple myeloma patients. And with the usual caveat, that this is an event driven trial, we currently estimate we'll see the data towards the end of this year. 
We also continued to expand our immuno oncology platform and announced new collaborations with Merk,[ph], combining their PD on inhibitor with BLINCYTO in the setting of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and AMG 820, our anticolony stimulating factor 1 receptor antibody in advanced solid tumors. 
Finally, in oncology, our Phase I study of AMG 330 our anti CD 33 [ph] [indiscernible] continues to enroll acute myeloid leukemia patients. In the area of bone health, we all of the partners at UCB are awaiting the results from our registrational Phase III study for [indiscernible] romosozumab for [indiscernible] osteoporosis. We expect to be stated this quarter. 
In this study, we are assessing the romosozumab dose monthly for 12 months, compared to placebo dose for 12 months after which both cohorts retrieve [indiscernible] for 12 months. The co- primary end points of the incidence of cerebral fracture at 12 and 24 months, an important secondary endpoint include chronical and non-[indiscernible]. 
We're also conducting a Phase III study of similar design comparing romosozumab to [indiscernible] followed by both cohorts [indiscernible]. We expect romosozumab to be used in high risk osteoporosis patients and with a total of 12 monthly doses, we believe the most effective way to ensure proper dosing and maximum benefit in this patient population which initially is for administration by a healthcare provider. We'll continue to evaluate the development of potential indications, formulations and delivery options that could be a factor for certain patient populations. In fact we will be seeing data from our Phase III study assessing the improvement in bone mineral density in men with osteoporosis in the first half of this year.
While osteoporosis and osteoporosis related fractures are more commonly associated with post-menopausal women, as many as 1 in 4 men over the age of 50 will suffer a fertility fracture in their remaining lifetimes. 
Before I leave our bone franchise, I'd point out that he will also be receiving data from our Phase III Prolia study in induced [indiscernible] osteoporosis. Millions of patients [indiscernible] therapy around the world, which can result in a significant bone loss and fracture.
In neuroscience our Phase III study in episodic migraine with our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334 continues to enroll extremely well across 2 studies, a testament to the unmet need and desire by patients for an effective prophylactic therapy. In the chronic migraine setting, our Phase IIb study is expected to read out in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, the Phase I study of our antipath 1 antibody for migraine, AMG 301, is currently enrolling patients.

Neulasta requires them to come back on a Saturday morning to get that last injection so sometimes what is happening is patients are getting an injection too early which is actually not good.

That confidence is high I think that the genetic validation that exists for the pathway is very convincing to people in the field. Also, we saw -- this is one of the few areas where the preclinical models, particularly those performed even in primates are really quite predictive of what DOC in humans and then in nonhuman primate we are able to do biomechanical testing of course after animals are sacrificed. And so we know that the achieved extremely high-strength in these animals comments are it to the DND increases. And finally, we've done very advanced imaging a few months to an increase with Romo says on them and come paired head-to-head with what we see with curtail. And as you probably know, Fortail [ph] has its major impact on travecular [ph] bone and has a relatively limited impact on cortical bone. And the cortical bone really is what matters for the majority of long bone fracture risks, which is really where the clinical need is. And so we have multiple reasons to believe that genetics, the preclinical information and the imaging that you got done in humans that we should have not be a greater DND increase but the quality of bone that we're producing is of the higher quality than when they're using PTH analogues. One way I'm thinking about this is there really are 2 master regulatory switches for controlling DND. One of them is rank line in [ph] , which controls osteoblast [ph] function that we direct to [indiscernible] , and the other areas which controls osteoblast function [indiscernible] is the key mediator. So what we're doing here, like with romosozumab, is throwing a master, direct physiologic regulatory switch, so what you're expecting to get and what we see in everything that we've observed is physiologic, high-quality bone formation."

What you have to look at inside that data is how many prescription is get to the pharmacy and how many will reject it versus how many are abandoned. So we are seeing the majority of prescription of getting to the pharmacy at the moment of being rejected, rejected because the prior authorization process have not been properly completed or all of this outstanding information and patients need to go back and get some data. All patients are seeing the co-pay at this particular study because the products are not quite formally yet and the subscription and they walk away. So the data you're seeing is really important, but you have to understand that matured effort prescriptions good to the pharmacy are either be in rejected while the plants come to their process which is why we spent so much time with the plan model showing them the number of eligible patients through on unlabeled getting to pharmacy and not getting product.

And then as we show the payers, the impact of 2 draconian utilization management criteria, not getting to the right patients, we will see to change the Pittsburgh and the outcomes will of course dramatically change a value of this particular drug and we do expect to see some changes in these utilization criteria once we have that."

Second question is Pfizer's made a decision to enroll primary prevention patients I believe into their Phase III PCSK9 outcomes there, Sean?

Maybe after Sean question and for Tony, what commercial implications is any -- is this going to have in your mind. And third, just a follow up on someone else's question, just to be more direct, I think what's going on in the street right now is people are concerned that the Romo fracture reduction magnitude may look optically less than what is contained for example in the Fortail label or some of the data that Radius [ph] has produced for the PGH analogue, primarily because at 2 years you're comparing obviously your [indiscernible] versus these other patients which were compared to placebo, I believe. So the question is should we be expecting, Sean -- can you just talk about this as an apples to apples comparison or apples to oranges when we actually see that number?"

They're froth with difficulty, always. These [indiscernible] comparisons. But we announced the press because the trials are very large and have very similar design. In general, people have felt very comfortable doing that and we're seeing that for example when we have our 3-year fracture data for Prolia, people compared it to a 3-year factory data with this [indiscernible] or IV, et cetera. And anything in this case, it's going to be much more difficult to make those kind of simple comparisons. I think what will happen here is the data will be interpreted by the experts in the field. And as always, as the case with the specialty products like this, it charges a very specific patient population, the experts in the field will make the determination whether they think the data are impressive and who will be getting the product and that will influence prescribing outside the expert. With respect to the primary versus the secondary prevention strategies, I think that the companies that were in the lead on PCSK9 wants it to get outcomes data for these products as fast as was possible. And the fastest way to get the outcomes data is to study our patient population that has a fairly high event rate, and that generally is achieved one of the main leverage you can pull is to have patients who have suffered with the prior events, that sort of the strongest indicators of the subsequent event. As you know, the weather has been slightly different, save for some enacted and pursued by us and by Regeneron [ph] but that's been the basic approach. Moreover, it's never been necessary in this field to do outcomes trials in various different populations in order to have a label that covers through our patient populations. So what we really need to do is demonstrate convincingly that the LDL reductions that you're achieving with your agents translate on the perfectly reductions in cardiovascular outcome risks. That's what we need to do. And we feel that these studies will do that. Obviously, a company coming behind, it has to think about what it had to do to try to differentiate."

Could it deviate from the line? Sure, it's always possible that some of the foibles of the way that the clinical trials are designed and conducted, there is of course for example a treatment lag of some sort that occurs when you start therapies. And so in this study, Repatha quickly instead of over a longer period of time that et cetera that will come off the line slightly in one direction. They also know that the agent does have activities that statins don't have. For example, there is an effect on LPa which is present in some individuals and seems to be a strong prognostic factor that could make the dots come off the line a bit in the other direction. So there is some very variability that you could expect, but from a scientific perspective, based on the human genetics and everything we know, one would expect that you're going to see a reduction that would be proportional and similar. And that would be roughly just ballpark around at 1/3 level reduction of the risks. So that's the kind of number that many people keep in mind. I think that 50% reduction in the risks, it was suggested by the analyses that were published in [indiscernible] general that there's a very wide confidence interval around those. And while you can't rule out the possibility that you see that big reduction, that's a bigger reduction that you expect to get if you are achieving the LDL lowering the dish even from the staff brought so you require some other biology and something that's going on and I can't tell you that's not happening because it sure would be my best case."

Now let me start off by saying that 2015 was an exceptional year for Amgen. It was another year of consistent and reliable performance as we delivered for patients and shareholders. But I think you can see that first in our financial results. 8% revenue growth in 2015 reflects the strength and breadth of our products and our 19% adjusted earnings growth reflects the operating leverage we've created through our successful and ongoing transformation efforts.
The momentum of our products can be seen in the 17% growth we recorded from our in-line brands including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate. Together, these brands generated $11 billion for us.
Our legacy medicines also performed well and these continue to be strong cash flow generators for us, and we remain positioned to compete as new players entering the market.
While delivering these solid results for the year, we also made important groundwork for our future growth with 4 innovative launches in oncology and 2 in cardiovascular disease over the past 12 months. As we've said before, we expect to Repatha and Kyprolis to be significant opportunities for us and see these as great examples of innovative medicines that address big unmet needs on providing significant clinical benefits and demonstrable value propositions for patients and providers. The importance of having value proposition such as these is only set to grow through the innovative biopharmaceutical industry and we're well positioned to embrace that reality in our pipeline.
Developing innovative medicines to address serious illness is at the core of what we do. Behind our 6 new product launches, are a number of additional exciting innovative pipeline opportunities, notably romosozumab on bone and health and AMG 334, which is directed in migraine in the neuroscience area. Also notice our oncology product, etelcalcetide, which is under regulatory review and omecamtiv mecarbil, which is an intriguing opportunity for us in cardiovascular disease.
In addition to our own pipeline of molecules, we expect to remain active in business development. When it comes to later stage opportunities, we would expect this to revolve around our 6 core areas which are hematology oncology, cardiovascular inflammation, bone health, nephrology and science. Focus will remain important to us and you'll see that reflected in our decision this week to help license our respiratory molecule, AMG 282. While we're intrigued by the genetics behind this target and the potential for the molecule in asthma and COPD, we feel the commercialization of it can be better optimized by Genentech, given their established presence in this field.
We continue to expand our global geographic reach, now with full ownership of our products in new markets and the very exciting approval of Repatha in Japan with our partner, Astellas, which represents our first product approval for this Japanese partnership. Our biosimilars program is also making tangible progress, with one, under regulatory review; one, having completed Phase III; and another four, which Phase III results are expected later this year.
We're making significant progress with our transformation efforts here at Amgen. We've already reduced gross costs by $700 million, enabling our 2015 adjusted operating margin to grow by some full points. We'll make further progress in 2016, and we're expecting another $400 million of gross savings as we expect to reduce adjusted operating expenses year-over-year.
Our transformation has also made us more agile and you see the benefits of that in our competitive performance across our products.
In manufacturing, our teams are significant contributors to our transformation efforts, driving down our cost of sales and making final preparations for the licensure of our next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Singapore. Improved drug delivery systems are an important differentiator of our medicines and we're delivering solid results with them. The Neulasta Onpro Kit has been extreme successful in the marketplace and we filed our Repatha once-monthly dosing option globally. We'll continue to innovate the patient and provide our friendly delivery systems to help differentiate our products.
We've also remained focus on smart capital allocation, through a combination of share buybacks, dividend and value creating business development activities that are aligned with our overall strategy, we expect to drive shareholder value. We established a set of targeted financial commitments through 2018. These metrics were chosen in part to provide evidence that we were making clear progress on our strategy through a period of patent exploration and new product launches. I'm pleased to report that as we closed 2015, we've made significant progress towards accomplishing these longer-term metrics.
Finally, as we enter 2016, our position is strong, our strategy is clear and we're excited about the year ahead. I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to deliver for patients and for our shareholders.
David, over to you."

Turning to the fourth quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues of $5.5 billion grew 4% year-over-year with a 3% increase in product sales. Other revenues at $207 million increased $50 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting an increase in royalty income and a milestone payment recognized in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income at $2.4 billion grew 16% from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 5 percentage points to 44% for the quarter, reflecting the continued benefits of our transformation program. On an adjusted basis, total operating expenses decreased 4% year-over-year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 2 percentage points.
Cost of sales margin at 14.3% improved by 1.6 percentage points, driven by lower manufacturing costs, higher net selling price and lower royalties
Research and development expenses at $1.1 billion were down 10% year-over-year, reflecting the Q4 2014 upfront payment to Kite Pharma of $60 million for our cancer immunotherapy collaboration as well as the benefit of R&D expense savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
SG&A expenses were up 3% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting incremental expenses in Q4 for new product launches, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Other income and expenses improved by $53 million year-over-year to a net expense of $120 million in the quarter, primarily due to cash investment portfolio activities as well as higher interest income due to higher cash balances this year.
The tax rate was 11.6% for the quarter, a 1.4 percentage point increase versus Q4 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to a decreased benefit from the R&D tax credit in 2015 versus 2014 due to higher pretax income and reduced R&D expenses. As a result, adjusted net income increased 19% and adjusted earnings per share increased 21%. 
You will find a summary of our full year 2015 results on Page 6 of the presentation. Our 2015 full-year revenues grew 8% to $21.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $10.38 per share. For the full year, adjusted operating income grew to $10.1 billion, a 19% increase based on the combination of solid revenue growth along with flat operating expenses.
Operating margin improved by 4 percentage points to 48%. On an adjusted basis, cost of sales margin improved by 1.3 percentage points year-over-year for 14.5%, driven by lower royalties, higher net selling price and lower manufacturing costs.
Research and development expenses decreased 5%, driven by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. And SG&A expenses were up 6%, primarily due to increased commercial expenses for new product launches, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Other income and expenses improved by $114 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher interest income due to higher cash balances, partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher debt balances.
The tax rate was 16.8% for the full year, up 1.9 percentage points versus 2014. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. For the full year 2015, we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow versus $7.8 billion last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales and profitability. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, total cash and investments increased to $31.4 billion. This balance included over $2 billion in the U.S. and $29 billion outside the U.S.
Total debt outstanding increased slightly to $31.6 billion. As a result, net debt decreased by $3.5 billion to $200 million at year-end 2015. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and an average maturity of 10 years.
Additionally, for 2015, we increased our dividend per share by 30% to $0.79 per quarter, with payments totaling $2.4 billion. We also announced a 27% increase to the dividend to $1 per share for our first quarter 2016 payment.
Finally, at our 2014 business review, we indicated the intent to repurchase shares totaling up to $2 billion by the end of 2015, which we have now accomplished, with repurchases of approximately 13 million shares since Q4 of 2014.
At the end of 2015, we had approximately $4.9 billion remaining under our board authorized share repurchase program. We intend to repurchase an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of shares in 2016 and are on track to deliver our capital allocation commitments to shareholders.
I will now turn to guidance for 2016, summarized on Page 8. As you will recall, we provided preliminary 2016 guidance on our October earnings call. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects an improved revenue outlook due to revised timing of new biosimilar competition as well as the inclusion of the R&D tax credit which has been permanently extended.
With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is $22 billion to $22.5 billion versus prior guidance of $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion, and our adjusted earnings per share guidance was $10.60 to $11 per share. In addition, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to improve by 1 percentage point versus prior guidance to 19.5% to 20.5%. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.
As a result of our strong progress in 2015 and the 2016 outlook, we remain confident we will meet or exceed commitments provided for the 2014 to '18 period, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth, adjusted operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%, $1.5 billion of transformation savings with a net $800 million reduction in operating expense and return to shareholders of at least 60% of adjusted net income during the period.
We also previously guided for total restructuring expense related to the transformation program of $935 million to $1.35 billion during the period through 2018. Based on better-than-anticipated results from the exit of 2 of our closed facilities, we now expect to incur a total of $800 million to $900 million in restructuring expense through 2018 with nearly $700 million recognized already in 2014 and '15.
In summary, we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2015, and we are increasingly confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2016 and beyond.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the fourth quarter on Slide #10. Globally, product sales grew 3% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, and 8% for the full year. Our U.S. business deliver",1743,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the fourth quarter on Slide #10. Globally, product sales grew 3% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, and 8% for the full year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-year growth in the quarter and 12% for the full year.
The fourth quarter included the negative $100 million impact related to the large quarter 3 end customer purchases that I described in our last earnings call. Foreign exchange negatively impacted year-over-year sales by 2 percentage points in both the fourth quarter and the full year.
Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, our international business was up 5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, and up 6% for the full year.
By any measure, 2015 was a success from an operating execution standpoint. Our growth products led the way as they continued meaningful growth. We also laid the foundation for future success with our new product launches as well as further expansion to new countries, while conforming our customer facing model and delivering significant cost savings, which we reinvested in the launches.
Let me now start the with an update on our new cardiovascular franchise where we had two launches in 2015. Repatha, of course, being the biggest opportunity. Repatha is off to a strong competitive start. In the U.S., Repatha's relative share of the segment is reflected in my mind of our launch preparations and execution in the field. Brand recognition amongst cardiologists and primary care physicians is strong. And Repatha is single dose, delivering intensive and predictable LDL-C level production is resonating well with prescribers.
We've made good progress with our pay and negotiations. More than 80% of commercial lives currently have access to Repatha. The strict pay utilization management criteria are limiting the uptick, as you see in the IMS scripts. We continue to work with payers on evaluating the utilization management criteria to ensure that appropriate patients are able to receive Repatha through their plans.
In Europe, reimbursement negotiation's ongoing and we expect to add reimbursement in many countries over the course of the year. I'm pleased to report that earlier this month, we've secured a national reimbursement in Spain well ahead of expectations. In Japan, Repatha was approved last week, along with our partner, Astellas. We are looking forward to launching the product in the next few months after securing reimbursement.
Sean will discuss our coronary imaging and cardiovascular outcome study shortly, and we look forward to data from these 2 trials strengthening Repatha's profile.
Also in cardiovascular disease, our innovative heart failure medicine, Corlanor, is making steady progress with prescribers after its launch early in 2015.
       
Let me now move to oncology, starting with our other large new opportunity, Kyprolis. Kyprolis grew 63% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Our chart orders indicate that we have more than doubled KRd patient share in new to treatment second line patients since our label expansion in July based on the ASPIRE data. We're very excited, too, about the recent FDA approval to add ENDEAVOR data to our U.S. label, demonstrating that Kyprolis has doubled progression-free survival versus Velcade. Our teams are trained and in the marketplace as they are to the ENDEAVOR approval.
With both the ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data now in our U.S. label, we have strengthened Kyprolis' profile as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. Kyprolis is now the only approved therapy for relapsed multiple myeloma with proven efficacy as a single agent, doublet or triplet combination, with different doses to meet individual patient needs. So we'll continue to grow as we treat more second line patients and they'll stay on therapy longer, driven by the deep, durable responses to Kyprolis.
In Europe, Kyprolis was approved in November for second line therapy based on the ASPIRE data. We are launching across Europe on a country-by-country basis as reimbursement is secured. It is already reimbursed in Germany and the launch there is underway.
Continuing now with oncology, XGEVA grew 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and delivered $1.4 billion in sales for the year, driven by unit share gains in both the U.S. and Europe. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by some large purchases in the third quarter. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition.
Vectibix grew 2% year-over-year but had a 10% unit growth. With over 60% of Vectibix sales outside the U.S., foreign exchange negatively impacted Vectibix growth by about 7 percentage points. Nplate continued solid growth of about 15% year-over-year driven by 17% unit growth.
Turning now to the filgrastim franchise. The launch of the Neulasta Onpro Kit continued its strong momentum, achieving 24% share of all Neulasta sales in the fourth quarter. This innovative delivery system is applied during a patient's chemotherapy visit so they can avoid returning to the doctor next day as this is the normal requirement for Neulasta injection. This will also be an important differentiator versus future long-acting by a similar competition. Quarter-over-quarter, Neulasta was negatively impacted by the burn off of some larger U.S. customer purchases in the third quarter that we described in our last call. We expect Neulasta to grow modestly in 2016, and we don't expect a biosimilar launch in the U.S. until the end of the year at the earliest.
NEUPOGEN declined 4% year-over-year. Sequentially, it lost 3 points of market share in the U.S., split between the biosimilar and the branded competitors, but still retains 76% in share. Share loss over the last year resulted in a 11% unit decline in the U.S. But the U.S. sales also benefited from a revision to accounting estimates in quarter 4.
As I said previously, we will compete, account by account, using our many years of experience competing in biosimilars in Europe and branded competitors globally, but do expect some share loss.
We launched two other medicines in oncology: BLINCYTO, which continues to make inroads with ALL patients, and IMLYGIC, but we are pleased with the initial response from key institutions with mixed indication as well as future potential in combination with other immunotherapies.
Let me now turn to information with Enbrel. On Slide #19, you'll see that Enbrel grew 8% year-over-year, driven by net selling price. You'll recall net selling price includes the impact from list price changes as well as contracting and access change that have occurred over the past 12 months. Year-over-year, segment growth remained strong, as rheumatology grew 27% and dermatology grew 46% on the value basis.
Quarter-on-quarter, our rheumatology value share was stable at 28%, while our share in dermatology declined 2 percentage points to 22% due to intensive line competition from new therapies. I'll remind you that dermatology accounts for about 80% of Enbrel sales. Given Enbrel's exclusivity through 2029, we continue to invest in the brand as the outlook for further growth remains strong.
I'll now move to bone health and Prolia. Prolia grew 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, with about 20% unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe delivering $1.3 billion of sales for the year. Growth is driven by continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2016.
With our recent agreement with GSK, we look forward to transitioning Prolia as well as XGEVA and Vectibix back under Amgen's control in 48 countries and continuing to drive growth. This is another important step in delivering our international expansion strategy.
We're also looking forward to a potential important addition to our bone health franchise, with romosozumab, which will soon have its Phase III data and Sean will be discussing that in a moment.
Turning now to our nephrology franchise, starting with EPOGEN. EPOGEN declined 37% year-over-year driven by a shift in ESA use. This decline has 3 primary components: First, around 30% of the decline is due to a shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting. We continue to see uptick of Aranesp with medium-sized and independent dialysis centers. Second, roughly 20% ia a result of the burn off from the large customer purchase in quarter 3 as we discussed in our last call. The remaining 50% of the decline comes from the shift from MIRCERA at Fresenius. Fresenius represents about 1/3 of the U.S. dialysis business. In October, they disclosed that just over half of the dialysis patients utilizing ESAs has switched to MIRCERA. EPOGEN sales in 2016 are likely to be impacted by further share declines in Fresenius and a potential for business switching to Aranesp.
Just a reminder, we have a very good business partnership with DaVita, and our agreement with then extend to 2018, to purchase at least 90% of the ESAs from Amgen.
Aranesp sales increased 4% year-over-year with a 25% unit growth in the U.S., driven by the continued shift in dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp. International sales were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates.
Sensipar grew 21% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and delivered $1.4 billion of sales for the year, driven by net selling price and unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe, with good growth prospects for 2016.
Our nephrology franchise had another exciting opportunity with Parsabiv, the new trade name for etelcalcetide, our intravenous calcimimetic currently under regulator review in both the U.S. and Europe.
I'd like to close by outlining our expectations for 2016. We do not expect Neulasta or EPOGEN biosimilars in the U.S. until the end of 2016 at the earliest. Assuming potential competitors provide us 180 days notice between approval and launch.
EPOGEN is likely to face continued competition at Fresenius and the conversion to Aranesp. NEUPOGEN continues to face headwinds with new competition, while we expect Neulasta sales to continue to grow given the assumed delay of U.S. biosimilar competition. We expect Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate will all see continued growth in 2016, and our recently launched products, notably Repatha and Kyprolis, will contribute meaningful growth in 2016.
Kyprolis' improved label in the U.S., coupled with our launches around the world, will continue to drive solid growth. Repatha growth is expected to be steady in the near term with breakaway potential once we have the outcomes study in our label.
This sure has been a busy and very exciting time for our teams across the world, and I'd like to thank them for their hard work and dedication to delivering to patients. Let me now pass it to Sean."

And 2016 promises to be another very busy year. We've already announced 2 regulatory approvals and there are a lot more R&D events to come.
Beginning with our cardiovascular franchise. Last week, Repatha was approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, and patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular events who are not empathically responding to statins. This is the first approval of a PCSK9 inhibitor in Japan and the very first approval of our -- by our joint venture, Amgen Astellas BioPharma. I'm also happy to report that our outcome study remains on track as we continue to expect the data in the second half of this year, along with the results of our coronary imaging study for conducting with the Cleveland Clinic. We believe that demonstrating the reduction in plaque burden with Repatha will resonate with cardiologists and complement the outcomes data.
We've also been reviewing in detail, along with our partners in Cytokinetics and Servier, the Phase II data from omecamtiv mecarbil, our novel myosin activator for heart failure. We've been extremely encouraged by the feedback we received from our discussions with experts in the field as we prepare to meet with regulators to discuss a potential path forward.
Turning to oncology, last week in the U.S., we also received a new indication for Kyprolis, in combination with dexamethasone in the relapsed multiple myeloma setting. This was based on the ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated clear superiority over Velcade, as Kyprolis doubled the amount of progression-free survival time. This FDA division -- decision also converted the initial accelerated approval to full approval and that is an important dosing flexibility. The Kyprolis ENDEAVOR data are currently under review in the EU.
Subsequent analysis of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR were presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting last month and the response from physicians reinforced our view that Kyprolis will be a backbone on multiple myeloma therapy, as physicians pursue deeper, more durable responses for their patients in search of cure. In support of this, we're exploring the use of Kyprolis in combination with newer therapies for multiple myeloma and announced an initial agreement made last year, in which we are providing drugs to Janssen for combination study with daratumumab.
In the fourth quarter, we also received three marketing authorizations in Europe, including Kyprolis in combination with Revlimid plus dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data. IMLYGIC was approved for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease, and BLINCYTO was approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed to refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 
We recently conducted an analysis of the events occurring in our large ongoing Phase III trial of XGEVA in the setting of skeletal related events prevention in multiple myeloma patients. And with the usual caveat that this is an event driven trial, we currently estimate we'll see the data towards the end of this year. 
We also continued to expand our immuno-oncology platform and announced new collaborations with Merck, combining their PD-1 inhibitor with BLINCYTO in the setting of diffused large B-cell lymphoma, and AMG 820, our anti-colony stimulating factor 1 receptor antibody in advanced solid tumors.
Finally, in oncology, our Phase I study of AMG 330, our anti-CD33 BiTE, continues to enroll acute myeloid leukemia patients. In the area of bone health, we along with our partners from UCB -- at UCB are awaiting the results from our registrational Phase III study for our sclerostin antibody, romosozumab, for postmenopausal osteoporosis. We expect to be stated this quarter. 
In this study, we are assessing the effect of romosozumab dose monthly for 12 months, compared to placebo dose for 12 months after which, both cohorts are treated with Prolia for 12 months. The co-primary end points of the incidence of vertebral fracture at 12 and 24 months. And important secondary endpoints include clinical and non-vertebral fractures.
We're also conducting a Phase III study of similar design comparing romosozumab to alendronate in year 1, followed by both cohorts being treated with in year 2. We expect romosozumab to be used in high risk osteoporosis patients and with a total of 12 monthly doses, we believe the most effective way to ensure proper dosing and maximum benefit in this patient population at least initially is through administration by a health care provider. We'll continue to evaluate the development of potential indications, formulations and delivery options that could be attractive for certain patient populations. In fact, we will be seeing data from our Phase III study assessing the improvement in bone mineral density in men with osteoporosis in the first half of this year.
While osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures are more commonly associated with postmenopausal women, as many as 1 in 4 men over the age of 50 will suffer a vertebral fracture in their remaining lifetimes.
Before I leave our bone franchise, I'd point out that we're also be receiving data from our Phase III Prolia study in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Millions of patients are in glucocorticoid therapy around the world, which can result in a significant bone loss and fracture.
In neuroscience, our Phase III study in episodic migraine with our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, continues to enroll extremely well across 2 studies, a testament to the unmet need and desire by patients for an effective prophylactic therapy. In the chronic migraine setting, our Phase IIb study is expected to read out in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, the Phase I study of our anti-PAC-1 antibody for migraine, AMG 301, is currently enrolling patients.
And finally, we've received the target action date from the FDA on ABP 501, our biosimilar environment, on September 25 of this year. As I said at the outset, 2015 was a very productive year and we have a lot in store for 2016. I would like to thank all of my colleagues at Amgen for continuing to deliver to patients. Bob?"

So I think, obviously, when one looks -- this is a genetically validated target. And when one looks at the rare familial forms of absence of sclerostin or partial absence of sclerostin activity, such as Van Buchem disease, sclerosteosis, these individuals from conception are deficient of sclerostin. And so as a consequence, of course, over time, often in their third or fourth decade, they'll begin to have some untoward effects from this, such as very thick skull plates. And the foramina, in which cranial nerves exit from the skull tend to impinge on the nerves due to overgrowth of bone. I think that this is something that is a -- isn't an effect of developing from conception with the absence of sclerostin. And I just would contrast that sharply with giving 1 year of therapy to generally quite elderly, at least, middle age at minimum, osteoporotic patients. So I think, of course, in an abundance of caution, we are doing testing on hearing and some other things that are designed to assess any kind of theoretical risks. But I would certainly be very surprised to see a pharmacodynamic response from the drug that would result those kinds of complications. The DSMB, of course, is as fully aware as all of our investigators are out doing the trials, and patients through their formal consent, but all the theoretical and established potential risks of these kinds of investigated products."

The hub we put together was clearly done because we understood there was going to be a little bit of time before the payers make a decision around formal approval. And to me, the hub would, therefore, be a surrogate to the level of prescriptions that cardiologists and those primary care physicians are prepared to prescribe. We are seeing, really, a robust level of prescriptions coming through the hub. So it continues to give me great confidence in terms of physician willingness to prescribe these rightful patients who will put aside the label. The prescriptions themselves, in terms of both the NBRxs and the TRxs are continuing.

As regard the On-Body Injector for Neulasta, the main reason we brought it to market is the unique distinctive value this drug -- this device brings to patients and to the physicians and clinics and institutions. Most patients try and get the chemo on a Friday and they can spend the weekend recovering before they go back to work. Neulasta requires them to come back on a Saturday morning to get that last injection. So sometimes what is happening is patients are getting an injection too early, which is actually not good. It actually reduces the effectiveness of the drug quite dramatically. Or two, they were not coming back for injection at all, so exposing themselves to potential febrile neutropenia. So the real value whether we pick up from patients, from nurses, from physicians and from institutions has been we are increasing the opportunity to give patients the right number of cycles at the right time and really reduce the possibility of febrile neutropenia dramatically.

Well, what I would say is that the cost in this level, we have about the BMD which, as you know, is the most impressive sort of BMD increase that's been seen in humans with any treatment, translating into fracture-resistance. That confidence is high. I think that the genetic validation that exists for the pathway is very convincing to people in the field. Also, we saw -- this is one of the few areas where the preclinical models, particularly those performed in nonhuman primates are really quite predictive of what they'll see in humans. And then in a nonhuman primate, we were able to do biomechanical testing of bone, of course, after animals were sacrificed. And so we know that we achieved extremely high bone strength in these animals commensurate with the BMD increases. And finally, we've done very advanced imaging of humans that have been treated with romosozumab and compared it head-to-head with what we've seen with Forteo. And as you probably know, Forteo has its major impact on trabecular bone and has a relatively limited impact on cortical bone. And cortical bone really is what matters for the majority of long bone fracture risk, which is really where the clinical need is. And so we have multiple reasons to believe the genetics, the preclinical information and the imaging that we've done in humans that we should have not only a greater BMD increase but that the quality of bone that we're producing is of a higher quality than what one gets using PTH analogues. One way I'm thinking about is that there really are 2 master regulatory switches for controlling BMD. One of them is RANK ligand, which controls osteoblast function that we direct in hazmat there, and the other is sclerostin which act -- which controls osteoblast function. And there, sclerostin is the key mediator. So what you're doing here, like with denosumab, is throwing a master physiologic regulatory switch. And so what you're expecting to get and what we see in everything that we've observed is physiologic, high-quality bone formation."

We know from our experiments with humans that we can't just withdraw the product and leave patients on no therapy, so the gains that are so impressive will melt away relatively quickly. And so it is necessary to lock in these gains with anti-resorptive agents. So what we expect to see is we obviously know a lot about Prolia, we expect the placebo group to respond well with Prolia in the second year. But the patients on romosozumab will also get substantial benefit. And so if there's a meaningful depth difference in fracture risk at the end of year 1, that should persist more or less out to the second year and even, in theory, well beyond that. But this is a new paradigm in osteoporosis that's relatively short period and the study designs are quite different than what people are used to seeing in the field.

Like always, I mean, to me TRxs and NBRxs, in terms of new naive patients are the most important thing to measure in terms of the growth. But with a new launch like this, where the plans that have put in place the formularies, what one has to remember that IMS only reports dispensed prescriptions, i.e. prescriptions that come to a pharmacy or a specialty pharmacy and the patient actually walks away with the drug. What you have to be able to look at inside that data is how many prescriptions get to the pharmacy and how many are rejected versus how many are abandoned. So we are seeing the majority of prescription getting to the pharmacy at the moment are being rejected. Rejected because the prior authorization process have not been properly completed, all of this is outstanding information and patients have to go back and get some more data. All patients are seeing the co-pay at this particular study because the product is not properly formed yet as being too high of co-pay and they abandon the prescription and they walk away. So the data you're seeing is really important, but you have to understand that the majority of prescriptions getting to the pharmacy are either being rejected or abandoned at the moment while there are plans to complete the process which is why we spend so much time with the [indiscernible] model, showing them the number of eligible players who are unlabeled getting to pharmacy and not getting product.

In general, people have felt pretty comfortable doing that and you are seeing that, for example, when we had our 3-year fracture data for Prolia, people compared it to a 3-year fracture data with bisphosphonates, either oral or IV, et cetera. And I think, in this case, it's going to be much more difficult to make those kind of simple comparisons. I think what will happen here is that the data will be interpreted by the experts in the field. And as always as the case with specialty products like this, [indiscernible] with a very specific patient population. The experts in the field will make the determination whether they think that the data are impressive and who ought to be getting the product. And that will influence prescribing outside the [indiscernible] expert. With respect to the primary versus secondary prevention strategies, I think that the companies that were in the lead on PCSK9 wanted to get outcomes data for these products as fast as was possible. And the fastest way to get the outcomes data is to study a patient population that has a fairly high event rate, and that generally is achieved. And one of the main leverage you can pull is to have patients who have suffered with a prior event, that's one of the strongest predictors of a subsequent event. And as you know, there have been slightly different variants on that that have been pursued by us and by Regeneron, but that's been the basic approach. Moreover, it's never been necessary in this field to do outcomes trials in various different populations in order to have a label that covers broad patient populations. So what we really need to do is demonstrate convincingly that the LDL level reductions that you're achieving with your agents translate unequivocally into reductions in cardiovascular outcome risks. That's all you need to do. And we feel that these studies will do that. Obviously, a company coming behind, it has to think about what they've had to do to try to differentiate their therapy."

I mean this is the kind of subject that one we can sit around and talk about for many, many hours, with experts which I'd done. And I think the best thing I can say is that we have a remarkably linear relationship that we've established. Most recently, we've improved it, extending that line -- just in a remarkably linear fashion, extending the line that was created by statins and by other interventions such as allele biohazard or enzymes so -- and the genetics, of course. And so when you put it all together, what you have to believe scientifically is that you -- what the truth is that you're going to fall right on that line, in the same ways if you achieve that additional LDL lowering with the statins or with [indiscernible], where that's, obviously it's not. Could it deviate from the line? Sure. I mean it's always possible that some of the foibles of the way that the clinical trials are designed and conducted, there is, of course, for example, a treatment lag of some sort that occurs when you start therapies. So and this study reads out very quickly instead of over a longer period of time that has a bigger influence, et cetera, that could make it come off the line slightly in one direction. We also know that the agent does have some activity that statins don't have. For example, there is effect on LPa which is present in some individuals and seems to be a strong prognostic factor that could make the dot come off the line a little bit, the other direction. So there is some variability that you could expect. But from a scientific perspective, based on the human genetics and everything we know, one would expect that you're going to see a reduction that would be proportional and similar. And that would be roughly, just ballpark, around that 1/3 level reduction of the risks. So that's the kind of number that many people keep in mind, I think that 50% reduction in risks, it was suggested by the analyses that were published in the interim in general are that there's a very light [indiscernible] interval around those and why you can't rule out the possibility that you'll see that big of a reduction, that's a bigger reduction that you would expect to get if you were achieving the LDL lowering that we're achieving for the statin. So it requires some other biology, [indiscernible] or something that will be going on. And I can't tell you that's not happening but it sure wouldn't be my best case."

So I think there's plenty to look forward to in that space.

Now let me start off by saying that 2015 was an exceptional year for Amgen. It was another year of consistent and reliable performance as we delivered for patients and shareholders. But I think you can see that first in our financial results. 8% revenue growth in 2015 reflects the strength and breadth of our products and our 19% adjusted earnings growth reflects the operating leverage we've created through our successful and ongoing transformation efforts.
The momentum of our products can be seen in the 17% growth we recorded from our in-line brands including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate. Together, these brands generated $11 billion for us.
Our legacy medicines also performed well and these continue to be strong cash flow generators for us, and we remain positioned to compete as new players entering the market.
While delivering these solid results for the year, we also made important groundwork for our future growth with 4 innovative launches in oncology and 2 in cardiovascular disease over the past 12 months. As we've said before, we expect Repatha and Kyprolis to be significant opportunities for us and see these as great examples of innovative medicines that address big unmet needs while providing significant clinical benefits and demonstrable value propositions for patients and providers. The importance of having value proposition such as these is only set to grow through the innovative biopharmaceutical industry and we're well positioned to embrace that reality in our pipeline.
Developing innovative medicines to address serious illness is at the core of what we do. Behind our 6 new product launches, are a number of additional exciting innovative pipeline opportunities, notably romosozumab on bone and health and AMG 334, which is directed in migraine in the neuroscience area. Also of note is our oncology product, etelcalcetide, which is under regulatory review and omecamtiv mecarbil, which is an intriguing opportunity for us in cardiovascular disease.
In addition to our own pipeline of molecules, we expect to remain active in business development. When it comes to later stage opportunities, we would expect this to revolve around our 6 core areas which are hematology oncology, cardiovascular inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience. Focus will remain important to us and you'll see that reflected in our decision this week to out license our respiratory molecule, AMG 282. While we're intrigued by the genetics behind this target and the potential for the molecule in asthma and COPD, we feel the commercialization of it can be better optimized by Genentech, given their established presence in this field.
We continue to expand our global geographic reach, now with full ownership of our products in new markets and the very exciting approval of Repatha in Japan with our partner, Astellas, which represents our first product approval for this Japanese partnership. Our biosimilars program is also making tangible progress, with one, under regulatory review; one, having completed Phase III; and another for which Phase III results are expected later this year.
We're making significant progress with our transformation efforts here at Amgen. We've already reduced gross costs by $700 million, enabling our 2015 adjusted operating margin to grow by some 4 points. We'll make further progress in 2016, and we're expecting another $400 million of gross savings as we expect to reduce adjusted operating expenses year-over-year.
Our transformation has also made us more agile and you see the benefits of that in our competitive performance across our products.
In manufacturing, our teams are significant contributors to our transformation efforts, driving down our cost of sales and making final preparations for the licensure of our next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Singapore. Improved drug delivery systems are an important differentiator of our medicines and we're delivering solid results with them. The Neulasta Onpro Kit has been extremely successful in the marketplace and we filed our Repatha once-monthly dosing option globally. We'll continue to innovate the patient and provider friendly delivery systems to help differentiate our products.
We've also remained focus on smart capital allocation, through a combination of share buybacks, dividend and value creating business development activities that are aligned with our overall strategy, we expect to drive shareholder value. We established a set of targeted financial commitments through 2018. These metrics were chosen in part to provide evidence that we were making clear progress on our strategy through a period of patent expiration and new product launches. I'm pleased to report that as we closed 2015, we've made significant progress towards accomplishing these longer-term metrics.
Finally, as we enter 2016, our position is strong, our strategy is clear and we're excited about the year ahead. I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to deliver for patients and for our shareholders.
David, over to you."

Turning to the fourth quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues of $5.5 billion grew 4% year-over-year with a 3% increase in product sales.

Turning to the fourth quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues of $5.5 billion grew 4% year-over-year with a 3% increase in product sales. Other revenues at $207 million increased $50 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting an increase in royalty income and a milestone payment recognized in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income at $2.4 billion grew 16% from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 5 percentage points to 44% for the quarter, reflecting the continued benefits of our transformation program. On an adjusted basis, total operating expenses decreased 4% year-over-year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 2 percentage points.
Cost of sales margin at 14.3% improved by 1.6 percentage points, driven by lower manufacturing costs, higher net selling price and lower royalties
Research and development expenses at $1.1 billion were down 10% year-over-year, reflecting the Q4 2014 upfront payment to Kite Pharma of $60 million for our cancer immunotherapy collaboration as well as the benefit of R&D expense savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
SG&A expenses were up 3% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting incremental expenses in Q4 for new product launches, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Other income and expenses improved by $53 million year-over-year to a net expense of $120 million in the quarter, primarily due to cash investment portfolio activities as well as higher interest income due to higher cash balances this year.
The tax rate was 11.6% for the quarter, a 1.4 percentage point increase versus Q4 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to a decreased benefit from the R&D tax credit in 2015 versus 2014 due to higher pretax income and reduced R&D expenses. As a result, adjusted net income increased 19% and adjusted earnings per share increased 21%. 
You will find a summary of our full year 2015 results on Page 6 of the presentation. Our 2015 full-year revenues grew 8% to $21.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $10.38 per share. For the full year, adjusted operating income grew to $10.1 billion, a 19% increase based on the combination of solid revenue growth along with flat operating expenses.
Operating margin improved by 4 percentage points to 48%. On an adjusted basis, cost of sales margin improved by 1.3 percentage points year-over-year for 14.5%, driven by lower royalties, higher net selling price and lower manufacturing costs.
Research and development expenses decreased 5%, driven by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. And SG&A expenses were up 6%, primarily due to increased commercial expenses for new product launches, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Other income and expenses improved by $114 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher interest income due to higher cash balances, partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher debt balances.
The tax rate was 16.8% for the full year, up 1.9 percentage points versus 2014. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. For the full year 2015, we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow versus $7.8 billion last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales and profitability. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, total cash and investments increased to $31.4 billion. This balance included over $2 billion in the U.S. and $29 billion outside the U.S.
Total debt outstanding increased slightly to $31.6 billion. As a result, net debt decreased by $3.5 billion to $200 million at year-end 2015. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and an average maturity of 10 years.
Additionally, for 2015, we increased our dividend per share by 30% to $0.79 per quarter, with payments totaling $2.4 billion. We also announced a 27% increase to the dividend to $1 per share for our first quarter 2016 payment.
Finally, at our 2014 business review, we indicated the intent to repurchase shares totaling up to $2 billion by the end of 2015, which we have now accomplished, with repurchases of approximately 13 million shares since Q4 of 2014.
At the end of 2015, we had approximately $4.9 billion remaining under our board authorized share repurchase program. We intend to repurchase an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of shares in 2016 and are on track to deliver our capital allocation commitments to shareholders.
I will now turn to guidance for 2016, summarized on Page 8. As you will recall, we provided preliminary 2016 guidance on our October earnings call. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects an improved revenue outlook due to revised timing of new biosimilar competition as well as the inclusion of the R&D tax credit which has been permanently extended.
With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is $22 billion to $22.5 billion versus prior guidance of $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion, and our adjusted earnings per share guidance was $10.60 to $11 per share. In addition, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to improve by 1 percentage point versus prior guidance to 19.5% to 20.5%. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.
As a result of our strong progress in 2015 and the 2016 outlook, we remain confident we will meet or exceed commitments provided for the 2014 to '18 period, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth, adjusted operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%, $1.5 billion of transformation savings with a net $800 million reduction in operating expense and return to shareholders of at least 60% of adjusted net income during the period.
We also previously guided for total restructuring expense related to the transformation program of $935 million to $1.35 billion during the period through 2018. Based on better-than-anticipated results from the exit of 2 of our closed facilities, we now expect to incur a total of $800 million to $900 million in restructuring expense through 2018 with nearly $700 million recognized already in 2014 and '15.
In summary, we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2015, and we are increasingly confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2016 and beyond.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the fourth quarter on Slide #10. Globally, product sales grew 3% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, and 8% for the full year. Our U.S. business deliver",1742,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the fourth quarter on Slide #10. Globally, product sales grew 3% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, and 8% for the full year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-year growth in the quarter and 12% for the full year.
The fourth quarter included the negative $100 million impact related to the large quarter 3 end customer purchases that I described in our last earnings call. Foreign exchange negatively impacted year-over-year sales by 2 percentage points in both the fourth quarter and the full year.
Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, our international business was up 5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, and up 6% for the full year.
By any measure, 2015 was a success from an operating execution standpoint. Our growth products led the way as they continued meaningful growth. We also laid the foundation for future success with our new product launches as well as further expansion to new countries, while transforming our customer facing model and delivering significant cost savings, which we reinvested in the launches.
Let me now start the with an update on our new cardiovascular franchise where we had 2 launches in 2015. Repatha, of course, being the biggest opportunity. Repatha is off to a strong competitive start. In the U.S., Repatha's relative share of the segment is reflected in my mind of our launch preparations and execution in the field. Brand recognition amongst cardiologists and primary care physicians is strong. And Repatha is single dose, delivering intensive and predictable LDL-C level production is resonating well with prescribers.
We've made good progress with our payer negotiations. More than 80% of commercial lives currently have access to Repatha. The strict payer utilization management criteria are limiting the uptick, as you see in the IMS scripts. We continue to work with payers on evaluating the utilization management criteria to ensure that appropriate patients are able to receive Repatha through their plans.
In Europe, reimbursement negotiations ongoing and we expect to add reimbursement in many countries over the course of the year. I'm pleased to report that earlier this month, we've secured a national reimbursement in Spain well ahead of expectations. In Japan, Repatha was approved last week, along with our partner, Astellas. We are looking forward to launching the product in the next few months after securing reimbursement.
Sean will discuss our coronary imaging and cardiovascular outcome study shortly, and we look forward to data from these 2 trials strengthening Repatha's profile.
Also in cardiovascular disease, our innovative heart failure medicine, Corlanor, is making steady progress with prescribers after its launch early in 2015.
       
Let me now move to oncology, starting with our other large new opportunity, Kyprolis. Kyprolis grew 63% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Our chart orders indicate that we have more than doubled KRd patient share in new to treatment second line patients since our label expansion in July based on the ASPIRE data. We're very excited, too, about the recent FDA approval to add ENDEAVOR data to our U.S. label, demonstrating that Kyprolis has doubled progression-free survival versus Velcade. Our teams are trained and in the marketplace the day after the ENDEAVOR approval.
With both the ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data now in our U.S. label, we have strengthened Kyprolis' profile as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. Kyprolis is now the only approved therapy for relapsed multiple myeloma with proven efficacy as a single agent, doublet or triplet combination, with different doses to meet individual patient needs. Sales will continue to grow as we treat more second line patients and they'll stay on therapy longer, driven by the deep, durable responses to Kyprolis.
In Europe, Kyprolis was approved in November for second line therapy based on the ASPIRE data. We are launching across Europe on a country-by-country basis as reimbursement is secured. It is already reimbursed in Germany and the launch there is underway.
Continuing now with oncology, XGEVA grew 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and delivered $1.4 billion in sales for the year, driven by unit share gains in both the U.S. and Europe. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by some large purchases in the third quarter. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition.
Vectibix grew 2% year-over-year but had a 10% unit growth. With over 60% of Vectibix sales outside the U.S., foreign exchange negatively impacted Vectibix growth by about 7 percentage points. Nplate continued solid growth of about 15% year-over-year driven by 17% unit growth.
Turning now to the filgrastim franchise. The launch of the Neulasta Onpro Kit continued its strong momentum, achieving 24% share of all Neulasta sales in the fourth quarter. This innovative delivery system is applied during a patient's chemotherapy visit so they can avoid returning to the doctor next day as this is the normal requirement for Neulasta injection. This will also be an important differentiator versus future long-acting filgrastim by a similar competition. Quarter-over-quarter, Neulasta was negatively impacted by the burn off of some larger U.S. customer purchases in the third quarter that we described in our last call. We expect Neulasta to grow modestly in 2016, and we don't expect a biosimilar launch in the U.S. until the end of the year at the earliest.
NEUPOGEN declined 4% year-over-year. Sequentially, it lost 3 points of market share in the U.S., split between the biosimilar and the branded competitors, but still retains 76% in share. Share loss over the last year resulted in a 11% unit decline in the U.S. But the U.S. sales also benefited from a revision to accounting estimates in quarter 4.
As I said previously, we will compete, account by account, using our many years of experience competing against biosimilars in Europe and branded competitors globally, but do expect some share loss.
We launched 2 other medicines in oncology: BLINCYTO, which continues to make inroads with ALL patients, and IMLYGIC, but we are pleased with the initial response from key institutions with niche indication as well as future potential in combination with other immunotherapies.
Let me now turn to inflammation with Enbrel. On Slide #19, you'll see that Enbrel grew 8% year-over-year, driven by net selling price. You'll recall net selling price includes the impact from list price changes as well as contracting and access change that have occurred over the past 12 months. Year-over-year, segment growth remained strong, as rheumatology grew 27% and dermatology grew 46% on the value basis.
Quarter-on-quarter, our rheumatology value share was stable at 28%, while our share in dermatology declined 2 percentage points to 22% due to intensive line competition from new therapies. I'll remind you that dermatology accounts for about 80% of Enbrel sales. Given Enbrel's exclusivity through 2029, we continue to invest in the brand as the outlook for further growth remains strong.
I'll now move to bone health and Prolia. Prolia grew 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, with about 20% unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe delivering $1.3 billion of sales for the year. Growth is driven by continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2016.
With our recent agreement with GSK, we look forward to transitioning Prolia as well as XGEVA and Vectibix back under Amgen's control in 48 countries and continuing to drive growth. This is another important step in delivering our international expansion strategy.
We're also looking forward to a potential important addition to our bone health franchise, with romosozumab, which will soon have its Phase III data and Sean will be discussing that in a moment.
Turning now to our nephrology franchise, starting with EPOGEN. EPOGEN declined 37% year-over-year driven by a shift in ESA use. This decline has 3 primary components: First, around 30% of the decline is due to a shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting. We continue to see uptick of Aranesp with medium-sized and independent dialysis centers. Second, roughly 20% is a result of the burn off from the large customer purchase in quarter 3 as we discussed in our last call. The remaining 50% of the decline comes from the shift from MIRCERA at Fresenius. Fresenius represents about 1/3 of the U.S. dialysis business. In October, they disclosed that just over half of the dialysis patients utilizing ESAs has switched to MIRCERA. EPOGEN sales in 2016 are likely to be impacted by further share declines in Fresenius and a potential for additional switching to Aranesp.
Just a reminder, we have a very good business partnership with DaVita, and our agreement with them extend to 2018, to purchase at least 90% of the ESAs from Amgen.
Aranesp sales increased 4% year-over-year with a 25% unit growth in the U.S., driven by the continued shift in dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp. International sales were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates.
Sensipar grew 21% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and delivered $1.4 billion of sales for the year, driven by net selling price and unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe, with good growth prospects for 2016.
Our nephrology franchise had another exciting opportunity with Parsabiv, the new trade name for etelcalcetide, our intravenous calcimimetic currently under regulatory review in both the U.S. and Europe.
I'd like to close by outlining our expectations for 2016. We do not expect Neulasta or EPOGEN biosimilars in the U.S. until the end of 2016 at the earliest. Assuming potential competitors provide us 180 days’ notice between approval and launch.
EPOGEN is likely to face continued competition at Fresenius and the conversion to Aranesp. NEUPOGEN continues to face headwinds with new competition, while we expect Neulasta sales to continue to grow given the assumed delay of U.S. biosimilar competition. We expect Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate will all see continued growth in 2016, and our recently launched products, notably Repatha and Kyprolis, will contribute meaningful growth in 2016.
Kyprolis' improved label in the U.S., coupled with our launches around the world, will continue to drive solid growth. Repatha growth is expected to be steady in the near term with breakaway potential once we have the outcomes study in our label.
This sure has been a busy and very exciting time for our teams across the world, and I'd like to thank them for their hard work and dedication to delivering to patients. Let me now pass it to Sean."

And 2016 promises to be another very busy year. We've already announced 2 regulatory approvals and there are a lot more R&D events to come.
Beginning with our cardiovascular franchise. Last week, Repatha was approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, and patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular events who are not adequately responding to statins. This is the first approval of a PCSK9 inhibitor in Japan and the very first approval of our -- by our joint venture, Amgen Astellas BioPharma. I'm also happy to report that our outcome study remains on track as we continue to expect the data in the second half of this year, along with the results of our coronary imaging study we're conducting with the Cleveland Clinic. We believe that demonstrating the reduction in plaque burden with Repatha will resonate with cardiologists and complement the outcomes data.
We've also been reviewing in detail, along with our partners in Cytokinetics and Servier, the Phase II data from omecamtiv mecarbil, our novel myosin activator for heart failure. We've been extremely encouraged by the feedback we received from our discussions with experts in the field as we prepare to meet with regulators to discuss a potential path forward.
Turning to oncology, last week in the U.S., we also received a new indication for Kyprolis, in combination with dexamethasone in the relapsed multiple myeloma setting. This was based on the ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated clear superiority over Velcade, as Kyprolis doubled the amount of progression-free survival time. This FDA division -- decision also converted the initial accelerated approval to full approval and that is an important dosing flexibility. The Kyprolis ENDEAVOR data are currently under review in the EU.
Subgroup analysis of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR were presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting last month and the response from physicians reinforced our view that Kyprolis will be a backbone on multiple myeloma therapy, as physicians pursue deeper, more durable responses for their patients in search of cure. In support of this, we're exploring the use of Kyprolis in combination with newer therapies for multiple myeloma and announced an initial agreement late last year, in which we are providing drugs to Janssen for combination study with daratumumab.
In the fourth quarter, we also received 3 marketing authorizations in Europe, including Kyprolis in combination with Revlimid plus dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data. IMLYGIC was approved for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease, and BLINCYTO was approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed to refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 
We recently conducted an analysis of the events occurring in our large ongoing Phase III trial of XGEVA in the setting of skeletal related events prevention in multiple myeloma patients. And with the usual caveat that this is an event driven trial, we currently estimate we'll see the data towards the end of this year. 
We also continued to expand our immuno-oncology platform and announced new collaborations with Merck, combining their PD-1 inhibitor with BLINCYTO in the setting of diffused large B-cell lymphoma, and AMG 820, our anti-colony stimulating factor 1 receptor antibody in advanced solid tumors.
Finally, in oncology, our Phase I study of AMG 330, our anti-CD33 BiTE, continues to enroll acute myeloid leukemia patients. In the area of bone health, we along with our partners from UCB -- at UCB are awaiting the results from our registrational Phase III study for our sclerostin antibody, romosozumab, for postmenopausal osteoporosis. We expect the data this quarter. 
In this study, we are assessing the effect of romosozumab dose monthly for 12 months, compared to placebo dose for 12 months after which, both cohorts are treated with Prolia for 12 months. The co-primary end points of the incidence of vertebral fracture at 12 and 24 months. And important secondary endpoints include clinical and non-vertebral fractures.
We're also conducting a Phase III study of similar design comparing romosozumab to alendronate in year 1, followed by both cohorts being treated with alendronate in year 2. We expect romosozumab to be used in high risk osteoporosis patients and with a total of 12 monthly doses, we believe the most effective way to ensure proper dosing and maximum benefit in this patient population at least initially is through administration by a health care provider. We'll continue to evaluate the development of potential indications, formulations and delivery options that could be attractive for certain patient populations. In fact, we will be seeing data from our Phase III study assessing the improvement in bone mineral density in men with osteoporosis in the first half of this year.
While osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures are more commonly associated with postmenopausal women, as many as 1 in 4 men over the age of 50 will suffer a fragility fracture in their remaining lifetimes.
Before I leave our bone franchise, I'd point out that we're also be receiving data from our Phase III Prolia study in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Millions of patients are in glucocorticoid therapy around the world, which can result in a significant bone loss and fracture.
In neuroscience, our Phase III study in episodic migraine with our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, continues to enroll extremely well across 2 studies, a testament to the unmet need and desire by patients for an effective prophylactic therapy. In the chronic migraine setting, our Phase IIb study is expected to read out in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, the Phase I study of our anti-PAC-1 antibody for migraine, AMG 301, is currently enrolling patients.
And finally, we've received the target action date from the FDA on ABP 501, our biosimilar HUMIRA, on September 25 of this year. As I said at the outset, 2015 was a very productive year and we have a lot in store for 2016. I would like to thank all of my colleagues at Amgen for continuing to deliver to patients. Bob?"

So I think, obviously, when one looks -- this is a genetically validated target. And when one looks at the rare familial forms of absence of sclerostin or partial absence of sclerostin activity, such as Van Buchem disease, sclerosteosis, these individuals from conception are deficient of sclerostin. And so as a consequence, of course, over time, often in their third or fourth decade, they'll begin to have some untoward effects from this, such as very thick skull plates. And the foramina, in which cranial nerves exit from the skull tend to impinge on the nerves due to overgrowth of bone. I think that this is something that is a -- is an effect of developing from conception with the absence of sclerostin. And I just would contrast that sharply with giving 1 year of therapy to generally quite elderly, at least, middle age at minimum, osteoporotic patients. So I think, of course, in an abundance of caution, we are doing testing on hearing and some other things that are designed to assess any kind of theoretical risks. But I would certainly be very surprised to see a pharmacodynamic response from the drug that would result those kinds of complications. The DSMB, of course, is as fully aware as all of our investigators are out doing the trials, and patients through informed consent, but all the theoretical and established potential risks of these kinds of investigative products."

The hub we put together was clearly done because we understood there was going to be a little bit of time before the payers made a decision around formal approval. And to me, the hub would, therefore, be a surrogate to the level of prescriptions that cardiologists, endos and primary care physicians are prepared to prescribe. We are seeing, really, a robust level of prescriptions coming through the hub. So it continues to give me great confidence in terms of physician willingness to prescribe this drug for patients who will put aside the label. The prescriptions themselves, in terms of both the NBRxs and the TRxs are continuing. It's clear that the utilization management criteria in place is restricting the number of prescriptions that get dispensed and we're working with payers at the moment to make sure that patients who are eligible actually get access to these drugs."

We clearly segment the NEUPOGEN accounts between large, medium and small, and we decide which ones we're going to defend and which ones we're going to be letting go. As you know, we've had competition on the market for over a year now, plus a biosimilar competitor for close to 6 months, and we still hold 76% of the market share. As regard the On-Body Injector for Neulasta, the main reason we brought it to market is the unique distinctive value this drug -- this device brings to patients and to the physicians and clinics and institutions. Most patients try and get the chemo on a Friday and they can spend the weekend recovering before they go back to work. Neulasta requires them to come back on a Saturday morning to get that last injection. So sometimes what is happening is patients are getting an injection too early, which is actually not good. It actually reduces the effectiveness of the drug quite dramatically. Or two, they were not coming back for injection at all, so exposing themselves to potential febrile neutropenia. So the real value whether we pick up from patients, from nurses, from physicians and from institutions has been we are increasing the opportunity to give patients the right number of cycles at the right time and really reduce the possibility of febrile neutropenia dramatically. This is the benefit we sell device consistently, which I'm sure will continue and stick."

Well, what I would say is that the confidence level we have about the BMD which, as you know, is the most impressive sort of BMD increase that's been seen in humans with any treatment, translating into fracture-resistance. That confidence is high. I think that the genetic validation that exists for the pathway is very convincing to people in the field. Also, we saw -- this is one of the few areas where the preclinical models, particularly those performed in nonhuman primates are really quite predictive of what they'll see in humans. And then in a nonhuman primate, we were able to do biomechanical testing of bone, of course, after animals were sacrificed. And so we know that we achieved extremely high bone strength in these animals commensurate with the BMD increases. And finally, we've done very advanced imaging of humans that have been treated with romosozumab and compared it head-to-head with what we've seen with Forteo. And as you probably know, Forteo has its major impact on trabecular bone and has a relatively limited impact on cortical bone. And cortical bone really is what matters for the majority of long bone fracture risk, which is really where the clinical need is. And so we have multiple reasons to believe the genetics, the preclinical information and the imaging that we've done in humans that we should have not only a greater BMD increase but that the quality of bone that we're producing is of a higher quality than what one gets using PTH analogues. One way I'm thinking about is that there really are 2 master regulatory switches for controlling BMD. One of them is RANK ligand, which controls osteoblast function that we direct in osmat [ph] there, and the other is sclerostin which act -- which controls osteoblast function. And there, sclerostin is the key mediator. So what you're doing here, like with denosumab, is throwing a master physiologic regulatory switch. And so what you're expecting to get and what we see in everything that we've observed is physiologic, high-quality bone formation."

We know from our experiments with humans that we can't just withdraw the product and leave patients on no therapy, so the gains that are so impressive will melt away relatively quickly. And so it is necessary to lock in these gains with anti-resorptive agents. So what we expect to see is we obviously know a lot about Prolia, we expect the placebo group to respond well with Prolia in the second year. But the patients on romosozumab will also get substantial benefit. And so if there's a meaningful difference in fracture risk at the end of year 1, that should persist more or less out to the second year and even, in theory, well beyond that. But this is a new paradigm in osteoporosis that's relatively short period and the study designs are quite different than what people are used to seeing in the field.

Like always, I mean, to me TRxs and NBRxs, in terms of new naive patients are the most important thing to measure in terms of the growth. But with a new launch like this, where the plans that have put in place the formularies, what one has to remember that IMS only reports dispensed prescriptions, i.e. prescriptions that come to a pharmacy or a specialty pharmacy and the patient actually walks away with the drug. What you have to be able to look at inside that data is how many prescriptions get to the pharmacy and how many are rejected versus how many are abandoned. So we are seeing the majority of prescription getting to the pharmacy at the moment are being rejected. Rejected because the prior authorization process have not been properly completed, or there is outstanding information and patients have to go back and get some more data. Or patients are seeing the co-pay at this particular stage because the product is not properly on formulary yet as being too high of co-pay and they abandon the prescription and they walk away. So the data you're seeing is really important, but you have to understand that the majority of prescriptions getting to the pharmacy are either being rejected or abandoned at the moment while there are plans to complete the process which is why we spend so much time with the plan at the moment, showing them the number of eligible patients who are on label getting to pharmacy and not getting product. It really is a concern. And when you think about the potential Repatha patient, these are patients that are at risk right now for a cardiac event and, therefore, early intervention is essential. So we're spending quite a bit of urgent time with the payers."

And most of the rejections are because the forms are not properly completed and there is just no time to collect the data. So as we get the process running a bit more efficiently and, hopefully, moving from paper to any electronic process, the prior authorizations could go faster. And then as we show the payers, the impact of 2 draconian utilization management criteria not getting to the right patients, we will see some change with that.

In general, people have felt pretty comfortable doing that and you are seeing that, for example, when we had our 3-year fracture data for Prolia, people compared it to a 3-year fracture data with bisphosphonates, either oral or IV, et cetera. And I think, in this case, it's going to be much more difficult to make those kind of simple comparisons. I think what will happen here is that the data will be interpreted by the experts in the field. And as always as the case with specialty products like this, it's targeted at a very specific patient population. The experts in the field will make the determination whether they think that the data are impressive and who ought to be getting the product. And that will influence prescribing outside the expert community. With respect to the primary versus secondary prevention strategies, I think that the companies that were in the lead on PCSK9 wanted to get outcomes data for these products as fast as was possible. And the fastest way to get the outcomes data is to study a patient population that has a fairly high event rate, and that generally is achieved. And one of the main levers you can pull is to have patients who have suffered with a prior event, that's one of the strongest predictors of a subsequent event. And as you know, there have been slightly different flavor variants on that that have been pursued by us and by Regeneron, but that's been the basic approach. Moreover, it's never been necessary in this field to do outcomes trials in various different populations in order to have a label that covers broad patient populations. So what we really need to do is demonstrate convincingly that the LDL level reductions that you're achieving with your agents translate unequivocally into reductions in cardiovascular outcome risks. That's all you need to do. And we feel that these studies will do that. Obviously, a company coming behind, it has to think about what they've had to do to try to differentiate their position."

I mean this is the kind of subject that one we can sit around and talk about for many, many hours, with experts which I'd done. And I think the best thing I can say is that we have a remarkably linear relationship that we've established. Most recently, with IMPROVE-IT, extending that line -- just in a remarkably linear fashion, extending the line that was created by statins and by other interventions such as allele biohazard and so on -- and the genetics, of course. And so when you put it all together, what you have to believe scientifically is that you -- what the truth is that you're going to fall right on that line, in the same ways if you achieve that additional LDL lowering with the statins or with ezetimibe, were that possible, obviously it's not. Could it deviate from the line? Sure. I mean it's always possible that some of the foibles of the way that the clinical trials are designed and conducted, there is, of course, for example, a treatment lag of some sort that occurs when you start therapies. So and this study reads out very quickly instead of over a longer period of time that has a bigger influence, et cetera, that could make it come off the line slightly in one direction. We also know that the agent does have some activity that statins don't have. For example, there is effect on LPa which is present in some individuals and seems to be a strong prognostic factor that could make the dot come off the line a little bit, the other direction. So there is some variability that you could expect. But from a scientific perspective, based on the human genetics and everything we know, one would expect that you're going to see a reduction that would be proportional and similar. And that would be roughly, just ballpark, around that 1/3 level reduction of the risks. So that's the kind of number that many people keep in mind, I think that 50% reduction in risks, it was suggested by the analyses that were published in the New England Journal are that there's a very light confidence interval around those and why you can't rule out the possibility that you'll see that big of a reduction, that's a bigger reduction than you would expect to get if you were achieving the LDL lowering that we're achieving for the statin. So it requires some other biology, like LDa or something that will be going on. And I can't tell you that's not happening but it sure wouldn't be my base case."

We have a completely novel inflammation mechanism that no one else is pursuing that, I think, is extremely interesting that's entering Phase I now and we have quite a range of BiTE targets that are moving forward into the clinic either now or in the relatively near future. So I think there's plenty to look forward to in that space. And we also have, earlier than that, really the most exciting stuff which is some of the targets that we believe we are uniquely working on because they've arisen from our advanced population based human genetics efforts like sort of the Gene X, example that some of you may recall from our business review, which is moving along very nicely. So I think in a future business review type setting, we'll probably talk a little bit more. It's been hard to do that with everything that's been going on in late stage work."

As Arvind said, we're off to a strong start in 2016 with 10% revenue growth and 17% adjusted earnings per share growth in the first quarter. Our sales were strong in the U.S. and internationally and that was true broadly across our products. As you can see from these results, we've put the company in a strong position to managed competition for our legacy products while investing for growth with our newly-launched and late stage pipeline products.
Last year, as you know, we had 6 launches in the U.S. We expect these products especially Kyprolis and Repatha, to pave the way for our long-term growth. We'll talk more about these launches in our priorities for them on this call.
If last year was a year of launches in the U.S., this will be a year of launches for us internationally as we take Repatha, Kyprolis and our other new products into countries around the rolled. In total, this year, we are expecting on the order of 80 new launches across our countries and products. For example, Repatha is launching now in Japan, Brazil and multiple countries in Europe, and the early signs are good. Similarly, Kyprolis, is off to a strong early started in its first markets in Europe.
Our oncology and cardiovascular franchises received a lot of visibility last year owing to the flow of data and our product launches in these areas. This year, we expect attention to focus on our other franchises as well as our pipeline advances with important new opportunities.
In bone health, for example, our romosozumab opportunity is coming into focus with positive Phase III data. In the nephrology, we expect approval later this year for Parsabiv, a therapeutic for dialysis patients, and we expect pivotal data in neuroscience for our migraine antibody, AMG 334.
In inflammation, we look forward later this year to establishing with the FDA that our adalimumab molecule is indeed biosimilar to Humira. And while I'm speaking about biosimilars programs, I'd also remind you we expect to submit our Avastin very similar file to regulators this year and to have Phase III data for our or Herceptin biosimilar as well.
Our transformation efforts are well underway and delivering results. This includes cost savings which David will discuss, but also improved speed to market and speed in the market, and these attributes are every bit as important as cost savings as we grow our company with new products new territories and adapt to the changing environment for our industry.
Finally, we designed our capital allocation strategy to deliver value for shareholders through both an attractive return of capital and dividends and buybacks and vigorous investment for long-term growth. This is an exciting time in the field of biology, with promising clinical opportunities and breakthroughs arising in many of our areas of interest. So with a strong balance sheet and a long-term investment outlook, we will continue to look for the most promising internal and external opportunities to advance. The to underscore our prior comments on this topic our emphasis will be on focus and capital discipline as we do this.
Before turning to David, let me just congratulate my colleagues around the world for the quality of their execution and a very strong start to the year. David?"

Turning to the first quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, we are pleased with our strong performance, driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Total revenues at $5.5 billion, grew 10% year-over-year. Overall product sales increased 7%, reflecting continued strong performance from our growth products, which more than offset the impact of competition on our legacy products, and NEUPOGEN.
Other revenues at $288 million, increased $129 billion versus the first quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited both from an upfront partner payment for licensing transaction, representing almost 40% of total other revenue for the quarter as well as higher brands royalty income. Total revenue and product sales were impacted 1% unfavorably due to foreign exchange changes.
Adjusted operating income at $2.9 billion, grew 17% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 54.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. As in prior years, our operating margin will likely be lower in the remaining quarters of the year, driven by the timing of expenses.
In 2016, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year. This enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities while delivering solid profitability.
On an adjusted basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales at 13.5% improved by 1.6 points, driven by manufacturing efficiencies, higher net selling price and lower royalties. Research and development expenses at $858 million, were relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 2016 versus last year.
SG&A expenses increased 11% on a year-over-year basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 1 percentage point.
Other income and expenses were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis at $144 million in the quarter as higher interest income was offset by higher interest expense. The adjusted tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, a 1.9 point increase versus Q1 of 2015. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and a state audit settlement in the same quarter of last year. These increases were partially offset by the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-09, a new accounting standard that impacts how certain share -based compensation tax expense is recognized. These impacts were previously reported on the balance sheet as a change in shareholders equity. The new rule requires these impacts to be recognized in the income statement and of thus have a tax rate impact. Future tax rate impacts will depend on the movement in our stock price between when we grant share-based compensation and when it vests. The Q1 benefit of this change is approximately $0.09 to -- adds approximately $0.09 to our adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted net income increased 15%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 17% year-over-year.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cash flow was $1.8 billion, an increase of $400 million over last year. We deployed $0.7 billion to repurchase 4.6 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $147 per share and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. Additionally, our first quarter dividend increased to $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year. At the end of the first quarter, we had $4.2 billion remaining on our board authorized share buyback program and are on track to deliver on our capital allocation commitments to shareholders.
Cash and investments totaled $34.7 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion from last year's first quarter level. This increase reflects strong net cash flow and our first quarter debt issuance of $2.9 billion, of which approximately $2 billion will be used to repay debt maturities over the balance of this year. Our debt balances stands at $34.3 billion as of March 31 of this year. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 11 years.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects solid Q1 performance from revenue and expense as well as the revised tax outlook. With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion versus prior guidance of $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion. And our adjusted earnings per share guidance is now $10.85 to $11.20 a share versus prior guidance of $10.60 to $11. In addition, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be 19% to 20%, including the impact of the previously mentioned accounting standards update versus prior guidance of 19.5% to 20.5%. Finally, we expect to invest capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year.
This concludes our financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony"

Our U.S. busin",1797,"Thank you, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the first quarter on Slide #10. As Bob said, we had a great start with a global product sales in the first quarter growing by 7% year-over-year. Our U.S. business delivered 9% year-over-year growth and sales growth in our international business was negatively impacted by 5 percentage points due to foreign exchange. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, our international business was up 7% year-over-year.
I will start to my comments in 3 categories today, performance of our growth products, how we are managing the lifecycle of our mature brands and conclude an update on the performance of our newly-launched products.
First, our 6 growth products, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate, Sensipar and Amro, aggregated netting $3 billion in sales or over 50% of the first quarter sales, growing 20% year-over-year. Sustaining their growth continues to be a priority for us.
Let me start with Prolia and XGEVA, which are now annualizing at approximately $3 billion per year. Prolia grew significantly at 29% year-over-year. Continued share gains growth in both the U.S. and Europe, although a 25% year-over-year unit demand growth in both regions. We saw the typical seasonality in the first quarter. In the U.S, our direct-to-consumer promotional efforts continue to drive increasing levels of new patient adoption and we are sustaining repeat injection rates of over 65%. We expect the continued growth from Prolia to come for years.
XGEVA grew 11% year-over-year. Unit share increased about 3 percentage points over last year in both the U.S. and Europe. The first quarter was probably impacted by increased levels of processing by some large end customers in the U.S. which we expect to burn off in the next quarter. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition and look forward to potential indications which will drive sustained long-term growth.
Turning to Vectibix and Nplate. Unit demand growth though double-digit gains year-over-year across both products. For Vectibix, we continue to make solid inroads into earlier lines of therapy in both the U.S. and Europe.
Sensipar grew 10% year-over-year, driven by net selling price, as well as unit growth in the U.S. and Europe. The sales annualizing around $1.5 billion, Sensipar remains a growth driver. We look forward to adding parsable is another treatment option for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, our regulated filing for parsable are currently under review in both the U.S. and Europe.
Let me now turn to Enbrel. Enbrel grew 24% year-on-year due to changes in net selling price and inventory which was partially offset by competition. As a reminder, net selling price change comprised several components including list price increases as well as rebates to provide to payers and the impact of [indiscernible]
In the first quarter of 2016, inventory was at a normal level. The year-over-year inventory growth is as a result of prior-year dynamics. Declines in inventory levels in the first quarter last year made for an approximately $100 million favorable comparison this quarter. As we think about the sq this year, we expect the same reverse effect of a similar magnitude. In other words, the significant in the second quarter 2015 will create an unfavorable comparison assuming inventory levels remain normal next quarter.
Turning to underlying performance for Enbrel, we saw 14% year-on-year growth in the rheumatology segment of the first quarter, and Enbrel held quarter-over-quarter value share at 28%. In dermatology, competition from new entrants, primary non-biologics some help drive year-on-year segment growth of 29%. Enbrel share in dermatology declined 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter to 21%. If you'll recall, rheumatology comprises about 80% of Enbrel sales. Given Enbrel's exclusivity through 2029, it remains a critical growth driver that we are continuing to invest behind it.
Let me now turn to how we are managing the lifecycle around our mature brands, starting with our ESA products. Aranesp increased 11% year-over-year, driven by 15% unit growth. In the U.S., we have successfully transitioning our medium-sized and independent dialysis centers from Epogen to Aranesp. Aranesp now represents over 70% of ESA shares of these providers. International sales were negatively impact my pricing pressures and foreign exchange rates.
Epogen declined 44% year-over-year. About 1/3 of this decline is the shift from Epogen to Aranesp in the dialysis setting I mentioned above. Most of the reigning decline comes from the shift from Amgen ESA to Macero sinuous. We understand that which represents about 1/3 of the U.S. dialysis business has converted over 70% of its patients to Macero. If you remember we have a contract with DaVita, which represents another 1/3 of the dialysis business to 2018, the person at least 90% of the year stays with Amgen. I'd like to point at we also do not expect biosimilar competition to Epogen in 2016.
Epogen declined 13% year-over-year and 19% quarter-over-quarter for the competitive landscape playing out as we generally expected. NEUPOGEN exited of the quarter with a 64% share of the short acting segment, which now consists of Granix and Leukine. As we said before, we'll continue to compete account by account as competition intensifies. We continue to emphasize the value of NEUPOGEN, Ultima's track record of safety, efficacy and reliable supply.
Neulasta grew 4% during the quarter. Unit growth was 3% including purchases by some large U.S. end customers which we expect to burn off next quarter.
Let me now turn to our launches beginning with the Neulasta Onpro Kit. The Neulasta Onpro Kit has been an extremely successful launch, achieving about 1/3 share of Neulasta units in the first quarter and approaching $1 billion in sales in the 12 months since launch.
Patients undergoing suppressive chemotherapy regimens are at high risk serious infections. One of the biggest challenges physicians face in preventing these infections is patient compliance, both ensuring patients get the Neulasta injection after each course of chemo and at the right time, 24 hours after chemo. These are critical steps in order to ensure maximum benefit from Neulasta.
Within the last Onpro Kit, we are able to address this important unmet need. This innovation also provides a meaningful differentiation versus the traditional prefilled syringe and potential future competitors.
We also see the compliance rates improving with the use of Neulasta Onpro based on patient level data. This is a great example of our strategy to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience. By all measures, this highly successful launch and the value brings to patients onto health care system is translating to strong performance. We remain focused on increasing adoption to benefit more patients.
Kyprolis grew 43% year-over-year in a sequential basis unit growth offset by unfavorable changes in inventory and to net selling price. The addition of endeavor data which demonstrated superiority versus relic into the U.S. label in January further solidifies Kyprolis profile as a back burn of multiple myeloma therapy. We expect sales to continue to grow as we treat more second line patients and they stay on therapy longer to achieve deeper and more durable responses. And markets outside the U.S, we're making good progress with our launches, initial results have been very positive as we bring this import of therapy to these patients.
BLINCYTO continues increase penetration in the U.S. and launches are underway across Europe as reimbursement is secured. Sean will discuss developments about by specific antibody platform in a moment. Oncolytic immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma is currently indicated as mono therapy in the U.S. and Europe and explaining an important role addressing the needs for the small patient population. We believe the true potential for lies in combination with other immunotherapies across different tumor types.
Turning now to Repatha, which I continue to believe, is what of our largest opportunities. I am pleased with our developments to date. Our robust clinical development program clearly demonstrated Repatha ability to deliver intensive and predictable LDL-C reduction. This message continues to resonate well with physicians and coupled with strong execution in the marketplace, we continue to the prescribing in the U.S. as recent IMS data.
In Europe, reimbursement negotiations are on track and we are in early launch in several countries including Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. In Japan, we have now received pricing approval and launch activity with our partner Astellas are well underway.
Before handing over to Sean, I thought I would provide some color on the Repatha launch. In my personal experience, I've seen a number of examples which are successful high-value, slow ramping products that share a few common place with Repatha. First, these products often contribute to changes in treatment paradigm such as new mechanism of action and new administration. In the case of Repatha, inhibition of PCSK9 is a novel mechanism and it is the first injectable biologic addressing chronic cardiovascular disease. I'm excited about the prospect of launching the Repatha monthly dosing option later this year, reducing the number of required injections and creating another potential point of difference from the competition.
Second, these products often have significant development program that improve the product profile, expand their patient tools with extend duration of therapy at the time. With Repatha, our study in patients was very well-received leading physicians of the recent American College of Cardiology meeting. Our current imaging study with the real lead out greater this year it is any demonstrate that Repatha reduces patients that and most significantly of course, we expect to read out that the large 27,500 patient outcomes trial later this year, which we expect will establish a clear benefit in cardiovascular outcomes based on Repatha's profound effect on lowering LDL cholesterol.
Lastly, access and reimbursement hurdles, while intense, should be able to overcome with a demonstration of superior clinical benefits versus the current standard of care. We expect to establish this with Repatha through the outcome study I just mentioned. You might have seen this dynamic successfully play out the fact that [indiscernible] as they displays Warfarin. I am unwavering in my commitment and in the belief of Repatha. We will continue to work with payers to improve access to Repatha for appropriate patients and expect strong value proposition to benefit patients with ASC VD who are risk of heart attack or stroke.
In closing, I'm pleased with our execution this quarter and our strong start to the year. We've maintain focus and our growth brands while defending our mature portfolio and launching new products. We are recognized with the relaunch products and imported long-term value driver and are working relentlessly to make this a success. Let me close by recognizing that none of us this would've made possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for their commitment to deliver to patients. Let me now pass to Sean"

I'll begin my remarks with our cardiovascular franchise, starting with Repatha. [indiscernible] and associated muscle symptoms represent a major unresolved challenge for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and often result in the use of therapies that provide less LDL-cholesterol reduction than desired. And our recently completed Phase III study, [indiscernible] 3, we evaluated Repatha and ezetimibe in a group with patients who's Staten intolerance was verified by rigorous blinded Staten rechallenge, where only those patients that experience muscle-related side effects on Staten, but not on placebo were studied. As presented at the ACC meeting and simultaneously published in the Journal of American Medical Association, the study demonstrated that Repatha resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL cholesterol after 24 weeks as compared to ezetimibe with low levels of muscle-related adverse events. We believe this is an important result for those high risk patients that are unable to effectively manage their LDL-cholesterol due to muscle symptoms from Statens. Looking ahead a study mentioned, we continue to look forward to the results of our coronary imaging study and cardiovascular outcome studies in the second half of this year. We also continued to work closely with regulators and their reviews of our Repatha monthly dosing option.
Feedback from cardiologists on our innovative myosin activator, has been consistent that we have a very compelling mechanism of action and Phase II data set. We're currently working with our partners in Cytokinetics and as well as global regulators to define and potential path to Phase III outcome studies.
Turning to oncology, our Phase III open label study evaluating BLINCYTO versus standard of care are patients with [indiscernible] factory of AOL was stopped at a prespecified interim analysis after successfully achieving the primary endpoint of overall survival. This is a first for immunotherapy in this population and we look forward to discussions with regulators as we see conversions to full approval.
In Q1, we also filed an SBLA for BLINCYTO in the U.S., to include no data supporting the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with AOL. We feel BLINCYTO could be an important treatment option for younger patients, potentially avoiding the complications later in life such as secondary malignancies that can arise with the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies.
We are advancing our bio specific T-cell engager or bite platform, including AMG-330, which continues to enroll patients in its Phase I dose escalation study. Recall that AMG-330 is our CD-33 [ph] for acute myelogenous leukemia or AML. AML remains an area of profound unmet medical need. Despite adult AML being about 4x as prevalent as adult AML and with a very poor prognosis, they have been no significant advances approved in the last 20 years.
Staying with our immuno-oncology platforms, we've recently initiated enrollment in the Phase III portion of our melanoma study at in combination with KEYTRUDA, marks PD-1 inhibitor, and we look forward to presenting the results from the Phase Ib portion of this study at the upcoming national meeting. We also recently presented some encouraging first in human data the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting from one of our early stage immuno-oncology programs, AMG 820. This is our anybody against stimulating factor 1 receptor, also known as C fans, which stimulates the activation of tumor associated macro phases. This great interest in the road, the tumor associated macrophages play in tumor immunosuppression and we're helping to lead this field with 820, which is now enrolling patients in a Phase I/II study in combination with KEYTRUDA in advanced solid tumors.
Before I leave oncology, I would note be continued to have productive interactions with regulators in Europe on the Kyprolis endeavor submission. And I'm also pleased to announce that our Phase III study of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, has completed its enrollment. This is an event-driven study and based on the current event rate, we estimate the data will be available in the second half of this year.
In bone health, we were pleased to report along with our partners at UCB, the positive results from 2 Phase III romosozumab studies in Q1. Most importantly, our placebo-controlled pivotal fracture study met both its primary refractory endpoints as well as the important secondary endpoint of clinical fractional reduction. This latter endpoint consists of symptomatic placebo fractures plus non placebo fractures, and pointed recently recognized by physician payers and regulators as these is a symptomatic fractures that can be life altering. Our Phase III study of romosozumab in men with osteoporosis also successfully completed in Q1 with romosozumab treatment resulting in significant gains in bone marrow density versus placebo.
We look forward to our meeting with FDA as pull together our initial filing package in the U.S. We also await results from the event-driven fractures study evaluating romosozumab in comparison to a our treatment which we expect to see in 2017 and will be part of our European filing.
Switching to neuroscience, we have the obviously to present the 52-week data from our Phase II episodic migraine study with our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, at the American Academy of Neurology meeting earlier this month. After 1 year of treatment with the 70-milligram monthly dosing regimen, more than 60% of patients experienced at least a 50% reduction in their monthly migraine days and about 20% of patients had no migraine days in month 12. These are patients that were having an order of 8 migraine days per month so this is quite a clinically meaningful result. We believe the efficacy, tolerability and administration profile of AMG 334 could be an attractive option for migraine patients, considering the lack of well-tolerated prophylactic options currently available. We are rapidly advancing this program to the clinic with our partners at Novartis. We now expect to have the results from our Phase IIb chronic migraine study midyear, and we intend to use this study to potentially gain medication in chronic migraine in our initial BLA filing. We have also completed now enrollment in both of our Phase III episodic migraine studies and expect the results from both of these in the second half of this year. Also with migraine, we believe that AMG 301, our path 1 receptor antibody, could compliment AMG 334, and we continue to progress this asset through Phase I.
In and other regulatory activities, we continue to work with a global regulators on their review of Parsabiv, our novel intravenous calcimimetic for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on hemodialysis. FDA has also accepted our SBLA for the expanded use of Enbrel, to treat pediatric patients whose chronic severe plaque psoriasis.
Finally, with several pivotal data sets and regulatory decisions ahead of us, we have a lot to look forward to this year, and I'd like to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues at Amgen for their unwavering focus on delivering innovative new medicines for patients in need. Bob?"

When I look at Repatha, it is about a 77% rejection rate, not abandonment, that's happening at pharmacy, right? So a lot of the prescriptions are being denied because they don't quite fit the prior process which has been required. Talking to cardiologists, it's clear they're extremely frustrated at the moment because the patients they're sending are appropriate patients who are not being properly managed on their maximum tolerated Staten at the moment. We are spending quite a bit of time with payers at the moment and helping to see the, what I would imagine, is the unintended consequences of rather than onerous paper-based prior system, which are resulting in some new patient not getting access as well as they should. So I think of it my discussion people will understand the importance of getting appropriate patients on drug. I think some the question in terms of narrowing the population is around what are the outcomes show. And there's no doubt in my mind that once we have proof that this right actually results not only lowering LDL, but actually reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke that more patients are will gain access to the drug.

I think that when you step back, there's a couple of things, one is that we need to present these data at the appropriate scientific congresses and publish them so that the experts in the field can look at the data because the paradigm for the study design is so different than what people are used to with a 3-year placebo-controlled portion rather than a 1-year placebo-controlled portion.

Cardiovascular, more broadly, we have some very interesting things we're working on in the early and mid-stage pipeline.

So as we price our drugs around the phamaeconomic value of the products as we bring it to market. Enbrel itself, of course, is competing in a highly competitive marketplace with several large players are competing for formulary position to enable patient access. At the same time, the health plans and the PBM's are negotiating price concessions on large rebates to set up formulary places themselves. And it's because of the magnitude of these rebates, the price increases are becoming part of this overall dynamic. So it's an integrated process flow as we go forward. Talking about 334, as Sean has said again and again, there's a huge unmet medical need in the marketplace where existing therapies have side effects and sometimes as bad as the disease itself. Unlike most of the diseases, patients with chronic migraine really know about it, it's debilitating, it is devastating. And some of the initial research we've done have shown a much higher information are prepared to pay in co-pay because patients really want to get rid of the disease as quick as they can. I think most of the patients who are available to us have been on therapy for some time and we're able to show that they've been on therapy. So I'm sure, will be there. But there is a lot of those patients who fail consistently on existing treatment at the marketplace."

So its our feeling that taken together, the data could potentially support both indications being granted at least by some of the global regulators, and I would not typically go into the discussions about the specific conversations we've had with regulators, but I just say that we feel that it's a very reasonable approach to attempt to get both indications based on the aggregate data package."

As Arvind said, we're off to a strong start in 2016 with 10% revenue growth and 17% adjusted earnings per share growth in the first quarter. Our sales were strong in the U.S. and internationally and that was true broadly across our products. As you can see from these results, we've put the company in a strong position to managed competition for our legacy products while investing for growth with our newly-launched in late-stage pipeline products.
Last year, as you know, we had 6 launches in the U.S. We expect these products, especially Kyprolis and Repatha, to pave the way for our long-term growth. We'll talk more about these launches in our priorities for them on this call.
If last year was a year of launches in the U.S., this will be a year of launches for us internationally as we take Repatha, Kyprolis and our other new products into countries around the world. In total, this year, we're expecting on the order of 80 new launches across our countries and products. For example, Repatha is launching now in Japan, Brazil and multiple countries in Europe, and the early signs are good. Similarly, Kyprolis, is off to a strong early start in its first markets in Europe.
Our oncology and cardiovascular franchises received a lot of visibility last year, owing to the flow of data and our product launches in these areas. This year, we expect attention to focus on our other franchises as well as our pipeline advances with important new opportunities.
In bone health, for example, our romosozumab opportunity is coming into focus with positive Phase III data. In the nephrology, we expect approval later this year for Parsabiv, a therapeutic for dialysis patients, and we expect pivotal data in neuroscience for our migraine antibody, AMG 334.
In inflammation, we look forward later this year to establishing with the FDA that our adalimumab molecule is indeed biosimilar to HUMIRA. And while I'm speaking about our biosimilars programs, I'd also remind you that we expect to submit our bevacizumab or Avastin biosimilar file to regulators this year and to have Phase III data for our trastuzumab or Herceptin biosimilar as well.
Our transformation efforts are well underway and delivering results. This includes cost savings which David will discuss, but also improved speed to market and speed in the market, and these attributes are every bit as important as cost savings as we grow our company with new products in new territories and adapt to the changing environment for our industry.
Finally, we designed our capital allocation strategy to deliver value for shareholders through both an attractive return of capital and dividends and buybacks and vigorous investment for long-term growth. This is an exciting time in the field of biology, with promising clinical opportunities and breakthroughs arising in many of our areas of interest. So with a strong balance sheet and a long-term investment outlook, we will continue to look for the most promising internal and external opportunities to advance. To underscore our prior comments on this topic, our emphasis will be on focus and capital discipline as we do this.
Before turning to David, let me just congratulate my colleagues around the world for the quality of their execution and a very strong start to the year. David?"

Turning to the first quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, we are pleased with our strong performance, driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio.

Turning to the first quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, we are pleased with our strong performance, driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Total revenues at $5.5 billion, grew 10% year-over-year. Overall product sales increased 7%, reflecting continued strong performance from our growth products, which more than offset the impact of competition on our legacy products, EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN.
Other revenues at $288 million, increased $129 million versus the first quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited both from an upfront partner payment for a licensing transaction, representing almost 40% of total other revenue for the quarter as well as higher Ibrance royalty income. Total revenue and product sales were impacted 1% unfavorably due to foreign exchange changes.
Adjusted operating income at $2.9 billion, grew 17% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 54.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. As in prior years, our operating margin will likely be lower in the remaining quarters of the year, driven by the timing of expenses.
In 2016, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year. This enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities while delivering solid profitability.
On an adjusted basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales at 13.5% improved by 1.6 points, driven by manufacturing efficiencies, higher net selling price and lower royalties. Research and development expenses at $858 million, were relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 2016 versus last year.
SG&A expenses increased 11% on a year-over-year basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 1 percentage point.
Other income and expenses were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis at $144 million in the quarter as higher interest income was offset by higher interest expense. The adjusted tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, a 1.9 point increase versus Q1 of 2015. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and a state audit settlement in the same quarter of last year. These increases were partially offset by the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-09, a new accounting standard that impacts how certain share-based compensation tax expense is recognized. These impacts were previously reported on the balance sheet as a change in shareholders' equity. The new rule requires these impacts to be recognized in the income statement and thus, have a tax rate impact. Future tax rate impacts will depend on the movement in our stock price between when we grant share-based compensation and when it vests. The Q1 benefit of this change is approximately $0.09 to -- adds approximately $0.09 to our adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted net income increased 15%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 17% year-over-year.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cash flow was $1.8 billion, an increase of $400 million over last year. We deployed $0.7 billion to repurchase 4.6 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $147 per share and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. Additionally, our first quarter dividend increased to $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year. At the end of the first quarter, we had $4.2 billion remaining on our board authorized share buyback program and are on track to deliver on our capital allocation commitments to shareholders.
Cash and investments totaled $34.7 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion from last year's first quarter level. This increase reflects strong net cash flow and our first quarter debt issuance of $2.9 billion, of which approximately $2 billion will be used to repay debt maturities over the balance of this year. Our debt balance stands at $34.3 billion as of March 31 of this year. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 11 years.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects solid Q1 performance from revenue and expense as well as the revised tax outlook. With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion versus prior guidance of $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion. And our adjusted earnings per share guidance is now $10.85 to $11.20 a share versus prior guidance of $10.60 to $11. In addition, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be 19% to 20%, including the impact of the previously mentioned accounting standards update versus prior guidance of 19.5% to 20.5%. Finally, we expect to invest capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the first quarter on Slide #10. As Bob said, we had a great start with a global product sales in the first quarter growing by 7% year-over-year. Our U.S. busin",1827,"Thank you, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the first quarter on Slide #10. As Bob said, we had a great start with a global product sales in the first quarter growing by 7% year-over-year. Our U.S. business delivered 9% year-over-year growth and sales growth in our international business was negatively impacted by 5 percentage points due to foreign exchange. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, our international business was up 7% year-over-year.
I will structure my comments in 3 categories today: performance of our growth products, how we are managing the life cycle of our mature brands and conclude with an update on the performance of our newly-launched products.
First, our 6 growth products, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate, Sensipar and Enbrel, aggregated nearly $3 billion in sales or over 50% of the first quarter sales, growing 20% year-over-year. Sustaining their growth continues to be a priority for us.
Let me start with Prolia and XGEVA, which are now annualizing at approximately $3 billion per year. Prolia grew significantly at 29% year-over-year. Continued share gains drove growth in both the U.S. and Europe, although a 25% year-over-year unit demand growth in both regions. We saw the typical seasonality in the first quarter. In the U.S, our direct-to-consumer promotional efforts continue to drive increasing levels from new patient adoption, and we are sustaining repeat injection rates of over 65%. We expect the continued growth from Prolia to come for years.
XGEVA grew 11% year-over-year. Unit share increased about 3 percentage points over last year in both the U.S. and Europe. The first quarter was probably impacted by increased levels of processing by some large-end customers in the U.S. which we expect to burn off in the next quarter. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition and look forward to potential new indications which will drive sustained long-term growth.
Turning to Vectibix and Nplate. Unit demand growth drove double-digit gains year-over-year across both products. For Vectibix, we continue to make solid inroads into earlier lines of therapy in both the U.S. and Europe.
Sensipar grew 10% year-over-year, driven by net selling price as well as unit growth in the U.S. and Europe. The sales annualizing around $1.5 billion, Sensipar remains a growth driver. We look forward to adding Parsabiv as another treatment option for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Our regulatory filings for Parsabiv are currently under review in both the U.S. and Europe.
Let me now turn to Enbrel. Enbrel grew 24% year-on-year due to changes in net selling price and inventory which was partially offset by competition. As a reminder, net selling price change comprised several components including list price increases as well as rebates to provide to payers and the impact of formulary decisions.
In the first quarter of 2016, inventory was at a normal level. The year-over-year inventory growth is as a result of prior year dynamics. Declines in inventory levels in the first quarter last year make for an approximately $100 million favorable comparison this quarter. As we think about the second quarter this year, we expect to see a reverse effect of a similar magnitude. In other words, the significant inventory build in the second quarter of 2015 will create an unfavorable comparison, assuming inventory levels remain normal next quarter.
Turning to underlying performance for Enbrel, we saw 14% year-on-year growth in the rheumatology segment of the first quarter, and Enbrel held quarter-over-quarter value share at 28%. In dermatology, competition from new entrants, primary non-biologics help drive year-on-year segment growth of 29%. Enbrel share in dermatology declined 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter to 21%. If you'll recall, rheumatology comprises about 80% of Enbrel sales. Given Enbrel's exclusivity through 2029, it remains a critical growth driver that we are continuing to invest behind it.
Let me now turn to how we are managing the life cycle around our mature brands, starting with our ESA products. Aranesp sales increased 11% year-over-year, driven by 15% unit growth. In the U.S., we are successfully transitioning our medium-sized and independent dialysis centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. Aranesp now represents over 70% of ESA shares of these providers. International sales were negatively impacted by pricing pressures and foreign exchange rates.
EPOGEN declined 44% year-over-year. About 1/3 of this decline is the shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting I mentioned above. Most of the reigning decline comes from the shift from Amgen ESA to MIRCERA at Fresenius. We understand that Fresenius, which represents about 1/3 of the U.S. dialysis business, has converted over 70% of the patients to MIRCERA. If you remember, we have a contract with DaVita, which represents another 1/3 of the dialysis business through 2018 to purchase at least 90% of the ESAs from Amgen. I'd like to point out, we also do not expect biosimilar competition to EPOGEN in 2016.
EPOGEN declined 13% year-over-year and 19% quarter-over-quarter for the competitive landscape playing out as we generally expected. NEUPOGEN exited the quarter with a 64% share of the short-acting segment, which now consists of Zarxio, Granix and Leukine. As we said before, we'll continue to compete account by account as competition intensifies. We continue to emphasize the value of NEUPOGEN, built on its track record of safety, efficacy and reliable supply.
Neulasta grew 4% during the quarter. Unit growth of 3% included purchases by some large U.S. end customers which we expect to burn off next quarter.
Let me now turn to our launches beginning with the Neulasta Onpro Kit. The Neulasta Onpro Kit has been an extremely successful launch, achieving about 1/3 share of Neulasta units in the first quarter and approaching $1 billion in cumulative sales in the 12 months since launch.
Patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens are at high risk of serious infections. One of the biggest challenges physicians face in preventing these infections is patient compliance, both ensuring patients get the Neulasta injection after each course of chemo and at the right time, 24 hours after chemo. These are critical steps in order to ensure maximum benefit of Neulasta.
With the Neulasta Onpro Kit, we are able to address this important unmet need. This innovation also provides a meaningful differentiation versus the traditional prefilled syringe and potential future competitors.
We also see the compliance rates improving with the use of Neulasta Onpro based on patient level data. This is a great example of our strategy to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience. By all measures, this is a highly successful launch and the value it brings to patients and the health care system is translating to strong performance. We remain focused on increasing adoption to benefit more patients.
Kyprolis grew 43% year-over-year on a sequential basis. U.S. unit growth was offset by unfavorable changes to the inventory and to net selling price. The addition of ENDEAVOR data which demonstrated superiority versus Velcade to the U.S. label in January further solidifies Kyprolis' profile as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. We expect sales to continue to grow as we treat more second-line patients and they stay on therapy longer to achieve deeper and more durable responses. In markets outside the U.S, we're making good progress with our launches, initial results have been very positive as we bring this import of therapy to these patients.
BLINCYTO continues to increase patient penetration in the U.S. and launches are underway across Europe as reimbursement is secured. Sean will discuss developments about bispecific antibody platform in a moment. IMLYGIC, our oncolytic immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma is currently indicated as mono therapy in the U.S. and Europe and is playing an important role in addressing the needs for the small-patient population. We believe the true potential for IMLYGIC lies in combination with other immunotherapies across different tumor types.
Turning now to Repatha, which I continue to believe, is one of our largest opportunities. I am pleased with our competitiveness to date. Our robust clinical development program clearly demonstrated Repatha's ability to deliver intensive and predictable LDL-C reduction. This message continues to resonate well with physicians and coupled with strong execution in the marketplace, we continue to lead prescribing in the U.S. as [indiscernible] IMS data.
In Europe, reimbursement negotiations are on track, and we are in early launch in several countries including Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. In Japan, we have now received pricing approval and launch activity with our partner Astellas are well underway.
Before handing over to Sean, I thought I would provide some color on the Repatha launch. In my personal experience, I've seen a number of examples of successful but high-value, slow-ramping products that share a few common traits with Repatha. First, these products often contribute to changes in treatment paradigm such as new mechanism of action and new routes [ph] of administration. In the case of Repatha, inhibition of PCSK9 is a novel mechanism, and it is the first injectable biologic addressing chronic cardiovascular disease. I'm excited about the prospect of launching the Repatha monthly dosing option later this year, reducing the number of required injections and creating another potential point of difference from the competition.
Second, these products often have significant development program that improve the product profile, expand their patient pools or extend duration of therapy over time. With Repatha, our GAUSS-3 study in statin-intolerant patients was very well received by physicians at the recent American College of Cardiology meeting. 
Our coronary imaging study will read out later this year and was designed to demonstrate that Repatha reduces patients blood [ph] burden and most significantly, of course, we expect the readout of a large 27,500 patient outcomes trial later this year, which we expect will establish a clear benefit in cardiovascular outcomes based on Repatha's profound effect on lowering LDL cholesterol.
Lastly, access and reimbursement hurdles, while intense, should be able to come with a demonstration of superior clinical benefits versus the current standard of care. We expect to establish this with Repatha through the outcome study I just mentioned. You might have seen this dynamic successfully play out for the fact that [indiscernible] as they displace Warfarin. I am unwavering in my commitment and in the belief of Repatha. We will continue to work with payers to improve access to Repatha for appropriate patients and expect its strong value proposition to benefit patients with ASCVD, who are at risk of heart attack or stroke.
In closing, I'm pleased with our execution this quarter and our strong start of the year. We've maintained focus on our growth brands while defending our mature portfolio and launching new products. We recognized that our launched products are an important long-term value driver and are working relentlessly to make them a success. Let me close by recognizing that none of this would have been possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for their commitment to delivering to patients. Let me now pass to Sean"
24816,330692264,966902,"Amgen Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We made a lot of exciting progress in Q1 as we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative programs. I'll begin my remarks with our cardiovascular franchise, starting with Repatha. Statin associated muscle symptoms represe",1194,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We made a lot of exciting progress in Q1 as we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative programs. I'll begin my remarks with our cardiovascular franchise, starting with Repatha. Statin associated muscle symptoms represent a major unresolved challenge for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and often result in the use of therapies that provide less LDL-cholesterol reduction than desired. 
In our recently completed Phase III study, GAUSS-3, we evaluated Repatha and ezetimibe in a group with patients whose statin intolerance was verified by rigorous blinded statin rechallenge, where only those patients that experience muscle-related side effects on statin, but not on placebo were studied. As presented at the ACC meeting and simultaneously published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the study demonstrated that Repatha resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL cholesterol after 24 weeks as compared to ezetimibe with low levels of muscle-related adverse events. We believe this is an important result for those high-risk patients that are unable to effectively manage their LDL-cholesterol due to muscle symptoms from statins. 
Looking ahead as Tony mentioned, we continue to look forward to the results of our coronary imaging study and cardiovascular outcome studies in the second half of this year. We also continue to work closely with regulators on their reviews of our Repatha monthly dosing option.
Feedback from cardiologists on our innovative myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, has been consistent that we have a very compelling mechanism of action in Phase II data set. We're currently working with our partners at Cytokinetics and Servier as well as global regulators to define a potential path to Phase III outcome studies.
Turning to oncology, our Phase III open label study evaluating BLINCYTO versus standard of care in patients with [indiscernible] relapsed or refractory ALL was stopped at a prespecified interim analysis after successfully achieving the primary endpoint of the overall survival. This is a first for immunotherapy in this population, and we look forward to discussions with regulators as we seek conversions to full approval.
In Q1, we also filed an sBLA for BLINCYTO in the U.S., to include new data supporting the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with AOL. We feel BLINCYTO could be an important treatment option for younger patients, potentially avoiding the complications later in life, such as secondary malignancies that can arise with the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies.
We are advancing our bispecific T cell Engager or BiTE platform, including AMG 330, which continues to enroll patients in its Phase I dose escalation study. Recall that AMG 330 is our CD [indiscernible] for acute myelogenous leukemia or AML. AML remains an area of profound unmet medical need. Despite adult AML being about 4x as prevalent as adult ALL and with a very poor prognosis, there have been no significant advances approved in the last 20 years.
Staying with our immuno-oncology platforms, we recently initiated enrollment in the Phase III portion of our melanoma study of IMLYGIC in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck's PD-1 inhibitor, and we look forward to presenting the results from the Phase Ib portion of this study at the upcoming ASCO meeting. We also recently presented some encouraging first in human data at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting from one of our early stage immuno-oncology programs, AMG 820. This is our antibody against colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, also known as c-FMS, which stimulates the activation of tumor-associated macrophages. There's great interest in the role that tumor-associated macrophages play in tumor immunosuppression, and we're helping to lead this field with 820, which is now enrolling patients in a Phase I/II study in combination with KEYTRUDA in advanced solid tumors.
Before I leave oncology, I would note we continue to have productive interactions with regulators in Europe on the Kyprolis ENDEAVOR submission. And I'm also pleased to announce that our Phase III study of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, has completed its enrollment. This is an event-driven study and based on the current event rate, we estimate the data will be available in the second half of this year.
In bone health, we were pleased to report along with our partners at UCB, the positive results from 2 Phase III romosozumab studies in Q1. Most importantly, our placebo-controlled pivotal fracture study met both of its primary vertebral fracture endpoints as well as the important secondary endpoint of clinical fracture reduction. This latter endpoint consists of symptomatic vertebral fractures plus non-vertebral fractures, an endpoint increasingly recognized by physician, payers and regulators as these are the symptomatic fractures that can be life-altering. Our Phase III study of romosozumab in men with osteoporosis also successfully completed in Q1 with romosozumab treatment resulting in significant gains in bone marrow density versus placebo.
We look forward to our pre-BLA meeting with FDA as we pull together our initial filing package in the U.S. We also await the results from it, the event-driven fracture study evaluating romosozumab in comparison to alendronate treatment which we expect to see in 2017 and will be part of our European filing.
Switching to neuroscience, we have the opportunity to present the 52-week data from our Phase II episodic migraine study with our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, at the American Academy of Neurology meeting earlier this month. After 1 year of treatment with the 70-milligram monthly dosing regimen, more than 60% of patients experienced at least a 50% reduction in their monthly migraine days and about 20% of patients had no migraine days in month 12. These are patients that were having an order -- on the order of 8 migraine days per month, so this is quite a clinically meaningful result. We believe the efficacy, tolerability and administration profile of AMG 334 could be an attractive option for migraine patients, considering the lack of well-tolerated prophylactic options currently available. We are rapidly advancing this program to the clinic with our partners at Novartis. We now expect to have the results from our Phase IIb chronic migraine study mid-year, and we intend to use this study to potentially gain an indication in chronic migraine in our initial BLA filing. We've also completed now enrollment in both of our Phase III episodic migraine studies and expect the results from both of these in the second half of this year. Also with migraine, we believe that AMG 301, our PAC-1 receptor antibody, could compliment AMG 334, and we continue to progress this asset through Phase I.
In other regulatory activities, we continue to work with global regulators on their review of Parsabiv, our novel intravenous calcimimetic for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on hemodialysis. FDA has also accepted our sBLA for the expanded use of Enbrel to treat pediatric patients with chronic severe plaque psoriasis.
Finally, with several pivotal data sets and regulatory decisions ahead of us, we have a lot to look forward to this year, and I'd like to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues at Amgen for their unwavering focus on delivering innovative new medicines for patients in need. Bob?"

On the large customer end user purchases for XGEVA and Neulasta, so in a range of $30 million to $50 millions, so it's not a large amount but they were clearly burn off during the second quarter. When I look at Repatha, it is about a 77% rejection rate, not abandonment, that's happening at pharmacy, right? So a lot of the prescriptions are being denied because they don't quite fit the prior op [ph] process which has been required. Talking to cardiologists, it's clear that they're extremely frustrated at the moment because the patients they're sending in are appropriate patients who are not being properly managed on their maximum -- tolerated statin at the moment. We are spending quite a bit of time with payers at the moment and helping to see the, what I would imagine, the unintended consequences of rather than onerous paper-based prior op [ph] system, which are resulting in some new patient not getting access to drug when they should. So I think with a bit more discussion people will understand the importance of getting appropriate patients on drug. I think some of the question in terms of narrowing the population is around what will the outcome show. And there's no doubt in my mind that once we have clinical proof that this drug actually results not only in lowering LDL, but in actually reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke that more patients will gain access to the drug."

I think that when you step back, there's a couple of things, one is that we need to present these data at the appropriate scientific congresses and publish them so that the experts in the field can look at the data because the paradigm for the study design is so different than what people are used to with a 3-year placebo-controlled portion rather than a 1-year placebo-controlled portion. And in the end, the most important endpoint to look at with these therapeutics we've had to which again, is the symptomatic vertebral fractures plus non-vertebral. We had quite a significant effect [ph] size there as well as the transition from treatment of romosozumab onto Prolia, where we continue to see benefit of romosozumab into the second year on Prolia.

And it's because of the magnitude of these rebates, the price increases are becoming part of this overall dynamic. So it's an integrated process flow as we go forward. Talking about 334, as Sean has said again and again, there's a huge unmet medical need in the marketplace where existing therapies have side effects and sometimes as bad as the disease itself. Unlike most of the diseases, patients with chronic migraine really know about it, it's debilitating, it is devastating. And some of the initial research we've done have shown a much higher inclination are prepared in this to pay a co-pay because patients really want to get rid of the disease as quick as they can. I think most of the patients who are available to us have been on therapy for some time, and we're able to show that they've been on therapy. So [indiscernible], I'm sure, will be there.

As Arvind said, we're off to a strong start in 2016 with 10% revenue growth and 17% adjusted earnings per share growth in the first quarter. Our sales were strong in the U.S. and internationally and that was true broadly across our products. As you can see from these results, we've put the company in a strong position to managed competition for our legacy products while investing for growth with our newly-launched in late-stage pipeline products.
Last year, as you know, we had 6 launches in the U.S. We expect these products, especially Kyprolis and Repatha, to pave the way for our long-term growth. We'll talk more about these launches and our priorities for them on this call.
If last year was a year of launches in the U.S., this will be a year of launches for us internationally as we take Repatha, Kyprolis and our other new products into countries around the world. In total, this year, we're expecting on the order of 80 new launches across our countries and products. For example, Repatha is launching now in Japan, Brazil and multiple countries in Europe, and the early signs are good. Similarly, Kyprolis, is off to a strong early start in its first markets in Europe.
Our oncology and cardiovascular franchises received a lot of visibility last year, owing to the flow of data and our product launches in these areas. This year, we expect attention to focus on our other franchises as well as our pipeline advances with important new opportunities.
In bone health, for example, our romosozumab opportunity is coming into focus with positive Phase III data. In the nephrology, we expect approval later this year for Parsabiv, a therapeutic for dialysis patients, and we expect pivotal data in neuroscience for our migraine antibody, AMG 334.
In inflammation, we look forward later this year to establishing with the FDA that our adalimumab molecule is indeed biosimilar to HUMIRA. And while I'm speaking about our biosimilars programs, I'd also remind you that we expect to submit our bevacizumab or Avastin biosimilar file to regulators this year and to have Phase III data for our trastuzumab or Herceptin biosimilar as well.
Our transformation efforts are well underway and delivering results. This includes cost savings which David will discuss, but also improved speed to market and speed in the market, and these attributes are every bit as important as cost savings as we grow our company with new products in new territories and adapt to the changing environment for our industry.
Finally, we designed our capital allocation strategy to deliver value for shareholders through both an attractive return of capital and dividends and buybacks and vigorous investment for long-term growth. This is an exciting time in the field of biology, with promising clinical opportunities and breakthroughs arising in many of our areas of interest. So with a strong balance sheet and a long-term investment outlook, we will continue to look for the most promising internal and external opportunities to advance. To underscore our prior comments on this topic, our emphasis will be on focus and capital discipline as we do this.
Before turning to David, let me just congratulate my colleagues around the world for the quality of their execution and a very strong start to the year. David?"

Turning to the first quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, we are pleased with our strong performance, driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Total revenues at $5.5 billion, grew 10% year-ove",871,"Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the first quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, we are pleased with our strong performance, driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Total revenues at $5.5 billion, grew 10% year-over-year. Overall product sales increased 7%, reflecting continued strong performance from our growth products, which more than offset the impact of competition on our legacy products, EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN.
Other revenues at $288 million, increased $129 million versus the first quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited both from an upfront partner payment for a licensing transaction, representing almost 40% of total other revenue for the quarter as well as higher Ibrance royalty income. Total revenue and product sales were impacted 1% unfavorably due to foreign exchange changes.
Adjusted operating income at $2.9 billion, grew 17% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 54.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. As in prior years, our operating margin will likely be lower in the remaining quarters of the year, driven by the timing of expenses.
In 2016, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year. This enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities while delivering solid profitability.
On an adjusted basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales at 13.5% improved by 1.6 points, driven by manufacturing efficiencies, higher net selling price and lower royalties. Research and development expenses at $858 million, were relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 2016 versus last year.
SG&A expenses increased 11% on a year-over-year basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 1 percentage point.
Other income and expenses were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis at $144 million in the quarter as higher interest income was offset by higher interest expense. The adjusted tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, a 1.9 point increase versus Q1 of 2015. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and a state audit settlement in the same quarter of last year. These increases were partially offset by the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-09, a new accounting standard that impacts how certain share-based compensation tax expense is recognized. These impacts were previously reported on the balance sheet as a change in shareholders' equity. The new rule requires these impacts to be recognized in the income statement and thus, have a tax rate impact. Future tax rate impacts will depend on the movement in our stock price between when we grant share-based compensation and when it vests. The Q1 benefit of this change is approximately $0.09 to -- adds approximately $0.09 to our adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted net income increased 15%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 17% year-over-year.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cash flow was $1.8 billion, an increase of $400 million over last year. We deployed $0.7 billion to repurchase 4.6 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $147 per share and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. Additionally, our first quarter dividend increased to $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year. At the end of the first quarter, we had $4.2 billion remaining on our board authorized share buyback program and are on track to deliver on our capital allocation commitments to shareholders.
Cash and investments totaled $34.7 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion from last year's first quarter level. This increase reflects strong net cash flow and our first quarter debt issuance of $2.9 billion, of which approximately $2 billion will be used to repay debt maturities over the balance of this year. Our debt balance stands at $34.3 billion as of March 31 of this year. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 11 years.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects solid Q1 performance from revenue and expense as well as the revised tax outlook. With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion versus prior guidance of $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion. And our adjusted earnings per share guidance is now $10.85 to $11.20 a share versus prior guidance of $10.60 to $11. In addition, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be 19% to 20%, including the impact of the previously mentioned accounting standards update versus prior guidance of 19.5% to 20.5%. Finally, we expect to invest capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the first quarter on Slide #10. As Bob said, we had a great start with a global product sales in the first quarter growing by 7% year-over-year. Our U.S. busin",1824,"Thank you, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the first quarter on Slide #10. As Bob said, we had a great start with a global product sales in the first quarter growing by 7% year-over-year. Our U.S. business delivered 9% year-over-year growth and sales growth in our international business was negatively impacted by 5 percentage points due to foreign exchange. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, our international business was up 7% year-over-year.
I will structure my comments in 3 categories today: performance of our growth products, how we are managing the life cycle of our mature brands and conclude with an update on the performance of our newly-launched products.
First, our 6 growth products, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate, Sensipar and Enbrel, aggregated nearly $3 billion in sales or over 50% of the first quarter sales, growing 20% year-over-year. Sustaining day [ph] growth continues to be a priority for us.
Let me start with Prolia and XGEVA, which are now annualizing at approximately $3 billion per year. Prolia grew significantly at 29% year-over-year. Continued share gains drove growth in both the U.S. and Europe, although a 25% year-over-year unit demand growth in both regions. We saw the typical seasonality in the first quarter. In the U.S, our direct-to-consumer promotional efforts continue to drive increasing levels from new patient adoption, and we are sustaining repeat injection rates of over 65%. We expect the continued growth from Prolia to come for years.
XGEVA grew 11% year-over-year. Unit share increased about 3 percentage points over last year in both the U.S. and Europe. The first quarter was positively impacted by increased levels of purchasing by some large-end customers in the U.S. which we expect to burn off in the next quarter. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition and look forward to potential new indications which will drive sustained long-term growth.
Turning to Vectibix and Nplate. Unit demand growth drove double-digit gains year-over-year across both products. For Vectibix, we continue to make solid inroads into earlier lines of therapy in both the U.S. and Europe.
Sensipar grew 10% year-over-year, driven by net selling price as well as unit growth in the U.S. and Europe. With sales annualizing around $1.5 billion, Sensipar remains a growth driver. We look forward to adding Parsabiv as another treatment option for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Our regulatory filings for Parsabiv are currently under review in both the U.S. and Europe.
Let me now turn to Enbrel. Enbrel grew 24% year-on-year due to changes in net selling price and inventory which was partially offset by competition. As a reminder, net selling price change comprised several components including list price increases as well as rebates to provide to payers and the impact of formulary decisions.
In the first quarter of 2016, inventory was at a normal level. The year-over-year inventory growth is as a result of prior year dynamics. Declines in inventory levels in the first quarter last year make for an approximately $100 million favorable comparison this quarter. As we think about the second quarter this year, we expect to see a reverse effect of a similar magnitude. In other words, the significant inventory build in the second quarter of 2015 will create an unfavorable comparison, assuming inventory levels remain normal next quarter.
Turning to underlying performance for Enbrel, we saw 14% year-on-year growth in the rheumatology segment of the first quarter, and Enbrel held quarter-over-quarter value share at 28%. In dermatology, competition from new entrants, primary non-biologics helped drive year-on-year segment growth of 29%. Enbrel share in dermatology declined 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter to 21%. If you'll recall, rheumatology comprises about 80% of Enbrel sales. Given Enbrel's exclusivity through 2029, it remains a critical growth driver that we are continuing to invest behind.
Let me now turn to how we are managing the life cycle around our mature brands, starting with our ESA products. Aranesp sales increased 11% year-over-year, driven by 15% unit growth. In the U.S., we are successfully transitioning our medium-sized and independent dialysis centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. Aranesp now represents over 70% of ESA shares of these providers. International sales were negatively impacted by pricing pressures and foreign exchange rates.
EPOGEN declined 44% year-over-year. About 1/3 of this decline is the shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting I mentioned above. Most of the reigning decline comes from the shift from Amgen ESA to MIRCERA at Fresenius. We understand that Fresenius, which represents about 1/3 of the U.S. dialysis business, has converted over 70% of the patients to MIRCERA. If you remember, we have a contract with DaVita, which represents another 1/3 of the dialysis business through 2018 to purchase at least 90% of the ESAs from Amgen. I'd like to point out, we also do not expect biosimilar competition to EPOGEN in 2016.
EPOGEN declined 13% year-over-year and 19% quarter-over-quarter with the competitive landscape playing out as we generally expected. NEUPOGEN exited the quarter with a 64% share of the short-acting segment, which now consists of Zarxio, Granix and Leukine. As we said before, we'll continue to compete account by account as competition intensifies. We continue to emphasize the value of NEUPOGEN, built on its track record of safety, efficacy and reliable supply.
Neulasta grew 4% during the quarter. Unit growth of 3% included purchases by some large U.S. end customers which we expect to burn off next quarter.
Let me now turn to our launches beginning with the Neulasta Onpro Kit. The Neulasta Onpro Kit has been an extremely successful launch, achieving about 1/3 share of Neulasta units in the first quarter and approaching $1 billion in cumulative sales in the 12 months since launch.
Patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens are at high risk of serious infections. One of the biggest challenges physicians face in preventing these infections is patient compliance, both ensuring patients get the Neulasta injection after each course of chemo and at the right time, 24 hours after chemo. These are critical steps in order to ensure maximum benefit of Neulasta.
With the Neulasta Onpro Kit, we are able to address this important unmet need. This innovation also provides a meaningful differentiation versus the traditional prefilled syringe and potential future competitors.
We also see the compliance rates improving with the use of Neulasta Onpro based on patient level data. This is a great example of our strategy to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience. By all measures, this is a highly successful launch and the value it brings to patients and the health care system is translating into strong performance. We remain focused on increasing adoption to benefit more patients.
Kyprolis grew 43% year-over-year on a sequential basis. U.S. unit growth was offset by unfavorable changes to the inventory and to net selling price. The addition of ENDEAVOR data which demonstrated superiority versus Velcade to the U.S. label in January further solidifies Kyprolis' profile as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. We expect sales to continue to grow as we treat more second-line patients and they stay on therapy longer to achieve deeper and more durable responses. In markets outside the U.S, we're making good progress with our launches, initial results have been very positive as we bring this important therapy to these patients.
BLINCYTO continues to increase patient penetration in the U.S. and launches are underway across Europe as reimbursement is secured. Sean will discuss developments about bispecific antibody platform in a moment. IMLYGIC, our oncolytic immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma is currently indicated as monotherapy in the U.S. and Europe and is playing an important role in addressing the needs for the small-patient population. We believe the true potential for IMLYGIC lies in combination with other immunotherapies across different tumor types.
Turning now to Repatha, which I continue to believe, is one of our largest opportunities. I am pleased with our competitiveness to date. Our robust clinical development program clearly demonstrated Repatha's ability to deliver intensive and predictable LDL-C reduction. This message continues to resonate well with physicians and coupled with strong execution in the marketplace, we continue to lead prescribing in the U.S. as [indiscernible] IMS data.
In Europe, reimbursement negotiations are on track, and we are in early launch in several countries including Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. In Japan, we have now received pricing approval and launch activity with our partner Astellas are well underway.
Before handing over to Sean, I thought I would provide some color on the Repatha launch. In my personal experience, I've seen a number of examples which have become [ph] successful but high-value, slow-ramping products that share a few common traits with Repatha. First, these products often contribute to changes in treatment paradigm such as new mechanism of action and new routes of administration. In the case of Repatha, inhibition of PCSK9 is a novel mechanism, and it is the first injectable biologic addressing chronic cardiovascular disease. I'm excited about the prospect of launching the Repatha monthly dosing option later this year, reducing the number of required injections and creating another potential point of difference from the competition.
Second, these products often have significant development program that improve the product profile, expand their patient pools or extend duration of therapy over time. With Repatha, our GAUSS-3 study in statin-intolerant patients was very well received by physicians at the recent American College of Cardiology meeting. 
Our coronary imaging study will read out later this year and was designed to demonstrate that Repatha reduces patients' blood [ph] burden and most significantly, of course, we expect the readout of a large 27,500 patient outcomes trial later this year, which we expect will establish a clear benefit in cardiovascular outcomes based on Repatha's profound effect on lowering LDL cholesterol.
Lastly, access and reimbursement hurdles, while intense, should be overcome with a demonstration of superior clinical benefits versus the current standard of care. We expect to establish this with Repatha through the outcome study I just mentioned. You might have seen this dynamic successfully play out in the Factor Xa as they displace Warfarin. I am unwavering in my commitment and in the belief of Repatha. We will continue to work with payers to improve access to Repatha for appropriate patients and expect its strong value proposition to benefit patients with ASCVD, who are at risk of heart attack or stroke.
In closing, I'm pleased with our execution this quarter and our strong start of the year. We've maintained focus on our growth brands while defending our mature portfolio and launching new products. We recognized that our launched products are an important long-term value driver and are working relentlessly to make them a success. Let me close by recognizing that none of this would have been possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for their commitment to delivering to patients. Let me now pass to Sean"
24816,330692264,966943,"Amgen Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We made a lot of exciting progress in Q1 as we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative programs. I'll begin my remarks with our cardiovascular franchise, starting with Repatha. Statin associated muscle symptoms represe",1196,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We made a lot of exciting progress in Q1 as we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative programs. I'll begin my remarks with our cardiovascular franchise, starting with Repatha. Statin associated muscle symptoms represent a major unresolved challenge for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and often result in the use of therapies that provide less LDL-cholesterol reduction than desired. 
In our recently completed Phase III study, GAUSS-3, we evaluated Repatha and ezetimibe in a group with patients whose statin intolerance was verified by rigorous blinded statin rechallenge, where only those patients that experienced muscle-related side effects on statin, but not on placebo were studied. As presented at the ACC meeting and simultaneously published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the study demonstrated that Repatha resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL cholesterol after 24 weeks as compared to ezetimibe with low levels of muscle-related adverse events. We believe this is an important result for those high-risk patients that are unable to effectively manage their LDL-cholesterol due to muscle symptoms from statins. 
Looking ahead as Tony mentioned, we continue to look forward to the results of our coronary imaging study and cardiovascular outcome studies in the second half of this year. We also continue to work closely with regulators on their reviews of our Repatha monthly dosing option.
Feedback from cardiologists on our innovative myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, has been consistent that we have a very compelling mechanism of action and Phase II data set. We're currently working with our partners at Cytokinetics and Servier as well as global regulators to define a potential path to Phase III outcome studies.
Turning to oncology, our Phase III open label study evaluating BLINCYTO versus standard of care in patients with [indiscernible] relapsed or refractory ALL was stopped at a prespecified interim analysis after successfully achieving the primary endpoint of the overall survival. This is a first for immunotherapy in this population, and we look forward to discussions with regulators as we seek conversions to full approval.
In Q1, we also filed an sBLA for BLINCYTO in the U.S., to include new data supporting the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with ALL. We feel BLINCYTO could be an important treatment option for younger patients, potentially avoiding the complications later in life, such as secondary malignancies that can arise with the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies.
We are advancing our bispecific T cell Engager or BiTE platform, including AMG 330, which continues to enroll patients in its Phase I dose escalation study. Recall that AMG 330 is our CD 30 [ph] [indiscernible] for acute myelogenous leukemia or AML. AML remains an area of profound unmet medical need. Despite adult AML being about 4x as prevalent as adult ALL and with a very poor prognosis, there have been no significant advances approved in the last 20 years.
Staying with our immuno-oncology platforms, we recently initiated enrollment in the Phase III portion of our melanoma study of IMLYGIC in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck's PD-1 inhibitor, and we look forward to presenting the results from the Phase Ib portion of this study at the upcoming ASCO meeting. We also recently presented some encouraging first in human data at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting from one of our early stage immuno-oncology programs, AMG 820. This is our antibody against colony-stimulating Factor I receptor, also known as c-FMS, which stimulates the activation of tumor-associated macrophages. There's great interest in the role that tumor-associated macrophages play in tumor immunosuppression, and we're helping to lead this field with 820, which is now enrolling patients in a Phase I/II study in combination with KEYTRUDA in advanced solid tumors.
Before I leave oncology, I would note we continue to have productive interactions with regulators in Europe on the Kyprolis ENDEAVOR submission. And I'm also pleased to announce that our Phase III study of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, has completed its enrollment. This is an event-driven study and based on the current event rate, we estimate the data will be available in the second half of this year.
In bone health, we were pleased to report along with our partners at UCB, the positive results from 2 Phase III romosozumab studies in Q1. Most importantly, our placebo-controlled pivotal fracture study met both of its primary vertebral fracture endpoints as well as the important secondary endpoint of clinical fracture reduction. This latter endpoint consists of symptomatic vertebral fractures plus non-vertebral fractures, an endpoint increasingly recognized by physician, payers and regulators as these are the symptomatic fractures that can be life-altering. Our Phase III study of romosozumab in men with osteoporosis also successfully completed in Q1 with romosozumab treatment resulting in significant gains in bone marrow density versus placebo.
We look forward to our pre-BLA meeting with FDA as we pull together our initial filing package in the U.S. We also await the results from it, the event-driven fracture study evaluating romosozumab in comparison to alendronate treatment which we expect to see in 2017 and will be part of our European filing.
Switching to neuroscience, we have the opportunity to present the 52-week data from our Phase II episodic migraine study with our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, at the American Academy of Neurology meeting earlier this month. After 1 year of treatment with the 70-milligram monthly dosing regimen, more than 60% of patients experienced at least a 50% reduction in their monthly migraine days and about 20% of patients had no migraine days in month 12. These are patients that were having an order -- on the order of 8 migraine days per month, so this is quite a clinically meaningful result. 
We believe the efficacy, tolerability and administration profile of AMG 334 could be an attractive option for migraine patients, considering the lack of well-tolerated prophylactic options currently available. We are rapidly advancing this program through the clinic with our partners at Novartis. We now expect to have the results from our Phase IIb chronic migraine study mid-year, and we intend to use this study to potentially gain an indication in chronic migraine in our initial BLA filing. We've also completed now enrollment in both of our Phase III episodic migraine studies and expect the results from both of these in the second half of this year. Also with migraine, we believe that AMG 301, our PAC-1 receptor antibody, could compliment AMG 334, and we continue to progress this asset through Phase I.
In other regulatory activities, we continue to work with global regulators on their review of Parsabiv, our novel intravenous calcimimetic for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on hemodialysis. FDA has also accepted our sBLA for the expanded use of Enbrel to treat pediatric patients with chronic severe plaque psoriasis.
Finally, with several pivotal data sets and regulatory decisions ahead of us, we have a lot to look forward to this year, and I'd like to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues at Amgen for their unwavering focus on delivering innovative new medicines for patients in need. Bob?"

On the large customer end user purchases for XGEVA and Neulasta, so in a range of $30 million to $50 million, so it's not a large amount but they were clearly burn off during the second quarter. When I look at Repatha, it is about a 77% rejection rate, not abandonment, that's happening at pharmacy, right? So a lot of the prescriptions are being denied because they don't quite fit the prior op process which has been required. Talking to cardiologists, it's clear that they're extremely frustrated at the moment because the patients they're sending in are appropriate patients who are not being properly managed on their maximum tolerated statin at the moment. We are spending quite a bit of time with payers at the moment and helping to see the, what I would imagine, the unintended consequences of rather than onerous paper-based prior op system, which are resulting in so many patients not getting access to drug when they should. So I think with a bit more discussion people will understand the importance of getting appropriate patients on drug. I think some of the question in terms of narrowing the population is around what will the outcome show. And there's no doubt in my mind that once we have definitive proof that this drug actually results not only in lowering LDL, but in actually reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke that more patients will gain access to the drug."

I think that when you step back, there's a couple of things, one is that we need to present these data at the appropriate scientific congresses and publish them so that the experts in the field can look at the data because the paradigm for the study design is so different than what people are used to with a 3-year placebo-controlled portion rather than a 1-year placebo-controlled portion.

So typically, one would set these kind of trials up, so that you wouldn't miss a 20% reduction in risk. Obviously, you may be looking for more, but that would be the way you power the trial. So there's more similarities than there are differences."

Just to reconfirm again, what we report and what we talked about is in terms of net price. And really, that's a combination of the list price, minus the rebates and/or formulary positions you have in the marketplace. I think as a company, we're acutely aware of the issues facing the industry in the U.S. at the moment. But Amgen's all about innovation, right? So as we price our drugs around the pharmacoeconomic value of the products as we bring it to market. Enbrel itself, of course, is competing in a highly competitive marketplace with several large players are competing for formulary position to enable patient access. At the same time, the health plans and the PBMs are negotiating price concessions on large rebates to set up formulary placement themselves [ph]. And it's because of the magnitude of these rebates that price increases are becoming part of this overall dynamic. So it's an integrated process flow as we go forward. Talking about 334, as Sean has said again and again, there's a huge unmet medical need in the marketplace where existing therapies have side effects that are sometimes as bad as the disease itself. Unlike most other the diseases, patients with chronic migraine really know about it, it's debilitating, it is devastating. And some of the initial research we've done have shown a much higher inclination are preparedness to pay a co-pay because patients really want to get rid of the disease as quick as they can. I think most of the patients who are available to us have been on therapy for some time, and we're able to show that they've been on therapy. So [indiscernible], I'm sure, will be there. But there is a large bolus of patients who fail consistently on existing treatment at the marketplace."

So it's our feeling that taken together, all the data could potentially support both indications being granted at least by some of the global regulators, and I would not typically go into the discussions about the specific conversations we've had with regulators, but I'd just say that we feel that it's a very reasonable approach to attempt to get both indications based on the aggregate data package."

As Arvind said, we're off to a strong start in 2016 with 10% revenue growth and 17% adjusted earnings per share growth in the first quarter. Our sales were strong in the U.S. and internationally and that was true broadly across our products. As you can see from these results, we've put the company in a strong position to managed competition for our legacy products while investing for growth with our newly launched in late-stage pipeline products.
Last year, as you know, we had 6 launches in the U.S. We expect these products, especially Kyprolis and Repatha, to pave the way for our long-term growth. We'll talk more about these launches and our priorities for them on this call.
If last year was a year of launches in the U.S., this will be a year of launches for us internationally as we take Repatha, Kyprolis and our other new products into countries around the world. In total, this year, we're expecting on the order of 80 new launches across our countries and products. For example, Repatha is launching now in Japan, Brazil and multiple countries in Europe, and the early signs are good. Similarly, Kyprolis, is off to a strong early start in its first markets in Europe.
Our oncology and cardiovascular franchises received a lot of visibility last year, owing to the flow of data and our product launches in these areas. This year, we expect attention to focus on our other franchises as well as our pipeline advances with important new opportunities.
In bone health, for example, our romosozumab opportunity is coming into focus with positive Phase III data. In the nephrology, we expect approval later this year for Parsabiv, a therapeutic for dialysis patients, and we expect pivotal data in neuroscience for our migraine antibody, AMG 334.
In inflammation, we look forward later this year to establishing with the FDA that our adalimumab molecule is indeed biosimilar to HUMIRA. And while I'm speaking about our biosimilars programs, I'd also remind you that we expect to submit our bevacizumab or Avastin biosimilar file to regulators this year and to have Phase III data for our trastuzumab or Herceptin biosimilar as well.
Our transformation efforts are well underway and delivering results. This includes cost savings which David will discuss, but also improved speed to market and speed in the market, and these attributes are every bit as important as cost savings as we grow our company with new products in new territories and adapt to the changing environment for our industry.
Finally, we designed our capital allocation strategy to deliver value for shareholders through both an attractive return of capital and dividends and buybacks and vigorous investment for long-term growth. This is an exciting time in the field of biology, with promising clinical opportunities and breakthroughs arising in many of our areas of interest. So with a strong balance sheet and a long-term investment outlook, we will continue to look for the most promising internal and external opportunities to advance. To underscore our prior comments on this topic, our emphasis will be on focus and capital discipline as we do this.
Before turning to David, let me just congratulate my colleagues around the world for the quality of their execution and a very strong start to the year. David?"

Turning to the first quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, we are pleased with our strong performance, driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Total revenues at $5.5 billion, grew 10% year-over-year. Overall product sales increased 7%, reflecting continued strong performance from our growth products, which more than offset the impact of competition on our legacy products, EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN.
Other revenues at $288 million, increased $129 million versus the first quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited both from an upfront partner payment for a licensing transaction, representing almost 40% of total other revenue for the quarter as well as higher Ibrance royalty income. Total revenue and product sales were impacted 1% unfavorably due to foreign exchange changes.
Adjusted operating income at $2.9 billion, grew 17% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 54.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. As in prior years, our operating margin will likely be lower in the remaining quarters of the year, driven by the timing of expenses.
In 2016, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year. This enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities while delivering solid profitability.
On an adjusted basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales at 13.5% improved by 1.6 points, driven by manufacturing efficiencies, higher net selling price and lower royalties. Research and development expenses at $858 million, were relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 2016 versus last year.
SG&A expenses increased 11% on a year-over-year basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 1 percentage point.
Other income and expenses were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis at $144 million in the quarter as higher interest income was offset by higher interest expense. The adjusted tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, a 1.9 point increase versus Q1 of 2015. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and a state audit settlement in the same quarter of last year. These increases were partially offset by the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-09, a new accounting standard that impacts how certain share-based compensation tax expense is recognized. These impacts were previously reported on the balance sheet as a change in shareholders' equity. The new rule requires these impacts to be recognized in the income statement and thus, have a tax rate impact. Future tax rate impacts will depend on the movement in our stock price between when we grant share-based compensation and when it vests. The Q1 benefit of this change is approximately $0.09 to -- adds approximately $0.09 to our adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted net income increased 15%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 17% year-over-year.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cash flow was $1.8 billion, an increase of $400 million over last year. We deployed $0.7 billion to repurchase 4.6 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $147 per share and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. Additionally, our first quarter dividend increased to $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year. At the end of the first quarter, we had $4.2 billion remaining on our board authorized share buyback program and are on track to deliver on our capital allocation commitments to shareholders.
Cash and investments totaled $34.7 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion from last year's first quarter level. This increase reflects strong net cash flow and our first quarter debt issuance of $2.9 billion, of which approximately $2 billion will be used to repay debt maturities over the balance of this year. Our debt balance stands at $34.3 billion as of March 31 of this year. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 11 years.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects solid Q1 performance from revenue and expense as well as the revised tax outlook. With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion versus prior guidance of $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion. And our adjusted earnings per share guidance is now $10.85 to $11.20 a share versus prior guidance of $10.60 to $11. In addition, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be 19% to 20%, including the impact of the previously mentioned accounting standards update versus prior guidance of 19.5% to 20.5%. Finally, we expect to invest capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

As Bob said, we had a great start with a global product sales in the first quarter growing by 7% year-over-year. Our U.S. business delivered 9% year-over-year growth and sales growth in our international business was negatively impacted by 5 percentage points due to foreign exchange. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, our international business was up 7% year-over-year.
I will structure my comments in 3 categories today: performance of our growth products, how we are managing the life cycle of our mature brands and conclude with an update on the performance of our newly launched products.
First, our 6 growth products, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate, Sensipar and Enbrel, aggregated nearly $3 billion in sales or over 50% of the first quarter sales, growing 20% year-over-year. Sustaining day [ph] growth continues to be a priority for us.
Let me start with Prolia and XGEVA, which are now annualizing at approximately $3 billion per year. Prolia grew significantly at 29% year-over-year. Continued share gains drove growth in both the U.S. and Europe, although a 25% year-over-year unit demand growth in both regions. We saw the typical seasonality in the first quarter. In the U.S, our direct-to-consumer promotional efforts continue to drive increasing levels from new patient adoption, and we are sustaining repeat injection rates of over 65%. We expect the continued growth from Prolia to come for years.
XGEVA grew 11% year-over-year. Unit share increased about 3 percentage points over last year in both the U.S. and Europe. The first quarter was positively impacted by increased levels of purchasing by some large-end customers in the U.S. which we expect to burn off in the next quarter. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition and look forward to potential new indications which will drive sustained long-term growth.
Turning to Vectibix and Nplate. Unit demand growth drove double-digit gains year-over-year across both products. For Vectibix, we continue to make solid inroads into earlier lines of therapy in both the U.S. and Europe.
Sensipar grew 10% year-over-year, driven by net selling price as well as unit growth in the U.S. and Europe. With sales annualizing around $1.5 billion, Sensipar remains a growth driver. We look forward to adding Parsabiv as another treatment option for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Our regulatory filings for Parsabiv are currently under review in both the U.S. and Europe.
Let me now turn to Enbrel. Enbrel grew 24% year-on-year due to changes in net selling price and inventory which was partially offset by competition. As a reminder, net selling price change comprised several components including list price increases as well as rebates to provide to payers and the impact of formulary decisions.
In the first quarter of 2016, inventory was at a normal level. The year-over-year inventory growth is as a result of prior year dynamics. Declines in inventory levels in the first quarter last year make for an approximately $100 million favorable comparison this quarter. As we think about the second quarter this year, we expect to see a reverse effect of a similar magnitude. In other words, the significant inventory build in the second quarter of 2015 will create an unfavorable comparison, assuming inventory levels remain normal next quarter.
Turning to underlying performance for Enbrel, we saw 14% year-on-year growth in the rheumatology segment of the first quarter, and Enbrel held quarter-over-quarter value share at 28%. In dermatology, competition from new entrants, primary non-biologics helped drive year-on-year segment growth of 29%. Enbrel share in dermatology declined 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter to 21%. If you'll recall, rheumatology comprises about 80% of Enbrel sales. Given Enbrel's exclusivity through 2029, it remains a critical growth driver that we are continuing to invest behind.
Let me now turn to how we are managing the life cycle around our mature brands, starting with our ESA products. Aranesp sales increased 11% year-over-year, driven by 15% unit growth. In the U.S., we are successfully transitioning our medium-sized and independent dialysis centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. Aranesp now represents over 70% of ESA shares of these providers. International sales were negatively impacted by pricing pressures and foreign exchange rates.
EPOGEN declined 44% year-over-year. About 1/3 of this decline is the shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting I mentioned above. Most of the reigning decline comes from the shift from Amgen ESA to MIRCERA at Fresenius. We understand that Fresenius, which represents about 1/3 of the U.S. dialysis business, has converted over 70% of the patients to MIRCERA. If you remember, we have a contract with DaVita, which represents another 1/3 of the dialysis business through 2018 to purchase at least 90% of the ESAs from Amgen. I'd like to point out, we also do not expect biosimilar competition to EPOGEN in 2016.
EPOGEN declined 13% year-over-year and 19% quarter-over-quarter with the competitive landscape playing out as we generally expected. NEUPOGEN exited the quarter with a 64% share of the short-acting segment, which now consists of Zarxio, Granix and Leukine. As we said before, we'll continue to compete account by account as competition intensifies. We continue to emphasize the value of NEUPOGEN, built on its track record of safety, efficacy and reliable supply.
Neulasta grew 4% during the quarter. Unit growth of 3% included purchases by some large U.S. end customers which we expect to burn off next quarter.
Let me now turn to our launches beginning with the Neulasta Onpro Kit. The Neulasta Onpro Kit has been an extremely successful launch, achieving about 1/3 share of Neulasta units in the first quarter and approaching $1 billion in cumulative sales in the 12 months since launch.
Patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens are at high risk of serious infections. One of the biggest challenges physicians face in preventing these infections is patient compliance, both ensuring patients get the Neulasta injection after each course of chemo and at the right time, 24 hours after chemo. These are critical steps in order to ensure maximum benefit of Neulasta.
With the Neulasta Onpro Kit, we are able to address this important unmet need. This innovation also provides a meaningful differentiation versus the traditional prefilled syringe and potential future competitors.
We also see the compliance rates improving with the use of Neulasta Onpro based on patient level data. This is a great example of our strategy to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience. By all measures, this is a highly successful launch and the value it brings to patients and the health care system is translating into strong performance. We remain focused on increasing adoption to benefit more patients.
Kyprolis grew 43% year-over-year on a sequential basis. U.S. unit growth was offset by unfavorable changes to the inventory and to net selling price. The addition of ENDEAVOR data which demonstrated superiority versus Velcade to the U.S. label in January further solidifies Kyprolis' profile as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. We expect sales to continue to grow as we treat more second-line patients and they stay on therapy longer to achieve deeper and more durable responses. In markets outside the U.S, we're making good progress with our launches, initial results have been very positive as we bring this important therapy to these patients.
BLINCYTO continues to increase patient penetration in the U.S. and launches are underway across Europe as reimbursement is secured. Sean will discuss developments about bispecific antibody platform in a moment. IMLYGIC, our oncolytic immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma is currently indicated as monotherapy in the U.S. and Europe and is playing an important role in addressing the needs for the small-patient population. We believe the true potential for IMLYGIC lies in combination with other immunotherapies across different tumor types.
Turning now to Repatha, which I continue to believe, is one of our largest opportunities. I am pleased with our competitiveness to date. Our robust clinical development program clearly demonstrated Repatha's ability to deliver intensive and predictable LDL-C reduction. This message continues to resonate well with physicians and coupled with strong execution in the marketplace, we continue to lead prescribing in the U.S. as [indiscernible] IMS data.
In Europe, reimbursement negotiations are on track, and we are in early launch in several countries including Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. In Japan, we have now received pricing approval and launch activity with our partner Astellas are well underway.
Before handing over to Sean, I thought I would provide some color on the Repatha launch. In my personal experience, I've seen a number of examples which have become [ph] successful but high-value, slow-ramping products that share a few common traits with Repatha. First, these products often contribute to changes in treatment paradigm such as new mechanism of action and new routes of administration. In the case of Repatha, inhibition of PCSK9 is a novel mechanism, and it is the first injectable biologic addressing chronic cardiovascular disease. I'm excited about the prospect of launching the Repatha monthly dosing option later this year, reducing the number of required injections and creating another potential point of difference from the competition.
Second, these products often have significant development program that improve the product profile, expand their patient pools or extend duration of therapy over time. With Repatha, our GAUSS-3 study in statin-intolerant patients was very well received by physicians at the recent American College of Cardiology meeting. 
Our coronary imaging study will read out later this year and was designed to demonstrate that Repatha reduces patients' blood [ph] burden and most significantly, of course, we expect the readout of a large 27,500 patient outcomes trial later this year, which we expect will establish a clear benefit in cardiovascular outcomes based on Repatha's profound effect on lowering LDL cholesterol.
Lastly, access and reimbursement hurdles, while intense, should be overcome with a demonstration of superior clinical benefits versus the current standard of care. We expect to establish this with Repatha through the outcome study I just mentioned. You might have seen this dynamic successfully play out in the Factor Xa as they displace Warfarin. I am unwavering in my commitment and in the belief of Repatha. We will continue to work with payers to improve access to Repatha for appropriate patients and expect its strong value proposition to benefit patients with ASCVD, who are at risk of heart attack or stroke.
In closing, I'm pleased with our execution this quarter and our strong start of the year. We've maintained focus on our growth brands while defending our mature portfolio and launching new products. We recognized that our launched products are an important long-term value driver and are working relentlessly to make them a success. Let me close by recognizing that none of this would have been possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for their commitment to delivering to patients. Let me now pass to Sean."
24816,330692264,969097,"Amgen Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We made a lot of exciting progress in Q1 as we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative programs. I'll begin my remarks with our cardiovascular franchise, starting with Repatha. Statin associated muscle symptoms represe",1196,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We made a lot of exciting progress in Q1 as we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative programs. I'll begin my remarks with our cardiovascular franchise, starting with Repatha. Statin associated muscle symptoms represent a major unresolved challenge for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and often result in the use of therapies that provide less LDL-cholesterol reduction than desired. 
In our recently completed Phase III study, GAUSS-3, we evaluated Repatha and ezetimibe in a group with patients whose statin intolerance was verified by rigorous blinded statin rechallenge, where only those patients that experienced muscle-related side effects on statin, but not on placebo were studied. As presented at the ACC meeting and simultaneously published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the study demonstrated that Repatha resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL cholesterol after 24 weeks as compared to ezetimibe with low levels of muscle-related adverse events. We believe this is an important result for those high-risk patients that are unable to effectively manage their LDL-cholesterol due to muscle symptoms from statins. 
Looking ahead as Tony mentioned, we continue to look forward to the results of our coronary imaging study and cardiovascular outcome studies in the second half of this year. We also continue to work closely with regulators on their reviews of our Repatha monthly dosing option.
Feedback from cardiologists on our innovative myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, has been consistent that we have a very compelling mechanism of action and Phase II data set. We're currently working with our partners at Cytokinetics and Servier as well as global regulators to define a potential path to Phase III outcome studies.
Turning to oncology, our Phase III open label study evaluating BLINCYTO versus standard of care in patients with [indiscernible] relapsed or refractory ALL was stopped at a prespecified interim analysis after successfully achieving the primary endpoint of the overall survival. This is a first for immunotherapy in this population, and we look forward to discussions with regulators as we seek conversions to full approval.
In Q1, we also filed an sBLA for BLINCYTO in the U.S., to include new data supporting the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with ALL. We feel BLINCYTO could be an important treatment option for younger patients, potentially avoiding the complications later in life, such as secondary malignancies that can arise with the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies.
We are advancing our bispecific T cell Engager or BiTE platform, including AMG 330, which continues to enroll patients in its Phase I dose escalation study. Recall that AMG 330 is our CD 30 [ph] [indiscernible] for acute myelogenous leukemia or AML. AML remains an area of profound unmet medical need. Despite adult AML being about 4x as prevalent as adult ALL and with a very poor prognosis, there have been no significant advances approved in the last 20 years.
Staying with our immuno-oncology platforms, we recently initiated enrollment in the Phase III portion of our melanoma study of IMLYGIC in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck's PD-1 inhibitor, and we look forward to presenting the results from the Phase Ib portion of this study at the upcoming ASCO meeting. We also recently presented some encouraging first in human data at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting from one of our early stage immuno-oncology programs, AMG 820. This is our antibody against colony-stimulating Factor I receptor, also known as c-FMS, which stimulates the activation of tumor-associated macrophages. There's great interest in the role that tumor-associated macrophages play in tumor immunosuppression, and we're helping to lead this field with 820, which is now enrolling patients in a Phase I/II study in combination with KEYTRUDA in advanced solid tumors.
Before I leave oncology, I would note we continue to have productive interactions with regulators in Europe on the Kyprolis ENDEAVOR submission. And I'm also pleased to announce that our Phase III study of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, has completed its enrollment. This is an event-driven study and based on the current event rate, we estimate the data will be available in the second half of this year.
In bone health, we were pleased to report along with our partners at UCB, the positive results from 2 Phase III romosozumab studies in Q1. Most importantly, our placebo-controlled pivotal fracture study met both of its primary vertebral fracture endpoints as well as the important secondary endpoint of clinical fracture reduction. This latter endpoint consists of symptomatic vertebral fractures plus non-vertebral fractures, an endpoint increasingly recognized by physician, payers and regulators as these are the symptomatic fractures that can be life-altering. Our Phase III study of romosozumab in men with osteoporosis also successfully completed in Q1 with romosozumab treatment resulting in significant gains in bone marrow density versus placebo.
We look forward to our pre-BLA meeting with FDA as we pull together our initial filing package in the U.S. We also await the results from it, the event-driven fracture study evaluating romosozumab in comparison to alendronate treatment which we expect to see in 2017 and will be part of our European filing.
Switching to neuroscience, we have the opportunity to present the 52-week data from our Phase II episodic migraine study with our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, at the American Academy of Neurology meeting earlier this month. After 1 year of treatment with the 70-milligram monthly dosing regimen, more than 60% of patients experienced at least a 50% reduction in their monthly migraine days and about 20% of patients had no migraine days in month 12. These are patients that were having an order -- on the order of 8 migraine days per month, so this is quite a clinically meaningful result. 
We believe the efficacy, tolerability and administration profile of AMG 334 could be an attractive option for migraine patients, considering the lack of well-tolerated prophylactic options currently available. We are rapidly advancing this program through the clinic with our partners at Novartis. We now expect to have the results from our Phase IIb chronic migraine study mid-year, and we intend to use this study to potentially gain an indication in chronic migraine in our initial BLA filing. We've also completed now enrollment in both of our Phase III episodic migraine studies and expect the results from both of these in the second half of this year. Also with migraine, we believe that AMG 301, our PAC-1 receptor antibody, could compliment AMG 334, and we continue to progress this asset through Phase I.
In other regulatory activities, we continue to work with global regulators on their review of Parsabiv, our novel intravenous calcimimetic for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on hemodialysis. FDA has also accepted our sBLA for the expanded use of Enbrel to treat pediatric patients with chronic severe plaque psoriasis.
Finally, with several pivotal data sets and regulatory decisions ahead of us, we have a lot to look forward to this year, and I'd like to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues at Amgen for their unwavering focus on delivering innovative new medicines for patients in need. Bob?"

On the large customer end user purchases for XGEVA and Neulasta, so in a range of $30 million to $50 million, so it's not a large amount but they were clearly burn off during the second quarter. When I look at Repatha, it is about a 77% rejection rate, not abandonment, that's happening at pharmacy, right? So a lot of the prescriptions are being denied because they don't quite fit the prior op process which has been required. Talking to cardiologists, it's clear that they're extremely frustrated at the moment because the patients they're sending in are appropriate patients who are not being properly managed on their maximum tolerated statin at the moment. We are spending quite a bit of time with payers at the moment and helping to see the, what I would imagine, the unintended consequences of rather than onerous paper-based prior op system, which are resulting in so many patients not getting access to drug when they should. So I think with a bit more discussion people will understand the importance of getting appropriate patients on drug. I think some of the question in terms of narrowing the population is around what will the outcome show. And there's no doubt in my mind that once we have definitive proof that this drug actually results not only in lowering LDL, but in actually reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke that more patients will gain access to the drug."

I think that when you step back, there's a couple of things, one is that we need to present these data at the appropriate scientific congresses and publish them so that the experts in the field can look at the data because the paradigm for the study design is so different than what people are used to with a 3-year placebo-controlled portion rather than a 1-year placebo-controlled portion. And in the end, the most important endpoint to look at with these therapeutics we've hit which again, is the symptomatic vertebral fractures plus non-vertebral and we had quite a significant effect [ph] size there as well as the transition from treatment of romosozumab onto Prolia, where we continue to see benefit of romosozumab into the second year on Prolia.

But whether that will really play into being an important clinical differentiator versus one of these products are out in the marketplace is, I think, too soon to know. Otherwise, we continue to push very hard on the product to get it to patients as fast as we can because there are about 26 million people with migraine in the United States and among them, there is somewhere in the order of 8 million to 10 million who have had attempts or are currently on and off of [ph] therapy for prophylaxis.

Cardiovascular, more broadly, we have some very interesting things we're working on in the early and mid-stage pipeline. And of course, the BiTE platform has a very large number of products in preclinical phases that are moving toward the clinic and we're seeing a situation in which we are going to be introducing into the clinic multiple different therapies in some cases, with different targets directed at the same hematologic malignancy, for example, and are having to -- in addition to some interesting multi-armed clinical trials to try to get some efficiency in the testing when have so many things coming forward simultaneously.

Just to reconfirm again, what we report and what we talked about is in terms of net price.

I think as a company, we're acutely aware of the issues facing the industry in the U.S. at the moment. But Amgen's all about innovation, right? So as we price our drugs around the pharmacoeconomic value of the products as we bring it to market. Enbrel itself, of course, is competing in a highly competitive marketplace with several large players are competing for formulary position to enable patient access. At the same time, the health plans and the PBMs are negotiating price concessions on large rebates to set up formulary placement themselves [ph]. And it's because of the magnitude of these rebates that price increases are becoming part of this overall dynamic. So it's an integrated process flow as we go forward. Talking about 334, as Sean has said again and again, there's a huge unmet medical need in the marketplace where existing therapies have side effects that are sometimes as bad as the disease itself. Unlike most other the diseases, patients with chronic migraine really know about it, it's debilitating, it is devastating. And some of the initial research we've done have shown a much higher inclination are preparedness to pay a co-pay because patients really want to get rid of the disease as quick as they can. I think most of the patients who are available to us have been on therapy for some time, and we're able to show that they've been on therapy. So [indiscernible], I'm sure, will be there.

Our second quarter once again is a continuation of great execution of how we are effectively managing the life cycle of legacy products while launching new products. Of course, there's much more to our execution. So to have a broader discussion, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, who will lead the call with the strategic overview. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016.  Following David, our head of global commercial operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter; followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We should have plenty of time for Q&A after Sean's comments. 
So before I turn the call over to Bob, I would like to note that we have reviewed the Security and Exchange Commission's recent guidance regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and our press release incorporates this revised guidance. As in the past, we will use slides for presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email. 
We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results. And reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, our Form 8-K and also the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation are forward-looking statements, and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.

Thank you, Arvind, and thank you all for joining our call. 
Our business continue to perform well, as you can see through the results the first 6 months of the year with our revenues up 8% and our adjusted earnings per share up 13%. 
While delivering strong and consistent quarter-to-quarter performance, we are also investing successfully for the long term, and the elements of our long-term strategy for growth are clearly progressing as well. We launched 6 new products last year, 2 in the cardiovascular arena and 4 in cancer. And these products are still in the early stages of their launch cycle globally. 
We remain particularly excited about the long-term prospects of Repatha and look forward to important clinical data set to emerge later this year and early next year, which we think will help illuminate the value of this product.  Kyprolis is also a top priority. Based on the very strong clinical profile of Kyprolis, we expect this product to be a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy for the foreseeable future and as such, for it to be used in combination with many of the new agents that are emerging in the field. Both of these products are making progress internationally with additional regular approvals and reimbursement negotiations proceeding well.
Behind the recent launches of our 6 drugs for cardiovascular disease and cancer, we have programs nearing key regulatory milestones in 4 other therapeutic areas: neurology where we are excited about [indiscernible] as potential first-in-class therapy for migraine; bone health where we recently submitted our romosozumab to FDA for regulatory review; nephrology with the prospect of an imminent launch of Parsabiv; and of course in inflammation where we were please with recent FDA panel review of our biosimilar to Humira. 
With an expected 80 new launches across countries and products this year and the recent reacquisition of rights to many of our existing products outside the United States, we're meaningfully expanding our global footprint.  To that end, we recently announced that we have partnered with Daiichi Sankyo in an effort to bring Amgen biosimilars to the Japanese market. 
I'd also note we are excited by the scientific progress we're making in our early research labs. For example, we continue to harness the power of our human genetics platform to uncover fundamental links to human disease. As we saw this quarter, we published research pointing to the role of the ASGR1 gene in cardiovascular disease. While this is still early stage, it highlights our unique ability to generate insights like this and to move them forward quickly in the drug development process. We expect insights such as this to be central to our ability to innovate and continue to deliver long-term growth and returns for our shareholders.
while we're focused on the long term, we are committed to delivering in the short and medium term as well. Our consistent strong performance has placed as well on our way towards delivering long-term commitments we made to shareholders for 2018. The transformation program, which we began some 2 years ago, continues to deliver savings, enabling us to invest in our business and to deliver results for our shareholders. 
Similarly, the commitment we made to effectively manage the life cycle of our legacy products is bearing fruit, as reflected in the success of our Neulasta Onpro launch and the success that we're having in offering [indiscernible] to our dialysis customers. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're active and looking for ways to build our business across our 6 therapeutic focus areas. And we expect to be patient and disciplined in looking for opportunities that we think we could add value to our shareholders. 
Before passing to Chief Financial Officer, David Meline, let me just thank our staff worldwide for their ongoing dedication to our mission of serving patients and for the results they once more delivered for our shareholders. David?"

Other revenues at $214 million increased $69 million versus the second quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited from higher brands royalty income as well as an upfront partner payment. As a reminder, we receive an 8% royalty on revenue which was acquired as part of the Onyx transaction.  Changes in foreign exchange had immaterial impact on total revenue and product sales in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating income at $2.8 billion grew 10% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 51.4% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories.  In 2016, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of incremental gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year, with half of incremental gross efficiency savings from the transformation occurring in the first half. Delivering on this transformation enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities, while also achieving solid profitability. 
On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales, at 13.5%, improved by 1.6 points, driven by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling price. Research and development expenses at $878 million decreased by 4% versus last year, driven primarily by transformation and process improvement efforts and lower spending required to support certain later stage clinical programs. SG&A expenses increased 13% on a year-over-year basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches for the U.S. and global launch activities were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year.
Other income and expenses were a net $176 million expense in Q2. This is an increase of $97 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year net expense increase was primarily due to gains in the second quarter of 2015 from our strategic and venture investment portfolio. We expect our other income and expenses to continue at the current year-to-date trend level.
The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, a 1.4-point decrease versus Q2 of 2015. This decrease reflects benefits associated with tax incentives and the adoption of accounting standards 2016-09, partially offset by unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings. 
Non-GAAP net income increased 9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $3.2 billion in the second quarter 2015. This year-over-year decline reflects timing impacts of income tax payments to the IRS and cash gains realized last year from foreign exchange contracts, which benefited from a strengthened U.S. dollar. 
We deployed $0.6 billion to repurchase 3.9 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $153 per share and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of 2 billion to 3 billion. Additionally, our second quarter dividend was $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year, which result in a dividend yield of over 2.5% on an annualized basis. At the end of the second quarter, we had $3.6 billion remaining on our board-authorized share buyback program. 
Cash and investments totaled $35 billion, an increase of $5 million from last year's second quarter level. this increase reflects continued solid net cash flow and the first quarter debt issuance of $2.9 billion, of which approximately $900 million was used to repay debt maturities in the second quarter.
Our debt balance stands at $33.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and an average maturity of 12 years. 
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on Page 8.  We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects continued conviction in executing on our strategy and solid first half performance of the business. In particular, our overall revenue guidance reflects recent launch product activities, plus continued progress in our growth brands, which grew 13% year-over-year in Q2 and accounted for over 50% of our all product sales. All of this is while absorbing the impact of the competition on our legacy EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN brands. 
With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion versus prior guidance of $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion. And our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $11.10 to $11.40 a share versus prior guidance of $10.85 to $11.20. Finally, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% and capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony"

Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-ye",1208,"Thanks, David. You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #10. 
We continued our strong performance in the second quarter with global product sales growing 5% year-over-year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-year growth, and our international business grew 3%, or 5% year-over-year excluding impact of foreign exchange. Europe was a strong contributor with 11% unit growth. 
My comments will be in 3 parts : first, the performance of our growth products, followed by update of our life-cycle management of the mature brands, and I'll conclude with highlights on the performance by newly launched products.
Our 6 growth products, Prolia, XGEVA, Enbrel,  indiscernible] and Nplate continued to drive our overall performance with 13% year-over-year growth. And as David said, they aggregated to $3 billion of sales or over 50% of second quarter sales. We continue our investments in these brands to achieve their full potential. Both Prolia and XGEVA are now annualizing at over $3 billion per year. 
Prolia grew 30% year-over-year, with a 24% unit growth and continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe. Postmenopausal osteoporosis remains a widely untreated disease. In the U.S. alone, 10 million people are affected, and 4.5 million of those are considered at high risk of fracture. Unfortunately, 60% of these patients are not treated. We're investing in Prolia to reach unserved patients and also to remind current Prolia patients about the importance of returning every 6 months for their treatment. 
XGEVA saw a 15% year-over-year growth, driven by unit share gains around 2 percentage points in both the U.S. and Europe. Quarter-over-quarter growth was negatively impacted by heavier purchasing from some larger end customers in the U.S. 
Enbrel grew 10% year-over-year, driven by changes in net selling price, partially offset by competition. As a reminder, changes in net selling price comprise several components, including changes in list price as well as the impact from rebates we provide to payers and formulary decisions. 
Turning now to the underlying performance for Enbrel. Growth was in both rheumatology and dermatology segments continues. Sequentially, Enbrel lost 2 points of value share in each segment. Recall rheumatology comprises about 80% of Enbrel sales. Enbrel has a long track record of safety, efficacy and a very competitive profile. We're focused on maintaining our position, particularly in the rheumatology segment. 
Sensipar grew 13% year-over-year, driven by net selling price as well as a strong unit growth in U.S. and Europe. We look forward to expanding our presence in nephrology. Market was positive, which is currently being reviewed by the U.S. and European regulators as another treatment option for secondary hyperthyroidism. 
Next, Vectibix. We delivered strong unit growth in our core markets. However, this performance is masked by comparing it against a quarter 2 in 2015 that benefits from an additional shipment to our Japanese partners. 
Nplate grew 14% year-over-year driven by double-digit unit growth. 
I'd now like to focus on how we're managing the life cycle of our mature brands.  Neulasta sales decreased 1% year-over-year. The second quarter was negatively impacted by heavier purchasing by some large end customers in the U.S. the first quarter. I'm pleased to report that the Neulasta deliver kit continued its strong uptake. Adoption is growing due to its ability to ensure maximum benefit of Neulasta, while improving the patient experience versus the traditional prefilled syringe. exited the second quarter with Onpro representing about 40% of Neulasta units and still growing.  We do not expect long-acting biosimilar competition this year, so there remains a significant opportunity to further increase adoption of Onpro. 
As regards to NEUPOGEN, we see the short-acting segment playing out as expected. We ended the second quarter with around 6% share. We continued to compete account by account, emphasizing NEUPOGEN's sustained track record of safety, efficacy and of course, reliable supply. 
Now to DSOs. Our investment sales increased 5% year-over-year driven by 13% unit growth. In the U.S., we've been successfully transitioning about 75% of patients from EPOGEN to Aranesp in medium-sized and independent dialysis centers. 
EPOGEN declined 33% year-on-year. About 1/3 of this decline is the shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting I just mentioned. Most of the remaining decline is due to a shift to Amgen ESAs to their own product.  We understand that [indiscernible], which has about 1/3 of the U.S. business, has converted about 80% of the patients.  You'll recall that our contract with DaVita, represent another 1/3 of the dialysis business, runs through 2018. We do not expect biosimilar competition against EPOGEN in 2016.
Lastly, I'd like to update you on Repatha and Kyprolis. Both products represents subsoil opportunities in addressing serious diseases with significant unmet needs. 
First, Repatha. Our cardiovascular teams executed well on the marketplace. strict utilization management criteria and processes employed by the insurers and [indiscernible] continues to be the biggest hurdle. We are working diligently to address these restrictions. So the pro fit [ph] patients are able to access the treatment their doctors prescribe for them. We look forward to the coronary imaging data from study reading out this year, and then outcome data in the first quarter of 2017. We expect that both these studies will further underscore the value of Repatha.
We're also excited to now offer a new monthly dosing treatment option with the recently approved Repatha [indiscernible, the first and only single monthly injection of a PCSK9 inhibitor. Like the Neulasta Onpro delivery kit, this is another example of our ability to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience. 
Outside the U.S., we continue to make good progress with Repatha's reimbursement negotiations on a country-by-country basis. In Europe, we are now in early launches in several countries including Germany, Netherlands, Spain, the U.K., Austria and Sweden. 
Repatha is an extremely important medicine for high-risk cardiovascular patients. we are committed to realizing its significant potential over time.
now to Kyprolis where we've made great progress in the quarter. we continue to grow volume in an intensely competitive environment with 3 new competitors, all approved in the U.S. late last year. This growth is encouraging if we continue to educate physicians on the benefits of Kyprolis as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. Our focus is  was continuing to drive adoption of Kyprolis for relapsed patients both on the compelling ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data. 
The early launches from our European organization into second line are very encouraging. Kyprolis has been well received, and we continue to get reimbursement approval country by country. The EU label include kyprolis in both a-3 drug regimen based on the ASPIRE data as well as a 2-drug regimen on the ENDEAVOR data. 
In summary, the second quarter was another strong quarter for Amgen. Our growth products led the way, while we defended our mature products. We've made good progress on bringing the launch products to more patients in both existing and new countries. And we remain convinced about the long-term growth potential of our launch brands and are working intensely to ensure their success. 
Let me close by recognizing that none of this would have been possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for their commitment to delivering for patients. Let me now pass to Sean"

We continue to make good progress in advancing our pipeline in both innovative and biosimilar molecules. 
Let me begin with cardiovascular. We don't believe that there is any compelling evidence that supports treating high-risk patients with anything but aggressive LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy. Our approach with Repatha differs from that taken by the other PCSK9 inhibitors in that we only maximally inhibit PCSK9 in LDL cholesterol. Our clinical program demonstrated that we could achieve this effect with either 140 milligrams of Repatha delivered every other week, or 420 milligrams delivered monthly. as is reflected in our label, these 2 dosing schedules were clinically equivalent. Now that we've received approval in the United States for the innovative Pushtronics delivery system, we can offer patients the choice of an autoinjector for every other week, or single monthly dosing ministration with Pushtronics. 
As we announced last month, we expect the results from our Phase III cardiovascular outcome study to be available in 1Q of 2017, in time for submission to the American College of Cardiology meeting in March. I would remind you that this is an event-driven study and at the time we'd included excess of 85% of the requisite events, which allowed us more accurately predict the timing for the study completion. This is a large study with 27,500 patients, and we remain focused on generating the most robust data set possible in this field from an analysis of the completed study.  Ahead of this, we also expect the coronary imaging study results later this year, which we expect to complement the cardiovascular outcomes data. 
In heart failure, after discussions with regulators on [indiscernible], our novel cardiac myosin activator from Cytokinetics, we have submitted our heart failure outcome study protocol for Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, with FDA and continue to work with our partners for advancing this novel therapy. 
Turning to oncology, we are pleased to receive European approval for kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone in the relapsed refractory multiple myeloma setting based on ENDEAVOR data. In the first-line setting, we're conducting [indiscernible  in approximately 900 patients head-to-head superiority study of Kyprolis versus Velcade, both administered with [indiscernible] in transplant -- ineligible subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. This has a primary endpoint of progression-free survival. Based on the current event rates, we now expect the primary analysis and top line results of the completed study in the second half of this year. 
Before I leave multiple myeloma, I'd like to remind you that we remain on track to complete our Phase III study of XGEVA versus [indiscernible] in the prevention of skeletal-related events.
In the quarter, we announced that FDAD had granted priority review status to BLINCYTO for the treatment of pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed refractory ALL with a PDUFA date of September. In the adult population, we had the opportunity last month ASCO to present the results of our confirmatory Phase III study of BLINCYTO. In this study, BLINCYTO demonstrated AN almost twofold increase in median overall survival compared to the standard of care. We will be discussing these data with regulators as we seek conversion to full approval in our current indication. 
As we announced last week with our partners at UCB, we have submitted our romosozumab to FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture. We'll be presenting the data from the pivotal Phase III frame study at the annual meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research in September. And we look forward to sharing results with the medical community. 
Recall, we're also running a Phase IIIs fracture study of romosozumab compared to [indiscernible] which will contribute to our submission in Europe, and we expect these data in 2017. 
Prolia later this year, we will be reviewing the data from our Phase III study in the setting of [indiscernible], a relatively small but medically important indication. 
Our neuroscience programs continues to advance. In our migraine collaboration with Novartis, we were pleased to receive positive results from [indiscernible] or AMG 334, CPRP receptor antibody in our Phase IIb chronic migraine study. These data will be presented at the European Headache and Migraine Interventional Congress in September. This was a large robust study. And we believe that these data, together with our 2 Phase III studies in episodic migraine reading out later this year, could support registration in some jurisdictions. We intend to seek both indications in our initial submission.
other clinical migraine program is our PAK1 anybody, AMG 301, which is currently proceeding nicely through Phase I development. PAK1 is a receptor for PAK [indiscernible, a neuropeptide migraine. We believe that AMG 301 has the potential to be additive or synergistic to [indiscernible], given that PAK1 is mechanistically differentiated from CGRP. And we're therefore pursuing concept of biospecific PAK1 CGRP receptor antibody as well. 
our nephrology franchise, we continue to work with regulators on our applications and look forward to our PDUFA DATE in the U.S. next month. [indiscernible] provides an opportunity to offer a novel intravenous option that's administered by health care providers 3x a week, coincident with the patient's dialysis session. [indiscernible] will be the first therapy approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in over a decade. 
Finally within our biosimilars program, last week we announced results from our Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of [indiscernible] compared to trastuzumab for patients with positive early breast cancer. Based on the overall bioanalytics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity we believe there are no clinically meaningful differences between AVP 98 and trastuzumab. we look forward to discussing these data with regulators. 
As always, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for continued advancement of important new medicines for patients around the world. Bob?"

[Audio Gap]
introduction of our next generation biomanufacturing. So generally, the trend is positive. We see that reflected
[Audio Gap]
consolidated our manufacturing activity to try to improve the efficiency. And you're now seeing that coming through into the results. So what we are pursuing here in both studies is the hypothesis that as we continue to lower LDL, the relationship between LDL and outcomes will be maintained that we've observed with statin therapy over the last 20 years. And within the dimension, there has been a clear relationship between the lowering of LDL and the volume of plaque. And that linear relationship looks remarkably similar to the one that you see when you look at outcomes versus LDL. And there is an relationship between that type of effect, and it all does tie together. And I think that we would be expecting to see conceptually, we believe that the benefits that are observed both perspective back on slowing the progression of plaque volume or causing regression of plaque volume as well as in the outcomes dimension. these are all mediated in the case of statins by the lowering of LDL cholesterol. So we expect in pound for pound, if you will, with the LDL cholesterol-lowering, we will see very similar sort of results. So I think those are the hypotheses we're testing through with the 2 studies."

You're seeing a very consistent result because you're maxing out the impact that's inhibiting CGRP [indiscernible] in migraine. So that's nice to see.

And I think then the devil gets into the details really around the issue of how easily administer [indiscernible] is that particular amount of antibodies? there's going to be certain milligram amount of an antibody that has to be administered, let's say.

You look at the progress we're making, which by the end of this year, we expect to be delivering $1.1 million improvement on our cost base versus 2013.

The second point I'd make is we're exactly, as of midyear 2016, now we're halfway through the period through 2018.

I would like to particularly extend a warm welcome to those who are new in their investment coverage of Amgen, including Ronny Gal and Vincent Chen of Bernstein.
Our second quarter once again is a continuation of great execution of how we are effectively managing the life cycle of legacy products while launching new products. Of course, there is much more to our execution. So to have that broader discussion, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, who will lead the call with the strategic overview. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Following David, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter; followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We should have plenty of time for Q&A after Sean's comments.
So before I turn the call over to Bob, I would like to note that we have reviewed the Security and Exchange Commission's recent guidance regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and our press release incorporates this revised guidance. As in the past, we will use slides for presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email.
We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information, which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results. And reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, our Form 8-K and also the Investor Relations section of our website.
Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation are forward-looking statements, and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?"

Thank you, Arvind, and thank you all for joining our call. Our business continues to perform well, as you can see through the results of the first 6 months of the year with our revenues up 8% and our adjusted earnings per share up 13%.
While delivering strong and consistent quarter-to-quarter performance, we're also investing successfully for the long term, and the elements of our long-term strategy for growth are clearly progressing as well. We launched 6 new products last year, 2 in the cardiovascular arena and 4 in cancer, and these products are still in the early stages of their launch cycle globally.
We remain particularly excited about the long-term prospects of Repatha and look forward to important clinical data set to emerge later this year and early next year, which we think will help fully illuminate the value of this product. Kyprolis is also a top priority. Based on the very strong clinical profile of Kyprolis, we expect this product to be a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy for the foreseeable future and, as such, for it to be used in combination with many of the new agents that are emerging in the field. Both of these products are making progress internationally with additional regulatory approvals and reimbursement negotiations proceeding well.
Behind the recent launches of our 6 drugs for cardiovascular disease and cancer, we have programs nearing key regulatory milestones in 4 other therapeutic areas: neurology where we are excited about erenumab as a potential first-in-class therapy for migraine; bone health where we recently submitted our bone-building romosozumab to FDA for a regulatory review; nephrology with the prospect of an imminent launch of Parsabiv; and of course, in inflammation where we were pleased with recent FDA panel review of our biosimilar to HUMIRA.
With an expected 80 new launches across countries and products this year and the recent reacquisition of rights to many of our existing products outside the United States, we're meaningfully expanding our global footprint. To that end, we recently announced that we have partnered with Daiichi Sankyo in an effort to bring Amgen biosimilars to the Japanese market.
I'd also note we're excited about the scientific progress we're making in our early research labs. For example, we continue to harness the power of our human genetics platform to uncover fundamental links to human disease. As you saw this quarter, we published research pointing to the role of the ASGR1 gene in cardiovascular disease. While this is still early stage, it highlights our unique ability to generate insights like this and to move them forward quickly in the drug development process. We expect insights such as this to be central to our ability to innovate and continue to deliver long-term growth and returns for our shareholders.
While we're focused on the long term, we're committed to delivering in the short and medium term as well. Our consistent strong performance has placed us well on our way towards delivering long-term commitments we made to shareholders for 2018. The transformation program, which we began some 2 years ago, continues to deliver savings, enabling us to invest in our business and deliver results for our shareholders. Similarly, the commitment we made to effectively manage the life cycle of our legacy products is bearing fruit as reflected in the success of our Neulasta Onpro launch and the success that we're having in offering Aranesp and EPOGEN to our dialysis customers.
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're active and looking for ways to build our business across our 6 therapeutic focus areas. And we expect to be patient and disciplined in looking for opportunities that we think we could add value, too, for our shareholders.
Before passing to our Chief Financial Officer, David Meline, let me just thank our staff worldwide for their ongoing dedication to our mission of serving patients and for the results they once more delivered for our shareholders.
David?"

Turning to the second quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, revenues of $5.7 billion grew 6% year-over-year with 5% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Other revenues",849,"Okay, thanks, Bob.  Turning to the second quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, revenues of $5.7 billion grew 6% year-over-year with 5% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Other revenues at $214 million increased $69 million versus the second quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited from higher Ibrance royalty income as well as an upfront partner payment. As a reminder, we receive an 8% royalty on Ibrance revenue, which was acquired as part of the Onyx transaction. Changes in foreign exchange had an immaterial impact on total revenue and product sales in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income at $2.8 billion grew 10% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 51.4% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. In 2016, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of incremental gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year, with half of incremental gross efficiency savings from the transformation occurring in the first half. Delivering on this transformation enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities, while also achieving solid profitability.
On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales at 13.5% improved by 1.6 points driven by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling price. Research and development expenses at $878 million decreased by 4% versus last year driven primarily by transformation and process improvement efforts and lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs. SG&A expenses increased 13% on a year-over-year basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches for the U.S. and global launch activities were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year.
Other income and expenses were a net $176 million expense in Q2. This is an increase of $97 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year net expense increase was primarily due to gains in the second quarter of 2015 from our strategic and venture investment portfolio. We expect our other income and expenses to continue at the current year-to-date trend level.
The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, a 1.4 point decrease versus Q2 of 2015. This decrease reflects discrete benefits associated with tax incentives and the adoption of accounting standards 2016-09 partially offset by unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings.
Non-GAAP net income increased 9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $3.2 billion in the second quarter of 2015. This year-over-year decline reflects timing impacts of income tax payments to the IRS and cash gains realized last year from foreign exchange contracts, which benefited from a strengthened U.S. dollar.
We have -- we deployed a $0.6 billion to repurchase 3.9 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $153 per share and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. Additionally, our second quarter dividend was $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year, which results in a dividend yield of over 2.5% on an annualized basis. At the end of the second quarter, we had $3.6 billion remaining on our board-authorized share buyback program.
Cash and investments totaled $35 billion, an increase of $5 billion from last year's second quarter level. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow and the first quarter debt issuance of $2.9 billion, of which, approximately $900 million was used to repay debt maturities during the second quarter.
Our debt balance stands at $33.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and an average maturity of 12 years.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects continued conviction in executing on our strategy and solid first half performance of the business. In particular, our overall revenue guidance reflects our recent launch product activities plus continued progress on our growth brands, which grew 13% year-over-year in Q2 and accounted for over 50% overall product sales. All of this is while absorbing the impact of the competition on our legacy EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN brands.
With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion versus prior guidance of $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion. And our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $11.10 to $11.40 a share versus prior guidance of $10.85 to $11.20.
Finally, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% and capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #10. We continued our strong performance in the second quarter with the global product sales growing 5% year-over-year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-",1239,"Thanks, David. You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #10. We continued our strong performance in the second quarter with the global product sales growing 5% year-over-year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-year growth, and our international business grew 3% or 5% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Europe was a strong contributor with 11% unit growth.
My comments will be in 3 parts today: first, the performance of our growth products; followed by an update of our life cycle management for the mature brands; and then I'll conclude with highlights on the performance by newly launched products.
Our 6 growth products, Prolia, XGEVA, Enbrel, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate, continued to drive our overall performance with 13% year-over-year growth. And as David said, they aggregated to $3 billion of sales or over 50% of second quarter sales. We continue our investments in these brands to achieve their full potential. Both Prolia and XGEVA are now annualizing at over $3 billion per year. 
Prolia grew 30% year-over-year with a 24% unit growth and continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe. Postmenopausal osteoporosis remains a widely untreated disease. In the U.S. alone, 10 million people are affected, and 4.5 million of those are considered at high risk of fracture. Unfortunately, nearly 60% of these patients are not treated. We're investing in Prolia to reach these unserved patients and also to remind current Prolia patients about the importance of returning every 6 months for their treatment.
XGEVA saw a 15% year-over-year growth driven by unit share gains around 2 percentage points in both the U.S. and Europe. Quarter-over-quarter growth was negatively impacted by heavier purchasing from some larger end customers in the U.S.
Enbrel grew 10% year-over-year driven by changes in net selling price, partially offset by competition. As a reminder, changes in net selling price comprise several components, including changes in list price as well as the impact from rebates we provide to payers and formulary decisions.
Turning now to the underlying performance of Enbrel. Growth within both rheumatology and dermatology segments continues. Sequentially, Enbrel lost 2 points of value share in each segment. Recall that rheumatology comprises about 80% of Enbrel sales. Enbrel has a long track record of safety, efficacy and a very competitive profile. We are focused on maintaining our position, particularly in the rheumatology segment.
Sensipar grew 13% year-over-year driven by net selling price as well as a strong unit growth in the U.S. and Europe. We look forward to expanding our presence in the nephrology. Market was positive, which is currently being reviewed by the U.S. and European regulators as a new treatment option for secondary hyperthyroidism.
Next, Vectibix. We delivered strong unit growth in our core markets. However, this performance was masked by comparing against a quarter 2 in 2015 that benefits from an additional shipment to our Japanese partners.
Nplate grew 14% year-over-year driven by double-digit unit growth.
I'd now like to focus on how we're managing the life cycle of our mature brands. Neulasta sales decreased 1% year-over-year. The second quarter was negatively impacted by heavier purchasing by some large end customers in the U.S. in the first quarter. I'm pleased to report that the Neulasta Onpro delivery kit continued its strong uptake. Adoption is growing due to its ability to ensure maximum benefit of Neulasta while improving the patient experience versus the traditional prefilled syringe. We exited the second quarter with Onpro representing about 40% of Neulasta units and still growing. We do not expect long-acting filgrastim biosimilar competition this year, so there remains a significant opportunity to further increase the adoption of Onpro.
As regards to NEUPOGEN, we see the short-acting segment playing out as expected. We ended the second quarter with around 60% share. We continue to compete account by account, emphasizing NEUPOGEN's sustained track record of safety, efficacy and, of course, reliable supply.
Now to DSOs. Aranesp sales increased 5% year-over-year driven by 13% unit growth. In the U.S., we've been successfully transitioning about 75% of patients from EPOGEN to Aranesp in our medium-sized and independent dialysis centers.
EPOGEN declined 33% year-on-year. About 1/3 of this decline is a shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting I just mentioned. Most of the remaining decline is due to a shift by Fresenius from Amgen ESAs to their own product. We understand that Fresenius, which has about 1/3 of the U.S. dialysis business, has converted about 80% of their patients. You'll recall that our contract with DaVita will represent another 1/3 of the dialysis business, runs through 2018. We do not expect biosimilar competition against EPOGEN in 2016.
Lastly, I'd like to update you on Repatha and Kyprolis. Both products represent substantial opportunities in addressing serious diseases with significant unmet needs. First, Repatha. Our cardiovascular teams have executed well on the marketplace. The strict utilization management criteria and processes employed by the insurers and PBMs continues to be the biggest hurdle. We are working diligently to address these restrictions, so the pro-fit [ph] patients are able to access the treatment their doctors prescribed for them. We look forward to the coronary imaging data from the CLARION [ph] study reading out later this year and then the FOURIER outcome data in the first quarter of 2017. We expect that both these studies will further underscore the value of Repatha.
We're also excited to now offer a new monthly dosing treatment option with our recently approved Repatha Pushtronex, the first and only single monthly injection of a PCSK9 inhibitor. Like the Neulasta Onpro delivery kit, this is another example of our ability to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience.
Outside the U.S., we continue to make good progress with Repatha's reimbursement negotiations on a country-by-country basis. In Europe, we are now in early launches in several countries, including Germany, Netherlands, Spain, the U.K., Austria and Sweden.
Repatha is an extremely important medicine for high-risk cardiovascular patients, and we are committed to realizing its significant potential over time.
Now to Kyprolis where we've made great progress in the quarter. We continue to grow volume in an intensely competitive environment with 3 new competitors, all approved in the U.S. late last year. This growth is encouraging as we continue to educate physicians on the benefits of Kyprolis as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. Our focus is on continuing to drive adoption of Kyprolis for relapsed patients based on the compelling ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data.
The early launches from our European organization into second line are very encouraging. Kyprolis has been well received, and we continue to gain reimbursement approval country by country. The EU label now includes Kyprolis in both a 3-drug regimen based on the ASPIRE data as well as a 2-drug regimen based on the ENDEAVOR data.
In summary, the second quarter was another strong quarter for Amgen. Our growth products led the way, while we defended our mature products. We've made good progress on bringing new launch products to more patients in both existing and new countries. And we remain convinced about the long-term growth potential of our launch brands and are working intensely to ensure their success.
Let me close by recognizing that none of this would have been possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for their commitment to delivering for patients. Let me now pass you to Sean."

We continue to make good progress advancing our pipeline of both innovative and biosimilar molecules. Let me begin with cardiovascular. We don't believe there is any compelling evidence that supports treating high-risk atherosclerotic patients with anything but aggressive LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy. Our approach with Repatha differs from that taken by the other market at PCSK9 inhibitor, and that we only maximally inhibit PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol. Our clinical program demonstrated that we could achieve this effect with either 140 milligrams of Repatha delivered every other week or 420 milligrams delivered monthly. And as is reflected in our label, these 2 dosing schedules were clinically equivalent. Now that we've received the approval in the United States for the innovative Pushtronex delivery system, we can offer patients the choice of an autoinjector 10 for every other week or single monthly dose administration with Pushtronex.
As we announced last month, we expect the results from our Phase III cardiovascular outcome study to be available in 1Q of 2017, in time for submission to the American College of Cardiology meeting in March. I would remind you that this is an event-driven study, and at the time, we'd included an excess of 85% of the requisite events, which allowed us more to accurately predict the timing for the study completion. This is a large study at 27,500 patients, and we remain focused on generating the most robust data set possible in this field from an analysis of the completed study. Ahead of this, we also expect the coronary imaging study results later this year, which we expect to complement the cardiovascular outcomes data.
In heart failure, after discussions with regulators on omecamtiv mecarbil, our novel cardiac myosin activator from Cytokinetics, we have submitted our heart failure outcome study protocol for Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, to FDA and continue to work with our partners toward advancing this novel therapy.
Turning to oncology, we were pleased to receive European approval for Kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone in the relapsed refractory multiple myeloma setting based on the ENDEAVOR data. In the first-line setting, we're conducting CLARION in approximately 900 patients head-to-head superiority study of Kyprolis versus Velcade, both administered concomitantly with melphalan and prednisone in transplant-ineligible subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. This has a primary endpoint of progression-free survival. Based on the current event rates, we now expect the primary analysis and top line results of the completed study in the second half of this year.
Before I leave multiple myeloma, I'd like to remind you that we remain on track to complete our Phase III study of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid in the prevention of skeletal-related events.
In the quarter, we announced that FDA had granted priority review status to BLINCYTO for the treatment of pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed refractory ALL with a PDUFA action date of September. In the adult population, we had the opportunity last month at ASCO to present the results of our confirmatory Phase III study of BLINCYTO. In this study, BLINCYTO demonstrated an almost twofold increase in median overall survival compared to the standard of care. We will be discussing these data with regulators as we seek conversion to full approval in our current indication.
As we announced last week, along with our partners at UCB, we have submitted our romosozumab BLA to FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture. We'll be presenting the data from the pivotal Phase III FRAME study at the annual meeting of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research in September. And we look forward to sharing the results with the medical community.
Recall, we're also running a Phase III fracture study of romosozumab compared to alendronate, which will contribute to our submission in Europe, and we expect these data in 2017.
For Prolia, later this year, we will be reviewing the data from our Phase III study in the setting of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, a relatively small but medically important indication.
Our neuroscience programs continue to advance. In our migraine collaboration with Novartis, we were pleased to receive positive results from erenumab, or AMG 334, our CGRP receptor antibody in our Phase IIb chronic migraine study. These data will be presented at the European Headache and Migraine Trust Interventional Congress (sic) [ European Headache
And Migraine Trust International Congress ] in September. This was a large robust study, and we believe that these data, together with our 2 Phase III studies in episodic migraine reading out later this year, could support registration in some jurisdictions. So we intend to seek both indications in our initial submission.
Our other clinical migraine program is our PAK1 anybody, AMG 301, which is currently proceeding nicely through Phase I development. PAK1 is a receptor for PAK CAP [ph], a neuropeptide implicated in migraine. We believe that AMG 301 has the potential to be additive or synergistic to erenumab given that PAK1 is mechanistically differentiated from CGRP. And we're, therefore, pursuing the concept of a biospecific PAK1 CGRP receptor antibody as well.
In our nephrology franchise, we continue to work with regulators on our Parsabiv applications and look forward to our PDUFA date in the U.S. next month. Parsabiv provides an opportunity to offer a novel intravenous calcimimetic option that's administered by health care providers 3x a week, coincident with the patient's dialysis session. Parsabiv will be the first therapy approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in over a decade.
Finally, within our biosimilars program, last week, we announced results from our Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 980 compared to trastuzumab, or Herceptin, in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Based on the overall bioanalytics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity, we believe there are no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 980 and trastuzumab. And we look forward to discussing these data with regulators.
As always, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued advancement of important new medicines for patients around the world.

SO what we're seeing is we -- as you would know, we consolidated our manufacturing activity to try to improve the efficiency, and you're now seeing that coming through into the results. So what we're pursuing here in both studies is the hypothesis that as we continue to lower LDL, the relationship between LDL and outcomes will be maintained that we've observed with statin therapy over the last 20 years. And within the IVUS dimension, there has been a clear relationship between the lowering of LDL and the volume of plaque. And that linear relationship looks remarkably similar to the one that you see when you look at outcomes versus LDL. And there is a known relationship between that IVUS type of effect and outcome. So it all does tie together, and I think that we would be expecting to see conceptually what we believe that the benefits that are observed both with respect to impact on slowing the progression of plaque volume or causing regression of plaque volume as well as in the outcomes dimension, that these are all mediated in the case of statins by the lowering of LDL cholesterol. So we expect that pound for pound, if you will, with the LDL, cholesterol lowering, we will see very similar sort of results. So I think those are the hypotheses we're testing through -- with the 2 studies."

What I would say again, and I kind of just made this comment, that when you look at what's going on where mainly companies have been driving for proof of concept and/or dose ranging their products, they used doses of either small molecules, ligand sequestering antibody or receptor antibodies, in our case, that are saturating the system. And when you -- when that happens, that's how I'll cross all these different studies across different companies and so on. You're seeing a very consistent result because you're maxing out the impact that's inhibiting CGRP can have in migraine. So that's nice to see. And then really, it comes down to the question of what is the minimal dose that's effective in achieving that affect. And I think then the devil gets into the details really around the issue of how easily administered poll [ph] is that particular amount of antibodies. So there's going to be a certain milligram amount of an antibody that has to be administered, let's say.

As you know, Sensipar has been extremely successful in treating patients both in the U.S. and around the world. But in spite of the efficacy of Sensipar, we probably only have about a 26% penetration. Compliance or patient persistency in this particular market is always an issue to ensure patients who are on dialysis 3x a week and if you take their tablets every day as well. Parsabiv brings a combination of potentially a better level of persistency because you're being infused while you're having your dialysis. But the second thing, as I've just seen from the clinical data, in fact, there appear to be a much more robust level of efficacy of Parsabiv. CMS have granted us a 2-year period that this product will exist outside the bundle, while they determine the medical value to determine the value of putting it back in the bundle. So we continue to be excited about the product. There are patients who will take -- our older patients will take an injectable, and we'll see how many patients we can assist with both products. As regards to Repatha, very little usage at the moment on the monthly dose. We have not had a patient-friendly dose up until now. There appear to be a fair amount of patients who would prefer to have a convenient once-a-month dose.

I would like to particularly extend a warm welcome to those who are new in their investment coverage of Amgen, including Ronny Gal and Vincent Chen of Bernstein.
Our second quarter once again is a continuation of great execution of how we are effectively managing the life cycle of legacy products while launching new products. Of course, there is much more to our execution. So to have that broader discussion, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, who will lead the call with a strategic overview. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Following David, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter; followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We should have plenty of time for Q&A after Sean's comments.
So before I turn the call over to Bob, I would like to note that we have reviewed the Security and Exchange Commission's recent guidance regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and our press release incorporates this revised guidance. As in the past, we will use slides for presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email.
We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results. And reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, our Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation are forward-looking statements, and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?"

Thank you, Arvind, and thank you all for joining our call. Our business continues to perform well, as you can see through the results of the first 6 months of the year with our revenues up 8% and our adjusted earnings per share up 13%.
While delivering strong and consistent quarter-to-quarter performance, we're also investing successfully for the long term, and the elements of our long-term strategy for growth are clearly progressing as well. We launched 6 new products last year, 2 in the cardiovascular arena and 4 in cancer, and these products are still in the early stages of their launch cycle globally.
We remain particularly excited about the long-term prospects of Repatha and look forward to important clinical data set to emerge later this year and early next year, which we think will help fully illuminate the value of this product. Kyprolis is also a top priority. Based on the very strong clinical profile of Kyprolis, we expect this product to be a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy for the foreseeable future and, as such, for it to be used in combination with many of the new agents that are emerging in the field. Both of these products are making progress internationally with additional regulatory approvals and reimbursement negotiations proceeding well.
Behind the recent launches of our 6 drugs for cardiovascular disease and cancer, we have programs nearing key regulatory milestones in 4 other therapeutic areas: neurology, where we are excited about erenumab as a potential first-in-class therapy for migraine; bone health, where we recently submitted our bone-building romosozumab to FDA for a regulatory review; nephrology, with the prospect of an imminent launch of Parsabiv; and of course, in inflammation, where we were pleased with the recent FDA panel review of our biosimilar to HUMIRA.
With an expected 80 new launches across countries and products this year and the recent reacquisition of rights to many of our existing products outside the United States, we're meaningfully expanding our global footprint. To that end, we recently announced that we have partnered with Daiichi Sankyo in an effort to bring Amgen biosimilars to the Japanese market.
I'd also note that we're excited about the scientific progress we're making in our early research labs. For example, we continue to harness the power of our human genetics platform to uncover fundamental links to human disease. As you saw this quarter, we published research pointing to the role of the ASGR1 gene in cardiovascular disease. While this is still early stage, it highlights our unique ability to generate insights like this and to move them forward quickly in the drug development process. We expect insights such as this to be central to our ability to innovate and continue to deliver long-term growth and returns for our shareholders.
While we're focused on the long term, we're committed to delivering in the short and medium term as well. Our consistent strong performance has placed us well on our way towards delivering long-term commitments we made to shareholders for 2018. The transformation program, which we began some 2 years ago, continues to deliver savings, enabling us to invest in our business and deliver results for our shareholders. Similarly, the commitment we made to effectively manage the life cycle of our legacy products is bearing fruit as reflected in the success of our Neulasta Onpro launch and the success that we're having in offering Aranesp and EPOGEN to our dialysis customers.
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're active and looking for ways to build our business across our 6 therapeutic focus areas. And we expect to be patient and disciplined in looking for opportunities that we think we could add value to for our shareholders.
Before passing to our Chief Financial Officer, David Meline, let me just thank our staff worldwide for their ongoing dedication to our mission of serving patients and for the results they once more delivered for our shareholders.

Turning to the second quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, revenues at $5.7 billion grew 6% year-over-year with 5% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Other revenues",847,"Okay, thanks, Bob. Turning to the second quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, revenues at $5.7 billion grew 6% year-over-year with 5% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Other revenues at $214 million increased $69 million versus the second quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited from higher Ibrance royalty income as well as an upfront partner payment. As a reminder, we receive an 8% royalty on Ibrance revenue, which was acquired as part of the Onyx transaction. Changes in foreign exchange had an immaterial impact on total revenue and product sales in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income at $2.8 billion grew 10% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 51.4% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. In 2016, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of incremental gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year, with half of incremental gross efficiency savings from the transformation occurring in the first half. Delivering on this transformation enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities, while also achieving solid profitability.
On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales at 13.5% improved by 1.6 points driven by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling price. Research and development expenses at $878 million decreased by 4% versus last year driven primarily by transformation and process improvement efforts and lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs. SG&A expenses increased 13% on a year-over-year basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches for the U.S. and global launch activities were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year.
Other income and expenses were a net $176 million expense in Q2. This is an increase of $97 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year net expense increase was primarily due to gains in the second quarter of 2015 from our strategic and venture investment portfolio. We expect our other income and expenses to continue at the current year-to-date trend level.
The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, a 1.4-point decrease versus Q2 of 2015. This decrease reflects discrete benefits associated with tax incentives and the adoption of accounting standards 2016-09 partially offset by unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings.
Non-GAAP net income increased 9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $3.2 billion in the second quarter of 2015. This year-over-year decline reflects timing impacts of income tax payments to the IRS and cash gains realized last year from foreign exchange contracts, which benefited from a strengthened U.S. dollar.
We have -- we deployed $0.6 billion to repurchase 3.9 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $153 per share and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. Additionally, our second quarter dividend was $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year, which results in a dividend yield of over 2.5% on an annualized basis. At the end of the second quarter, we had $3.6 billion remaining on our board-authorized share buyback program.
Cash and investments totaled $35 billion, an increase of $5 billion from last year's second quarter level. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow and the first quarter debt issuance of $2.9 billion, of which, approximately $900 million was used to repay debt maturities during the second quarter.
Our debt balance stands at $33.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and an average maturity of 12 years.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects continued conviction in executing on our strategy and solid first half performance of the business. In particular, our overall revenue guidance reflects our recent product launch activities plus continued progress on our growth brands, which grew 13% year-over-year in Q2 and accounted for over 50% overall product sales. All of this is while absorbing the impact of the competition on our legacy EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN brands.
With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion versus prior guidance of $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion. And our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $11.10 to $11.40 a share versus prior guidance of $10.85 to $11.20.
Finally, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% and capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #10. We continued our strong performance in the second quarter with the global product sales growing 5% year-over-year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-",1238,"Thanks, David. You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #10. We continued our strong performance in the second quarter with the global product sales growing 5% year-over-year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-year growth, and our international business grew 3% or 5% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Europe was a strong contributor with 11% unit growth.
My comments will be in 3 parts today: first, the performance of our growth products; followed by an update of our life cycle management for the mature brands; and then I'll conclude with highlights on the performance by newly launched products.
Our 6 growth products, Prolia, XGEVA, Enbrel, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate, continued to drive our overall performance with 13% year-over-year growth. And as David said, they aggregated to $3 billion of sales or over 50% of second quarter sales. We continue our investments in these brands to achieve their full potential. Both Prolia and XGEVA are now annualizing at over $3 billion per year. 
Prolia grew 30% year-over-year with a 24% unit growth and continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe. Postmenopausal osteoporosis remains a widely untreated disease. In the U.S. alone, 10 million people are affected, and 4.5 million of those are considered at high risk of fracture. Unfortunately, nearly 60% of these patients are not treated. We're investing in Prolia to reach these unserved patients and also to remind current Prolia patients about the importance of returning every 6 months for their treatment.
XGEVA saw a 15% year-over-year growth driven by unit share gains around 2 percentage points in both the U.S. and Europe. Quarter-over-quarter growth was negatively impacted by heavier purchasing from some larger end customers in the U.S.
Enbrel grew 10% year-over-year driven by changes in net selling price, partially offset by competition. As a reminder, changes in net selling price comprise several components, including changes in list price as well as the impact from rebates we provide to payers and formulary decisions.
Turning now to the underlying performance of Enbrel. Growth within both rheumatology and dermatology segments continues. Sequentially, Enbrel lost 2 points of value share in each segment. Recall that rheumatology comprises about 80% of Enbrel sales. Enbrel has a long track record of safety, efficacy and a very competitive profile. We are focused on maintaining our position, particularly in the rheumatology segment.
Sensipar grew 13% year-over-year driven by net selling price as well as a strong unit growth in the U.S. and Europe. We look forward to expanding our presence in the nephrology. Market was positive, which is currently being reviewed by the U.S. and European regulators as a new treatment option for secondary hyperthyroidism.
Next, Vectibix. We delivered strong unit growth in our core markets. However, this performance was masked by comparing against a quarter 2 in 2015 that benefits from an additional shipment to our Japanese partners.
Nplate grew 14% year-over-year driven by double-digit unit growth.
I'd now like to focus on how we're managing the life cycle of our mature brands. Neulasta sales decreased 1% year-over-year. The second quarter was negatively impacted by heavier purchasing by some large end customers in the U.S. in the first quarter. I'm pleased to report that the Neulasta Onpro delivery kit continued its strong uptake. Adoption is growing due to its ability to ensure maximum benefit of Neulasta while improving the patient experience versus the traditional prefilled syringe. We exited the second quarter with Onpro representing about 40% of Neulasta units and still growing. We do not expect long-acting filgrastim biosimilar competition this year, so there remains a significant opportunity to further increase the adoption of Onpro.
As regards to NEUPOGEN, we see the short-acting segment playing out as expected. We ended the second quarter with around 60% share. We continue to compete account by account, emphasizing NEUPOGEN's sustained track record of safety, efficacy and, of course, reliable supply.
Now to DSOs. Aranesp sales increased 5% year-over-year driven by 13% unit growth. In the U.S., we've been successfully transitioning about 75% of patients from EPOGEN to Aranesp in our medium-sized and independent dialysis centers.
EPOGEN declined 33% year-on-year. About 1/3 of this decline is a shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting I just mentioned. Most of the remaining decline is due to a shift by Fresenius from Amgen ESAs to their own product. We understand that Fresenius, which has about 1/3 of the U.S. dialysis business, has converted about 80% of their patients. You'll recall that our contract with DaVita, who represent another 1/3 of the dialysis business, runs through 2018. We do not expect biosimilar competition against EPOGEN in 2016.
Lastly, I'd like to update you on Repatha and Kyprolis. Both products represent substantial opportunities in addressing serious diseases with significant unmet needs. First, Repatha. Our cardiovascular teams have executed well in the marketplace. The strict utilization management criteria and processes employed by the insurers and PBMs continues to be the biggest hurdle. We are working diligently to address these restrictions, so the appropriate patients are able to access the treatment their doctors prescribed for them. We look forward to the coronary imaging data from the Glaxo [ph] study reading out later this year and then the FOURIER outcome data in the first quarter of 2017. We expect that both these studies will further underscore the value of Repatha.
We're also excited to now offer a new monthly dosing treatment option with our recently approved Repatha Pushtronex, the first and only single monthly injection of a PCSK9 inhibitor. Like the Neulasta Onpro delivery kit, this is another example of our ability to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience.
Outside the U.S., we continue to make good progress with Repatha's reimbursement negotiations on a country-by-country basis. In Europe, we are now in early launches in several countries, including Germany, Netherlands, Spain, the U.K., Austria and Sweden.
Repatha is an extremely important medicine for high-risk cardiovascular patients, and we are committed to realizing its significant potential over time.
Now to Kyprolis where we've made great progress in the quarter. We continue to grow volume in an intensely competitive environment with 3 new competitors, all approved in the U.S. late last year. This growth is encouraging as we continue to educate physicians on the benefits of Kyprolis as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. Our focus is on continuing to drive adoption of Kyprolis in relapsed patients based on the compelling ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data.
The early launches from our European organization into second line are very encouraging. Kyprolis has been well received, and we continue to gain reimbursement approval country by country. The EU label now includes Kyprolis in both a 3-drug regimen based on the ASPIRE data as well as a 2-drug regimen based on the ENDEAVOR data.
In summary, the second quarter was another strong quarter for Amgen. Our growth products led the way, while we defended our mature products. We've made good progress on bringing new launch products to more patients in both existing and new countries. And we remain convinced about the long-term growth potential of our launch brands and are working intensely to ensure their success.
Let me close by recognizing that none of this would have been possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for their commitment to delivering for patients. Let me now pass you to Sean."

We continue to make good progress advancing our pipeline of both innovative and biosimilar molecules. Let me begin with cardiovascular. We don't believe there is any compelling evidence that supports treating high-risk atherosclerotic patients with anything but aggressive LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy. Our approach with Repatha differs from that taken by the other marketed PCSK9 inhibitor in that we only maximally inhibit PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol. Our clinical program demonstrated that we could achieve this effect with either 140 milligrams of Repatha delivered every other week or 420 milligrams delivered monthly. And as is reflected in our label, these 2 dosing schedules were clinically equivalent. Now that we've received approval in the United States for the innovative Pushtronex delivery system, we can offer patients the choice of an autoinjector pen for every other week or single monthly dose administration with Pushtronex.
As we announced last month, we expect the results from our Phase III cardiovascular outcome study to be available in 1Q of 2017, in time for submission to the American College of Cardiology meeting in March. I would remind you that this is an event-driven study, and at the time, we recruited in excess of 85% of the requisite events, which allowed us more to accurately predict the timing for the study completion. This is a large study at 27,500 patients, and we remain focused on generating the most robust data set possible in this field from an analysis of the completed study. Ahead of this, we also expect the coronary imaging study results later this year, which we expect to complement the cardiovascular outcomes data.
In heart failure, after discussions with regulators on omecamtiv mecarbil, our novel cardiac myosin activator from Cytokinetics, we have submitted our heart failure outcome study protocol for Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, to FDA and continue to work with our partners toward advancing this novel therapy.
Turning to oncology, we were pleased to receive European approval for Kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone in the relapsed refractory multiple myeloma setting based on the ENDEAVOR data. In the first-line setting, we're conducting CLARION in approximately 900 patients head-to-head superiority study of Kyprolis versus Velcade, both administered concomitantly with melphalan and prednisone in transplant-ineligible subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. This has a primary endpoint of progression-free survival. Based on the current event rates, we now expect the primary analysis and top line results of the completed study in the second half of this year.
Before I leave multiple myeloma, I'd like to remind you that we remain on track to complete our Phase III study of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid in the prevention of skeletal-related events.
In the quarter, we announced that FDA had granted priority review status to BLINCYTO for the treatment of pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed refractory ALL with a PDUFA action date of September. In the adult population, we had the opportunity last month at ASCO to present the results of our confirmatory Phase III study of BLINCYTO. In this study, BLINCYTO demonstrated an almost twofold increase in median overall survival compared to the standard of care. We will be discussing these data with regulators as we seek conversion to full approval in our current indication.
As we announced last week, along with our partners at UCB, we have submitted our romosozumab BLA to FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture. We'll be presenting the data from the pivotal Phase III FRAME study at the annual meeting of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research in September. And we look forward to sharing the results with the medical community.
Recall, we're also running a Phase III fracture study of romosozumab compared to alendronate, which will contribute to our submission in Europe, and we expect these data in 2017.
For Prolia, later this year, we will be reviewing the data from our Phase III study in the setting of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, a relatively small but medically important indication.
Our neuroscience programs continue to advance. In our migraine collaboration with Novartis, we were pleased to receive positive results from erenumab, or AMG 334, our CGRP receptor antibody in our Phase IIb chronic migraine study. These data will be presented at the European Headache and Migraine Trust Interventional Congress (sic) [ European Headache And Migraine Trust International Congress ] in September. This was a large robust study, and we believe that these data, together with our 2 Phase III studies in episodic migraine reading out later this year, could support registration in some jurisdictions. So we intend to seek both indications in our initial submission.
Our other clinical migraine program is our PAK1 antibody, AMG 301, which is currently proceeding nicely through Phase I development. PAK1 is a receptor for PAK CAP [ph], a neuropeptide implicated in migraine. We believe that AMG 301 has the potential to be additive or synergistic to erenumab given that PAK1 is mechanistically differentiated from CGRP. And we're, therefore, pursuing the concept of a biospecific PAK1 CGRP receptor antibody as well.
In our nephrology franchise, we continue to work with regulators on our Parsabiv applications and look forward to our PDUFA date in the U.S. next month. Parsabiv provides an opportunity to offer a novel intravenous calcimimetic option that's administered by health care providers 3x a week, coincident with the patient's dialysis session. Parsabiv will be the first therapy approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in over a decade.
Finally, within our biosimilars program, last week, we announced results from our Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 980 compared to trastuzumab, or Herceptin, in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Based on the overall bioanalytics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity, we believe there are no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 980 and trastuzumab. And we look forward to discussing these data with regulators.
As always, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued advancement of important new medicines for patients around the world.

So what we're seeing is we -- as you would know, we consolidated our manufacturing activity to try to improve the efficiency, and you're now seeing that coming through into the results. So what we're pursuing here in both studies is the hypothesis that as we continue to lower LDL, the relationship between LDL and outcomes will be maintained that we've observed with statin therapy over the last 20 years. And within the IVUS dimension, there has been a clear relationship between the lowering of LDL and the volume of plaque. And that linear relationship looks remarkably similar to the one that you see when you look at outcomes versus LDL. And there is a known relationship between that IVUS type of effect and outcome. So it all does tie together, and I think that we would be expecting to see conceptually what we believe that the benefits that are observed both with respect to impact on slowing the progression of plaque volume or causing regression of plaque volume as well as in the outcomes dimension, that these are all mediated in the case of statins by the lowering of LDL cholesterol. So we expect that pound for pound, if you will, with the LDL, cholesterol lowering, we will see very similar sort of results. So I think those are the hypotheses we're testing through -- with the 2 studies."

What I would say again, and I kind of just made this comment, that when you look at what's going on where mainly companies have been driving for proof of concept and/or dose ranging their products, they've used doses of either small molecules, ligand sequestering antibody or receptor antibodies, in our case, that are saturating the system. And when you -- when that happens, that's how across all these different studies across different companies and so on, you're seeing a very consistent result because you're maxing out the impact that's inhibiting CGRP can have in migraine. So that's nice to see. And then really, it comes down to the question of what is the minimal dose that's effective in achieving that affect. And I think then the devil gets into the details really around the issue of how easily administered a poll [ph] is that particular amount of antibodies. So there's going to be a certain milligram amount of an antibody that has to be administered, let's say.

Parsabiv brings a combination of potentially a better level of persistency because you're being infused while you're having your dialysis. But the second thing, as I've just seen from the clinical data, in fact, there appear to be a much more robust level of efficacy of Parsabiv. CMS have granted us a 2-year period that this product will exist outside the bundle, while they determine the medical value to determine the value of putting it back in the bundle.

As regards to Repatha, very little usage at the moment on the monthly dose. We have not had a patient-friendly dose up until now. There appear to be a fair amount of patients who would prefer to have a convenient once-a-month dose. And we're spending quite a bit of time talking to cardiologists about this, and we'll be coming to market in the next couple of weeks."

And I think the point is as we want to make sure we see everything that might be of interest to us, and I think we're seeing that, first of all, certainly, we're in a financial position to be able to be competitive. And then secondly, we're -- it's true. We're not the only people out there who are in the market looking for opportunities. So I think the point for us is we need to make sure that we, first of all, look at things as to the scientific insight that we can bring to bear, including with our insight from a human genetic perspective. And then secondly, we are very clear that we're going to be disciplined in terms of the financial returns that we can expect. And we're interested in doing deals that'll create returns for Amgen, not just the sellers.

You look at the progress we're making, which, by the end of this year, we expect to be delivering $1.1 million improvement on our cost base versus 2013. And we see us certainly achieving the $1.5 billion goal that we set out. Likewise, if you look at the progress on the margins where we started at a 38% margin in 2013, you've now seen us this quarter again deliver over 50%, on the way to 52% to 54%. So first of all, I'd say we're pleased with the progress where we're running the company on an agile and efficient manner while still investing significantly for the long-term health of the business. The second point I'd make is we're exactly, as of midyear 2016, now we're halfway through the period through 2018. And quite frankly, while we're making very good progress, I think it'd be a mistake for us to take our eye off the ball to continue to focus on delivering against those goals that we've set out for the company. So first and foremost, we're looking at delivering on those goals. And in due course, we'll be looking then in terms of the financial performance beyond that.

Our second quarter once again is a continuation of great execution of how we are effectively managing the life cycle of legacy products while launching new products. Of course, there is much more to our execution. So to have that broader discussion, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, who will lead the call with a strategic overview. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Following David, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter; followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We should have plenty of time for Q&A after Sean's comments.
So before I turn the call over to Bob, I would like to note that we have reviewed the Security and Exchange Commission's recent guidance regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and our press release incorporates this revised guidance. As in the past, we will use slides for presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email.
We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results. And reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, our Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation are forward-looking statements, and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.

We remain particularly excited about the long-term prospects of Repatha and look forward to important clinical data set to emerge later this year and early next year, which we think will help fully illuminate the value of this product. Kyprolis is also a top priority. Based on the very strong clinical profile of Kyprolis, we expect this product to be a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy for the foreseeable future and, as such, for it to be used in combination with many of the new agents that are emerging in the field. Both of these products are making progress internationally with additional regulatory approvals and reimbursement negotiations proceeding well.
Behind the recent launches of our 6 drugs for cardiovascular disease and cancer, we have programs nearing key regulatory milestones in 4 other therapeutic areas: neurology, where we are excited about erenumab as a potential first-in-class therapy for migraine; bone health, where we recently submitted our bone-building romosozumab to FDA for a regulatory review; nephrology, with the prospect of an imminent launch of Parsabiv; and of course, in inflammation, where we were pleased with the recent FDA panel review of our biosimilar to HUMIRA.
With an expected 80 new launches across countries and products this year and the recent reacquisition of rights to many of our existing products outside the United States, we're meaningfully expanding our global footprint. To that end, we recently announced that we have partnered with Daiichi Sankyo in an effort to bring Amgen biosimilars to the Japanese market.
I'd also note that we're excited about the scientific progress we're making in our early research labs. For example, we continue to harness the power of our human genetics platform to uncover fundamental links to human disease. As you saw this quarter, we published research pointing to the role of the ASGR1 gene in cardiovascular disease. While this is still early stage, it highlights our unique ability to generate insights like this and to move them forward quickly in the drug development process. We expect insights such as this to be central to our ability to innovate and continue to deliver long-term growth and returns for our shareholders.
While we're focused on the long term, we're committed to delivering in the short and medium term as well. Our consistent strong performance has placed us well on our way towards delivering long-term commitments we made to shareholders for 2018. The transformation program, which we began some 2 years ago, continues to deliver savings, enabling us to invest in our business and deliver results for our shareholders. Similarly, the commitment we made to effectively manage the life cycle of our legacy products is bearing fruit as reflected in the success of our Neulasta Onpro launch and the success that we're having in offering Aranesp and EPOGEN to our dialysis customers.
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're active and looking for ways to build our business across our 6 therapeutic focus areas. And we expect to be patient and disciplined in looking for opportunities that we think we could add value to for our shareholders.
Before passing to our Chief Financial Officer, David Meline, let me just thank our staff worldwide for their ongoing dedication to our mission of serving patients and for the results they once more delivered for our shareholders.

Turning to the second quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, revenues at $5.7 billion grew 6% year-over-year with 5% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Other revenues",847,"Okay, thanks, Bob. Turning to the second quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, revenues at $5.7 billion grew 6% year-over-year with 5% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Other revenues at $214 million increased $69 million versus the second quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited from higher Ibrance royalty income as well as an upfront partner payment. As a reminder, we receive an 8% royalty on Ibrance revenue, which was acquired as part of the Onyx transaction. Changes in foreign exchange had an immaterial impact on total revenue and product sales in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income at $2.8 billion grew 10% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 51.4% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. In 2016, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of incremental gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year, with half of incremental gross efficiency savings from the transformation occurring in the first half. Delivering on this transformation enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities, while also achieving solid profitability.
On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales at 13.5% improved by 1.6 points driven by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling price. Research and development expenses at $878 million decreased by 4% versus last year driven primarily by transformation and process improvement efforts and lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs. SG&A expenses increased 13% on a year-over-year basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches for the U.S. and global launch activities were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year.
Other income and expenses were a net $176 million expense in Q2. This is an increase of $97 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year net expense increase was primarily due to gains in the second quarter of 2015 from our strategic and venture investment portfolio. We expect our other income and expenses to continue at the current year-to-date trend level.
The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, a 1.4-point decrease versus Q2 of 2015. This decrease reflects discrete benefits associated with tax incentives and the adoption of accounting standards 2016-09 partially offset by unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings.
Non-GAAP net income increased 9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $3.2 billion in the second quarter of 2015. This year-over-year decline reflects timing impacts of income tax payments to the IRS and cash gains realized last year from foreign exchange contracts, which benefited from a strengthened U.S. dollar.
We have -- we deployed $0.6 billion to repurchase 3.9 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $153 per share and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. Additionally, our second quarter dividend was $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year, which results in a dividend yield of over 2.5% on an annualized basis. At the end of the second quarter, we had $3.6 billion remaining on our board-authorized share buyback program.
Cash and investments totaled $35 billion, an increase of $5 billion from last year's second quarter level. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow and the first quarter debt issuance of $2.9 billion, of which, approximately $900 million was used to repay debt maturities during the second quarter.
Our debt balance stands at $33.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and an average maturity of 12 years.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects continued conviction in executing on our strategy and solid first half performance of the business. In particular, our overall revenue guidance reflects our recent product launch activities plus continued progress on our growth brands, which grew 13% year-over-year in Q2 and accounted for over 50% overall product sales. All of this is while absorbing the impact of the competition on our legacy EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN brands.
With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion versus prior guidance of $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion. And our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $11.10 to $11.40 a share versus prior guidance of $10.85 to $11.20.
Finally, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% and capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #10. We continued our strong performance in the second quarter with the global product sales growing 5% year-over-year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-",1238,"Thanks, David. You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #10. We continued our strong performance in the second quarter with the global product sales growing 5% year-over-year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-year growth, and our international business grew 3% or 5% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Europe was a strong contributor with 11% unit growth.
My comments will be in 3 parts today: first, the performance of our growth products; followed by an update of our life cycle management for the mature brands; and then I'll conclude with highlights on the performance by newly launched products.
Our 6 growth products, Prolia, XGEVA, Enbrel, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate, continued to drive our overall performance with 13% year-over-year growth. And as David said, they aggregated to $3 billion of sales or over 50% of second quarter sales. We continue our investments in these brands to achieve their full potential. Both Prolia and XGEVA are now annualizing at over $3 billion per year. 
Prolia grew 30% year-over-year with a 24% unit growth and continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe. Postmenopausal osteoporosis remains a widely untreated disease. In the U.S. alone, 10 million people are affected, and 4.5 million of those are considered at high risk of fracture. Unfortunately, nearly 60% of these patients are not treated. We're investing in Prolia to reach these unserved patients and also to remind current Prolia patients about the importance of returning every 6 months for their treatment.
XGEVA saw a 15% year-over-year growth driven by unit share gains around 2 percentage points in both the U.S. and Europe. Quarter-over-quarter growth was negatively impacted by heavier purchasing from some larger end customers in the U.S.
Enbrel grew 10% year-over-year driven by changes in net selling price, partially offset by competition. As a reminder, changes in net selling price comprise several components, including changes in list price as well as the impact from rebates we provide to payers and formulary decisions.
Turning now to the underlying performance of Enbrel. Growth within both rheumatology and dermatology segments continues. Sequentially, Enbrel lost 2 points of value share in each segment. Recall that rheumatology comprises about 80% of Enbrel sales. Enbrel has a long track record of safety, efficacy and a very competitive profile. We are focused on maintaining our position, particularly in the rheumatology segment.
Sensipar grew 13% year-over-year driven by net selling price as well as a strong unit growth in the U.S. and Europe. We look forward to expanding our presence in the nephrology. Market was positive, which is currently being reviewed by the U.S. and European regulators as a new treatment option for secondary hyperthyroidism.
Next, Vectibix. We delivered strong unit growth in our core markets. However, this performance was masked by comparing against a quarter 2 in 2015 that benefits from an additional shipment to our Japanese partners.
Nplate grew 14% year-over-year driven by double-digit unit growth.
I'd now like to focus on how we're managing the life cycle of our mature brands. Neulasta sales decreased 1% year-over-year. The second quarter was negatively impacted by heavier purchasing by some large end customers in the U.S. in the first quarter. I'm pleased to report that the Neulasta Onpro delivery kit continued its strong uptake. Adoption is growing due to its ability to ensure maximum benefit of Neulasta while improving the patient experience versus the traditional prefilled syringe. We exited the second quarter with Onpro representing about 40% of Neulasta units and still growing. We do not expect long-acting filgrastim biosimilar competition this year, so there remains a significant opportunity to further increase the adoption of Onpro.
As regards to NEUPOGEN, we see the short-acting segment playing out as expected. We ended the second quarter with around 60% share. We continue to compete account by account, emphasizing NEUPOGEN's sustained track record of safety, efficacy and, of course, reliable supply.
Now to DSOs. Aranesp sales increased 5% year-over-year driven by 13% unit growth. In the U.S., we've been successfully transitioning about 75% of patients from EPOGEN to Aranesp in our medium-sized and independent dialysis centers.
EPOGEN declined 33% year-on-year. About 1/3 of this decline is a shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting I just mentioned. Most of the remaining decline is due to a shift by Fresenius from Amgen ESAs to their own product. We understand that Fresenius, which has about 1/3 of the U.S. dialysis business, has converted about 80% of their patients. You'll recall that our contract with DaVita, who represent another 1/3 of the dialysis business, runs through 2018. We do not expect biosimilar competition against EPOGEN in 2016.
Lastly, I'd like to update you on Repatha and Kyprolis. Both products represent substantial opportunities in addressing serious diseases with significant unmet needs. First, Repatha. Our cardiovascular teams have executed well in the marketplace. The strict utilization management criteria and processes employed by the insurers and PBMs continues to be the biggest hurdle. We are working diligently to address these restrictions, so the appropriate patients are able to access the treatment their doctors prescribed for them. We look forward to the coronary imaging data from the Glaxo [ph] study reading out later this year and then the FOURIER outcome data in the first quarter of 2017. We expect that both these studies will further underscore the value of Repatha.
We're also excited to now offer a new monthly dosing treatment option with our recently approved Repatha Pushtronex, the first and only single monthly injection of a PCSK9 inhibitor. Like the Neulasta Onpro delivery kit, this is another example of our ability to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience.
Outside the U.S., we continue to make good progress with Repatha's reimbursement negotiations on a country-by-country basis. In Europe, we are now in early launches in several countries, including Germany, Netherlands, Spain, the U.K., Austria and Sweden.
Repatha is an extremely important medicine for high-risk cardiovascular patients, and we are committed to realizing its significant potential over time.
Now to Kyprolis where we've made great progress in the quarter. We continue to grow volume in an intensely competitive environment with 3 new competitors, all approved in the U.S. late last year. This growth is encouraging as we continue to educate physicians on the benefits of Kyprolis as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. Our focus is on continuing to drive adoption of Kyprolis in relapsed patients based on the compelling ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data.
The early launches from our European organization into second line are very encouraging. Kyprolis has been well received, and we continue to gain reimbursement approval country by country. The EU label now includes Kyprolis in both a 3-drug regimen based on the ASPIRE data as well as a 2-drug regimen based on the ENDEAVOR data.
In summary, the second quarter was another strong quarter for Amgen. Our growth products led the way, while we defended our mature products. We've made good progress on bringing new launch products to more patients in both existing and new countries. And we remain convinced about the long-term growth potential of our launch brands and are working intensely to ensure their success.
Let me close by recognizing that none of this would have been possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for their commitment to delivering for patients. Let me now pass you to Sean."
24816,374183326,1015139,"Amgen Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We continue to make good progress advancing our pipeline of both innovative and biosimilar molecules. Let me begin with cardiovascular.

We continue to make good progress advancing our pipeline of both innovative and biosimilar molecules. Let me begin with cardiovascular. We don't believe there is any compelling evidence that supports treating high-risk atherosclerotic patients with anything but aggressive LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy. Our approach with Repatha differs from that taken by the other marketed PCSK9 inhibitor in that we only maximally inhibit PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol. Our clinical program demonstrated that we could achieve this effect with either 140 milligrams of Repatha delivered every other week or 420 milligrams delivered monthly. And as is reflected in our label, these 2 dosing schedules were clinically equivalent. Now that we've received approval in the United States for the innovative Pushtronex delivery system, we can offer patients the choice of an autoinjector pen for every other week or single monthly dose administration with Pushtronex.
As we announced last month, we expect the results from our Phase III cardiovascular outcome study to be available in 1Q of 2017, in time for submission to the American College of Cardiology meeting in March. I would remind you that this is an event-driven study, and at the time, we recruited in excess of 85% of the requisite events, which allowed us more to accurately predict the timing for the study completion. This is a large study at 27,500 patients, and we remain focused on generating the most robust data set possible in this field from an analysis of the completed study. Ahead of this, we also expect the coronary imaging study results later this year, which we expect to complement the cardiovascular outcomes data.
In heart failure, after discussions with regulators on omecamtiv mecarbil, our novel cardiac myosin activator from Cytokinetics, we have submitted our heart failure outcome study protocol for Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, to FDA and continue to work with our partners toward advancing this novel therapy.
Turning to oncology, we were pleased to receive European approval for Kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone in the relapsed refractory multiple myeloma setting based on the ENDEAVOR data. In the first-line setting, we're conducting CLARION in approximately 900 patients head-to-head superiority study of Kyprolis versus Velcade, both administered concomitantly with melphalan and prednisone in transplant-ineligible subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. This has a primary endpoint of progression-free survival. Based on the current event rates, we now expect the primary analysis and top line results of the completed study in the second half of this year.
Before I leave multiple myeloma, I'd like to remind you that we remain on track to complete our Phase III study of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid in the prevention of skeletal-related events.
In the quarter, we announced that FDA had granted priority review status to BLINCYTO for the treatment of pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed refractory ALL with a PDUFA action date of September. In the adult population, we had the opportunity last month at ASCO to present the results of our confirmatory Phase III study of BLINCYTO. In this study, BLINCYTO demonstrated an almost twofold increase in median overall survival compared to the standard of care. We will be discussing these data with regulators as we seek conversion to full approval in our current indication.
As we announced last week, along with our partners at UCB, we have submitted our romosozumab BLA to FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture. We'll be presenting the data from the pivotal Phase III FRAME study at the annual meeting of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research in September. And we look forward to sharing the results with the medical community.
Recall, we're also running a Phase III fracture study of romosozumab compared to alendronate, which will contribute to our submission in Europe, and we expect these data in 2017.
For Prolia, later this year, we will be reviewing the data from our Phase III study in the setting of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, a relatively small but medically important indication.
Our neuroscience programs continue to advance. In our migraine collaboration with Novartis, we were pleased to receive positive results from erenumab, or AMG 334, our CGRP receptor antibody in our Phase IIb chronic migraine study. These data will be presented at the European Headache and Migraine Trust Interventional Congress (sic) [ European Headache And Migraine Trust International Congress ] in September. This was a large robust study, and we believe that these data, together with our 2 Phase III studies in episodic migraine reading out later this year, could support registration in some jurisdictions. So we intend to seek both indications in our initial submission.
Our other clinical migraine program is our PAK1 antibody, AMG 301, which is currently proceeding nicely through Phase I development. PAK1 is a receptor for PAK CAP [ph], a neuropeptide implicated in migraine. We believe that AMG 301 has the potential to be additive or synergistic to erenumab given that PAK1 is mechanistically differentiated from CGRP. And we're, therefore, pursuing the concept of a biospecific PAK1 CGRP receptor antibody as well.
In our nephrology franchise, we continue to work with regulators on our Parsabiv applications and look forward to our PDUFA date in the U.S. next month. Parsabiv provides an opportunity to offer a novel intravenous calcimimetic option that's administered by health care providers 3x a week, coincident with the patient's dialysis session. Parsabiv will be the first therapy approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in over a decade.
Finally, within our biosimilars program, last week, we announced results from our Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 980 compared to trastuzumab, or Herceptin, in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Based on the overall bioanalytics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity, we believe there are no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 980 and trastuzumab. And we look forward to discussing these data with regulators.
As always, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued advancement of important new medicines for patients around the world.

So what we're seeing is we -- as you would know, we consolidated our manufacturing activity to try to improve the efficiency, and you're now seeing that coming through into the results. So what we're pursuing here in both studies is the hypothesis that as we continue to lower LDL, the relationship between LDL and outcomes will be maintained that we've observed with statin therapy over the last 20 years. And within the IVUS dimension, there has been a clear relationship between the lowering of LDL and the volume of plaque. And that linear relationship looks remarkably similar to the one that you see when you look at outcomes versus LDL. And there is a known relationship between that IVUS type of effect and outcome. So it all does tie together, and I think that we would be expecting to see conceptually what we believe that the benefits that are observed both with respect to impact on slowing the progression of plaque volume or causing regression of plaque volume as well as in the outcomes dimension, that these are all mediated in the case of statins by the lowering of LDL cholesterol. So we expect that pound for pound, if you will, with the LDL, cholesterol lowering, we will see very similar sort of results. So I think those are the hypotheses we're testing through -- with the 2 studies."

Over time, we think those can be an important source of growth and revenue opportunity for us at Amgen. We think that our commitment to developing these biosimilars reflects our belief that the capabilities we have established for our innovative business will lend themselves well to developing a branded biosimilar portfolio as well. The next step for us on the 3 that are in the advanced regulatory stages is the same path for each of the 3. It starts with needing to get a regulatory approval, so we hope and expect that we'll have an opportunity to get a regulatory approval for our first, which is the biosimilar to HUMIRA at the end of -- or later this year. And with the benefit of that and with that approval in hand, we'll turn to the questions of commercialization as we will for the other 2. So first thing we need to do is get approvals, and that's what we're working on securing right now. As to your question about revenue profile and what we're going to do, we will wait and comment on those issues at the appropriate time, Matthew."

In the episodic migraine setting, of course, the baseline number of headache days are by definition less, but the treatment effect is still quite robust and reproducible. And I think that's been the case. It's kind of within the world of neuroscience products quite remarkable when you look at the data across the small molecules that have been entered into the space, the ligand sequestering antibodies and erenumab that you would see a remarkably consistent treatment effect. One comment I'd make is that it's -- the case that this treatment effect is robust, it's reproducible, but there also is quite a large kind of a placebo effect that patients get

What I would say again, and I kind of just made this comment, that when you look at what's going on where mainly companies have been driving for proof of concept and/or dose ranging their products, they've used doses of either small molecules, ligand sequestering antibody or receptor antibodies, in our case, that are saturating the system. And when you -- when that happens, that's how across all these different studies across different companies and so on, you're seeing a very consistent result because you're maxing out the impact that's inhibiting CGRP can have in migraine. So that's nice to see. And then really, it comes down to the question of what is the minimal dose that's effective in achieving that affect. And I think then the devil gets into the details really around the issue of how easily administered a poll [ph] is that particular amount of antibodies. So there's going to be a certain milligram amount of an antibody that has to be administered, let's say. We believe a monthly subcutaneous disposable autoinjector would be a very nice solution to this otherwise healthy active type of population. And so that's -- but -- and I think that others, of course, are pursuing strategies that are different than that. And I think it'll be just -- it'll be interesting, obviously, to see how that all plays out. Tony, you could comment. But I think scientifically, I have not seen any data that suggest that these products are different from one another with respect to what they can achieve when they are dosed and saturating upon."

As you know, Sensipar has been extremely successful in treating patients both in the U.S. and around the world. But in spite of the efficacy of Sensipar, we probably only have about a 26% penetration. Compliance or patient persistency in this particular market is always an issue to ensure patients who are on dialysis 3x a week and if you take their tablets every day as well. Parsabiv brings a combination of potentially a better level of persistency because you're being infused while you're having your dialysis. But the second thing, as I've just seen from the clinical data, in fact, there appear to be a much more robust level of efficacy of Parsabiv. CMS have granted us a 2-year period that this product will exist outside the bundle, while they determine the medical value to determine the value of putting it back in the bundle. So we continue to be excited about the product. There are patients who will take -- our older patients will take an injectable, and we'll see how many patients we can assist with both products. As regards to Repatha, very little usage at the moment on the monthly dose. We have not had a patient-friendly dose up until now. There appear to be a fair amount of patients who would prefer to have a convenient once-a-month dose. And we're spending quite a bit of time talking to cardiologists about this, and we'll be coming to market in the next couple of weeks."

So performance during the quarter is best characterized by considerable operating leverage as earnings growth well exceeded revenue growth. We successfully executed on our life cycle management strategies for older products while continuing to make up for to make our new product launches a success. To discuss our performance in greater detail, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, who will make some introductory comments. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Following David, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter; followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We should have plenty of time for Q&A after Sean's comments.
As in the past, we will use slides for our presentation today which have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedule accompanying today's press release, our Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.
So just a reminder that some of the statements major in the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements, and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.

Our business has performed well through the first 9 months of the year and we continue to make progress in delivering our strategy for long-term growth. At the heart of our strategy is innovation. And as as you can see once again",1188,"Okay. Thank you, Arvind. Our business has performed well through the first 9 months of the year and we continue to make progress in delivering our strategy for long-term growth. At the heart of our strategy is innovation. And as as you can see once again in the third quarter, we enjoyed strong unit volume growth for a number of our newer innovative products including Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate. As international expansion is an important objective for us, it's worth noting as well that our unit volumes grew 12% outside of the U.S. And with respect to that 12%, recognized that the competition for our legacy products began much earlier outside of the U.S. than inside, so what you see in these numbers are the strong demand for our new innovative medicines emerging internationally. Our transformation program, which we announced over 2 years ago, is foundational for our long-term objectives and we have achieved momentum in that effort as evidenced in this quarter's results with operating leveraged across all of our business, enabling us to grow our earnings well ahead of revenues and deliver nearly 53% operating margin.
And just as importantly, the transformation is improving our agility, which shows up in our ability to move a program like erenumab to market ahead of competition and in our ability to rapidly adopt the changing demands in the marketplace as we've done in the dialysis market with our long acting Aranesp.
I've said for some time that the strength of our legacy franchises is reflected in our durable cash flows. This quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Stable cash flow like this enables us to invest for the long term both internally and externally while at the same time, returning significant cash to our shareholders. We continue to invest globally in the long-term success of our newly launched products which we expect will generate meaningful revenues over time. In cardiovascular, the Phase III results from our recent Repatha coronary imaging study constitute 1 more success in our clinical development program for this molecule. This study demonstrates the powerful effect of Repatha on sclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries, the major underlying cause of cardiovascular disease and the leading cause of death worldwide. This is especially impressive considering that these results were generated on top of maximized statin therapy. Cardiovascular outcomes data, which are expected in the first quarter next year, will obviously be important for Repatha and should definitively establish the importance of this therapy for those at risk at cardiovascular disease.
In oncology, the Neulasta Onpro kit continues to impress the doctors in the marketplace and this has proven to be a very successful launch. Multiple myeloma is a rapidly changing field where we've proven Kyprolis to be the superior inhibitor for relapsed multiple myeloma patients. We're focused on growing Kyprolis in this important segment around the world and early launch results in Europe are encouraging, especially in Germany.
With respect to our innovative pipeline, our focus remains on addressing unmet medical needs with innovative medicines that make a big difference for patients.
Our next wave of new medicines is set to do just that. In neuroscience, we've already reported successful pivotal studies with our migraine medicine, erenumab, in both chronic and episodic migraine. This is a potentially life-changing medicine for migraine sufferers and we're pleased to be in the lead position in the CGRP class.
Rounding out our franchise in bone health, we recently shared more clnical data on our noble bone-building agent romosozumab. Experts in the field are excited about the potential of romosozumab and we look forward to our PDUFA date in July.
In biosimilars, AMJEVITA, which is of course our; biosimilar to adalimumab, is our first approval among the many biosimilar programs that we expect will help generate long-term growth in Amgen. As you know, we're in litigation with over AMJEVITA and it's safe to say that there will be more litigation before there's a launch. Given the pace of that litigation, it's unlikely that this matter will be clarified in time for us to launch in 2017.
We've also successfully completed Phase III studies in 2 more biosimilars and look forward to their regulatory progress.
While talking about R&D, I want to say also a few words about the healthcare debate in the United States. I think it's obvious that this debate is not going to dissipate anytime soon and that all of us in the community must work together to find more affordable healthcare solutions.
But as we seek to do that, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that if the economic and societal burden of disease, that is the enemy. An innovative biopharmaceutical drugs are for the promise of addressing that burden.
We're at the dawn of a very exciting era for innovation. We see that today in cancer, we see it an in cardiovascular medicine and I think it you see it in Alzheimer's and other devastating illnesses as well. But for advance promising new medicines, we'll have to do that with an eye to both the price and the value of these therapies. And we must do it in a way that maintains role of physicians in making the best decisions for patients.
We price our products to offer strong value proposition for patients, payers and providers. We believe that differentiated efficacy of our products enables us to take leading role in our industry in structuring value-based partnerships for our medicines. We accept that our products need to deliver clear benefit for our customers and accept that we shouldn't be rewarded when they do not.
We have value-based contracts in place with a number of payers already and expect to do more. While the regulatory environment is complex in this area today, making each individual contract challenging and time-consuming tape it in place, we expect to see more and more value-based contracts arise as one of the ways of enabling more patients to gain access in the right innovative medicines for their ailments at the right time. We don't have all the solutions obviously at Amgen but we're committed to working with others to address challenges and improve the short and long-term health of our society as a whole.
Shifting gears, we have a strong balance sheet and the flexibility and willingness to invest in external innovation. We're active in our review of opportunities, principally in our core therapeutic categories and we're disciplined as to the price that we'll pay for assets.
Of late, we have seen better opportunities to create value with earlier stage assets. For example, in immuno-oncology, which is, of course, a focus area for us. We expanded our arsenal during the quarter with the collaboration with Advaxis, as well as through the reacquisition of Mike molecule through the BMCA target for multiple myeloma from Boehringer Ingelheim. We also expanded our cardiovascular franchise with an early-stage collaboration with Arrowhead.
Wrapping up, I'd offer that the long-term prospects of our business are bright and I want to thank our teams around the world for their continuing focus on serving patients. David?"

This quarter, we saw heavy product sales performance anniversary-ing against the strong third quarter compassion last year. Other revenues at $295 million, increased $88 million versus the third quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited primarily from milestone payments, notably a milestone received related to the approval of Kyprolis in Japan.
Changes in foreign exchange had a less than a 1% negative impact to total revenue and product sales in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating income at $2.9 billion, grew 9% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by over 4 points to 52.9% for the quarter, reflecting continued revenue performance and favorable expense impacts from a transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories are per on a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 0.5 points to 13%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling price, partially offset by product mix.
Research and development expenses at $963 million decreased by 11% versus last year, driven primarily by lower spending required to support certain late-stage clinical programs and transformation and process improvement efforts, partially offset by increases in upfront payments for several in-licensing transactions.
SG&A expenses increased 1% on a year-over-year basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches, primarily in international markets, were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% year-over-year. Other income and expenses were a net $109 million expense in Q3. This is favorable by $38 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year favorability was primarily due to gains in the third quarter through rebalancing our investment portfolio. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, a 0.9-point increase versus Q3 of 2015. This increase reflects unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings, offset by the benefit of the federal R&D credit in 2016.
Non-GAAP net income increased 9% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2015. We deployed $0.7 billion to repurchase 4.4 million shares in the quarter. Our year-to-date repurchases now total $2 billion at an average of $157 per share.
We continue to plan on repurchases of up to $3 billion in total this year. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year.
In October 2016, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the share repurchase authorization to $5 billion. Cash and investments totaled $38 billion, [ph] an increase of approximately $7  billion [ph] from last year's third quarter level. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow and the net effect of the third quarter debt issuance. Our debt balance stands at $35.3 billion as of September 30. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 12 years. Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on Page 8.
We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance which reflects continued conviction in executing on our strategy and business performance through the first 3 quarters of this year.
As a reminder, we expect to see an increase in operating expenses in Q4 versus Q3 reflecting the typical pattern for the business. With respect to our updated guidance, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.6 billion to $22.8 billion versus prior guidance of $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion. And our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $11.40 to $11.55 per share versus prior guidance of $11.10 to $11.40. Finally, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% and capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.
In summary, our performance in 2016 remains on track. In this regard, we will be providing 2017 guidance in our January call. We continue to be on track to meet our commitments through 2018 [ph] based on our balanced portfolio of launch, growth and legacy products along with steady progress in the expenses due to our transformation efforts.

Our total revenues increased 2% year-over-year as we continue to drive strong volume growth, as Bob said, across several important brands including Prolia, Sensip",1293,"Thank you, David, and you'll find a summary about performance in third quarter on Slide #10. Our total revenues increased 2% year-over-year as we continue to drive strong volume growth, as Bob said, across several important brands including Prolia, Sensipar, XGEVA, Nplate and Vectibix. And we're bringing on our new products, notably Kyprolis and Repatha to multi in more markets. These gains were offset by declines by our legacy products primarily due to competition, along with the negative impact in changes in inventory levels. In the U.S., our product sales declined 1% year-over-year and internationally, product sales grew 12% or 7% including -- excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This performance were fueled by 12% volume growth. Let me start with an update on how we're executing the life cycle management strategies across our mature brands beginning with Neulasta. Neulasta treat cancer patients who had risk of [indiscernible]. Each year, around 100,000 patients in the U.S. are hospitalized due to potentially fear on [indiscernible] . Not only are these hospitalizations costly to our healthcare system and potentially devastating to patients, but they also result in potential excessive use of broad spectrum antibiotics, which can contribute to hospital-based antibiotic resistance. This is a prime example of how our innovative medicines can deliver value to the healthcare system. Year-over-year, Neulasta declined 5% due to a small segment complex in the U.S. along with increased competition in our international business.
We continue to see strong performance from our Onpro delivery kit to the U.S. and are on track to exit 2016 at close to 40% market share.
The Onpro delivery kit is a clear example of our commitment to innovation to improve the quality of patient care throughout their products life cycle.
Onpro improves the patient experience by eliminating the need to return to a doctor's office the day after chemotherapy for Neulasta injection. This translates to increased value for providers, patients and payers. We expect adoption of this device to continue. The short-acting pegfilgrastim market in the U.S. continue to behave as expected with the entrance of [indiscernible] biosimilar in September last year. NEUPOGEN declined 36% year-over-year mainly due to this competition. We continue to compete account by account and hold 55% of the short-acting market as we exit the third quarter. Turning to our ESA business. Aranesp increased 8% year-over-year, mainly due to growth in the U.S. dialysis segment. We have successfully transitioned over 80% of the ESA used in independent and midsize dialysis centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. We don't expect much further transition to Aranesp moving forward.
EPOGEN declined 31% year-over-year, the largest driver was conversion to by Fresenius, which began in earnest in the fourth quarter of 2015. We don't expect the short-acting biosimilar entrant until late next year at the earliest.
Now to Enbrel. With segment growth remain strong in both rheumatology and dermatology, our primary focus is in rheumatology which represents in excess of 80% of our business, where Enbrel offers a very effective efficacy and safety profile, as well as a strong economic value. Enbrel [indiscernible] year-over-year driven by several factors. Firstly, volume decline due to increased competition. Sequentially, our value-based as we maintain share in rheumatology and lost 1 percentage point to dermatology. Competition in these segments continues to intensify.
Secondly, we experienced a negative impact from changes in inventory levels. Both of these dynamics were offset by positive changes in net selling price. You'll recall the changes in net selling price comprised several components, including changes to list price, as well as impacts from rebates we provide to payers including those related to the former decisions.
Enbrel is another example of our focus on innovation where we continue to pursue additional indications, including 1 chronic moderate to severe psoriasis. We're also investing in mobile delivery systems to help patients with chronic inflammatory diseases to more excessively and efficiently inject themselves and ensure optimal therapy over the treatment period. We will continue to compete on a payer contracting basis to maximize patient access to Enbrel. In a highly competitive markets, PBMs can require incremental rebase from us in order for us to maintain our former positioning.
Maintaining our former positioning is essential to ensure patients and access to a drug like Enbrel which have the longest in-market history of efficacy and safety. Given this dynamic and present on track negotiations, we expect relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017. Sensipar grew 18% year-over-year driven by net selling price and strong unit growth globally. We look forward to positive European approval and are working with the FDA to obtain our approval in the U.S. Prolia delivered strong growth of 18% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw the typical seasonality in quarter 3 with a decline of 14%. Prolia remains an important growth driver and we continue to invest to realize its full potential.
Prolia growth continue to nearly 20% in both the U.S. and the E.U. as we continue to capture share across these markets.
XGEVA showed continued volume growth of about 7% year-on-year and we were pleased to see the recent results of the successful Phase III trial with XGEVA in multiple myeloma.
About half of the patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma will develop renal impairment, limiting the options for [indiscernible] events. We look forward to bringing XGEVA to these patients who until recently had no other option.
Parsabiv and Nplate continue to deliver double-digit growth driven mainly by volume gains. also benefited from this quarter from shipments Japanese partner, which can fluctuate throughout the year.
Let me now turn to our launch products, mostly Repatha and Kyprolis. Both products represent substantial opportunities as they address serious diseases with significant unmet needs. Starting with our cardiovascular franchise. [indiscernible] helped us to establish our presence in cardiovascular space and better understand the cardiology community. was approved to prevent rehospitalization, one of the single largest cost in health care system, and that offers a strong value proposition for chronic heart failure patients. It is also now be included in the heart failure guidelines. Nonetheless, sales have been modest to date as it faces steep payer hurdles.
We do not expect a dramatic change in this trend in the near future. As for Repatha, we are working with payers and providers to allow unlabeled patient access. You have seen some minor improvements in the utilization management criteria but high hurdles remain for both physicians and patients to gain access. We are very pleased with the Repatha [indiscernible] results which Sean will discuss in a moment. We believe that [indiscernible] along with the expected positive outcomes data from the Prolia data or the [indiscernible] study in the first quarter 2017 will certainly strengthen Repatha's value proposition.
We look forward to having these data included in our label.
Now to Kyprolis. Kyprolis grew 34% year-over-year as we see strong early uptake from key markets in Europe, combined with continued growth in the U.S. In Europe, Kyprolis grew 30% year-over-year. Multiple myeloma is a dynamic market with the entrance of the new competitors. In the U.S., we've lost some share in the third line plus as a result of these new entrants. However, we expect further inhibition to remain foundational therapy and we continue to grow and generate volume growth in second line as this segment grows and patients are treated longer.
We are focused on growing our second line based on the strongest client and in the metadata. Both arrangement, and ENDEAVOR have been recognized as preferred regimen for second-line treatment in the recently updated NCCN guidelines.
Let me close by thanking our customer-facing teams around the world. Their focus on longevity to continue delivering to patients through this highly dynamic environment is inspirational. Let me now pass it to Sean."

We continue to make very good progress in the third quarter with numerous regulatory and pipeline milestones. I'll begin my review with cardiovascular. In September, we received results from our intervascular ultrasound study in patients with coronary artery disease on intensive statin therapy with the primary and secondary endpoints from them. From a scientific standpoint, a clear demonstration of a length between the PCSK9 mechanism action in lowering LDL cholesterol and a reduction in [indiscernible] in patients already treated with intensive statin therapy is truly groundbreaking.
We look forward to the presentation of these results at the American Heart Association meetings in New Orleans on November 15 where we will also be hosting an Investor event.
We're on track to view the results from our cardiovascular outcome study in the first quarter of next year and anticipate having the date and time for presentation of the American Collegiate Cardiology annual meeting in March.
In heart failure, we reached agreement with the FDA on the key elements of our Phase III cardiovascular outcome study through a special protocol assessment. This study will enroll approximately 8,000 chronic heart failure patients which reduce injection fraction with a primary endpoint of time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure event.
We're finalizing some of the details of the protocol with global regulators and anticipated enrolling patients early next year. While [indiscernible] is being developed in collaboration with kinetics and [indiscernible].
In an earlier stage cardiovascular programs, we've recently announced the licensing and collaboration agreements with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize RNA interference therapies for LTAA and another undisclosed target. [indiscernible] is a target we have gain great confidence in through advanced genetic analysis performed in [indiscernible]. We have also recently entered the clinic with an exciting new molecule for heart failure. And our ASGR 1 program in sclerosis continue to move forward in this preclinical phase.
Turning to oncology. I'll begin with Kyprolis. In Q3, we received the results of the study which we have the opportunity to discuss at length our in conference call. I would stress that we are committed to advancing Kyprolis into the first-line therapy and we're close to finalizing a study design focused on the combination of Kyprolis, Revlimid and on in transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients where we have seen very encouraging data from large investigators sponsor studies. In fact, today, many of the thought leaders in the field considered KRD a standard of care for first-line patients.
We're also exploring other combinations studies including some of the newer therapies and we're currently in discussions with Janssen to co-fund the study of [indiscernible] in combination with erenumab and for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We're also currently supplying their Phase Ib sales combination study.
Before leaving Kyprolis, I'm pleased to report we've completed enrollment in the Phase III study of weekly demonstration in the third-line setting and expect those results next year.
We're also advancing a reformulated to molecule into the clinic in order to rapidly and definitively assess the potential to develop an inhibitor with the benefit risk profile that would be superior to existing oral therapy. We recently have the opportunity to review the results of the study of XGEVA in the prevention of bone complications in the multiple myeloma population and we're pleased to report the study met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to [indiscernible] acid in the time to grow scalable-related events. This was expected. The efficacy was similar between the agents, but in addition, the renal safety profile, particularly important in the multiple myeloma population, favored the XGEVA arm. Recall that XGEVA is not currently indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in the multiple myeloma population and we look forward to discussing label updates before the regulators. In our immuno-oncology program, our CD19 continues to make a meaningful impact on the lives of certain ALL patients. And in 3Q, the FDA expanded the indication to include the pediatric setting. The addition of a noble immunotherapy like is an important advancement to these patients with the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies can lead to long-term consequences such as secondary malignancies.
We're also initiating several Phase III studies of [indiscernible] and non-Hodgkin lymphoma including our previously announced combination study with Merck's PD1 inhibitor. As we investigate the potential for in combination with other immunotherapies, we recently had the opportunity to present encouraging data from an interim analysis of our Phase II study in combination with [indiscernible] at the European cancer meetings a. In summary, the data suggests that the combination of [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] has greater efficacy than either agent alone in stage 3D for myeloma patients without any additional safety burden. This study is expected to complete later this year and will be submitted presentation at the medical meeting in 2017.
Our combinations of studies have been in logic with active PD-1 antibody continue to enroll. We also we acquired the rights to a new for 20, of Phase 1 by contrast directed against the cell maturation antigen or BCMA, a multiple myeloma target that is licensed to Boehringer Ingelheim prior to our acquisition of Micromet. And finally, we announced the preclinical collaboration with Advaxis on a unique innovative and bespoke approach to generating immune responses against patient-specific [indiscernible].
In our bone health programs, a Phase III study of Prolia compared with [indiscernible] in patients receiving treatment met all primary and secondary endpoints induced osteoporosis is a small and medically important indication for men and women, often under the care of rheumatologists. And we will discuss and with update with the regulators soon.
Last month, data from the romosozumab Phase III placebo-controlled fracture study, FRAME, was presented at the American Society of Bone and Research and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Feedback from the bone community was very positive and there's a clear desire for new innovative anabolic therapies for the treatment of osteoporosis.
FDA has accepted our romosozumab file and along with our partners, UCB, we look forward to continued interaction as we work toward our July '17 PDUFA date. We also expect to conduct the primary analysis of the Phase III active control fracture study, ARCH, in the first half of next year. In neuroscience, we continue to advance our CGRP receptor antibody erenumab for migraine prophylaxis in collaboration with Novartis.
We successfully completed the first 2 Phase III studies in the episodic migraine setting. 70 milligrams of subcutaneous erenumab administered monthly resulted in the statistically and clinically significant reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days with a safety profile similar to placebo. We'll see the results in the second Phase III study in episodic migraine by the end of this year. We also presented the positive results from our Phase IIb chronic migraine study at the European Headache and Migraine Trust International Congress. This was a robust study in more than 650 patients experiencing 18 migraine days per month at baseline. And we believe the results of this study, combined with our 2 Phase III studies in episodic migraine, could support registration for both chronic and episodic migraine indications. In nephrology, Parsabiv received a positive opinion in Europe for the prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism and adults with chronic kidney disease on dialysis and we look forward to receiving market authorization in the EU. In the U.S., we are working with FDA toward an approval.
Finally, we received our first biosimilar approval in Q3 for AMJEVITA, our biosimilar HUMIRA, which was approved in all eligible indications of the referenced product. We also began enrolling Phase III studies for our biosimilar rituximab, AVP 798 in both rheumatoid arthritis and non-hodgkin's lymphoma and our biosimilar infliximab, AVP 710, in rheumatoid arthritis. As we move toward the end of the year, we still have some important work ahead of us. And as always, like to thank our staff for their efforts to combat serious disease.

And what we'd look at would be, first, to maintain the lowest weighted average cost of capital for the company and that could involve repaying some of the debt that we have on the balance sheet but maintaining a pretty healthy net debt position for the company. And then we look at certainly deploying cash, as Bob was saying, towards external opportunities. But in that instance, we would certainly lead with either strategic opportunity said that makes sense where we could get a return to our own shareholders from such investments. And then finally, we look at potentially buying back shares to again get to the right in balance weighted average cost of capital."

What I would say is that the scientific hypothesis behind the program is that we would see a similar impact on disease and, hence, outcome measures from lowering LDL by a given amount. With this mechanism as we would if we did it with a staff. And obviously here, patients already maxed out on staff and you're doing something you otherwise couldn't do which is to lower LDL substantially beyond that. But the hypothesis would be that you would see a reduction, the impact of disease that could be generally similar because the mechanisms are very similar. And I think that the positive study of increases one's confidence about that hypothesis substantially. As you know, the human genetics, which we tend to focus on a lot here at Amgen were very strong indicative of that already but give much, much more confidence. So I generally expect to see something that's generally similar to what we might expect to see if we were reducing LDL in the PCSK9 outcomes trial if it were possible to do so on top of existing statin therapy with the rest at. So that's kind of how I think about it."

But I think that you are right that, of course, anytime we do studies on our products, regulators are interested to see them, mainly to be an and we are all interested in getting those changes into the label or they're interested from a safety perspective and so on.
I think that one thing we have to recognize is that this study is designed to be analyzed first based on a time-driven basis and that's what we're talking about when we talked about the primary analysis that comes in the first half of next year. And then because we never are sure about the event rate that we're going to experience in these kind of trials, there's an event-driven analysis, for example, for non-retrieval fracture which would come later if we don't hit it based on the time-based analysis. So that's important to understand. And then finally, I would say that this is a very high hurdle. No one's done a active controlled fractured trial like this before it's actually powered and designed to actually show fracture results from the get-go. And it produces a high hurdle. It was our feeling that we needed to be able to demonstrate that the product could be superior to a strategy of using erenumab.

So it's a huge unmet need and if you compare it to an area like oncology, the amount of work that's going on in terms of innovative mechanisms that are directed at heart failure is night and day. There's very little, for example, there's absolutely no competition in the space of something that would be ionic traffic hard contractile mechanism like [indiscernible]. So I think there's a huge opportunity and in particular, just from a purely medical perspective, this has been kind of a Holy Grail in heart failure is to try to get something that actually can increase the efficiency of the squeeze of the living cardiac tissue can provide without increasing myocardial oxygen demand resulting in arrhythmic death. So we believe at this point that we have a very compelling phase to experience and a lot of very sophisticated human physiologic experiments that we've done to understand how the product is working. We understand the degree at the molecular level and I think that the PK is an important feature and one of the rasons that it's taken us the time it has to get the product into Phase III is this is kind of classic, really tough, relatively narrow window for small molecule [indiscernible] and then we have to come up with a formulation who was well behaved. And also a drug testing strategy that can be implemented in the clinic to assess. So we have a titrated regimen where our patients get started on a dose and they get the blood tests test to see what other problems, some proportion of patients get increased to a higher dose to ensure that everybody is in the therapeutic range. And I think we've demonstrated very convincingly that we can keep all the patients out of the range where you're getting too much of the mechanism, too much from [indiscernible] effect and not enough relaxation time. So bottom line is, I think it's an extremely important program and I think that it will -- these programs are inherently long term because you can't, unlike Repatha where we can get at least onto the market from the surrogate, you have to have mortality and morbidity outcomes trial just to gain market. But I'm very pleased that we are advancing this mechanism and we have a lot of interest in heart failure throughout ample pipeline."

You can imagine this could be an extremely attractive regimen to have Kyprolis ask [indiscernible] in the lab as a relapsed to refractory agent available to patients who've been treated with, often times, drugs like Revlimid and steroids and in the first-line of therapy. So I think that's an obvious place for us to look at that kind of combination therapy and that's what we're focused on. In the big picture, I would say that we will be looking, remember how rapidly moving this field has been in myeloma and how many new entrants have gone in place, there's also a potential role for immunotherapy here with the checkpoint inhibitor so we're doing studies of that so it's going to continue to be a rapidly evolving field and we remain confident that some inhibition is going to be a backbone proponent of regimens and that because of the limitations that are inherent inside the trade with drug could cause kind of the peripheral [indiscernible], of course, would romosozumab would end up playing an important role in the treatment regimens for sure."

So our performance during the quarter is best characterized by considerable operating leverage as earnings growth well exceeded revenue growth. We successfully executed on our life cycle management strategies for older products while continuing to make efforts to make our new product launches a success. To discuss our performance in greater detail, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, who will make some introductory comments. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Following David, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter; followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We should have plenty of time for Q&A after Sean's comments.
As in the past, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, our Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.
So just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements, and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob."

Our business has performed well through the first 9 months of the year, and we continue to make progress in delivering our strategy for long-term growth. At the heart of our strategy is innovation. And as you can see once again in",1187,"Okay. Thank you, Arvind. Our business has performed well through the first 9 months of the year, and we continue to make progress in delivering our strategy for long-term growth. At the heart of our strategy is innovation. And as you can see once again in the third quarter, we enjoyed strong unit volume growth for a number of our newer innovative products including Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate. As international expansion is an important objective for us, it's worth noting as well that our unit volumes grew 12% outside of the U.S. And with respect to that 12%, recognize that the competition for our legacy products began much earlier outside of the U.S. than inside, so what you see in this number is the strong demand for our new innovative medicines emerging internationally. Our transformation program, which we announced over 2 years ago, is foundational for our long-term objectives, and we have achieved momentum in that effort as evidenced in this quarter's results with operating leverage across all of our business enabling us to grow earnings well ahead of revenues and deliver nearly 53% operating margin.
And just as importantly, the transformation is improving our agility, which shows up in our ability to move a program like erenumab to market ahead of the competition and in our ability to rapidly adopt the changing demands in the marketplace as we've done in the dialysis market with our long-acting Aranesp.
I've said for some time that the strength of our legacy franchises is reflected in our durable cash flows. This quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Stable cash flow like this enables us to invest for the long term both internally and externally, while at the same time returning significant cash to our shareholders. We continue to invest globally in the long-term success of our newly launched products, which we expect will generate meaningful revenues over time. In cardiovascular, the Phase III results from our recent Repatha coronary imaging study constitute one more success in our clinical development program for this molecule. This study demonstrates the powerful effect of Repatha on atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries, the major underlying cause of cardiovascular disease and the leading cause of death worldwide. This is especially impressive considering that these results were generated on top of maximized statin therapy. Cardiovascular outcomes data, which are expected in the first quarter next year, will obviously be important for Repatha and should definitively establish the importance of this therapy for those at risk of cardiovascular disease.
In oncology, the Neulasta Onpro Kit continues to impress adopters in the marketplace, and this has proven to be a very successful launch. Multiple myeloma is a rapidly changing field where we've proven Kyprolis to be the superior proteasome inhibitor for relapsed multiple myeloma patients. We're focused on growing Kyprolis in this important segment around the world, and early launch results in Europe are encouraging, especially in Germany.
With respect to our innovative pipeline, our focus remains on addressing unmet medical needs with innovative medicines that make a big difference for patients.
Our next wave of new medicines is set to do just that. In neuroscience, we've already reported successful pivotal studies with our migraine medicine, erenumab, in both chronic and episodic migraine. This is a potentially life-changing medicine for migraine sufferers, and we're pleased to be in the lead position in the CGRP class.
Rounding out our franchise in bone health, we recently shared more clinical data on our noble bone-building agent romosozumab. Experts in the field are excited about the potential of romosozumab, and we look forward to our PDUFA date in July.
In biosimilars, AMJEVITA, which is of course our biosimilar to adalimumab, is our first approval among the many biosimilar programs that we expect will help generate long-term growth at Amgen. As you know, we're in litigation with AbbVie over AMJEVITA, and it's safe to say that there will be more litigation before there's a launch. Given the pace of that litigation, it's unlikely that this matter will be clarified in time for us to launch in 2017.
We've also successfully completed Phase III studies in 2 more biosimilars and look forward to their regulatory progress.
While talking about R&D, I want to say also a few words about the health care debate in the United States. I think it's obvious that this debate is not going to dissipate anytime soon and that all of us in the community must work together to find more affordable health care solutions.
But as we seek to do that, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that it's the economic and societal burden of disease that is the enemy. Innovative biopharmaceutical drugs are for the promise of addressing that burden.
We're at the dawn of a very exciting era for innovation. We see that today in cancer, we see it in cardiovascular medicine, and I think it we'll see it in Alzheimer's and other devastating illnesses as well. But to advance promising new medicines, we'll have to do that with an eye to both the price and the value of these therapies, and we must do it in a way that maintains the role of physicians in making the best decisions for patients.
We price our products to offer strong value proposition for patients, payers and providers. We believe the differentiated efficacy of our products enables us to take a leading role in our industry in structuring value-based partnerships for our medicines. We accept that our products need to deliver clear benefit for our customers and accept that we shouldn't be rewarded when they do not.
We have value-based contracts in place with a number of payers already and expect to do more. While the regulatory environment is complex in this area today, making each individual contract challenging and time-consuming to put in place, we expect to see more and more value-based contracts arise as one of the ways of enabling more patients to gain access to the right innovative medicines for their ailments at the right time. We don't have all the solutions obviously at Amgen, but we're committed to working with others to address challenges and improve the short and long-term health of our society as a whole.
Shifting gears, we have a strong balance sheet and the flexibility and willingness to invest in external innovation. We're active in our review of opportunities, principally in our core therapeutic categories, and we're disciplined as to the price that we'll pay for assets.
Of late, we've seen better opportunities to create value with earlier stage assets. For example, in immuno-oncology, which is of course a focus area for us, we expanded our arsenal during the quarter with a collaboration with Advaxis as well as through the reacquisition of BiTE molecule to BCMA target for multiple myeloma from Boehringer Ingelheim. We also expanded our cardiovascular franchise with an early-stage collaboration with Arrowhead.
Wrapping up, I'd offer that the long-term prospects of our business are bright, and I want to thank our teams around the world for their continuing focus on serving patients. David?"

Turning to the third quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, revenues at $5.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year. This quarter, we saw steady product sales performance anniversary-ing against the strong third quarter comparis",753,"Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the third quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, revenues at $5.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year. This quarter, we saw steady product sales performance anniversary-ing against the strong third quarter comparison last year. Other revenues at $295 million increased $88 million versus the third quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited primarily from milestone payments, notably a milestone received related to the approval of Kyprolis in Japan.
Changes in foreign exchange had less than a 1% negative impact to total revenue and product sales in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating income at $2.9 billion grew 9% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by over 4 points to 52.9% for the quarter, reflecting continued revenue performance and favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 0.5 points to 13%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling price partially offset by product mix.
Research and development expenses at $963 million decreased by 11% versus last year, driven primarily by lower spending required to support certain late-stage clinical programs and transformation and process improvement efforts, partially offset by increases in upfront payments for several in-licensing transactions.
SG&A expenses increased 1% on a year-over-year basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches primarily in international markets were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% year-over-year. Other income and expenses were a net of $109 million expense in Q3. This is favorable by $38 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year favorability was primarily due to gains in the third quarter from rebalancing our investment portfolio. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, a 0.9-point increase versus Q3 of 2015. This increase reflects unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings offset by the benefit of the federal R&D credit in 2016.
Non-GAAP net income increased 9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2015. We deployed $0.7 billion to repurchase 4.4 million shares in the quarter. Our year-to-date repurchases now total $2 billion at an average of $157 per share.
We continue to plan on repurchases of up to $3 billion in total this year. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year.
In October 2016, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the share repurchase authorization to $5 billion. Cash and investments totaled $38 billion, an increase of approximately $7  billion from last year's third quarter level. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow and the net effect of the third quarter debt issuance. Our debt balance stands at $35.3 billion as of September 30. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 12 years.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects continued conviction in executing our strategy and business performance through the first 3 quarters of this year.
As a reminder, we expect to see an increase in operating expenses in Q4 versus Q3, reflecting the typical pattern for the business. With respect to our updated guidance, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.6 billion to $22.8 billion versus prior guidance of $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion. And our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $11.40 to $11.55 per share versus prior guidance of $11.10 to $11.40. Finally, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% and capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.
In summary, our performance in 2016 remains on track. In this regard, we will be providing 2017 guidance in our January call. We continue to be on track to meet our commitments through 2018 based on our balanced portfolio of launch, growth and legacy products along with steady progress in expenses due to our transformation efforts. This concludes the financial update. I'd like to turn the call over now to Tony."

Our total revenues increased 2% year-over-year as we continue to drive strong volume growth, as Bob said, across several important brands including Prolia",1305,"Thank you, David, and you'll find a summary about the performance of the third quarter on Slide #10. Our total revenues increased 2% year-over-year as we continue to drive strong volume growth, as Bob said, across several important brands including Prolia, Sensipar, XGEVA, Nplate and Vectibix. And we're bringing on new products, notably Kyprolis and Repatha, to more patients in more markets. These gains were offset by declines in our legacy products primarily due to competition, along with the negative impact in changes in inventory levels. In the U.S., our product sales declined 1% year-over-year, and internationally, product sales grew 4% or 7% including -- excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This performance was fueled by 12% volume growth. Let me start with an update on how we're executing the life cycle management strategies across our mature brands beginning with Neulasta. Neulasta treats cancer patients who had risk of febrile neutropenia. Each year, around 100,000 patients in the U.S. are hospitalized due to potentially fatal febrile neutropenia. Not only are these hospitalizations costly to a health care system and potentially devastating to patients, but they also result in potential excessive use of broad spectrum antibiotics, which can contribute to hospital-based antibiotic resistance. This is a prime example of how innovative medicines can deliver value to the health care system. Year-over-year, Neulasta declined 5% due to a small segment complex in the U.S. along with increased competition in our international business.
We continue to see strong performance from our Onpro delivery kit to the U.S. and are on track to exit 2016 at close to 30% market share.
The Onpro delivery kit is a clear example of our commitment to innovation, to improve the quality of patient care throughout the product life cycle.
Onpro improves the patient experience by eliminating the need to return to a doctor's office the day after chemotherapy for a Neulasta injection. This translates to increased value for providers, patients and payers. We expect adoption of this device to continue. The short-acting filgrastim market in the U.S. continue to behave as expected with the entrance of a short-acting biosimilar in September last year. NEUPOGEN declined 36% year-over-year mainly due to this competition. We continue to compete account by account and hold 55% of the short-acting market as we exit the third quarter. Turning to our ESA business. Aranesp increased 8% year-over-year, mainly due to growth in the U.S. dialysis segment. We have successfully transitioned over 80% of the ESA used in independent and midsize dialysis centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. We don't expect much further transition to Aranesp moving forward.
EPOGEN declined 31% year-over-year. The largest driver was conversion to by MIRCERA by Fresenius, which began in earnest in the fourth quarter of 2015. We don't expect the short-acting biosimilar entrant until late next year at the earliest.
Now to Enbrel, where segment growth remains strong in both rheumatology and dermatology. Our primary focus is in rheumatology, which represents in excess of 80% of our business, where Enbrel offers a very effective efficacy and safety profile as well as a strong economic value. [indiscernible] year-over-year driven by several factors. Firstly, volume declined due to increased competition. Sequentially, on a value basis, we maintained share in rheumatology and lost 1 percentage point in dermatology. Competition in these segments continues to intensify.
Secondly, we experienced a negative impact from changes in inventory levels. Both of these dynamics were offset by positive changes in net selling price. You'll recall that changes in net selling price comprise several components, including changes to list price as well as impacts from rebates we provide to payers, including those related to their former decisions.
Enbrel is another example of our focus on innovation, where we continue to pursue additional indications, including one for children suffering from chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. We're also investing in mobile delivery systems to help patients with chronic inflammatory diseases to more effectively and efficiently inject themselves and ensure optimal therapy over the treatment period. We will continue to compete on a payer contracting basis to maximize patient access to Enbrel. In highly competitive markets, PBMs can require incremental rebates from us in order for us to maintain our firm repositioning.
Maintaining our firm repositioning is essential to ensure patients have access to a drug like Enbrel, which has the longest in-market history of efficacy and safety. Given this dynamic and present complex negotiations, we expect relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017. Sensipar grew 18% year-over-year driven by net selling price and strong unit growth globally. We look forward to positive European approval and are working with the FDA to obtain our approval in the U.S. Prolia delivered strong growth of 18% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw the typical seasonality in quarter 3 with a decline of 14%. Prolia remains an important growth driver, and we continue to invest to realize its full potential.
Volume growth continued at 20% in both the U.S. and the EU as we continue to capture share across these markets.
XGEVA showed continued volume growth of about 7% year-on-year, and we were pleased to see the recent results of the successful Phase III trial with XGEVA in multiple myeloma.
About half of the patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma will develop renal impairment, limiting the options for skeletal-related events. We look forward to bringing XGEVA to these patients who until recently had no other option.
Vectibix and Nplate continue to deliver double-digit growth driven mainly by volume gains. Vectibix also benefited in this quarter from shipments to our Japanese partner, which can fluctuate throughout the year.
Let me now turn to our launch products, notably Repatha and Kyprolis. Both products represent substantial opportunities as they address serious diseases with significant unmet needs. Starting with our cardiovascular franchise. Corlanor helped us to establish our presence in cardiovascular space and better understand the cardiology community. Corlanor was approved to prevent rehospitalization, one of the single largest cost in health care system and thus offers a strong value proposition for chronic heart failure patients. It's also now been included in the heart failure guidelines. Nonetheless, Corlanor sales have been modest to date as it faces steep payer hurdles.
We do not expect a dramatic change in this trend in the near future. As for Repatha, we are working with payers and providers to allow unlabeled patient access. We've seen some minor improvements in the utilization management criteria, but high hurdles remain for both physicians and patients to gain access. We are very pleased with the Repatha GLAGOV results, which Sean will discuss in a moment. We believe that GLAGOV, along with the expected positive outcomes data from the FOURIER data -- or from the FOURIER study in the first quarter 2017, will certainly strengthen Repatha's value proposition.
We look forward to having these data included in our label.
Now to Kyprolis. Kyprolis grew 34% year-over-year as we see strong early uptake from key markets in Europe combined with continued growth in the U.S. In Europe, Kyprolis grew 30% year-over-year. Multiple myeloma is a dynamic market with the entrance of new competitors. In the U.S., we lost some share in the third-line plus as a result of these new entrants. However, we expect proteasome inhibition to remain foundational therapy, and we continue to grow and generate volume growth in second line as this segment grows and patients are treated longer.
We are focused on growing second line based on the strong ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data. Both regimens, the triplet and doublet, have been recognized as preferred regimens for second-line treatment in the recently updated NCCN guidelines.
Let me close by thanking our customer-facing teams around the world. Their focus and agility to continue delivering to patients in this highly dynamic environment is inspirational. Let me now pass it to Sean."

We continue to make very good progress in the third quarter with numerous regulatory and pipeline milestones. I'll begin my review with cardiovascular. In September, we received results from our intravascular ultrasound study",1340,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We continue to make very good progress in the third quarter with numerous regulatory and pipeline milestones. I'll begin my review with cardiovascular. In September, we received results from our intravascular ultrasound study in patients with coronary artery disease on intensive statin therapy with the primary and secondary endpoints for MET. From a scientific standpoint, the clear demonstration of a link between the PCSK9 mechanism of action in lowering LDL cholesterol and a reduction in atherosclerotic heartburn in patients already treated with intensive statin therapy is truly groundbreaking.
We look forward to the presentation of these results at the American Heart Association meetings in New Orleans on November 15, where we will also be hosting an investor event.
We're on track to review the results from our cardiovascular outcome study in the first quarter of next year and anticipate having the data in time for presentation at the American College of Cardiology annual meeting in March.
In heart failure, we reached agreement with the FDA on the key elements of our omecamtiv mecarbil Phase III cardiovascular outcome study through a special protocol assessment. This study will enroll approximately 8,000 chronic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction with the primary endpoint of time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure event.
We're finalizing some of the details of the protocol with global regulators and anticipate enrolling patients early next year. Omecamtiv is being developed in collaboration with Cytokinetics and Servier.
In the earlier stage cardiovascular programs, we recently announced the licensing and collaboration agreements with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize RNA interference therapies for Lp(a) and another undisclosed target. Lp(a) is the target we have gained great confidence in through advanced genetic analysis performed in detail. We have also recently entered the clinic with an exciting new molecule for heart failure, and our ASGR1 program in atherosclerosis continues to move forward in its preclinical phase.
Turning to oncology, I'll begin with Kyprolis. In Q3, we received the results of the CLARION study, which we have the opportunity to discuss at length in our conference call. I would stress that we are committed to advancing Kyprolis into a first-line therapy, and we're close to finalizing a study design focused on the combination of Kyprolis, Revlimid and dexamethasone in transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, where we have seen very encouraging data from large investigator-sponsored studies. In fact, today, many of the thought leaders in the field considered KRd the standard of care for first-line patients.
We're also exploring other combination studies including with some of the newer therapies, and we're currently in discussions with Janssen to cofund the study of carfilzomib in combination with daratumumab for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We're also currently supplying drug to Janssen for their Phase Ib dose-finding combination study.
Before leaving Kyprolis, I'm pleased to report we've completed enrollment in the Phase III study of weekly administration in the third-line setting and expect those results next year.
We're also advancing a reformulated oprozomib molecule into the clinic in order to rapidly and definitively assess the potential to develop an oral proteasome inhibitor with the benefit risk profile that would be superior to existing oral proteasome therapy. We recently have the opportunity to review the results of the study of XGEVA in the prevention of bone complications in the multiple myeloma population, and we're pleased to report the study met its primary endpoint of noninferiority to zoledronic acid in the time to first skeletal-related event. This was expected. The efficacy was similar between the agents, but in addition, the renal safety profile, particularly important in the multiple myeloma population, favored the XGEVA arm. Recall that XGEVA is not currently indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in the multiple myeloma population, and we look forward to discussing label updates before the regulators. In our immuno-oncology program, BLINCYTO, our CD19 BiTE, continues to make a meaningful impact on the lives of certain ALL patients. And in 3Q, the FDA expanded the indication to include the pediatric setting. The addition of a noble immunotherapy like BLINCYTO is an important event for these patients where the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies can lead to long-term consequences such as secondary malignancies.
We're also initiating several Phase III studies of BLINCYTO in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma including our previously announced combination study with Merck's PD-1 inhibitor, KEYTRUDA. As we investigate the potential for IMLYGIC in combination with other immunotherapies, we recently had the opportunity to present encouraging data from an interim analysis of our Phase II study of IMLYGIC in combination with [indiscernible] at the European cancer meetings ESMO. In summary, the data suggests that the combination of IMLYGIC and [indiscernible] has greater efficacy than either agent alone in stage IIIb-IV melanoma patients without any additional safety burden. This study is expected to complete later this year and will be submitted for presentation at a medical meeting in 2017.
Our combination studies of IMLYGIC with the anti-PD-1 antibody KEYTRUDA continue to enroll. We also reacquired the rights to AMG 420, a Phase 1 BiTE construct directed against B-cell maturation antigen or BCMA, a multiple myeloma target that had been licensed to Boehringer Ingelheim prior to our acquisition of Micromet. And finally, we announced a preclinical collaboration with Advaxis on a unique, innovative and bespoke approach to generating immune responses against patient-specific tumor neoantigens.
In our bone health programs, a Phase III study of Prolia compared with risedronate in patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment met all primary and secondary endpoints. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is a small and medically important indication for men and women often under the care of rheumatologists and we will discuss in our label update with regulators soon.
Last month, data from the romosozumab Phase III placebo-controlled fracture study, FRAME, was presented at the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Feedback from the bone community was very positive, and there's a clear desire for new innovative anabolic therapies for the treatment of osteoporosis.
FDA has accepted our romosozumab file, and along with our partner, UCB, we look forward to continued interactions as we work toward our July '17 PDUFA date. We also expect to conduct the primary analysis of the Phase III active control fracture study, ARCH, in the first half of next year. In neuroscience, we continue to advance our CGRP receptor antibody erenumab for migraine prophylaxis in collaboration with Novartis.
We successfully completed the first of 2 Phase III studies in the episodic migraine setting. 70 milligrams of subcutaneous erenumab administered monthly resulted in the statistically and clinically significant reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days with a safety profile similar to placebo. We'll see the results of the second Phase III study in episodic migraine by the end of this year. We also presented the positive results from our Phase IIb chronic migraine study at the European Headache and Migraine Trust International Congress. This was a robust study in more than 650 patients experiencing 18 migraine days per month at baseline. And we believe the results of this study, combined with our 2 Phase III studies in episodic migraine, could support registration for both chronic and episodic migraine indications. In nephrology, Parsabiv received a positive opinion in Europe for the prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, and we look forward to receiving market authorization in the EU. In the U.S., we are working with FDA toward an approval.
Finally, we received our first biosimilar approval in Q3 for AMJEVITA, our biosimilar HUMIRA, which was approved in all eligible indications of the referenced product. We also began enrolling Phase III studies for our biosimilar rituximab, ABP 798 in both rheumatoid arthritis and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and our biosimilar infliximab, ABP 710, in rheumatoid arthritis. As we move toward the end of the year, we still have some important work ahead of us. And as always, I'd like to thank our staff for their efforts to combat serious disease.

So I think the point is, should we see a tax reform in the U.S., would we consider to repatriate the cash? I would say yes. And what we'd look at would be, first, to maintain the lowest weighted average cost of capital for the company and that could involve repaying some of the debt that we have on the balance sheet but maintaining a pretty healthy net debt position for the company. And then we look at certainly deploying cash, as Bob was saying, towards external opportunities.

With regards to the IVUS results and sort of reading them through to CV outcomes, there's obviously no formula for that. What I would say is that the scientific hypothesis behind the program is that we would see a similar impact on atherosclerotic disease and, hence, outcome measures from lowering LDL by a given amount with this mechanism as we would if we did it with statin. And obviously here, patients are already maxed out on statin therapy and you're doing something you otherwise couldn't do, which is to lower LDL substantially beyond that. But the hypothesis would be that you would see a reduction in the impact of atherosclerotic disease that would be generally similar because the mechanisms are very similar. And I think that the positive IVUS study increases one's confidence about that hypothesis substantially. As you know, the human genetics, which we tend to focus on a lot here at Amgen, were a very strong indicative of that already, but the IVUS data give much, much more confidence. So I generally expect to see something that's generally similar to what we might expect to see if we were reducing LDL in the PCSK9 outcomes trial were possible to do so on top of existing maxed out statin therapy with statin. So that's kind of how I think about it."

So I think a very interesting target and something that no one could imagine being synergistic with checkpoint inhibition. There are, of course, tumor types that tend to have much more infiltration of these macrophages, where you can demonstrate, in fact, that prognosis is related to an individual patient by the numbers or density of these infiltrating macrophages. So we tended to focus on some of those tumor types.

But I think that you are right that, of course, anytime we do studies on our products, regulators are interested to see them, mainly to be -- and we often are interested in getting those changes into the label or they're interested in them from a safety perspective and so on.
I think that one thing we have to recognize is that this study is designed to be analyzed first based on a time-driven basis, and that's what we're talking about when we talk about the primary analysis that comes in the first half of next year. And then because we never are sure about the event rate that we're going to experience in these kind of trials, there's an event-driven analysis, for example, for nonretrieval fracture which would come later if we don't hit it based on the time-based analysis. So that's important to understand. And then finally, I would say that this is a very high hurdle. No one's done an active controlled fracture trial like this before that's actually powered and designed to actually show fracture results from the get-go. And it produces a high hurdle. It was our feeling that we needed to be able to demonstrate that the product could be superior to a strategy of using alendronate.

And if you compare it to an area like oncology, the amount of work that's going on in terms of innovative mechanisms that are directed at heart failure is night and day. There's very little -- for example, there's absolutely no competition in the space of something that would be an ionotropic positive contractile mechanism like omecamtiv. So I think there's a huge opportunity and in particular, just from a purely medical perspective, this has been kind of the Holy Grail in heart failure, is to try and get something that actually can increase the efficiency of the squeeze that the living cardiac tissue can provide without increasing myocardial oxygen demand resulting in arrhythmic death. So we believe at this point that we have a very compelling phase to experience and a lot of very sophisticated human physiologic experiments that we've done to understand how the product is working, we understand deeply at a molecular level. And I think that the PK is an important feature and one of the reasons that it's taken us the time it has to get the product into Phase III is this kind of classic, really tough, relatively narrow of a window small molecule developed, and we had to come up with a formulation that was well behaved and also a drug testing strategy that can be implemented in the clinic to assess. So we have a titrated regimen where our patients get started on a dose and they get the blood test to see whether they're [indiscernible] or steady state, and some proportion of patients get increased to a higher dose to ensure that everybody is in the therapeutic range. And I think we've demonstrated very convincingly that we can keep all the patients out of the range where you're getting too much of the mechanism, too much pharmacodynamic effect and not enough relaxation time. So bottom line is I think it's an extremely important program, and I think that it will -- these programs are inherently long term because you can't, unlike Repatha where we could get at least onto the market from the surrogate, you have to have a mortality and morbidity outcomes trial just to gain market. But I'm very pleased that we are advancing this mechanism, and we have a lot of interest in heart failure throughout our whole pipeline."

When you get to the relapsed/refractory, which is where we're talking about the study with Janssen, at that point, you're really looking at, for example, the ENDEAVOR type regimen which is Kyprolis at a particular dose with dexamethasone. That's where we were able to demonstrate the doubling of PFS versus Velcade. So that base regimen plus daratumumab is -- versus the regimen alone is what we're thinking about looking at. And you can imagine that this could be an extremely attractive regimen to have Kyprolis, dex and daratumumab as a relapsed/refractory agent available to patients who've been treated with oftentimes drugs like Revlimid and steroids and Velcade in the first-line of therapy. So I think that's an obvious place for us to look at that kind of combination therapy, and that's what we're focused on. In the big picture, I would say that we will be looking -- remember how rapidly moving this field has been in multiple myeloma and how many new entrants have come in place. There's also a potential role for immunotherapy here with the checkpoint inhibitor, so we're doing studies with that. So it's going to continue to be a rapidly evolving field, and we remain confident that proteasome inhibition is going to be a backbone component of regimens and that because of the limitations that are inherent in trying to treat with a drug that causes the kind of peripheral neuropathy that occurs with pertuzumab will end up playing an important role in the treatment regimens for sure."

And we've that in place for some time now. And so we make choices between those depending on particular circumstances. Now obviously with a molecule like BLINCYTO that's already approved, the thing that we're doing there is looking at induction regimens where an intensive treatment with an intravenous administration for a limited period of time would be acceptable if we were going to drive people into very low minimal residual disease positive state. But it is true that for many solid tumor settings, for example, the development that we would pursue would be with the half-life extended versions of the BiTE. So in the big picture, it turns out interestingly that for some of these molecules when they're being used in hematologic malignancy settings and there's a real potential for this kind of cytokine storm syndromes, the ability to actually turn the drugs infusion off and have it dissipate out of the system in a matter of minutes is a huge advantage. And so that's something that you need to take into account. But we do, as we develop this against targets in solid tumors, we ultimately -- and even in settings like lymphoma, you may see us do something with a short-acting [indiscernible] sort of next generation with the half-life extended version."

So our performance during the quarter is best characterized by considerable operating leverage as earnings growth well exceeded revenue growth. We successfully executed on our life cycle management strategies for older products while continuing to make efforts to make our new product launches a success. To discuss our performance in greater detail, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, who will make some introductory comments. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Following David, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter; followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We should have plenty of time for Q&A after Sean's comments.
As in the past, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, our Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.
So just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements, and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob."

Our business has performed well through the first 9 months of the year, and we continue to make progress in delivering our strategy for long-term growth. At the heart of our strategy is innovation. And as you can see once again in the third quarter, we enjoyed strong unit volume growth for a number of our newer innovative products including Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate. As international expansion is an important objective for us, it's worth noting as well that our unit volumes grew 12% outside of the U.S. And with respect to that 12%, recognize that the competition for our legacy products began much earlier outside of the U.S. than inside, so what you see in this number is the strong demand for our new innovative medicines emerging internationally. 
Our transformation program, which we announced over 2 years ago, is foundational for our long-term objectives, and we have achieved momentum in that effort as evidenced in this quarter's results with operating leverage across all of our business enabling us to grow earnings well ahead of revenues and deliver nearly 53% operating margin.
And just as importantly, the transformation is improving our agility, which shows up in our ability to move a program like erenumab to market ahead of the competition and in our ability to rapidly adapt to changing demands in the marketplace as we've done in the dialysis market with our long-acting Aranesp.
I've said for some time that the strength of our legacy franchises is reflected in our durable cash flows. This quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Stable cash flow like this enables us to invest for the long term both internally and externally, while at the same time returning significant cash to our shareholders. 
We continue to invest globally in the long-term success of our newly launched products, which we expect will generate meaningful revenues over time. In cardiovascular, the Phase III results from our recent Repatha coronary imaging study constitute one more success in our clinical development program for this molecule. This study demonstrates the powerful effect of Repatha on atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries, the major underlying cause of cardiovascular disease and the leading cause of death worldwide. This is especially impressive considering that these results were generated on top of maximized statin therapy. Cardiovascular outcomes data, which are expected in the first quarter next year, will obviously be important for Repatha and should definitively establish the importance of this therapy for those at risk of cardiovascular disease.
In oncology, the Neulasta Onpro Kit continues to impress adopters in the marketplace, and this has proven to be a very successful launch. Multiple myeloma is a rapidly changing field where we've proven Kyprolis to be the superior proteasome inhibitor for relapsed multiple myeloma patients. We're focused on growing Kyprolis in this important segment around the world, and early launch results in Europe are encouraging, especially in Germany.
With respect to our innovative pipeline, our focus remains on addressing unmet medical needs with innovative medicines that make a big difference for patients.
Our next wave of new medicines is set to do just that. In neuroscience, we've already reported successful pivotal studies with our migraine medicine, erenumab, in both chronic and episodic migraine. This is a potentially life-changing medicine for migraine sufferers, and we're pleased to be in the lead position in the CGRP class.
Rounding out our franchise in bone health, we recently shared more clinical data on our novel bone-building agent, romosozumab. Experts in the field are excited about the potential of romosozumab, and we look forward to our PDUFA date in July.
In biosimilars, AMJEVITA, which is of course our biosimilar to adalimumab, is our first approval among the many biosimilar programs that we expect will help generate long-term growth at Amgen. As you know, we're in litigation with AbbVie over AMJEVITA, and it's safe to say that there will be more litigation before there's a launch. Given the pace of that litigation, it's unlikely that this matter will be clarified in time for us to launch in 2017.
We've also successfully completed Phase III studies in 2 more biosimilars and look forward to their regulatory progress.
While talking about R&D, I want to say also a few words about the health care debate in the United States. I think it's obvious that this debate is not going to dissipate anytime soon and that all of us in the community must work together to find more affordable health care solutions.
But as we seek to do that, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that it's the economic and societal burden of disease that is the enemy. Innovative biopharmaceutical drugs are for the promise of addressing that burden.
We're at the dawn of a very exciting era for innovation. We see that today in cancer, we see it in cardiovascular medicine, and I think it we'll see it in Alzheimer's and other devastating illnesses as well. But if we're to advance promising new medicines, we'll have to do that with an eye to both the price and the value of these therapies, and we must do it in a way that maintains the role of physicians in making the best decisions for patients.
We price our products to offer strong value proposition for patients, payers and providers. We believe the differentiated efficacy of our products enables us to take a leading role in our industry in structuring value-based partnerships for our medicines. We accept that our products need to deliver clear benefit for our customers and accept that we shouldn't be rewarded when they do not.
We have value-based contracts in place with a number of payers already and expect to do more. While the regulatory environment is complex in this area today, making each individual contract challenging and time-consuming to put in place, we expect to see more and more value-based contracts arise as one of the ways of enabling more patients to gain access to the right innovative medicines for their ailments at the right time. We don't have all the solutions obviously at Amgen, but we're committed to working with others to address challenges and improve the short and long-term health of our society as a whole.
Shifting gears, we have a strong balance sheet and the flexibility and willingness to invest in external innovation. We're active in our review of opportunities, principally in our core therapeutic categories, and we're disciplined as to the price that we'll pay for assets.
Of late, we've seen better opportunities to create value with earlier stage assets. For example, in immuno-oncology, which is of course a focus area for us, we expanded our arsenal during the quarter with a collaboration with Advaxis as well as through the reacquisition of BiTE molecule to BCMA target for multiple myeloma from Boehringer Ingelheim. We also expanded our cardiovascular franchise with an early-stage collaboration with Arrowhead.
Wrapping up, I'd offer that the long-term prospects of our business are bright, and I want to thank our teams around the world for their continuing focus on serving patients. David?"

Turning to the third quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, revenues of $5.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year. This quarter, we saw steady product sales performance anniversary-ing against the strong third quarter comparis",753,"Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the third quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, revenues of $5.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year. This quarter, we saw steady product sales performance anniversary-ing against the strong third quarter comparison last year. Other revenues at $295 million increased $88 million versus the third quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited primarily from milestone payments, notably a milestone received related to the approval of Kyprolis in Japan.
Changes in foreign exchange had less than a 1% negative impact to total revenue and product sales in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating income at $2.9 billion grew 9% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by over 4 points to 52.9% for the quarter, reflecting continued revenue performance and favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 0.5 points to 13%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling price partially offset by product mix.
Research and development expenses at $963 million decreased by 11% versus last year, driven primarily by lower spending required to support certain late-stage clinical programs and transformation and process improvement efforts, partially offset by increases in upfront payments for several in-licensing transactions.
SG&A expenses increased 1% on a year-over-year basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches, primarily in international markets, were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% year-over-year. Other income and expenses were a net of $109 million expense in Q3. This is favorable by $38 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year favorability was primarily due to gains in the third quarter from rebalancing our investment portfolio. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, a 0.9-point increase versus Q3 of 2015. This increase reflects unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings offset by the benefit of the federal R&D credit in 2016.
Non-GAAP net income increased 9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2015. We deployed $0.7 billion to repurchase 4.4 million shares in the quarter. Our year-to-date repurchases now total $2 billion at an average of $157 per share.
We continue to plan on repurchases of up to $3 billion in total this year. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year.
In October 2016, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the share repurchase authorization to $5 billion. Cash and investments totaled $38 billion, an increase of approximately $7 billion from last year's third quarter level. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow and the net effect of the third quarter debt issuance. Our debt balance stands at $35.3 billion as of September 30. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 12 years.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects continued conviction in executing our strategy and business performance through the first 3 quarters of this year.
As a reminder, we expect to see an increase in operating expenses in Q4 versus Q3, reflecting the typical pattern for the business. With respect to our updated guidance, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.6 billion to $22.8 billion versus prior guidance of $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion. And our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $11.40 to $11.55 per share versus prior guidance of $11.10 to $11.40. Finally, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% and capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.
In summary, our performance in 2016 remains on track. In this regard, we will be providing 2017 guidance in our January call. We continue to be on track to meet our commitments through 2018 based on our balanced portfolio of launch, growth and legacy products along with steady progress in expenses due to our transformation efforts. This concludes the financial update. I'd like to turn the call over now to Tony."
24816,405160725,1064713,"Amgen Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and you'll find a summary about the performance of the third quarter on Slide #10. Our total revenues increased 2% year-over-year as we continue to drive strong volume growth, as Bob said, across several important brands including Prolia",1313,"Thank you, David, and you'll find a summary about the performance of the third quarter on Slide #10. Our total revenues increased 2% year-over-year as we continue to drive strong volume growth, as Bob said, across several important brands including Prolia, Sensipar, XGEVA, Nplate and Vectibix. And we're bringing on new products, notably Kyprolis and Repatha, to more patients in more markets. These gains were offset by declines in our legacy products primarily due to competition, along with the negative impact in changes in inventory levels. 
In the U.S., our product sales declined 1% year-over-year, and internationally, product sales grew 4% or 7% including -- excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This performance was fueled by 12% volume growth. Let me start with an update on how we're executing the life cycle management strategies across our mature brands beginning with Neulasta. Neulasta treats cancer patients who had risk of febrile neutropenia. Each year, around 100,000 patients in the U.S. are hospitalized due to potentially fatal febrile neutropenia. Not only are these hospitalizations costly to our health care system and potentially devastating to patients, but they also result in potential excessive use of broad spectrum antibiotics, which can contribute to hospital-based antibiotic resistance. This is a prime example of how innovative medicines can deliver value to the health care system. Year-over-year, Neulasta declined 5% due to a small segment complex [ph] in the U.S. along with increased competition in our international business.
We continue to see strong performance from our Onpro delivery kit to the U.S. and are on track to exit 2016 at close to 30% market share.
The Onpro delivery kit is a clear example of our commitment to innovation, to improve the quality of patient care throughout the product life cycle.
Onpro improves the patient experience by eliminating the need to return to a doctor's office the day after chemotherapy for a Neulasta injection. This translates to increased value for providers, patients and payers. We expect adoption of this device to continue. The short-acting filgrastim market in the U.S. continue to behave as expected with the entrance of a short-acting biosimilar in September last year. NEUPOGEN declined 36% year-over-year mainly due to this [ph] competition. We continue to compete account by account and hold 55% of the short-acting market as we exit the third quarter. 
Turning to our ESA business. Aranesp increased 8% year-over-year, mainly due to growth in the U.S. dialysis segment. We have successfully transitioned over 80% of the ESA used in independent and midsize dialysis centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. We don't expect much further transition to Aranesp moving forward.
EPOGEN declined 31% year-over-year. The largest driver was conversion to by MIRCERA by Fresenius, which began in earnest in the fourth quarter of 2015. We don't expect a short-acting biosimilar entrant until late next year at the earliest.
Now to Enbrel, where segment growth remains strong in both rheumatology and dermatology. Our primary focus is in rheumatology, which represents in excess of 80% of our business, where Enbrel offers a very effective efficacy and safety profile as well as a strong economic value. Enbrel sales were unchanged year-over-year driven by several factors. Firstly, volume declined due to increased competition. Sequentially, on a value basis, we maintained share in rheumatology and lost 1 percentage point to dermatology. Competition in these segments continues to intensify.
Secondly, we experienced a negative impact from changes in inventory levels. Both of these dynamics were offset by positive changes in net selling price. You'll recall that changes in net selling price comprise several components, including changes to list price as well as impacts from rebates we provide to payers, including those related to their former decisions.
Enbrel is another example of our focus on innovation, where we continue to pursue additional indications, including one for children suffering from chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. We're also investing in novel delivery systems to help patients with chronic inflammatory diseases to more effectively and efficiently inject themselves and ensure optimal therapy over the treatment period. We will continue to compete on a payer contracting basis to maximize patient access to Enbrel. In highly competitive markets, PBMs can require incremental rebates from us in order for us to maintain our formulary positioning.
Maintaining our formulary positioning is essential to ensure patients have access to a drug like Enbrel, which has the longest in-market history of efficacy and safety. Given this dynamic and present contract negotiations, we expect relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017. Sensipar grew 18% year-over-year driven by net selling price and strong unit growth globally. We look forward to positive European approval and are working with the FDA to obtain our approval in the U.S. Prolia delivered strong growth of 18% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw the typical seasonality in quarter 3 with a decline of 14%. Prolia remains an important growth driver, and we continue to invest to realize its full potential.
Volume growth continued at nearly 20% in both the U.S. and the EU as we continue to capture share across these markets.
XGEVA showed continued volume growth of about 7% year-on-year, and we were pleased to see the recent results of the successful Phase III trial with XGEVA in multiple myeloma.
About half of the patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma will develop renal impairment, limiting the options for skeletal-growth-related events. We look forward to bringing XGEVA to these patients who until recently had no other option.
Vectibix and Nplate continue to deliver double-digit growth driven mainly by volume gains. Vectibix also benefited in this quarter from shipments to our Japanese partner, which can fluctuate throughout the year.
Let me now turn to our launch products, notably Repatha and Kyprolis. Both products represent substantial opportunities as they address serious diseases with significant unmet needs. Starting with our cardiovascular franchise. Corlanor helped us to establish our presence in cardiovascular space and better understand the cardiology community. Corlanor was approved to prevent rehospitalization, one of the single largest costs in health care system and thus offers a strong value proposition for chronic heart failure patients. It is also now been included in the Heart Failure Guidelines. Nonetheless, Corlanor sales have been modest to date as it faces steep payer hurdles.
We do not expect a dramatic change in this trend in the near future. As for Repatha, we are working with payers and providers to allow unlabeled [ph] patient access. We've seen some minor improvements in the utilization management criteria, but high hurdles remain for both physicians and patients to gain access. We are very pleased with the Repatha GLAGOV results, which Sean will discuss in a moment. We believe that GLAGOV, along with the expected positive outcomes data from the FOURIER data -- or from the FOURIER study in the first quarter 2017, will certainly strengthen Repatha's value proposition.
We look forward to having these data included in our label.
Now to Kyprolis. Kyprolis grew 34% year-over-year as we see strong early uptake from key markets in Europe combined with continued growth in the U.S. In Europe, Kyprolis grew 30% year-over-year. Multiple myeloma is a dynamic market with the entrance of new competitors. In the U.S., we lost some share in the third-line plus as a result of these new entrants. However, we expect proteasome inhibition to remain foundational therapy, and we continue to grow and generate volume growth in second line as this segment grows and patients are treated longer.
We are focused on growing second line based on the strong ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data. Both regimens, the triplet and doublet, have been recognized as preferred regimens for second-line treatment in the recently updated NCCN guidelines.
Let me close by thanking our customer-facing teams around the world. Their focus and agility to continue delivering to patients in this highly dynamic environment is inspirational. Let me now pass it to Sean."

We continue to make very good progress in the third quarter with numerous regulatory and pipeline milestones. I'll begin my review with cardiovascular. In September, we received results from our intravascular ultrasound study",1344,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We continue to make very good progress in the third quarter with numerous regulatory and pipeline milestones. I'll begin my review with cardiovascular. In September, we received results from our intravascular ultrasound study in patients with coronary artery disease on intensive statin therapy with the primary and secondary endpoints for MET. From a scientific standpoint, the clear demonstration of a link between the PCSK9 mechanism of action in lowering LDL cholesterol and a reduction in atherosclerotic plaque burden in patients already treated with intensive statin therapy is truly groundbreaking.
We look forward to the presentation of these results at the American Heart Association meetings in New Orleans on November 15, where we will also be hosting an investor event.
We're on track to review the results from our cardiovascular outcome study in the first quarter of next year and anticipate having the data in time for presentation at the American College of Cardiology annual meeting in March.
In heart failure, we reached agreement with the FDA on the key elements of our omecamtiv mecarbil Phase III cardiovascular outcome study through a special protocol assessment. This study will enroll approximately 8,000 chronic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction with the primary endpoint of time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure event.
We're finalizing some of the details of the protocol with global regulators and anticipate enrolling patients early next year. omecamtiv is being developed in collaboration with Cytokinetics and Servier.
In the earlier stage cardiovascular programs, we recently announced the licensing and collaboration agreements with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize RNA interference therapies for Lp(a) and another undisclosed target. Lp(a) is the target we have gained great confidence in through advanced genetic analyses performed in detail [ph]. We have also recently entered the clinic with an exciting new molecule for heart failure, and our ASGR1 program in atherosclerosis continues to move forward in its preclinical phase.
Turning to oncology, I'll begin with Kyprolis. In Q3, we received the results of the CLARION study, which we have the opportunity to discuss at length in our conference call. I would stress that we are committed to advancing Kyprolis into a first-line therapy, and we're close to finalizing a study design focused on the combination of Kyprolis, Revlimid and dexamethasone in transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, where we have seen very encouraging data from large investigator-sponsored studies. In fact, today, many of the thought leaders in the field considered KRd the standard of care for first-line patients.
We're also exploring other combination studies including with some of the newer therapies, and we're currently in discussions with Janssen to cofund the study of carfilzomib in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We're also currently supplying drug to Janssen for their Phase Ib dose-finding combination study.
Before leaving Kyprolis, I'm pleased to report we've completed enrollment in the Phase III study of weekly administration in the third-line setting and expect those results next year.
We're also advancing a reformulated oprozomib molecule into the clinic in order to rapidly and definitively assess the potential to develop an oral proteasome inhibitor with the benefit risk profile that would be superior to existing oral proteasome therapy. We recently have the opportunity to review the results of the study of XGEVA in the prevention of bone complications in the multiple myeloma population, and we're pleased to report the study met its primary endpoint of noninferiority to zoledronic acid in the time to first skeletal-related event. This was expected. The efficacy was similar between the agents, but in addition, the renal safety profile, particularly important in the multiple myeloma population, favored the XGEVA arm. 
Recall that XGEVA is not currently indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in the multiple myeloma population, and we look forward to discussing label updates with global regulators. In our immuno-oncology program, BLINCYTO, our CD19 BiTE, continues to make a meaningful impact on the lives of certain ALL patients. And in 3Q, the FDA expanded the indication to include the pediatric setting. The addition of a novel immunotherapy like BLINCYTO is an important advance for these patients where the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies can lead to long-term consequences such as secondary malignancies.
We're also initiating several Phase III studies of BLINCYTO in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma including our previously announced combination study with Merck's PD-1 inhibitor, KEYTRUDA. As we investigate the potential for IMLYGIC in combination with other immunotherapies, we recently had the opportunity to present encouraging data from an interim analysis of our Phase II study of IMLYGIC in combination with YERVOY at the European cancer meetings, ESMO. In summary, the data suggests that the combination of IMLYGIC and YERVOY has greater efficacy than either agent alone in stage IIIb-IV melanoma patients without any additional safety burden. This study is expected to complete later this year and will be submitted for presentation at a medical meeting in 2017.
Our combination studies of IMLYGIC with the anti-PD-1 antibody KEYTRUDA continue to enroll. We also reacquired the rights to AMG 420, a Phase 1 BiTE construct directed against B-cell maturation antigen or BCMA, a multiple myeloma target that had been licensed to Boehringer Ingelheim prior to our acquisition of Micromet. And finally, we announced a preclinical collaboration with Advaxis on a unique, innovative and bespoke approach to generating immune responses against patient-specific tumor neoantigens.
In our bone health programs, a Phase III study of Prolia compared with risedronate in patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment met all primary and secondary endpoints. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is a small and medically important indication for men and women often under the care of rheumatologists and we will discuss in our label update with regulators soon.
Last month, data from the romosozumab Phase III placebo-controlled fracture study, FRAME, was presented at the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Feedback from the bone community was very positive, and there's a clear desire for new innovative anabolic therapies for the treatment of osteoporosis.
FDA has accepted our romosozumab file, and along with our partner, UCB, we look forward to continued interactions as we work toward our July '17 PDUFA date. We also expect to conduct the primary analysis of the Phase III active control fracture study, ARCH, in the first half of next year. 
In neuroscience, we continue to advance our CGRP receptor antibody erenumab for migraine prophylaxis in collaboration with Novartis. We successfully completed the first of 2 Phase III studies in the episodic migraine setting. 70 milligrams of subcutaneous erenumab administered monthly resulted in the statistically and clinically significant reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days with a safety profile similar to placebo. We'll see the results of the second Phase III study in episodic migraine by the end of this year. 
We also presented the positive results from our Phase IIb chronic migraine study at the European Headache and Migraine Trust International Congress. This was a robust study in more than 650 patients experiencing 18 migraine days per month at baseline. And we believe the results of this study, combined with our 2 Phase III studies in episodic migraine, could support registration for both chronic and episodic migraine indications. In nephrology, Parsabiv received a positive opinion in Europe for the prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, and we look forward to receiving market authorization in the EU. In the U.S., we are working with FDA toward an approval.
Finally, we received our first biosimilar approval in Q3 for AMJEVITA, our biosimilar HUMIRA, which was approved in all eligible indications of the referenced product. We also began enrolling Phase III studies for our biosimilar rituximab, ABP 798 in both rheumatoid arthritis and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and our biosimilar infliximab, ABP 710, in rheumatoid arthritis. 
As we move toward the end of the year, we still have some important work ahead of us. And as always, I'd like to thank our staff for their efforts to combat serious disease.

And obviously here, patients are already maxed out on statin therapy and you're doing something you otherwise couldn't do, which is to lower LDL substantially beyond that. But the hypothesis would be that you would see a reduction in the impact of atherosclerotic disease that would be generally similar because the mechanisms are very similar. And I think that the positive IVUS study increases one's confidence about that hypothesis substantially. As you know, the human genetics, which we tend to focus on a lot here at Amgen, were a very strong indicative of that already, but the IVUS data give much, much more confidence. So I generally expect to see something that's generally similar to what we might expect to see if we were reducing LDL in the PCSK9 outcomes trial were possible to do so on top of existing maxed out statin therapy with statin. So that's kind of how I think about it."

There are, of course, tumor types that tend to have much more infiltration of these macrophages, where you can demonstrate, in fact, that prognosis is related to an individual patient by the numbers or density of these infiltrating macrophages. So we tended to focus on some of those tumor types.

So we've made a strategic decision to file in some parts of the world with both studies, and that has to do with payer access determinations and so on. But I think that you are right that, of course, any time we do studies on our products, regulators are interested to see them, mainly to be -- and we often are interested in getting those changes into the label or they're interested in them from a safety perspective and so on. I think that one thing we have to recognize is that this study is designed to be analyzed first based on a time-driven basis, and that's what we're talking about when we talk about the primary analysis that comes in the first half of next year. And then because we never are sure about the event rate that we're going to experience in these kind of trials, there's an event-driven analysis, for example, for nonvertebral fracture which would come later if we don't hit it based on the time-based analysis. So that's important to understand. And then finally, I would say that this is a very high hurdle. No one's done an active controlled fracture trial like this before that's actually powered and designed to actually show fracture results from the get-go. And it produces a high hurdle. It was our feeling that we needed to be able to demonstrate that the product could be superior to a strategy of using alendronate. And so that's the idea behind having this second study, largely, again, to work with payers."

There's a lot of pressure in the highly competitive environment, specifically with the anti-TNFs where we have to put large rebates on the table to maintain our formulary position. The large rebates are clearly impacting net selling price. So let me just go back and say that as we think about 2017, we will see little impact on net selling price for Enbrel. Demand will be driven by what happens in the marketplace, and the trends are as they are in terms of the market share at the moment and in terms of the TRxs. As regards to some of the value-based contracts we have, there is a contract in the Northeast where we've talked about a value-based contract with Repatha around a guaranteed level of lipid lowering, specifically linked to Repatha and our ability to lower lipids.

And if you compare it to an area like oncology, the amount of work that's going on in terms of innovative mechanisms that are directed at heart failure is night and day. There's very little -- for example, there's absolutely no competition in the space of something that would be an ionotropic positive contractile mechanism like omecamtiv. So I think there's a huge opportunity and in particular, just from a purely medical perspective, this has been kind of the Holy Grail in heart failure, is to try and get something that actually can increase the efficiency of the squeeze that the living cardiac tissue can provide without increasing myocardial oxygen demand resulting in arrhythmic death. So we believe at this point that we have a very compelling Phase II experience and a lot of very sophisticated human physiologic experiments that we've done to understand how the product is working, we understand deeply at a molecular level. And I think that the PK is an important feature and one of the reasons that it's taken us the time it has to get the product into Phase III is this kind of classic, really tough, relatively narrow window of small molecule drug development. And we had to come up with a formulation that was well behaved and also a drug testing strategy that can be implemented in the clinic to assess. So we have a titrated regimen where our patients get started on a dose and they get the blood test to see what level they're at once they're steady state, and some proportion of patients get increased to a higher dose to ensure that everybody is in the therapeutic range. And I think we've demonstrated very convincingly that we can keep all the patients out of the range where you're getting too much of the mechanism, too much pharmacodynamic effect and not enough relaxation time. So bottom line is I think it's an extremely important program, and I think that it will -- these programs are inherently long term because you can't -- unlike Repatha where we could get at least onto the market from the surrogate, you have to have a mortality and morbidity outcomes trial just to gain market. But I'm very pleased that we are advancing this mechanism, and we have a lot of interest in heart failure throughout our whole pipeline."

That's where we were able to demonstrate the doubling of PFS versus Velcade. So that base regimen plus daratumumab is -- versus the regimen alone is what we're thinking about looking at. And you can imagine that this could be an extremely attractive regimen to have Kyprolis, dex and daratumumab as a relapsed/refractory agent available to patients who've been treated with oftentimes drugs like Revlimid and steroids and Velcade in the first-line of therapy. So I think that's an obvious place for us to look at that kind of combination therapy, and that's what we're focused on. In the big picture, I would say that we will be looking -- remember how rapidly moving this field has been in multiple myeloma and how many new entrants have come in place. There's also a potential role for immunotherapy here with the checkpoint inhibitors, so we're doing studies with that. So it's going to continue to be a rapidly evolving field, and we remain confident that proteasome inhibition is going to be a backbone component of regimens and that because of the limitations that are inherent in trying to treat with a drug that causes the kind of peripheral neuropathy that occurs with pertuzumab will end up playing an important role in the treatment regimens for sure."

Clearly, we haven't set a price for the product yet, but from what we've seen, there's a huge unmet medical need. A large number of patients who suffered from this disease. It's a debilitating disease. It takes away independence and the ability to be productive, to be productive either as a worker or as a mother or a father. The available treatment on the market at the moment does not help patients as much as they'd like. It causes side effects that are sometimes worse than the disease itself. And it's a disease that patients really know about when they have it. It's not a nonobservable symptom like some other diseases.

I think it's -- first of all, I mean, we currently have the ability to develop the very short half-life molecules or much longer half-life versions of these constructs. And we've that in place for some time now. And so we make choices between those depending on particular circumstances. Now obviously with a molecule like BLINCYTO that's already approved, the thing that we're doing there is looking at induction regimens where an intensive treatment with an intravenous administration for a limited period of time would be acceptable if we were going to drive people into very low minimal residual disease positive state. But it is true that for many solid tumor settings, for example, the development that we would pursue would be with the half-life extended versions of the BiTE. So in the big picture, it turns out interestingly that for some of these molecules when they're being used in hematologic malignancy settings and there's a real potential for these kind of cytokine storm syndromes, the ability to actually turn the drug's infusion off and have it dissipate out of the system in a matter of minutes is a huge advantage. And so that's something that you need to take into account. But we do, as we develop these against targets in solid tumors, we ultimately -- and even in settings like lymphoma, you may see us do something with a short-acting BiTE and follow in as a sort of next generation with the half-life extended version."

So our performance during the quarter is best characterized by considerable operating leverage as earnings growth well exceeded revenue growth. We successfully executed on our life cycle management strategies for older products while continuing to make efforts to make our new product launches a success. To discuss our performance in greater detail, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, who will make some introductory comments. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Following David, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter; followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We should have plenty of time for Q&A after Sean's comments.
As in the past, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, our Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.
So just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements, and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob."

Our business has performed well through the first 9 months of the year, and we continue to make progress in delivering our strategy for long-term growth. At the heart of our strategy is innovation. And as you can see once again in",1189,"Okay. Thank you, Arvind. Our business has performed well through the first 9 months of the year, and we continue to make progress in delivering our strategy for long-term growth. At the heart of our strategy is innovation. And as you can see once again in the third quarter, we enjoyed strong unit volume growth for a number of our newer innovative products including Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate. As international expansion is an important objective for us, it's worth noting as well that our unit volumes grew 12% outside of the U.S. And with respect to that 12%, recognize that the competition for our legacy products began much earlier outside of the U.S. than inside, so what you see in this number is the strong demand for our new innovative medicines emerging internationally. 
Our transformation program, which we announced over 2 years ago, is foundational for our long-term objectives, and we have achieved momentum in that effort as evidenced in this quarter's results with operating leverage across all of our business enabling us to grow earnings well ahead of revenues and deliver nearly 53% operating margin.
And just as importantly, the transformation is improving our agility, which shows up in our ability to move a program like erenumab to market ahead of the competition and in our ability to rapidly adapt to changing demands in the marketplace as we've done in the dialysis market with our long-acting Aranesp.
I've said for some time that the strength of our legacy franchises is reflected in our durable cash flows. This quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Stable cash flow like this enables us to invest for the long term both internally and externally, while at the same time returning significant cash to our shareholders. 
We continue to invest globally in the long-term success of our newly launched products, which we expect will generate meaningful revenues over time. In cardiovascular, the Phase III results from our recent Repatha coronary imaging study constitute one more success in our clinical development program for this molecule. This study demonstrates the powerful effect of Repatha on atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries, the major underlying cause of cardiovascular disease and the leading cause of death worldwide. This is especially impressive considering that these results were generated on top of maximized statin therapy. Cardiovascular outcomes data, which are expected in the first quarter next year, will obviously be important for Repatha and should definitively establish the importance of this therapy for those at risk of cardiovascular disease.
In oncology, the Neulasta Onpro Kit continues to impress adopters in the marketplace, and this has proven to be a very successful launch. Multiple myeloma is a rapidly changing field where we've proven Kyprolis to be the superior proteasome inhibitor for relapsed multiple myeloma patients. We're focused on growing Kyprolis in this important segment around the world, and early launch results in Europe are encouraging, especially in Germany.
With respect to our innovative pipeline, our focus remains on addressing unmet medical needs with innovative medicines that make a big difference for patients.
Our next wave of new medicines is set to do just that. In neuroscience, we've already reported successful pivotal studies with our migraine medicine, erenumab, in both chronic and episodic migraine. This is a potentially life-changing medicine for migraine sufferers, and we're pleased to be in the lead position in the CGRP class.
Rounding out our franchise in bone health, we recently shared more clinical data on our novel bone-building agent, romosozumab. Experts in the field are excited about the potential of romosozumab, and we look forward to our PDUFA date in July.
In biosimilars, AMJEVITA, which is of course our biosimilar to adalimumab, is our first approval among the many biosimilar programs that we expect will help generate long-term growth at Amgen. As you know, we're in litigation with AbbVie over AMJEVITA, and it's safe to say that there will be more litigation before there's a launch. Given the pace of that litigation, it's unlikely that this matter will be clarified in time for us to launch in 2017.
We've also successfully completed Phase III studies in 2 more biosimilars and look forward to their regulatory progress.
While talking about R&D, I want to say also a few words about the health care debate in the United States. I think it's obvious that this debate is not going to dissipate anytime soon and that all of us in the community must work together to find more affordable health care solutions.
But as we seek to do that, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that it's the economic and societal burden of disease that is the enemy. Innovative biopharmaceutical drugs are for the promise of addressing that burden.
We're at the dawn of a very exciting era for innovation. We see that today in cancer, we see it in cardiovascular medicine, and I think it we'll see it in Alzheimer's and other devastating illnesses as well. But if we're to advance promising new medicines, we'll have to do that with an eye to both the price and the value of these therapies, and we must do it in a way that maintains the role of physicians in making the best decisions for patients.
We price our products to offer strong value proposition for patients, payers and providers. We believe the differentiated efficacy of our products enables us to take a leading role in our industry in structuring value-based partnerships for our medicines. We accept that our products need to deliver clear benefit for our customers and accept that we shouldn't be rewarded when they do not.
We have value-based contracts in place with a number of payers already and expect to do more. While the regulatory environment is complex in this area today, making each individual contract challenging and time-consuming to put in place, we expect to see more and more value-based contracts arise as one of the ways of enabling more patients to gain access to the right innovative medicines for their ailments at the right time. We don't have all the solutions obviously at Amgen, but we're committed to working with others to address challenges and improve the short and long-term health of our society as a whole.
Shifting gears, we have a strong balance sheet and the flexibility and willingness to invest in external innovation. We're active in our review of opportunities, principally in our core therapeutic categories, and we're disciplined as to the price that we'll pay for assets.
Of late, we've seen better opportunities to create value with earlier stage assets. For example, in immuno-oncology, which is of course a focus area for us, we expanded our arsenal during the quarter with a collaboration with Advaxis as well as through the reacquisition of BiTE molecule to BCMA target for multiple myeloma from Boehringer Ingelheim. We also expanded our cardiovascular franchise with an early-stage collaboration with Arrowhead.
Wrapping up, I'd offer that the long-term prospects of our business are bright, and I want to thank our teams around the world for their continuing focus on serving patients. David?"

Turning to the third quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, revenues of $5.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year. This quarter, we saw steady product sales performance anniversary-ing against the strong third quarter comparis",753,"Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the third quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck, revenues of $5.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year. This quarter, we saw steady product sales performance anniversary-ing against the strong third quarter comparison last year. Other revenues at $295 million increased $88 million versus the third quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited primarily from milestone payments, notably a milestone received related to the approval of Kyprolis in Japan.
Changes in foreign exchange had less than a 1% negative impact to total revenue and product sales in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating income at $2.9 billion grew 9% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by over 4 points to 52.9% for the quarter, reflecting continued revenue performance and favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 0.5 points to 13%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling price partially offset by product mix.
Research and development expenses at $963 million decreased by 11% versus last year, driven primarily by lower spending required to support certain late-stage clinical programs and transformation and process improvement efforts, partially offset by increases in upfront payments for several in-licensing transactions.
SG&A expenses increased 1% on a year-over-year basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches, primarily in international markets, were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% year-over-year. Other income and expenses were a net of $109 million expense in Q3. This is favorable by $38 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year favorability was primarily due to gains in the third quarter from rebalancing our investment portfolio. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, a 0.9-point increase versus Q3 of 2015. This increase reflects unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings offset by the benefit of the federal R&D credit in 2016.
Non-GAAP net income increased 9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2015. We deployed $0.7 billion to repurchase 4.4 million shares in the quarter. Our year-to-date repurchases now total $2 billion at an average of $157 per share.
We continue to plan on repurchases of up to $3 billion in total this year. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year.
In October 2016, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the share repurchase authorization to $5 billion. Cash and investments totaled $38 billion, an increase of approximately $7 billion from last year's third quarter level. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow and the net effect of the third quarter debt issuance. Our debt balance stands at $35.3 billion as of September 30. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 12 years.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects continued conviction in executing our strategy and business performance through the first 3 quarters of this year.
As a reminder, we expect to see an increase in operating expenses in Q4 versus Q3, reflecting the typical pattern for the business. With respect to our updated guidance, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.6 billion to $22.8 billion versus prior guidance of $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion. And our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $11.40 to $11.55 per share versus prior guidance of $11.10 to $11.40. Finally, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% and capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.
In summary, our performance in 2016 remains on track. In this regard, we will be providing 2017 guidance in our January call. We continue to be on track to meet our commitments through 2018 based on our balanced portfolio of launch, growth and legacy products along with steady progress in expenses due to our transformation efforts. This concludes the financial update. I'd like to turn the call over now to Tony."
24816,405160725,1066309,"Amgen Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and you'll find a summary about the performance of the third quarter on Slide #10. Our total revenues increased 2% year-over-year as we continue to drive strong volume growth, as Bob said, across several important brands including Prolia",1313,"Thank you, David, and you'll find a summary about the performance of the third quarter on Slide #10. Our total revenues increased 2% year-over-year as we continue to drive strong volume growth, as Bob said, across several important brands including Prolia, Sensipar, XGEVA, Nplate and Vectibix. And we're bringing on new products, notably Kyprolis and Repatha, to more patients in more markets. These gains were offset by declines in our legacy products primarily due to competition, along with the negative impact in changes in inventory levels. 
In the U.S., our product sales declined 1% year-over-year, and internationally, product sales grew 4% or 7% including -- excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This performance was fueled by 12% volume growth. Let me start with an update on how we're executing the life cycle management strategies across our mature brands beginning with Neulasta. Neulasta treats cancer patients who had risk of febrile neutropenia. Each year, around 100,000 patients in the U.S. are hospitalized due to potentially fatal febrile neutropenia. Not only are these hospitalizations costly to our health care system and potentially devastating to patients, but they also result in potential excessive use of broad spectrum antibiotics, which can contribute to hospital-based antibiotic resistance. This is a prime example of how innovative medicines can deliver value to the health care system. Year-over-year, Neulasta declined 5% due to a small segment complex [ph] in the U.S. along with increased competition in our international business.
We continue to see strong performance from our Onpro delivery kit to the U.S. and are on track to exit 2016 at close to 30% market share.
The Onpro delivery kit is a clear example of our commitment to innovation, to improve the quality of patient care throughout the product life cycle.
Onpro improves the patient experience by eliminating the need to return to a doctor's office the day after chemotherapy for a Neulasta injection. This translates to increased value for providers, patients and payers. We expect adoption of this device to continue. The short-acting filgrastim market in the U.S. continue to behave as expected with the entrance of a short-acting biosimilar in September last year. NEUPOGEN declined 36% year-over-year mainly due to this [ph] competition. We continue to compete account by account and hold 55% of the short-acting market as we exit the third quarter. 
Turning to our ESA business. Aranesp increased 8% year-over-year, mainly due to growth in the U.S. dialysis segment. We have successfully transitioned over 80% of the ESA used in independent and midsize dialysis centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. We don't expect much further transition to Aranesp moving forward.
EPOGEN declined 31% year-over-year. The largest driver was conversion to by MIRCERA by Fresenius, which began in earnest in the fourth quarter of 2015. We don't expect a short-acting biosimilar entrant until late next year at the earliest.
Now to Enbrel, where segment growth remains strong in both rheumatology and dermatology. Our primary focus is in rheumatology, which represents in excess of 80% of our business, where Enbrel offers a very effective efficacy and safety profile as well as a strong economic value. Enbrel sales were unchanged year-over-year driven by several factors. Firstly, volume declined due to increased competition. Sequentially, on a value basis, we maintained share in rheumatology and lost 1 percentage point to dermatology. Competition in these segments continues to intensify.
Secondly, we experienced a negative impact from changes in inventory levels. Both of these dynamics were offset by positive changes in net selling price. You'll recall that changes in net selling price comprise several components, including changes to list price as well as impacts from rebates we provide to payers, including those related to their former decisions.
Enbrel is another example of our focus on innovation, where we continue to pursue additional indications, including one for children suffering from chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. We're also investing in novel delivery systems to help patients with chronic inflammatory diseases to more effectively and efficiently inject themselves and ensure optimal therapy over the treatment period. We will continue to compete on a payer contracting basis to maximize patient access to Enbrel. In highly competitive markets, PBMs can require incremental rebates from us in order for us to maintain our formulary positioning.
Maintaining our formulary positioning is essential to ensure patients have access to a drug like Enbrel, which has the longest in-market history of efficacy and safety. Given this dynamic and present contract negotiations, we expect relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017. Sensipar grew 18% year-over-year driven by net selling price and strong unit growth globally. We look forward to positive European approval and are working with the FDA to obtain our approval in the U.S. Prolia delivered strong growth of 18% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw the typical seasonality in quarter 3 with a decline of 14%. Prolia remains an important growth driver, and we continue to invest to realize its full potential.
Volume growth continued at nearly 20% in both the U.S. and the EU as we continue to capture share across these markets.
XGEVA showed continued volume growth of about 7% year-on-year, and we were pleased to see the recent results of the successful Phase III trial with XGEVA in multiple myeloma.
About half of the patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma will develop renal impairment, limiting the options for skeletal-growth-related events. We look forward to bringing XGEVA to these patients who until recently had no other option.
Vectibix and Nplate continue to deliver double-digit growth driven mainly by volume gains. Vectibix also benefited in this quarter from shipments to our Japanese partner, which can fluctuate throughout the year.
Let me now turn to our launch products, notably Repatha and Kyprolis. Both products represent substantial opportunities as they address serious diseases with significant unmet needs. Starting with our cardiovascular franchise. Corlanor helped us to establish our presence in cardiovascular space and better understand the cardiology community. Corlanor was approved to prevent rehospitalization, one of the single largest costs in health care system and thus offers a strong value proposition for chronic heart failure patients. It is also now been included in the Heart Failure Guidelines. Nonetheless, Corlanor sales have been modest to date as it faces steep payer hurdles.
We do not expect a dramatic change in this trend in the near future. As for Repatha, we are working with payers and providers to allow unlabeled [ph] patient access. We've seen some minor improvements in the utilization management criteria, but high hurdles remain for both physicians and patients to gain access. We are very pleased with the Repatha GLAGOV results, which Sean will discuss in a moment. We believe that GLAGOV, along with the expected positive outcomes data from the FOURIER data -- or from the FOURIER study in the first quarter 2017, will certainly strengthen Repatha's value proposition.
We look forward to having these data included in our label.
Now to Kyprolis. Kyprolis grew 34% year-over-year as we see strong early uptake from key markets in Europe combined with continued growth in the U.S. In Europe, Kyprolis grew 30% year-over-year. Multiple myeloma is a dynamic market with the entrance of new competitors. In the U.S., we lost some share in the third-line plus as a result of these new entrants. However, we expect proteasome inhibition to remain foundational therapy, and we continue to grow and generate volume growth in second line as this segment grows and patients are treated longer.
We are focused on growing second line based on the strong ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data. Both regimens, the triplet and doublet, have been recognized as preferred regimens for second-line treatment in the recently updated NCCN guidelines.
Let me close by thanking our customer-facing teams around the world. Their focus and agility to continue delivering to patients in this highly dynamic environment is inspirational. Let me now pass it to Sean."

We continue to make very good progress in the third quarter with numerous regulatory and pipeline milestones. I'll begin my review with cardiovascular. In September, we received results from our intravascular ultrasound study",1344,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We continue to make very good progress in the third quarter with numerous regulatory and pipeline milestones. I'll begin my review with cardiovascular. In September, we received results from our intravascular ultrasound study in patients with coronary artery disease on intensive statin therapy with the primary and secondary endpoints for MET. From a scientific standpoint, the clear demonstration of a link between the PCSK9 mechanism of action in lowering LDL cholesterol and a reduction in atherosclerotic plaque burden in patients already treated with intensive statin therapy is truly groundbreaking.
We look forward to the presentation of these results at the American Heart Association meetings in New Orleans on November 15, where we will also be hosting an investor event.
We're on track to review the results from our cardiovascular outcome study in the first quarter of next year and anticipate having the data in time for presentation at the American College of Cardiology annual meeting in March.
In heart failure, we reached agreement with the FDA on the key elements of our omecamtiv mecarbil Phase III cardiovascular outcome study through a special protocol assessment. This study will enroll approximately 8,000 chronic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction with the primary endpoint of time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure event.
We're finalizing some of the details of the protocol with global regulators and anticipate enrolling patients early next year. Omecamtiv is being developed in collaboration with Cytokinetics and Servier.
In the earlier stage cardiovascular programs, we recently announced the licensing and collaboration agreements with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize RNA interference therapies for Lp(a) and another undisclosed target. Lp(a) is the target we have gained great confidence in through advanced genetic analyses performed in detail [ph]. We have also recently entered the clinic with an exciting new molecule for heart failure, and our ASGR1 program in atherosclerosis continues to move forward in its preclinical phase.
Turning to oncology, I'll begin with Kyprolis. In Q3, we received the results of the CLARION study, which we have the opportunity to discuss at length in our conference call. I would stress that we are committed to advancing Kyprolis into a first-line therapy, and we're close to finalizing a study design focused on the combination of Kyprolis, Revlimid and dexamethasone in transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, where we have seen very encouraging data from large investigator-sponsored studies. In fact, today, many of the thought leaders in the field considered KRd the standard of care for first-line patients.
We're also exploring other combination studies including with some of the newer therapies, and we're currently in discussions with Janssen to cofund the study of carfilzomib in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We're also currently supplying drug to Janssen for their Phase Ib dose-finding combination study.
Before leaving Kyprolis, I'm pleased to report we've completed enrollment in the Phase III study of weekly administration in the third-line setting and expect those results next year.
We're also advancing a reformulated oprozomib molecule into the clinic in order to rapidly and definitively assess the potential to develop an oral proteasome inhibitor with the benefit risk profile that would be superior to existing oral proteasome therapy. We recently have the opportunity to review the results of the study of XGEVA in the prevention of bone complications in the multiple myeloma population, and we're pleased to report the study met its primary endpoint of noninferiority to zoledronic acid in the time to first skeletal-related event. This was expected. The efficacy was similar between the agents, but in addition, the renal safety profile, particularly important in the multiple myeloma population, favored the XGEVA arm. 
Recall that XGEVA is not currently indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in the multiple myeloma population, and we look forward to discussing label updates with global regulators. In our immuno-oncology program, BLINCYTO, our CD19 BiTE, continues to make a meaningful impact on the lives of certain ALL patients. And in 3Q, the FDA expanded the indication to include the pediatric setting. The addition of a novel immunotherapy like BLINCYTO is an important advance for these patients where the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies can lead to long-term consequences such as secondary malignancies.
We're also initiating several Phase III studies of BLINCYTO in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma including our previously announced combination study with Merck's PD-1 inhibitor, KEYTRUDA. As we investigate the potential for IMLYGIC in combination with other immunotherapies, we recently had the opportunity to present encouraging data from an interim analysis of our Phase II study of IMLYGIC in combination with YERVOY at the European cancer meetings, ESMO. In summary, the data suggests that the combination of IMLYGIC and YERVOY has greater efficacy than either agent alone in stage IIIb-IV melanoma patients without any additional safety burden. This study is expected to complete later this year and will be submitted for presentation at a medical meeting in 2017.
Our combination studies of IMLYGIC with the anti-PD-1 antibody KEYTRUDA continue to enroll. We also reacquired the rights to AMG 420, a Phase 1 BiTE construct directed against B-cell maturation antigen or BCMA, a multiple myeloma target that had been licensed to Boehringer Ingelheim prior to our acquisition of Micromet. And finally, we announced a preclinical collaboration with Advaxis on a unique, innovative and bespoke approach to generating immune responses against patient-specific tumor neoantigens.
In our bone health programs, a Phase III study of Prolia compared with risedronate in patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment met all primary and secondary endpoints. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is a small and medically important indication for men and women often under the care of rheumatologists and we will discuss in our label update with regulators soon.
Last month, data from the romosozumab Phase III placebo-controlled fracture study, FRAME, was presented at the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Feedback from the bone community was very positive, and there's a clear desire for new innovative anabolic therapies for the treatment of osteoporosis.
FDA has accepted our romosozumab file, and along with our partner, UCB, we look forward to continued interactions as we work toward our July '17 PDUFA date. We also expect to conduct the primary analysis of the Phase III active control fracture study, ARCH, in the first half of next year. 
In neuroscience, we continue to advance our CGRP receptor antibody erenumab for migraine prophylaxis in collaboration with Novartis. We successfully completed the first of 2 Phase III studies in the episodic migraine setting. 70 milligrams of subcutaneous erenumab administered monthly resulted in the statistically and clinically significant reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days with a safety profile similar to placebo. We'll see the results of the second Phase III study in episodic migraine by the end of this year. 
We also presented the positive results from our Phase IIb chronic migraine study at the European Headache and Migraine Trust International Congress. This was a robust study in more than 650 patients experiencing 18 migraine days per month at baseline. And we believe the results of this study, combined with our 2 Phase III studies in episodic migraine, could support registration for both chronic and episodic migraine indications. In nephrology, Parsabiv received a positive opinion in Europe for the prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, and we look forward to receiving market authorization in the EU. In the U.S., we are working with FDA toward an approval.
Finally, we received our first biosimilar approval in Q3 for AMJEVITA, our biosimilar HUMIRA, which was approved in all eligible indications of the referenced product. We also began enrolling Phase III studies for our biosimilar rituximab, ABP 798 in both rheumatoid arthritis and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and our biosimilar infliximab, ABP 710, in rheumatoid arthritis. 
As we move toward the end of the year, we still have some important work ahead of us. And as always, I'd like to thank our staff for their efforts to combat serious disease.

With regards to the IVUS results and sort of reading them through to CV outcomes, there's obviously no formula for that. What I would say is that the scientific hypothesis behind the program is that we would see a similar impact on atherosclerotic disease and, hence, outcome measures from lowering LDL by a given amount with this mechanism as we would if we did it with statin. And obviously here, patients are already maxed out on statin therapy and you're doing something you otherwise couldn't do, which is to lower LDL substantially beyond that. But the hypothesis would be that you would see a reduction in the impact of atherosclerotic disease that would be generally similar because the mechanisms are very similar. And I think that the positive IVUS study increases one's confidence about that hypothesis substantially. As you know, the human genetics, which we tend to focus on a lot here at Amgen, were a very strong indicative of that already, but the IVUS data give much, much more confidence. So I generally expect to see something that's generally similar to what we might expect to see if we were reducing LDL in the PCSK9 outcomes trial were possible to do so on top of existing maxed out statin therapy with statin. So that's kind of how I think about it."

There's a lot of very sort of noncausal indirect evidence to suggest that those macrophages do play an important role in tumor genesis and maintaining surveillance -- evading surveillance of the immune system. So I think a very interesting target and something that no one could imagine being synergistic with checkpoint inhibition. There are, of course, tumor types that tend to have much more infiltration of these macrophages, where you can demonstrate, in fact, that prognosis is related to an individual patient by the numbers or density of these infiltrating macrophages. So we tended to focus on some of those tumor types. I wouldn't necessarily get into on this call exactly what tumor types we're exploring because we're doing -- we're in the early stages, so we're looking at lots of different tumor types in kind of mixed population studies.

So we've made a strategic decision to file in some parts of the world with both studies, and that has to do with payer access determinations and so on. But I think that you are right that, of course, any time we do studies on our products, regulators are interested to see them, mainly to be -- and we often are interested in getting those changes into the label or they're interested in them from a safety perspective and so on. I think that one thing we have to recognize is that this study is designed to be analyzed first based on a time-driven basis, and that's what we're talking about when we talk about the primary analysis that comes in the first half of next year. And then because we never are sure about the event rate that we're going to experience in these kind of trials, there's an event-driven analysis, for example, for nonvertebral fracture which would come later if we don't hit it based on the time-based analysis. So that's important to understand. And then finally, I would say that this is a very high hurdle. No one's done an active controlled fracture trial like this before that's actually powered and designed to actually show fracture results from the get-go. And it produces a high hurdle. It was our feeling that we needed to be able to demonstrate that the product could be superior to a strategy of using alendronate. And so that's the idea behind having this second study, largely, again, to work with payers."

There's a lot of pressure in the highly competitive environment, specifically with the anti-TNFs where we have to put large rebates on the table to maintain our formulary position. The large rebates are clearly impacting net selling price. So let me just go back and say that as we think about 2017, we will see little impact on net selling price for Enbrel. Demand will be driven by what happens in the marketplace, and the trends are as they are in terms of the market share at the moment and in terms of the TRxs. As regards to some of the value-based contracts we have, there is a contract in the Northeast where we've talked about a value-based contract with Repatha around a guaranteed level of lipid lowering, specifically linked to Repatha and our ability to lower lipids.

And if you compare it to an area like oncology, the amount of work that's going on in terms of innovative mechanisms that are directed at heart failure is night and day. There's very little -- for example, there's absolutely no competition in the space of something that would be an ionotropic positive contractile mechanism like omecamtiv. So I think there's a huge opportunity and in particular, just from a purely medical perspective, this has been kind of the Holy Grail in heart failure, is to try and get something that actually can increase the efficiency of the squeeze that the living cardiac tissue can provide without increasing myocardial oxygen demand resulting in arrhythmic death. So we believe at this point that we have a very compelling Phase II experience and a lot of very sophisticated human physiologic experiments that we've done to understand how the product is working, we understand deeply at a molecular level. And I think that the PK is an important feature and one of the reasons that it's taken us the time it has to get the product into Phase III is this kind of classic, really tough, relatively narrow window of small molecule drug development. And we had to come up with a formulation that was well behaved and also a drug testing strategy that can be implemented in the clinic to assess. So we have a titrated regimen where our patients get started on a dose and they get the blood test to see what level they're at once they're steady state, and some proportion of patients get increased to a higher dose to ensure that everybody is in the therapeutic range. And I think we've demonstrated very convincingly that we can keep all the patients out of the range where you're getting too much of the mechanism, too much pharmacodynamic effect and not enough relaxation time. So bottom line is I think it's an extremely important program, and I think that it will -- these programs are inherently long term because you can't -- unlike Repatha where we could get at least onto the market from the surrogate, you have to have a mortality and morbidity outcomes trial just to gain market. But I'm very pleased that we are advancing this mechanism, and we have a lot of interest in heart failure throughout our whole pipeline."

That's where we were able to demonstrate the doubling of PFS versus Velcade. So that base regimen plus daratumumab is -- versus the regimen alone is what we're thinking about looking at. And you can imagine that this could be an extremely attractive regimen to have Kyprolis, dex and daratumumab as a relapsed/refractory agent available to patients who've been treated with oftentimes drugs like Revlimid and steroids and Velcade in the first-line of therapy. So I think that's an obvious place for us to look at that kind of combination therapy, and that's what we're focused on. In the big picture, I would say that we will be looking -- remember how rapidly moving this field has been in multiple myeloma and how many new entrants have come in place. There's also a potential role for immunotherapy here with the checkpoint inhibitors, so we're doing studies with that. So it's going to continue to be a rapidly evolving field, and we remain confident that proteasome inhibition is going to be a backbone component of regimens and that because of the limitations that are inherent in trying to treat with a drug that causes the kind of peripheral neuropathy that occurs with pertuzumab will end up playing an important role in the treatment regimens for sure."

We think the proposition itself is flawed, and so we are joined in our view by most of the major newspapers in California, a very large number of the veterans groups as well. I think even frankly many of the major California public entities have also come out against Proposition 61. So we're working hard to try to make sure that people understand the reasons why we don't think this is in the interest of the citizens of the State of California. Obviously, this is a populist topic at the moment, Cory, so we think it's important to shed light on it here in California and wherever else there might be a similar ballot initiated risk because I think, fundamentally, what we support, as I described earlier, is the role of innovative biopharmaceuticals to try and address what is the villain here, which is the economic and social burden of serious disease. And we think innovative therapies are the way to help address that problem and any initiative that might have the unintended consequences of Proposition 61 could have to funding of innovative R&D is something we look at very carefully and share our concerns about."

You have a Phase II/III study listed in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for continuous infusion. Now you've got the BI product which is continuous infusion and also subcutaneous administration, I believe.

So can you discuss the BiTE strategy, particularly against targets where there are fully human BiTE-specific antibodies and cell therapies also being directed to those targets?"

I think it's -- first of all, I mean, we currently have the ability to develop the very short half-life molecules or much longer half-life versions of these constructs. And we've that in place for some time now. And so we make choices between those depending on particular circumstances. Now obviously with a molecule like BLINCYTO that's already approved, the thing that we're doing there is looking at induction regimens where an intensive treatment with an intravenous administration for a limited period of time would be acceptable if we were going to drive people into very low minimal residual disease positive state. But it is true that for many solid tumor settings, for example, the development that we would pursue would be with the half-life extended versions of the BiTE. So in the big picture, it turns out interestingly that for some of these molecules when they're being used in hematologic malignancy settings and there's a real potential for these kind of cytokine storm syndromes, the ability to actually turn the drug's infusion off and have it dissipate out of the system in a matter of minutes is a huge advantage. And so that's something that you need to take into account. But we do, as we develop these against targets in solid tumors, we ultimately -- and even in settings like lymphoma, you may see us do something with a short-acting BiTE and follow in as a sort of next generation with the half-life extended version."
