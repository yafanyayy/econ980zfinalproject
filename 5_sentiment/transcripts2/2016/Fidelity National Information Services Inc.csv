Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report we exited 2015 with solid momentum as the team is focused on execution and driving further improvements in our cost structure and overall performance, delivering continued earnings growth. We're in the right markets empowering our clients of all sizes, whether here in the U.S. with community and regional banks or globally. Our long-term strategy has consistently driven year-over-year performance results, and we remain committed to our strategy. 
Turning to Slide 5. We continue to build global scale in 2015, finalizing our acquisitions of SunGard and finishing the year with revenue increasing 7% on a constant currency basis to $6.6 billion, growing adjusted EBITDA 8% on a constant currency basis to $2 billion and producing adjusted earnings per share of 6% on a constant currency basis to $3.22. We generated $921 million free cash flow and returned $605 million to shareholders. Strategically, we are investing in the business to deliver long-term growth and superior shareholder returns. We are entering 2016 focused on 3 growth drivers. First, the acquisition of SunGard broadens our solution portfolio, allowing us to expand into new and adjacent markets and provide deeper value to our clients. Second, we will continue to capitalize on our expanded skill, operating leverage and a disciplined integration to drive earnings growth. Third, our strong cash flow generation allows us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 6. Our SunGard acquisition, which closed on November 30, is a meaningful value creator for FIS. As we have discussed in the past, the industry is continuing to move towards fewer providers due to the complexity of solutions and regulatory oversight. As a result, our strategy has been to continue to expand our broad array of IP-led products built for the financial services industry, augmented with the right transformation services components needed to bridge the gap between these complex systems in the new digital age. The SunGard acquisition is another key component in implementing these overall strategy. In addition to opening complimentary new markets, this combination positively impacts our revenue mix, creating a more profitable product-centric revenue base in the ability to accelerate margin expansion by implementing our leading go-to-market delivery approach as well as significant cost savings around administration and technology expenses. This acquisition expands beyond our traditional retail banking and payments footprint into the institutional and wholesale side of the financial solutions as well as other buy-side organizations. On a combined basis, our share of wallet with our common global clients increased dramatically due to these combination, allowing us to become a more strategic solution provider. This comment has been substantiated multiple times over the last 60 days as we've engaged with many of our global question regarding the combination. The benefits of the transaction do not stop with our global banks. It also significantly expands our existing solutions and client base in wealth management, treasury and corporate payments. These are in high demand among our regional and community institutions and has been a significant focus area for FIS as our clients look for ways to replace their fee revenue due to continuing regulatory changes and increased oversight. As we look at the December results for SunGard, we are pleased with the momentum the sales organization maintained throughout the month and are also pleased with the health of the overall pipeline that we acquired. While still early, we're also excited about how the sales teams are collaborating and building further opportunities within our robust clients set which further substantiates the strategy on why we put these 2 companies together. Finally, this transaction brings very strong talent in increased leadership to FIS with market-specific expertise. This further positions FIS as the clear leader in financial technology globally, strengthening our ability to deliver for our clients and help them grow their business. 
Turning to Slide 7. Based on the significant strategic rationale discussed, the overall alignment has been equally strong given both companies' DNA is centered on development products for financial services. This cultural alignment allowed us to accelerate our integration efforts, and we are very pleased with our initial progress integrating these 2 great companies. For example, have already rolled out a streamlined organizational structure, transitioned our North American payroll and benefits plans and completed the rollout of the rebranding of SunGard. Given our current pace and results to date, we are ahead to exit 2016 at our synergy run rate goal of $100 million and are confident in our ability to exit 2017 with the synergy run rate of $200 million. FIS has a proven track record of meeting or exceeding our synergy targets. And based on progress to date, this record will continue. While that wraps up my comments regarding the strategy and integration of SunGard, the company had other notable successes in support of our growth. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing some of these key results. 
Turn to Slide 8 to review the segment highlights. Our Integrated Financial Solutions business continue to cross-sell and upsell additional products and services through our North American client base, leveraging the strength of our portfolio. In particular, we saw a continued demand for our digital solutions, well and -- production and institutions of all sizes. In addition, the expanded our relationship with large online retailer in the fourth quarter, resulting in double-digit growth in our high-margin network services business. Our mobile business continues its industry-leading position, growing its number of registered users by 19% year-over-year and delivering 27% year-over-year growth in our hosted service model. Overall, our digital finance withdrew -- greater than $250 million in revenue at margins greater than 40%. Card production increased 12% to 112 million cards in closing of a much driving EMV. EMV grew sequentially 15% from Q3 to Q4 in 2015 resulting in full year production of 12.5 million EMV cards. We continue to build traction among mid-tier community institutions, signing several new long-term core process and partnerships in the quarter and for your. The success we saw in core processing signings for the year was almost double the number of deals in 2014. These wins in 2015 create positive benefits for 2016 and beyond. Also in the quarter, we signed the bank with assets greater than $200 billion to consolidate its debit processing and associated fraud-related services. The decision was driven by the banks' desire to improve operating efficiencies and increase service flexibility with a common solution across its expansive retail and direct bank business. This significant multiyear agreement demonstrates FIS' strength in serving the payments needs of institutions of all sizes around the world. 2015 was the transition year for Global Financial Solutions business. We responded to the challenges presented to us in the year whether they were due to global economic issues, overall softness in market demand for people-based services or execution. We made leadership changes to address execution issues and refocus the impacted businesses. Regarding our consulting business, Capco, we're seeing progress in building our pipeline for consultative deals but continue to expect a slow recovery in the first half of 2016 with increased performance in the back half of the year. As we discussed in the strategic rationale for SunGard, our non-product lead business is now make up less than 10% of our total revenue. Globally, our Clear2Pay business showed very strong momentum, growing over 20% for the full year fueled by solid demand for real-time payments and clear competitive differentiation in this space. We acquired Clear2Pay in 2014, with the strategic view of the market direction and is another illustration of how discipline acquisitions and careful integration can enhance our client value proposition in earnings growth profile. During the quarter, our GFS segment signed a bank in North America with assets greater than $100 billion to a new multiyear agreement for a new direct bank, providing an end-to-end integrated solution for core banking, fraud solutions, back office and call center services. This key win underscores our ability to deliver innovative technology solutions that empower our clients to better serve customers in today's digital age. In Brazil, we were encouraged to see 1 of our key clients pursue the purchase of a large card portfolio expanding their franchise for future growth even in a difficult macroeconomic environment. This acquisition expands our ongoing business in Brazil, and we are already seeing the benefit of revenue stream as we provide professional services expertise to on-board these accounts in the back half of the year. In Europe, we continue to show positive sales momentum, especially in the U.K. and Germany, where we saw important wins across the year that will fuel continued growth in 2016. Our strategy within the region is building momentum around over expand the relationships by leveraging existing strengths within the FIS and SunGard portfolios. We are making strong progress in the sincere engagement. We have recently delivered the new platform which is a key milestone in the project. Testing is underway and we now plan to migrate customers on to the new platform later this year. We are proud of our partnership with this client, and we look forward to empowering them as our strategic technology partner over the next decade. We also signed the first all-digital bank in the U.K. as we help this client prepare for their upcoming loans in 2016. Asia continued to have a strong growth throughout 2015. And we are pleased at the SunGard acquisition more than doubles our sales force in the region, which allows us to continue to address the demand for FIS products and services throughout the high-growth region. 
Turning next to Slide 9. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize by emphasizing that our competitive positioning is strong, and our long-term earnings growth story remains intact. To meet our 2016 note growth and financial performance goals, we will continue to focus on driving profitable growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders and continued acceleration of our integration efforts. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Woody for additional detail on how the financial results for the quarter and full year. Woody?"

I'll begin with Slide 11 on the summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year of 2015. The fourth quarter and full year results included the impact of the SunGard transaction, which closed on November 30. Tho",1062,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin with Slide 11 on the summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year of 2015. The fourth quarter and full year results included the impact of the SunGard transaction, which closed on November 30. Those results are reported in the GFS segment. Today, unless otherwise specified, I'll be referencing percentage changes in our metrics on a constant currency basis. Also, reconciliations of non-GAAP measures can be found in our press release and our earnings deck, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. In the fourth quarter, revenue increased $1.9 billion or 18% and adjusted EBITDA increased 21% to $624 million. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 13% to $278 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.93. In the quarter, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by $63 million, EBITDA by $12 million and earnings per share by $0.02. For the year, revenue increased 7% to $6.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $2 billion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased $930 million, a 6% increase; and adjusted earnings per share was $3.22. For the year, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by $243 million, EBITDA about $45 million and earnings per share about $0.07. 
I will now continue on Slide 12 for segment results. In the fourth quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue grew 4.4% on a normalized basis to $1 billion. EBITDA was 3% -- EBITDA increased 3% to $405 million compared to the prior-year period. We are pleased with the results of the segment and the underlying business continues to perform well. For the year, IFS revenue on a normalized basis increased 3% to $3.9 billion, and EBITDA increased 2% to $1.6 billion. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our IFS growth was driven by digital and risk solutions and by increase in EMV card production volumes. Regarding revenue composition remains very high in IFS. 
Turning to Slide 14. In the fourth quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue increased 38% to $902 million. SunGard contributed approximately $300 million of revenue and approximately $100 million of EBITDA. Excluding SunGard on a normalized basis, GFS revenue decreased 3%. This decrease was driven primarily by softness in professional services demand and a difficult comp to the prior-year period. GFS adjusted EBITDA increased to $259 million, representing a 58% increase. EBITDA growth in the quarter was driven by restructuring cost actions taken in the first half of the year and the inclusion of SunGard for 1 month. For the year, GFS revenue increased 16% to $2.7 billion. Excluding SunGard on a normalized basis, revenue grew 3%. EBITDA increased 25% to $629 million. 
Moving to Slide 15. We are presenting the results in the region including SunGard to give some player their regional impacts, although we know that SunGard's impact is on the for 1 month. Given that, my following commentary on the regions excludes SunGard and focuses on the GFS segment standalone performance. For the fourth quarter, North America decline approximately $50 million to $252 million. Almost half this decline was a result of the previously discussed contract nonrenewal followed by continued softness in professional service demand and a difficult license sale comparable in the prior-year period. For the year, North America revenues were $1.1 billion. As for the nonrenewal of the contract, full year revenue decreased 1% reflecting professional services softness in the second half of the year. In the quarter, Europe grew 1% to $198 million. For the year, Europe revenues increased 14% to $757 million. The fourth quarter results include the anniversary of our Clear2Pay acquisition and the impact of softness for people-based services in Europe. We are pleased about the results in Latin America and the contract expansion in Brazil is a nice win in the quarter and should help Latin America in 2016 in spite of difficult macroeconomic background. As Gary indicated earlier, we remain bullish on the long-term impact of the Asia Pacific region. The team has done a nice job of growing the business in this region. The addition of SunGard gives greater contribution from IP-led solutions, which we believe improves the visibility and predictability of results for this segment. 
Moving to Slide 16. For the quarter, free cash flow inquiries 12% to $399 million or 143% conversion of net earnings. And for the year, free cash flow increased 7% to $921 million or 99% conversion of net earnings. We are highly focused on paying down debt and deleveraging the balance sheet. The effective tax rate increased to 33.4% for the quarter compared to 32.6% in the prior-year period, driven by acquisition-related items. For the full year, the effective tax rate was 33.1%. 
Moving to Slide 17. In 2016 and going forward, we will report revenue growth on an organic basis. Organic revenue, excluding impact of acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency translation. We believe this will give better visibility in the underlying operating results of the business. For 2016, we expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%; adjusted EBITDA of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion dollars; adjusted earnings per share of $3.70 to $3.80, representing growth of 15% to 18%. Free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. As we think about the quarter-to-quarter flow of the operating plan, we generally expect 15% to 18% EPS growth each quarter and expect the impact of synergies and interest savings to increase over the course of the year. There is more information regarding our planning assumptions in the Appendix material, but I will highlight a handful of them here. We assumed net interest expense of approximately $370 million, in 2016 effective tax rate of approximately 35%. We believe that by implementing tax planning strategies over the next tax rate down by 200 basis points or more. Capital expenditures approximately 6% of revenue, reaffirming our goal of exiting 2016 with $100 million or more in run rate cost synergies. 
Moving to Slide 18. In conclusion, I'm highly confident in our operating plan and our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016 and 2017. We remain focused on multiyear earnings growth and cash generation and believe our business model will create long-term shareholder value, and we continue to invest for growth and strive for leadership in the markets that we serve. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

The pipelines are growing, the teams are executing. They're very excited about being a part of FIS, and I think that's relating into client base. I can't tell you why many comments I've got over the last 60 days from clients just talking about being up under FIS, our ability to invest in focus for the long-term. And to the customers are receiving it well. Our sales teams are receiving it well, and that's project into the results. So we feel really good about the. The secret is going to be as now since November 30, as we started to put our sales teams together and they started to have some conversations about joint selling into their account, we're also seeing some good traction there. Not only in the Global Financial Solutions but as I said, when you look at Treasury and wealth and many of the products at that SunGard had other applicable for regional and community banks, what you're seeing to see strong traction there as well. And then, of course, as you know, our consulting groups started in the capital markets area of the industry, and so being able to wrap that kind of consultant gave consultative engagement around products is going to be differentiating for us going forward."

But as you know in the consulting business, that's all about building your pipeline and filling it. And that's in fulfilling -- that's 1 of the things that we changed significantly. What we have done in Capco historically, we've gotten a very large transformational engagement. And we took our eye of the ball of the base business of consulting in my opinion. So we've retooled the leadership there, got them refocused on executing more of these up leadership, consulting engagements. We've seen nice uptick of pipeline. We've actually seen stress come into Q1 with delivery. So we've got to continue that, obviously and continue that growth. But it's going to be much more back to what we picked up in the original Capco acquisition, which is more transformational consulting, where we're doing engagements, more short term in nature around that leadership and how to transform various functions of the financial institution and then allow us to pool in more product IP instead of some of the large lower margin bodyshop type of deployments that we've gotten into.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that we exited 2015 with solid momentum, as the team's focused on execution and driving further improvements in our cost structure and overall performance, delivering continued earnings growth. We're in the right markets empowering our clients of all sizes, whether here in the U.S. with community and regional banks or globally. Our long-term strategy has consistently driven year-over-year performance results, and we remain committed to our strategy. 
Turning to Slide 5. We continue to build global scale in 2015, finalizing our acquisition of SunGard and finishing the year with revenue increasing 7% on a constant currency basis to $6.6 billion, growing adjusted EBITDA 8% on a constant currency basis to $2 billion and producing adjusted earnings per share of 6% on a constant currency basis to $3.22. We generated $921 million free cash flow and returned $605 million to shareholders. Strategically, we are investing in the business to deliver long-term growth and superior shareholder returns. We are entering 2016 focused on 3 growth drivers. First, the acquisition of SunGard broadens our solution portfolio, allowing us to expand into new and adjacent markets and provide deeper value to our clients. Second, we will continue to capitalize on our expanded scale, operating leverage and our disciplined integration to drive earnings growth. Third, our strong cash flow generation allows us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 6. Our SunGard acquisition, which closed on November 30, is a meaningful value creator for FIS. As we have discussed in the past, the industry is continuing to move towards fewer providers due to the complexity of solutions and regulatory oversight. As a result, our strategy has been to continue to expand our broad array of IP-led products built for the financial services industry, augmented with the right transformation services components needed to bridge the gap between these complex systems in the new digital age. The SunGard acquisition is another key component in implementing this overall strategy. In addition to opening complementary new markets, this combination positively impacts our revenue mix, creating a more profitable product-centric revenue base, and the ability to accelerate margin expansion by implementing our leading go-to-market delivery approach as well as significant cost savings around administration and technology expenses. This acquisition expands us beyond our traditional retail banking and payments footprint into the institutional and wholesale side of financial solutions as well as other buy-side organizations. On a combined basis, our share of wallet with our common global clients increased dramatically due to this combination, allowing us to become a more strategic solution provider. This comment has been substantiated multiple times over the last 60 days, as we've engaged with many of our global clients regarding the combination. The benefits of the transaction do not stop with our global banks. It also significantly expands our existing solutions and client base in wealth management, treasury and corporate payments. These are in high demand among our regional and community institutions and has been a significant focus area for FIS, as our clients look for ways to replace their fee revenue due to continuing regulatory change and increased oversight. As we look at the December results for SunGard, we are pleased with the momentum the sales organization maintained throughout the month, and are also pleased with the health of the overall pipeline that we acquired. While still early, we're also excited about how the sales teams are collaborating and building further opportunities within our robust client set, which further substantiates the strategy on why we put these 2 companies together. Finally, this transaction brings very strong talent and increased leadership to FIS with market-specific expertise. This further positions FIS as the clear leader in financial technology globally, strengthening our ability to deliver for our clients and help them grow their business. 
Turning to Slide 7. Based on the significant strategic rationale discussed, the cultural alignment is then equally strong given both companies' DNA is centered on developed products for financial services. This cultural alignment has allowed us to accelerate our integration efforts, and we are very pleased with our initial progress integrating these 2 great companies. For example, we have already rolled out a streamlined organizational structure, transitioned our North American payroll and benefits plans and completed the rollout of the rebranding of SunGard. Given our current pace and results to date, we are ahead of schedule to exit 2016 at our synergy run rate goal of $100 million, and are confident in our ability to exit 2017 with the synergy run rate of $200 million. FIS has a proven track record of meeting or exceeding our synergy targets. And based on progress to date, this record will continue. While that wraps up my comments regarding the strategy and integration of SunGard, the company had other notable successes in support of our growth. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing some of these key results. 
Turn to Slide 8 to review the segment highlights. Our Integrated Financial Solutions business continue to cross-sell and upsell additional products and services through our North American client base, leveraging the strength of our portfolio. In particular, we saw a continued demand for our digital solutions, wealth and card production and institutions of all sizes. In addition, we expanded our relationship with large online retailer in the fourth quarter, resulting in double-digit growth in our high-margin network services business. Our mobile business continues its industry-leading position, growing its number of registered users by 19% year-over-year and delivering 27% year-over-year growth in our hosted service model. Overall, our digital finance, we grew to greater than $250 million in revenues at margins greater than 40%. Card production increased 12% to 112 million cards inclusive of a match for a rise in EMV. EMV grew sequentially 15% from Q3 to Q4 in 2015, resulting in a full year production of 12.5 million EMV cards. We continue to build traction among mid-tier community institutions, signing several new long-term core process and partnerships in the quarter and full year. The success we saw in core processing signings for the year was almost double the number of deals in 2014. These wins in 2015 create positive benefits for 2016 and beyond. Also in the quarter, we signed the bank with assets greater than $200 billion to consolidate its debit processing and associated fraud-related services. The decision was driven by the bank's desire to improve operating efficiencies and increase service flexibility with a common solution across its expansive retail and direct bank business. This significant multiyear agreement demonstrates FIS' strength in serving the payment needs of institutions of all sizes around the world. 2015 was the transition year for Global Financial Solutions business. We responded to the challenges presented to us in the year, whether they were due to global economic issues, overall softness in market demand for people-based services or execution. We made leadership changes to address execution issues and refocused the impacted businesses. Regarding our consulting business, Capco, we're seeing progress in building our pipeline for consultative deals, but continue to expect a slow recovery in the first half of 2016, with increased performance in the back half of the year. As we discussed in the strategic rationale for SunGard, our non-product-led business has now make up less than 10% of our total revenue. Globally, our Clear2Pay business showed very strong momentum, growing over 20% for the full year, fueled by solid demand for real-time payments and a clear competitive differentiation in this space. We acquired Clear2Pay in 2014 with the strategic view of the market's direction, and is another illustration of how disciplined acquisitions and careful integration can enhance our client value proposition and earnings growth profile. During the quarter, our GFS segment signed a bank in North America with assets greater than $100 billion to a new multiyear agreement for a new direct bank, providing an end-to-end integrated solution for core banking, fraud solutions, back office and call center services. This key win underscores our ability to deliver innovative technology solutions that empower our clients to better serve their customers in today's digital age. In Brazil, we were encouraged to see one of our key clients pursue the purchase of a large card portfolio, expanding their franchise for future growth even in a difficult macroeconomic environment. This acquisition expands our ongoing business in Brazil, and we are already seeing the benefit of revenue stream, as we provide professional services expertise to onboard these accounts in the back half of the year. In Europe, we continue to show positive sales momentum, especially in the U.K. and Germany, where we saw important wins across the year, that will fuel continued growth in 2016. Our strategy within the region is building momentum around our expanding relationships by leveraging existing strengths within the FIS and SunGard portfolios. We are making strong progress in the Sainsbury engagement. We have recently delivered the new bank platform, which is a key milestone in the project. Testing is underway, and we now plan to start to migrate customers on to the new platform later this year. We are proud of our partnership with this client, and we look forward to empowering them as our strategic technology partner over the next decade. We also signed the first all-digital bank in the U.K. as we help this client prepare for their upcoming launch in 2016. Asia continue to have strong growth throughout 2015. And we are pleased that the SunGard acquisition more than doubles our sales force in the region, which allows us to continue to address the demand for FIS products and services throughout the high-growth region. 
Turning next to Slide 9. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize by emphasizing that our competitive positioning is strong and our long-term earnings growth story remains intact. To meet our 2016 growth and financial performance goals, we will continue to focus on driving profitable growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders and continued acceleration of our integration efforts. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Woody for additional detail on our financial results for the quarter and full year. Woody?"

The fourth quarter and full year results included the impact of the SunGard transaction, which closed on November 30. Tho",1071,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin with Slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year of 2015. The fourth quarter and full year results included the impact of the SunGard transaction, which closed on November 30. Those results are reported in the GFS segment. Today, unless otherwise specified, I'll be referencing percentage changes in our metrics on a constant currency basis. Also, reconciliations of non-GAAP measures can be found in our press release and our earnings deck, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. In the fourth quarter, revenue increased to $1.9 billion or 18%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 21% to $624 million. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 13% to $278 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.93. In the quarter, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by $63 million, EBITDA by $12 million and earnings per share by $0.02. For the year, revenue increased 7% to $6.6 billion, and adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $2 billion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $930 million, a 6% increase, and adjusted earnings per share was $3.22. For the year, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by $243 million, EBITDA about $45 million and earnings per share about $0.07. 
I will now continue on Slide 12 for segment results. In the fourth quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue grew 4.4% on a normalized basis to $1 billion. EBITDA was 3% -- EBITDA increased 3% to $405 million compared to the prior-year period. We are pleased with the results of this segment, and the underlying business continues to perform well. For the year, IFS revenue on a normalized basis increased 3% to $3.9 billion, and EBITDA increased 2% to $1.6 billion. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our IFS growth was driven by our digital and risk solutions and by an increase in EMV card production volumes. Recurring revenue composition remains very high in IFS. 
Turning to Slide 14. In the fourth quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue increased 38% to $902 million. SunGard contributed approximately $300 million of revenue and approximately $100 million of EBITDA. Excluding SunGard on a normalized basis, GFS revenue decreased 3%. This decrease was driven primarily by softness in professional services demand and a difficult comp to the prior-year period. GFS adjusted EBITDA increased to $259 million, representing a 58% increase. EBITDA growth in the quarter was driven by restructuring cost actions taken in the first half of the year and the inclusion of SunGard for 1 month. For the year, GFS revenue increased 16% to $2.7 billion. Excluding SunGard on a normalized basis, revenue grew 3%. EBITDA increased 25% to $629 million. 
Moving to Slide 15. We are presenting the results in the region including SunGard to give some clarity into their regional impacts, although we note that SunGard's impact is only for 1 month. Given that, my following commentary on the regions excludes SunGard and focuses on the GFS segment standalone performance. For the fourth quarter, North America declined approximately $50 million to $252 million. Almost half this decline was a result of the previously discussed contract nonrenewal, followed by continued softness in professional service demand and a difficult license sale comparable in the prior-year period. For the year, North America revenues were $1.1 billion. As with the nonrenewal of the contract, full year revenue decreased 1%, reflecting professional services softness in the second half of the year. In the quarter, Europe grew 1% to $198 million. For the year, Europe revenues increased 14% to $757 million. The fourth quarter results include the anniversary of our Clear2Pay acquisition and the impact of softness for people-based services in Europe. We are pleased about the results in Latin America, and the contract expansion in Brazil is a nice win in the quarter and should help Latin America in 2016 in spite of difficult macroeconomic background. As Gary indicated earlier, we remain bullish on the long-term impact of the Asia Pacific region. The teams have done a nice job of growing the business in this region. The addition of SunGard creates greater contribution from IP-led solutions, which we believe improves the visibility and predictability of results for this segment. 
Moving to Slide 16. For the quarter, free cash flow increased 12% to $399 million or 143% conversion of net earnings. And for the year, free cash flow increased 7% to $921 million or 99% conversion of net earnings. We are highly focused on paying down debt and deleveraging the balance sheet. The effective tax rate increased to 33.4% for the quarter compared to 32.6% in the prior-year period, driven by acquisition-related items. For the full year, the effective tax rate was 33.1%. 
Moving to Slide 17. In 2016 and going forward, we will report revenue growth on an organic basis, organic revenue excluding impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation. We believe this will get better visibility in the underlying operating results of the business. For 2016, we expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%; adjusted EBITDA of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion; adjusted earnings per share of $3.70 to $3.80, representing growth of 15% to 18% free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. As we think about the quarter-to-quarter flow of the operating plan, we generally expect 15% to 18% EPS growth each quarter and expect the impact of synergies and interest savings to increase over the course of the year. There is more information regarding our planning assumptions in the appendix material, but I will highlight a handful of them here. We assumed net interest expense of approximately $370 million and 2016 effective tax rate of approximately 35%. We believe that by implementing tax planning strategies over the next 24 months, we can drive tax rate down by 200 basis points or more, capital expenditures of approximately 6% of revenue, reaffirming our goal of exiting 2016 with $100 million or more in run rate cost synergies. 
Moving to Slide 18. In conclusion, I'm highly confident in our operating plan and our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016 and 2017. We remain focused on multiyear earnings growth and cash generation and believe our business model will create long-term shareholder value. And we continue to invest for growth and strive for leadership in the markets that we serve. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

When I look, they had every opportunity to really take their foot off the gas. I mean, they could have gotten distracted with the combination. We had a lot going on at that time, but things stayed very focused through year-end and executed very well. So that was positive. When I look at the pipeline going into this year, the same thing exists. The pipelines are growing. The teams are executing. They're very excited about being a part of FIS, and I think that's translating in the client base. I can't tell you how many comments I've gotten over the last 60 days from clients just talking about being up under FIS, our ability to invest and focus for the long term. And so the customers are receiving it well. Our sales teams are receiving it well, and that's projecting into the results. So we feel really good about it. The secret's going to be, as now since November 30, as we started to put our sales teams together and they've started to have some conversations about joint selling into their account, we're also seeing some good traction there, not only in the global financial Institutions. But as I said, when you look at treasury and wealth and many of the products that SunGard have that are applicable for regional and community banks, we're seeing to see strong traction there as well. And then, of course, as you know, our consulting groups started in the capital markets area of the industry. And so being able to wrap that kind of consultative engagement around products is going to be differentiating for us going forward."

But as you know in the consulting business, that's all about building your pipeline and filling it. And that's in fulfilling it. That's one of the things that we changed significantly. What we have done in Capco historically, we've gotten the very large transformational engagements, and we took our eye off the ball of the base business of consulting in my opinion. And so we've retooled the leadership there, got them refocused on executing more of the thought leadership, consulting engagements. We've seen nice uptick of pipeline. We've actually seen strength coming into Q1 with delivery. So we've got to continue that obviously and continue that growth. But it's going to be much more back to what we picked up in the original Capco acquisition, which is more transformational consulting, where we're doing engagements, more short term in nature around thought leadership and how to transform various functions of the financial institution, and then allow us to pool in more product IP instead of some of the large lower-margin body shop-type deployments that we've gotten into. Lance has excellent experience on that from his prior life with his former company. He's bringing a great discipline to that process, and we're seeing a lot of improvement early on under his leadership."

Frankly, to your point, it does onboard over time because these are big projects, and it takes time to get them on board. But when you think about Sainsbury, it's going to be kind of a midsummer deployment for what we're calling phase 2 of that project. The final phase will launch in early '17. So very good progress there. We have high confidence in that, and the relationship can't be better and the things are working very well. We also mentioned a U K. digital bank that will launch in Q2 as well. And then the digital bank that you mentioned, greater than $100 billion, that will drive a lot of services work, but that'll be onboarding throughout '16 and into '17. So that's a little later because we didn't sign that until Q4, and those tend to run about anywhere from 12 to 18 months of deployment time.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that we exited 2015 with solid momentum, as the teams focused on execution and driving further improvements in our cost structure and overall performance, delivering continued earnings growth. We're in the right markets empowering our clients of all sizes, whether here in the U.S. with community and regional banks or globally. Our long-term strategy has consistently driven year-over-year performance results, and we remain committed to our strategy. 
          
          Turning to Slide 5. We continue to build global scale in 2015, finalizing our acquisition of SunGard and finishing the year with revenue increasing 7% on a constant currency basis to $6.6 billion, growing adjusted EBITDA 8% on a constant currency basis to $2 billion and producing adjusted earnings per share of 6% on a constant currency basis to $3.22. We generated $921 million in free cash flow and returned $605 million to shareholders. Strategically, we are investing in the business to deliver long-term growth and superior shareholder returns. We are entering 2016 focused on 3 growth drivers. First, the acquisition of SunGard broadens our solution portfolio, allowing us to expand into new and adjacent markets and provide deeper value to our clients. Second, we will continue to capitalize on our expanded scale, operating leverage and our disciplined integration to drive earnings growth. Third, our strong cash flow generation allows us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. 
          
          Turning to Slide 6. Our SunGard acquisition, which closed on November 30, is a meaningful value creator for FIS. As we have discussed in the past, the industry is continuing to move towards fewer providers due to the complexity of solutions and regulatory oversight. As a result, our strategy has been to continue to expand our broad array of IP-led products built for the financial services industry, augmented with the right transformation services components needed to bridge the gap between these complex systems in the new digital age. The SunGard acquisition is another key component in implementing this overall strategy. In addition to opening complementary new markets, this combination positively impacts our revenue mix, creating a more profitable product-centric revenue base, and the ability to accelerate margin expansion by implementing our leading go-to-market delivery approach as well as significant cost savings around administration and technology expenses. This acquisition expands us beyond our traditional retail banking and payments footprint into the institutional and wholesale side of financial institutions as well as other buy-side organizations. On a combined basis, our share of wallet with our common global clients increased dramatically due to this combination, allowing us to become a more strategic solution provider. This comment has been substantiated multiple times over the last 60 days, as we've engaged with many of our global clients regarding the combination. The benefits of the transaction do not stop with our global banks. It also significantly expands our existing solutions and client base in wealth management, treasury and corporate payments. These are in high demand among our regional and community institutions and has been a significant focus area for FIS, as our clients look for ways to replace their fee revenue due to continuing regulatory change and increased oversight. As we look at the December results for SunGard, we are pleased with the momentum the sales organization maintained throughout the month, and are also pleased with the health of the overall pipeline that we acquired. While still early, we're also excited about how the sales teams are collaborating and building further opportunities within our robust client set, which further substantiates the strategy on why we put these 2 companies together. Finally, this transaction brings very strong talent and increased leadership to FIS with market-specific expertise. This further positions FIS as the clear leader in financial technology globally, strengthening our ability to deliver for our clients and help them grow their business. 
          
          Turning to Slide 7. Based on the significant strategic rationale discussed, the cultural alignment has been equally strong given both companies' DNA is centered on developed products for financial services. This cultural alignment has allowed us to accelerate our integration efforts, and we are very pleased with our initial progress integrating these 2 great companies. For example, we have already rolled out a streamlined organizational structure, transitioned our North American payroll and benefits plans and completed the rollout of the rebranding of SunGard. Given our current pace and results to date, we are ahead of schedule to exit 2016 at our synergy run rate goal of $100 million, and are confident in our ability to exit 2017 with a synergy run rate of $200 million. FIS has a proven track record of meeting or exceeding our synergy targets. And based on progress to date, this record will continue. While that wraps up my comments regarding the strategy and integration of SunGard, the company had other notable successes in support of our growth. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing some of these key results. 
          
          Turn to Slide 8 to review the segment highlights. Our Integrated Financial Solutions business continued to cross-sell and upsell additional products and services to our North American client base, leveraging the strength of our portfolio. In particular, we saw a continued demand for our digital solutions, wealth and card production in institutions of all sizes. In addition, we expanded our relationship with a large online retailer in the fourth quarter, resulting in double-digit growth in our high-margin network services business. Our mobile business continues its industry-leading position, growing its number of registered users by 19% year-over-year and delivering 27% year-over-year growth in our hosted service model. Overall, our digital finance suite grew to greater than $250 million in revenues at margins greater than 40%. Card production increased 12% to 112 million cards inclusive of a mag stripe in EMV. EMV grew sequentially 15% from Q3 to Q4 in 2015, resulting in a full year production of 12.5 million EMV cards. We continue to build traction among mid-tier and community institutions, signing several new long-term core processing partnerships in the quarter and full year. The success we saw in core processing signings for the year was almost double the number of deals in 2014. These wins in 2015 create positive benefits for 2016 and beyond. Also in the quarter, we signed a bank with assets greater than $200 billion to consolidate its debit processing and associated fraud-related services. The decision was driven by the bank's desire to improve operating efficiencies and increase service flexibility with a common solution across its expansive retail and direct bank business. This significant multiyear agreement demonstrates FIS' strength in serving the payment needs of institutions of all sizes around the world. 2015 was a transition year for Global Financial Solutions business. We responded to the challenges presented to us in the year, whether they were due to global economic issues, overall softness in market demand for people-based services or execution. We made leadership changes to address execution issues and refocused the impacted businesses. Regarding our consulting business, Capco, we are seeing progress in building our pipeline for consultative deals, but continue to expect a slow recovery in the first half of 2016, with increased performance in the back half of the year. As we discussed in the strategic rationale for SunGard, our non-product-led businesses now make up less than 10% of our total revenue. Globally, our Clear2Pay business showed very strong momentum, growing over 20% for the full year, fueled by solid demand for real-time payments and our clear competitive differentiation in this space. We acquired Clear2Pay in 2014 with the strategic view of the market's direction, and it is another illustration of how disciplined acquisitions and careful integration can enhance our client value proposition and earnings growth profile. During the quarter, our GFS segment signed a bank in North America with assets greater than $100 billion to a new multiyear agreement for a new direct bank, providing an end-to-end integrated solution for core banking, fraud solutions, back office and call center services. This key win underscores our ability to deliver innovative technology solutions that empower our clients to better serve their customers in today's digital age. In Brazil, we were encouraged to see one of our key clients pursue the purchase of a large card portfolio, expanding their franchise for future growth even in the difficult macroeconomic environment. This acquisition expands our ongoing business in Brazil, and we are already seeing the benefit in our revenue stream, as we provide professional services expertise to onboard these accounts in the back half of the year. In Europe, we continued to show positive sales momentum, especially in the U.K. and Germany, where we saw important wins across the year, that will fuel continued growth in 2016. Our strategy within the region is building momentum around our expanding relationships by leveraging existing strengths within the FIS and SunGard portfolios. We are making strong progress on the Sainsbury engagement. We have recently delivered the new bank platform, which is a key milestone in the project. Testing is underway, and we now plan to start to migrate customers onto the new platform later this year. We are proud of our partnership with this client, and we look forward to empowering them as our strategic technology partner over the next decade. We also signed the first all-digital bank in the U.K. as we helped this client prepare for their upcoming launch in 2016. Asia continue to have strong growth throughout 2015. And we are pleased that the SunGard acquisition more than doubles our sales force in the region, which allows us to continue to address the demand for FIS products and services throughout the high-growth region. 
          
          Turning next to Slide 9. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize by emphasizing that our competitive positioning is strong and our long-term earnings growth story remains intact. To meet our 2016 growth and financial performance goals, we will continue to focus on driving profitable growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders and continued acceleration of our integration efforts. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Woody for additional detail on how the [ph] financial results for the quarter and full year. Woody?"

The fourth quarter and full year results include the impact of the SunGard transaction, which closed on November 30. Those",1074,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year of 2015. The fourth quarter and full year results include the impact of the SunGard transaction, which closed on November 30. Those results are reported in the GFS segment. Today, unless otherwise specified, I'll be referencing percentage changes in our metrics on a constant currency basis. Also, reconciliations of non-GAAP measures can be found in our press release and our earnings deck, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. In the fourth quarter, revenue increased to $1.9 billion or 18%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 21% to $624 million. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 13% to $278 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.93. In the quarter, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by $63 million, EBITDA by $12 million and earnings per share by $0.02. For the year, revenue increased 7% to $6.6 billion, and adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $2 billion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $930 million, a 6% increase, and adjusted earnings per share was $3.22. For the year, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by $243 million, EBITDA by $45 million and earnings per share by $0.07. 
          
          I will now continue on Slide 12 for segment results. In the fourth quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue grew 4.4% on a normalized basis to $1 billion. EBITDA was 3% -- EBITDA increased 3% to $405 million compared to the prior-year period. We are pleased with the results of this segment, and the underlying business continues to perform well. For the year, IFS revenue on a normalized basis increased 3% to $3.9 billion, and EBITDA increased 2% to $1.6 billion. 
          
          Turning to Slide 13. Our IFS growth was driven by our digital and risk solutions and by an increase in EMV card production volumes. Recurring revenue composition remains very high in IFS. 
          
          Turning to Slide 14. In the fourth quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue increased 38% to $902 million. SunGard contributed approximately $300 million of revenue and approximately $100 million of EBITDA. Excluding SunGard on a normalized basis, GFS revenue decreased 3%. This decrease was driven primarily by softness in professional services demand and a difficult comp to the prior-year period. GFS adjusted EBITDA increased to $259 million, representing a 58% increase. EBITDA growth in the quarter was driven by restructuring cost actions taken in the first half of the year and the inclusion of SunGard for 1 month. For the year, GFS revenue increased 16% to $2.7 billion. Excluding SunGard on a normalized basis, revenue grew 3%. EBITDA increased 25% to $629 million. 
          
          Moving to Slide 15. We are presenting the results in the regions including SunGard to give some clarity into their regional impacts, although we note that SunGard's impact is only for 1 month. Given that, my following commentary on the regions excludes SunGard and focuses on the GFS segment standalone performance. For the fourth quarter, North America declined approximately $50 million to $252 million. Almost half this decline is a result of the previously discussed contract nonrenewal, followed by continued softness in professional service demand and a difficult license sale comparable in the prior-year period. For the year, North America revenues were $1.1 billion. Absent the nonrenewal of the contract, full year revenue decreased 1%, reflecting professional services softness in the second half of the year. In the quarter, Europe grew 1% to $198 million. For the year, Europe revenues increased 14% to $757 million. The fourth quarter results include the anniversary of our Clear2Pay acquisition and the impact of softness for people-based services in Europe. We are pleased by the results in Latin America, and the contract expansion in Brazil was a nice win in the quarter and should help Latin America in 2016 in spite of a difficult macroeconomic backdrop. As Gary indicated earlier, we remain bullish on the long-term impact of the Asia Pacific region. The teams have done a nice job of growing the business in this region. The addition of SunGard creates greater contribution from IP-led solutions, which we believe improves the visibility and predictability of results for this segment. 
          
          Moving to Slide 16. For the quarter, free cash flow increased 12% to $399 million or 143% conversion of net earnings. And for the year, free cash flow increased 7% to $921 million or 99% conversion of net earnings. We are highly focused on paying down debt and deleveraging the balance sheet. The effective tax rate increased to 33.4% for the quarter compared to 32.6% in the prior-year period, driven by acquisition-related items. For the full year, the effective tax rate was 33.1%. 
          
          Moving to Slide 17. In 2016 and going forward, we will report revenue growth on an organic basis, organic revenue will exclude impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation. We believe this will get better visibility into the underlying operating results of the business. For 2016, we expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%; adjusted EBITDA of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion; adjusted earnings per share of $3.70 to $3.80, representing growth of 15% to 18% free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. As we think about the quarter-to-quarter flow of the operating plan, we generally expect 15% to 18% EPS growth each quarter and expect the impact of synergies and interest savings to increase over the course of the year. There is more information regarding our planning assumptions in the appendix material, but I will highlight a handful of them here. We assume net interest expense of approximately $370 million and a 2016 effective tax rate of approximately 35%. We believe that by implementing tax planning strategies over the next 24 months, we can drive the tax rate down by 200 basis points or more, capital expenditures of approximately 6% of revenue, reaffirming our goal of exiting 2016 with $100 million or more in run rate cost synergies. 
          
          Moving to Slide 18. In conclusion, I'm highly confident in our operating plan and our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016 and 2017. We remain focused on multiyear earnings growth and cash generation and believe our business model will create long-term shareholder value. And we continue to invest for growth and strive for leadership in the markets that we serve. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

When I look, they had every opportunity to really take their foot off the gas. I mean, they could have gotten distracted with the combination. We had a lot going on at that time. The team stayed very focused through year-end and executed very well. So that was positive. When I look at the pipeline going into this year, the same thing exists. The pipelines are growing. The teams are executing. They're very excited about being a part of FIS, and I think that's translating in the client base. I can't tell you how many comments I've gotten over the last 60 days from clients just talking about being up under FIS, our ability to invest and focus for the long term. And so the customers are receiving it well. Our sales teams are receiving it well, and that's projecting into the results. So we feel really good about it. The secret's going to be, as now since November 30, as we've started to put our sales teams together and they've started to have some conversations about joint selling into the account. We're also seeing some good traction there, not only in the global financial institutions, but as I said, when you look at treasury and wealth and many of the products that SunGard have that are applicable for regional and community banks, we're starting to see strong traction there as well. And then, of course, as you know, our consulting group started in the capital markets area of the industry. And so being able to wrap that kind of consultative engagement around products is going to be differentiating for us going forward."

And that's -- and fulfilling it. That's one of the things that we changed significantly. What we have done in Capco historically, we've gotten the very large transformational engagements, and we took our eye off the ball off the base business of consulting in my opinion. And so we've retooled the leadership there, got them refocused on executing more of the thought leadership, consulting engagements. We've seen nice uptick of pipeline. We've actually seen strength coming into Q1 with delivery. So we've got to continue that obviously and continue that growth. But it's going to be much more back to what we picked up in the original Capco acquisition, which is more transformational consulting, where we're doing engagements, more short term in nature around thought leadership and how to transform various functions of the financial institution, and then allow us to pull in more product IP instead of some of the large lower-margin body shop-type deployments that we've gotten into.

I mean, you came off a year where obviously there were some unforeseen things that had occurred. And so I know that the intention hopefully was to come into this year with more of a conservative guidance assumption. And so here we are with 3% to 4%. Fourth quarter run rate was decent on the IFS segment. But obviously, like you mentioned for a lot of different reasons, slower on the GFS. So when we look going forward, I mean, can you just give us some confidence on what would -- if there's anything that would lead to that guidance being either below that? Or what are those variables? And potentially, is that already conservative? Is this sort of the low end of the range inherently what you're giving with upside to that from other variables?

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that we exited 2015 with solid momentum, as the teams focused on execution and driving further improvements in our cost structure and overall performance, delivering continued earnings growth. We're in the right markets empowering our clients of all sizes, whether here in the U.S. with community and regional banks or globally. Our long-term strategy has consistently driven year-over-year performance results, and we remain committed to our strategy.
Turning to Slide 5. We continue to build global scale in 2015, finalizing our acquisition of SunGard and finishing the year with revenue increasing 7% on a constant currency basis to $6.6 billion, growing adjusted EBITDA 8% on a constant currency basis to $2 billion and producing adjusted earnings per share of 6% on a constant currency basis to $3.22. We generated $921 million in free cash flow and returned $605 million to shareholders. Strategically, we are investing in the business to deliver long-term growth and superior shareholder returns. We are entering 2016 focused on 3 growth drivers. First, the acquisition of SunGard broadens our solution portfolio, allowing us to expand into new and adjacent markets and provide deeper value to our clients. Second, we will continue to capitalize on our expanded scale, operating leverage and our disciplined integration to drive earnings growth. Third, our strong cash flow generation allows us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 6. Our SunGard acquisition, which closed on November 30, is a meaningful value creator for FIS. As we have discussed in the past, the industry is continuing to move towards fewer providers due to the complexity of solutions and regulatory oversight. As a result, our strategy has been to continue to expand our broad array of IP-led products built for the financial services industry, augmented with the right transformation services components needed to bridge the gap between these complex systems in the new digital age. The SunGard acquisition is another key component in implementing this overall strategy. In addition to opening complementary new markets, this combination positively impacts our revenue mix, creating a more profitable product-centric revenue base, and the ability to accelerate margin expansion by implementing our leading go-to-market delivery approach as well as significant cost savings around administration and technology expenses. This acquisition expands us beyond our traditional retail banking and payments footprint into the institutional and wholesale side of financial institutions as well as other buy-side organizations. On a combined basis, our share of wallet with our common global clients increased dramatically due to this combination, allowing us to become a more strategic solution provider. This comment has been substantiated multiple times over the last 60 days, as we've engaged with many of our global clients regarding the combination. The benefits of the transaction do not stop with our global banks. It also significantly expands our existing solutions and client base in wealth management, treasury and corporate payments. These are in high demand among our regional and community institutions and has been a significant focus area for FIS, as our clients look for ways to replace their fee revenue due to continuing regulatory change and increased oversight. As we look at the December results for SunGard, we are pleased with the momentum the sales organization maintained throughout the month, and are also pleased with the health of the overall pipeline that we acquired. While still early, we're also excited about how the sales teams are collaborating and building further opportunities within our robust client set, which further substantiates the strategy on why we put these 2 companies together. Finally, this transaction brings very strong talent and increased leadership to FIS with market-specific expertise. This further positions FIS as the clear leader in financial technology globally, strengthening our ability to deliver for our clients and help them grow their business.
Turning to Slide 7. Based on the significant strategic rationale discussed, the cultural alignment has been equally strong given both companies' DNA is centered on developed products for financial services. This cultural alignment has allowed us to accelerate our integration efforts, and we are very pleased with our initial progress integrating these 2 great companies. For example, we have already rolled out a streamlined organizational structure, transitioned our North American payroll and benefits plans and completed the rollout of the rebranding of SunGard. Given our current pace and results to date, we are ahead of schedule to exit 2016 at our synergy run rate goal of $100 million, and are confident in our ability to exit 2017 with a synergy run rate of $200 million. FIS has a proven track record of meeting or exceeding our synergy targets. And based on progress to date, this record will continue. While that wraps up my comments regarding the strategy and integration of SunGard, the company had other notable successes in support of our growth. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing some of these key results.
Turn to Slide 8 to review the segment highlights. Our Integrated Financial Solutions business continued to cross-sell and upsell additional products and services to our North American client base, leveraging the strength of our portfolio. In particular, we saw a continued demand for our digital solutions, wealth and card production in institutions of all sizes. In addition, we expanded our relationship with a large online retailer in the fourth quarter, resulting in double-digit growth in our high-margin network services business. Our mobile business continues its industry-leading position, growing its number of registered users by 19% year-over-year and delivering 27% year-over-year growth in our hosted service model. Overall, our digital finance suite grew to greater than $250 million in revenues at margins greater than 40%. Card production increased 12% to 112 million cards inclusive of a mag stripe in EMV. EMV grew sequentially 15% from Q3 to Q4 in 2015, resulting in a full year production of 12.5 million EMV cards. We continue to build traction among mid-tier and community institutions, signing several new long-term core processing partnerships in the quarter and full year. The success we saw in core processing signings for the year was almost double the number of deals in 2014. These wins in 2015 create positive benefits for 2016 and beyond. Also in the quarter, we signed a bank with assets greater than $200 billion to consolidate its debit processing and associated fraud-related services. The decision was driven by the bank's desire to improve operating efficiencies and increase service flexibility with a common solution across its expansive retail and direct bank business. This significant multiyear agreement demonstrates FIS' strength in serving the payment needs of institutions of all sizes around the world. 2015 was a transition year for Global Financial Solutions business. We responded to the challenges presented to us in the year, whether they were due to global economic issues, overall softness in market demand for people-based services or execution. We made leadership changes to address execution issues and refocused the impacted businesses. Regarding our consulting business, Capco, we are seeing progress in building our pipeline for consultative deals, but continue to expect a slow recovery in the first half of 2016, with increased performance in the back half of the year. As we discussed in the strategic rationale for SunGard, our non-product-led businesses now make up less than 10% of our total revenue. Globally, our Clear2Pay business showed very strong momentum, growing over 20% for the full year, fueled by solid demand for real-time payments and our clear competitive differentiation in this space. We acquired Clear2Pay in 2014 with the strategic view of the market's direction, and it is another illustration of how disciplined acquisitions and careful integration can enhance our client value proposition and earnings growth profile. During the quarter, our GFS segment signed a bank in North America with assets greater than $100 billion to a new multiyear agreement for a new direct bank, providing an end-to-end integrated solution for core banking, fraud solutions, back office and call center services. This key win underscores our ability to deliver innovative technology solutions that empower our clients to better serve their customers in today's digital age. In Brazil, we were encouraged to see one of our key clients pursue the purchase of a large card portfolio, expanding their franchise for future growth even in the difficult macroeconomic environment. This acquisition expands our ongoing business in Brazil, and we are already seeing the benefit in our revenue stream, as we provide professional services expertise to onboard these accounts in the back half of the year. In Europe, we continued to show positive sales momentum, especially in the U.K. and Germany, where we saw important wins across the year, that will fuel continued growth in 2016. Our strategy within the region is building momentum around our expanding relationships by leveraging existing strengths within the FIS and SunGard portfolios. We are making strong progress on the Sainsbury engagement. We have recently delivered the new bank platform, which is a key milestone in the project. Testing is underway, and we now plan to start to migrate customers onto the new platform later this year. We are proud of our partnership with this client, and we look forward to empowering them as our strategic technology partner over the next decade. We also signed the first all-digital bank in the U.K. as we helped this client prepare for their upcoming launch in 2016. Asia continue to have strong growth throughout 2015. And we are pleased that the SunGard acquisition more than doubles our sales force in the region, which allows us to continue to address the demand for FIS products and services throughout the high-growth region.
Turning next to Slide 9. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize by emphasizing that our competitive positioning is strong and our long-term earnings growth story remains intact. To meet our 2016 growth and financial performance goals, we will continue to focus on driving profitable growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders and continued acceleration of our integration efforts. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Woody for additional detail on how the [ph] financial results for the quarter and full year. Woody?"

I'll begin on Slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year of 2015. The fourth quarter and full year results include the impact of the SunGard transaction, which closed on November 30. Those results are reported in the GFS segment. Today, unless otherwise specified, I'll be referencing percentage changes in our metrics on a constant currency basis. Also, reconciliations of non-GAAP measures can be found in our press release and our earnings deck, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. In the fourth quarter, revenue increased to $1.9 billion or 18%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 21% to $624 million. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 13% to $278 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.93. In the quarter, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by $63 million, EBITDA by $12 million and earnings per share by $0.02. For the year, revenue increased 7% to $6.6 billion, and adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $2 billion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $930 million, a 6% increase, and adjusted earnings per share was $3.22. For the year, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by $243 million, EBITDA by $45 million and earnings per share by $0.07.
I will now continue on Slide 12 for segment results. In the fourth quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue grew 4.4% on a normalized basis to $1 billion. EBITDA was 3% -- EBITDA increased 3% to $405 million compared to the prior-year period. We are pleased with the results of this segment, and the underlying business continues to perform well. For the year, IFS revenue on a normalized basis increased 3% to $3.9 billion, and EBITDA increased 2% to $1.6 billion.
Turning to Slide 13. Our IFS growth was driven by our digital and risk solutions and by an increase in EMV card production volumes. Recurring revenue composition remains very high in IFS.
Turning to Slide 14. In the fourth quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue increased 38% to $902 million. SunGard contributed approximately $300 million of revenue and approximately $100 million of EBITDA. Excluding SunGard on a normalized basis, GFS revenue decreased 3%. This decrease was driven primarily by softness in professional services demand and a difficult comp to the prior-year period. GFS adjusted EBITDA increased to $259 million, representing a 58% increase. EBITDA growth in the quarter was driven by restructuring cost actions taken in the first half of the year and the inclusion of SunGard for 1 month. For the year, GFS revenue increased 16% to $2.7 billion. Excluding SunGard on a normalized basis, revenue grew 3%. EBITDA increased 25% to $629 million.
Moving to Slide 15. We are presenting the results in the regions including SunGard to give some clarity into their regional impacts, although we note that SunGard's impact is only for 1 month. Given that, my following commentary on the regions excludes SunGard and focuses on the GFS segment standalone performance. For the fourth quarter, North America declined approximately $50 million to $252 million. Almost half this decline is a result of the previously discussed contract nonrenewal, followed by continued softness in professional service demand and a difficult license sale comparable in the prior-year period. For the year, North America revenues were $1.1 billion. Absent the nonrenewal of the contract, full year revenue decreased 1%, reflecting professional services softness in the second half of the year. In the quarter, Europe grew 1% to $198 million. For the year, Europe revenues increased 14% to $757 million. The fourth quarter results include the anniversary of our Clear2Pay acquisition and the impact of softness for people-based services in Europe. We are pleased by the results in Latin America, and the contract expansion in Brazil was a nice win in the quarter and should help Latin America in 2016 in spite of a difficult macroeconomic backdrop. As Gary indicated earlier, we remain bullish on the long-term impact of the Asia Pacific region. The teams have done a nice job of growing the business in this region. The addition of SunGard creates greater contribution from IP-led solutions, which we believe improves the visibility and predictability of results for this segment.
Moving to Slide 16. For the quarter, free cash flow increased 12% to $399 million or 143% conversion of net earnings. And for the year, free cash flow increased 7% to $921 million or 99% conversion of net earnings. We are highly focused on paying down debt and deleveraging the balance sheet. The effective tax rate increased to 33.4% for the quarter compared to 32.6% in the prior-year period, driven by acquisition-related items. For the full year, the effective tax rate was 33.1%.
Moving to Slide 17. In 2016 and going forward, we will report revenue growth on an organic basis, organic revenue will exclude impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation. We believe this will get better visibility into the underlying operating results of the business. For 2016, we expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%; adjusted EBITDA of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion; adjusted earnings per share of $3.70 to $3.80, representing growth of 15% to 18% free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. As we think about the quarter-to-quarter flow of the operating plan, we generally expect 15% to 18% EPS growth each quarter and expect the impact of synergies and interest savings to increase over the course of the year. There is more information regarding our planning assumptions in the appendix material, but I will highlight a handful of them here. We assume net interest expense of approximately $370 million and a 2016 effective tax rate of approximately 35%. We believe that by implementing tax planning strategies over the next 24 months, we can drive the tax rate down by 200 basis points or more, capital expenditures of approximately 6% of revenue, reaffirming our goal of exiting 2016 with $100 million or more in run rate cost synergies.
Moving to Slide 18. In conclusion, I'm highly confident in our operating plan and our ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2016 and 2017. We remain focused on multiyear earnings growth and cash generation and believe our business model will create long-term shareholder value. And we continue to invest for growth and strive for leadership in the markets that we serve. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

When I look, they had every opportunity to really take their foot off the gas. I mean, they could have gotten distracted with the combination. We had a lot going on at that time. The team stayed very focused through year-end and executed very well. So that was positive. When I look at the pipeline going into this year, the same thing exists. The pipelines are growing. The teams are executing. They're very excited about being a part of FIS, and I think that's translating in the client base. I can't tell you how many comments I've gotten over the last 60 days from clients just talking about being up under FIS, our ability to invest and focus for the long term. And so the customers are receiving it well. Our sales teams are receiving it well, and that's projecting into the results. So we feel really good about it. The secret's going to be, as now since November 30, as we've started to put our sales teams together and they've started to have some conversations about joint selling into the account. We're also seeing some good traction there, not only in the global financial institutions, but as I said, when you look at treasury and wealth and many of the products that SunGard have that are applicable for regional and community banks, we're starting to see strong traction there as well. And then, of course, as you know, our consulting group started in the capital markets area of the industry. And so being able to wrap that kind of consultative engagement around products is going to be differentiating for us going forward."

And that's -- and fulfilling it. That's one of the things that we changed significantly. What we have done in Capco historically, we've gotten the very large transformational engagements, and we took our eye off the ball off the base business of consulting in my opinion. And so we've retooled the leadership there, got them refocused on executing more of the thought leadership, consulting engagements. We've seen nice uptick of pipeline. We've actually seen strength coming into Q1 with delivery. So we've got to continue that obviously and continue that growth. But it's going to be much more back to what we picked up in the original Capco acquisition, which is more transformational consulting, where we're doing engagements, more short term in nature around thought leadership and how to transform various functions of the financial institution, and then allow us to pull in more product IP instead of some of the large lower-margin body shop-type deployments that we've gotten into.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm very pleased to open this morning's call reporting that FIS had a strong first quarter, with good performance overall, exceeding our expectations. We delivered strong and profitable growth. We have a solid pipeline and our sales team are doing a nice job of converting opportunities to new wins and cross-selling and up selling to existing clients. 
Market and client demand for our solutions continues with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies and implementing transformational solutions. These results and trends underscore our confidence in achieving our full year 2016 plan. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our first quarter top line growth was driven by positive results across both operating segments. Adjusted revenue increased more than 4% organically compared to the prior-year period to $2.3 billion with the EBITDA growing almost twice as fast as revenue at 8%. Adjusted earnings per share rose 22%. And we are ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration. In fact, we see clear line of sight to exit the year with $150 million in run rate synergy. By all accounts, this is a good start to the year and creates a strong foundation for achieving our 2016 goals. 
These results are further confirmation that executing on our strategy, including integrating and repositioning SunGard into our FIS business is delivering the desired results. Steady execution, coupled with continued improvements in our cost structure and overall performance remains our focus this year to drive continued earnings growth. We are in the right market serving financial institutions, empowering our clients of all sizes, from community and regional banks to large global institutions. 
Strategically, we are investing in the business to deliver long-term growth and consistent shareholder returns. Our growth strategy remains consistent and has the following key components: First, we are focused on our base business growth by effectively selling to and delivering for our existing clients. The acquisition of SunGard broadens our base business to a wider set of solutions, allowing us to expand and into new and adjacent markets and provide deeper value to our clients of all sizes. Second, we are focused on continually creating enterprise value. We will accomplish this through disciplined integration of our strategic investments and innovation and by capitalizing on our expanded scale and operating leverage. This focus will enable us to create new sales opportunities to drive earnings growth. Third, we are focused on financial discipline to maintain our strong balance sheet and improve our cash flow. We will officially use our strong cash flow to pay down debt in the near term and invest for growth for the longer term. We believe our strategy will consistently drive performance and results for the long-term, and we remain confident in this strategy. 
Turning to Slide 6 to review our segment highlights. We entered the first quarter with strong momentum driven in part by increased interest in our expanded portfolio. This momentum has translated into strong deal closure for the quarter and a robust quality pipeline of diversified opportunities across both operating segments. In our Integrated Financial Solutions business, we saw strong cross-sell activity delivering top line growth of greater than 5% organically. This growth is driven by a balance of demand in each of our solution areas, including core banking and wealth, Payments and our corporate and digital solutions. This is a strong start to the year for the segment, and we are pleased with its first quarter growth. 
In our banking and wealth management business, we signed several strategic long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks, seeking the benefits of our fully integrated solution suite. In March, we signed a new multiyear strategic agreement with a $6 billion Community Bank replacing their long-term or banking digital, network and processing applications with FIS solutions. 
We also signed a long-term agreement with the U.S. [indiscernible] by the $900 billion global institution that renewed and expanded their core processing relationship to include a full suite of item processing and associated print and mail solutions. 
In our enterprise governance risk and compliance business, we saw double-digit growth, primarily driven by institution seeking to remediate regulatory compliance issues by working with our governance and compliance experts. Our Payments business also drove double-digit growth in both our high-margin, high-reoccurring network business called NYCE. We saw a significant increase in transaction volumes from a large major online retailer. And in our card production business, where we signed a new multiyear master services agreement with a bank with assets in excess of $65 billion as well as continued strength in our EMV card deployments. Demand for our digital solutions suite was strong, representing double-digit growth in our user bases for our digital banking platforms. Our mobile banking platform now supports more than 36 million end users. 
Additionally, our FIS cardless cash solution has now more been deployed at more than 30 early adopter institutions across the U.S. We are proud of our leadership position in digital money movement innovation and expected to continue to deliver new opportunities. 
Within our corporate liquidity business, we signed a multi-million dollar agreement with a leading commercial financing and leasing company to upgrade and host its trade management solution. This is a great early example of how FIS scale and global distribution creates value and growth advantages for our acquired companies. 
Two weeks ago, we hosted over 1,200 North American community and regional bankers at one of our annual conferences. The event was focused on disruptive technologies particularly in digital and enabled us to showcase and demo many FIS solutions to these bank executives. Client response was overwhelmingly positive as they look to run their banks more efficiently and invest in new innovative technologies so they can effectively compete and grow their institutions. 
All of these new and extended relationships demonstrate FIS' strength in serving the banking and payment needs in North American institutions, regardless of size, creating predictable revenues, tied to long-term contracts and deployed in a one-to-many model. 
Turning to our Global Financial Solutions business, we are very pleased with the early progress in this segment attributable to the changes we implemented last year, combined with a new portfolio of offerings from the SunGard acquisition. 
In the quarter, we delivered top line growth greater than 4% organically. A significant change from last year, approximately 85% of total revenue for this segment is now driven from IP-led solutions due to the SunGard acquisition. We also have a much more diversified pipeline, primarily driven by the addition of new offerings from SunGard and our Clear2Pay next-generation payment solutions. While this will bring slower than historical growth for this segment due to the IP-lead nature of future deals, it will also brings higher profit margins, accompanied with more predictable revenue. 
The segments institutional and wholesale business comprised primarily of the former SunGard business drove more than 5% organic growth with good margin expansion in the quarter. Growth was driven from demand in trading volumes and strong demand for Capital Markets risk and compliance solutions. We also saw a good renewal activity in the quarter. 
Our Clear2Pay solutions drove double-digit growth to the top line and our integration efforts have nearly doubled the margin profile of this business since we acquired the company in October of 2014. This global payments delivery platform continues to gain momentum with increased client demand as the need for more real-time and least cost routing of payments gains momentum. 
In Europe, we continue to see success with challenger banks. Adam Bank, the U.K.'s first all-digital bank went live last month, ahead of schedule. FIS will continue to be their long-term strategic technology partner of choice. 
And in Brazil, we were encouraged to see continuing gains in transaction volumes, primarily due to the expanded relationship with the one of our strategic plans and the reason. Overall card processing in Brazil is up 11%, excluding currency year-over-year. Additionally, we entered into a new multiyear strategic agreement to help the same clients advance its digital banking strategy. Both of these agreements are positive steps forward for us in a region that continues to be challenged by macroeconomic conditions. 
Our consulting business is delivering on expectations and had a good quarter. The overall pipeline is growing, as expected, and supports our belief that 2016 will be an improved year for consulting. 
Turning next to Slide 7. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our first quarter results. The strong performance reinforces our confidence in our 2016 operating plan. To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on our integration efforts with high intensity, driving profitable growth to renew sales, maintaining a strong balance sheet, repaying down debt and returning cash to shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Woody for additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Woody?"

As Gary mentioned, we're very pleased with the start of the year and with the efforts of the SunGard integration teams. Integration efforts have provided incremental synergies, which benefited earnings per share for the quarter by about $0.01. As noted earlier, we now have a line of sight to exit the year and an expense synergy run rate of $150 million, ahead of our original expectations of $100 million. 
We expect the earnings impact to this increase and run rates synergies to be more heavily weighted in the second half of the year and drive benefit into 2017. We remain highly focused on accelerating and over driving our synergies. 
As you know, we closed the SunGard transaction on November 30, 2015, with all of the results of the acquired businesses flowing in the GFS segment for the month of December. During the first quarter, we have made minor adjustments to the reporting structure of certain businesses to more accurately reflect the way investment decisions are made and how we're operating the company. We have to move the public sector and education, retail check processing and our commercial services business into the corporate and other segment. We have also included the recently acquired SunGard wealth management and corporate liquidity businesses in the IFS segment. 
Included in the press release this morning, we have also provided historical adjusted combined financial information for 2015 and 2014 by quarter. This historical combined financials include SunGard's results as if we own in January 1, 2014. And reflect these changes in order provide you with greater clarity and better comparisons to the prior year. 
Moving to Slide 10. IFS has been strengthened by combining the acquired wealth management assets with FIS wealth solutions and by adding liquidity solutions to our corporate and digital solutions. This slide highlights the key additions to the IFS segment from the SunGard acquisition. 
Moving to Slide 11. In the first quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions organic revenue grew 5.4% to $1.1 billion. I'm pleased with how FIS started the year. EBITDA increased $426 million, an increase of 2.2% compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis with 130 basis points of margin decline. We are pleased with the pace of revenue growth in the quarter although the overdrive came in lower margin solutions and services revenue. This revenue mix cost approximately 30 basis points of decline in margin for the quarter compared to our expectations. Additionally, as planned, we had higher incentive accruals in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 12. Banking and wealth grew 5.1% for the quarter. This was driven primarily by wealth solutions and continued market demand for regulatory and compliance solutions. We're also pleased with Payments growth of 6.7%. This was driven by volume in debit, payments over the NYCE Network and EMV card production. 
Corporate and digital grew 3.7, with mobile banking posting a double-digit growth rate in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13. The GFS segment has been strengthened by the institutional and wholesale solutions from the SunGard acquisition. This business include Capital Markets, Global Trading and buy-side and now comprised of about 50% of the total work revenue for GFS. Our traditional GFS banking and payments and consulting businesses remain part of GFS. 
Moving to Slide 14. In the quarter, Global Financial Solutions organic revenue grew 4.4% to $990 million and EBITDA increased 251 -- to $251 million, a 12.1% increase compared to the prior year in an adjusted combined basis. This represents 270 basis points of margin expansion. The addition of SunGard improves the revenue stream in this segment by increasing the mission-critical, intellectual property driven recurring revenue of GFS will provide opportunities to generate margin expansion in the segment. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our institutional and wholesale business grew 5.4% and we're very pleased with the start of the year. Growth was driven primarily by strong demand in Global Trading and Capital Markets risk and compliance solution. Banking and payments organic revenue grew 4% to $351 million, which was supported by double-digit growth in Clear2Pay. 
Despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges in Brazil, we continue to see strong growth in card processing volumes in that market. In addition, our first 2 fully outsourced client in India continued to experience good growth. The consulting business performance was in line with our expectations. We are building momentum based on a strong pipeline, which gives us confidence that 2016 will have improve results. 
Moving to Slide 16. As stated earlier, the Corporate and Other segment now includes the public sector and education, retail check processing and commercial services business. This reporting structure just reflect how we make investment decisions to support these nonfinancial services customers. 
Adjusted revenue in the quarter was $151 million with an EBITDA loss of $40 million dollars. The Corporate and Other segment also includes results of $76 million of corporate expenses, which compares favorably to adjusted combined corporate expense of $89 million in the prior year, reflecting cost management and synergy attainment. The Corporate and Other segment declined 5% on an organic basis. The public sector and education business had strong organic growth of 7.1%. Organic growth in the commercial services business declined 13%, driven by a final stub period of the nonstrategic contract nonrenewal discussed last year. Retail check processing declined 6.1% reflecting the continued decline in check processing volumes.
Moving to Slide 17. For the quarter, free cash flow was $338 million. As of March 31, we had $11.3 billion of debt outstanding. During the quarter, we repaid $150 million of debt. We returned $85 million the shareholders through dividends. We also ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of 327 million on a fully diluted basis. 
We are highly focused on cash flow generation to delever the balance sheet and will continue to be a priority for us in the upcoming quarters. As expected, the effective tax rate increased to 35% for the quarter driven primarily by the inclusion of SunGard in the results. 
Moving to Slide 18. In conclusion, we're very pleased with the start of 2016, top line growth and synergy execution. We are highly confident in our full year 2016 plan, and we continue to expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%; adjusted EPS of $3.70 to $3.80 per share, a 15% to 18% increase; and free cash flow to adjusted -- to approximate adjusted net earnings. Further, we believe that the market's current consensus view of the second quarter is in line with our expectation. We remain focused on constantly improving cash flow generation, delevering our balance sheet, investing for growth and returning cash to shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

They are now translating to the growth this year. We have seen some improvement in our people-based services business, which is also was a pretty big headwind throughout the year for us last year. But I would just say, across the board, we saw improvement. We've highlighted a number of those areas with good, strong transaction growth at our network. We're seeing strong demand from some of our next generation innovations we are doing that we also continue to see good response from the sales team around core offerings and all of the flow-through that they can generate across our products suite. And to Woody's point, SunGard, the former SunGard business performed very well for us. We were pleased with the results of that. We had modeled that acquisition in that 3% to 4% range.

This was a fantastic relationship that FIS had and by the combination of SunGard, we were able to pull in our new offerings into a particular area that they were looking at and win that transaction.

So this is a huge shift that occurred since prior to the acquisition. As you know, product-related sales tend to take longer, right? And then you have the implementation side for the on-board. So naturally, growth is going to slow a little bit than say traditional people-based services businesses that are somewhat detached from software.

You're looking at the company that looked very similar to FIS, either the early part of this century or in the late '90s that had a heavy license fee concentration. So we were very focused on the license fee component of the revenue because that can be more cyclical and also be somewhat more volatile. What we like about what SunGard has done is those licenses formed the licenses and back to the mission criticality of it. If people don't renew those licenses some of those models are the longer he devised in the particular institution and and therefore no the mission critical there very large and very complex to implement. So we continue to watch that metric, but we also feel much better about that now after we've owned the company for some period of time. We continue to watch like in just like in all of our global institutions the macroeconomic issues that are going to impact spend. One of the things that we like about FIS is the fact that we have such a diversified revenue portfolio. So what you're finding is the spend can move around the institution. So increased regulatory change can perhaps drive more focus on regulatory and compliance. We now have a suite of solutions to deal with regulatory compliance. We also have a robust professional services around that as an example.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm very pleased to open this morning's call reporting that FIS had a strong first quarter, with good performance overall, exceeding our expectations. We delivered strong and profitable growth. We have a solid pipeline and our sales teams are doing a nice job of converting opportunities to new wins and cross-selling and upselling to existing clients. 
Market and client demand for our solutions continues with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies and implementing transformational solutions. These results and trends underscore our confidence in achieving our full year 2016 plan. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our first quarter top line growth was driven by positive results across both operating segments. Adjusted revenue increased more than 4% organically compared to the prior-year period to $2.3 billion with the EBITDA growing almost twice as fast as revenue at 8%. Adjusted earnings per share rose 22%. And we are ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration. In fact, we see clear line of sight to exit the year with $150 million in run rate synergy. By all accounts, this is a good start to the year and creates a strong foundation for achieving our 2016 goals. 
These results are further confirmation that executing on our strategy, including integrating and repositioning SunGard into our FIS business is delivering the desired results. Steady execution, coupled with continued improvements in our cost structure and overall performance remains our focus this year to drive continued earnings growth. We are in the right market serving financial institutions, empowering our clients of all sizes, from community and regional banks to large global institutions. 
Strategically, we are investing in the business to deliver long-term growth and consistent shareholder returns. Our growth strategy remains consistent and has the following key components: First, we are focused on our base business growth by effectively selling to and delivering for our existing clients. The acquisition of SunGard broadens our base business for a wider set of solutions, allowing us to expand into new and adjacent markets and provide deeper value to our clients of all sizes. Second, we are focused on continually creating enterprise value. We will accomplish this through disciplined integration of our strategic investments and innovation and by capitalizing on our expanded scale and operating leverage. This focus will enable us to create new sales opportunities to drive earnings growth. Third, we are focused on financial discipline to maintain our strong balance sheet and improve our cash flow. We will officially use our strong cash flow to pay down debt in the near term and invest for growth for the longer term. We believe our strategy will consistently drive performance and results for the long-term, and we remain confident in this strategy. 
Turning to Slide 6 to review our segment highlights. We entered the first quarter with strong momentum driven in part by increased interest in our expanded portfolio. This momentum has translated into strong deal closure for the quarter and a robust quality pipeline of diversified opportunities across both operating segments. In our Integrated Financial Solutions business, we saw strong cross-sell activity delivering top line growth of greater than 5% organically. This growth is driven by a balance of demand in each of our solution areas, including core banking and wealth, Payments and our corporate and digital solutions. This is a strong start to the year for this segment, and we are pleased with its first quarter growth. 
In our banking and wealth management business, we signed several strategic long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks, seeking the benefits of our fully integrated solution suite. In March, we signed a new multiyear strategic agreement with a $6 billion community bank replacing their long-term core banking, digital, network and item processing applications with FIS solutions. 
We also signed a long-term agreement with the U.S. arm of $900 billion global institution that renewed and expanded their core processing relationship to include a full suite of item processing and associated print and mail solutions. 
In our enterprise governance, risk and compliance business, we saw double-digit growth, primarily driven by institution seeking to remediate regulatory compliance issues by working with our governance and compliance experts. Our Payments business also drove double-digit growth in both our high-margin, high-reoccurring network business called NYCE, which saw a significant increase in transaction volumes from a large major online retailer. And in our card production business, where we signed a new multiyear master services agreement with a bank with assets in excess of $65 billion as well as continued strength in our EMV card deployments. Demand for our digital solution suite was strong, representing double-digit growth in our user bases for our digital banking platforms. Our mobile banking platform now supports more than 36 million end users. 
Additionally, our FIS cardless cash solution has now been deployed at more than 30 early adopter institutions across the U.S. We are proud of our leadership position in digital money movement innovation and expected to continue to deliver new opportunities. 
Within our corporate liquidity business, we signed a multi-million dollar agreement with a leading commercial financing and leasing company to upgrade and host its trade management solution. This is a great early example of how FIS scale and global distribution creates value and growth advantages for our acquired companies. 
Two weeks ago, we hosted over 1,200 North American community and regional bankers at one of our annual conferences. The event was focused on disruptive technologies, particularly in digital and it enabled us to showcase and demo many FIS solutions to these bank executives. Client response was overwhelmingly positive as they look to run their banks more efficiently and invest in new innovative technologies so they can effectively compete and grow their institutions. 
All of these new and extended relationships demonstrate FIS' strength in serving the banking and payment needs in North American institutions, regardless of size, creating predictable revenues, tied to long-term contracts and deployed in a one-to-many model. 
Turning to our Global Financial Solutions business, we are very pleased with the early progress in this segment attributable to the changes we implemented last year, combined with a new portfolio of offerings from the SunGard acquisition. 
In the quarter, we delivered top line growth greater than 4% organically. A significant change from last year, approximately 85% of total revenue for this segment is now driven from IP-led solutions due to the SunGard acquisition. We also have a much more diversified pipeline, primarily driven by the addition of new offerings from SunGard and our Clear2Pay next-generation payment solutions. While this will bring slower than historical growth for this segment due to the IP-lead nature of future deals, it will also bring higher profit margins, accompanied with more predictable revenue. 
The segments institutional and wholesale business comprised primarily of the former SunGard business drove more than 5% organic growth with good margin expansion in the quarter. Growth was driven from demand in trading volumes and strong demand for capital markets risk and compliance solutions. We also saw a good renewal activity in the quarter. 
Our Clear2Pay solutions drove double-digit growth to the top line and our integration efforts have nearly doubled the margin profile of this business since we acquired the company in October of 2014. This global payments delivery platform continues to gain momentum with increased client demand as the need for more real-time and least cost routing of payments gains momentum. 
In Europe, we continue to see success with challenger banks. Adam Bank, the U.K.'s first all-digital bank went live last month, ahead of schedule. FIS will continue to be their long-term strategic technology partner of choice. 
And in Brazil, we were encouraged to see continuing gains in transaction volumes, primarily due to the expanded relationship with one of our strategic clients in the region. Overall card processing in Brazil is up 11%, excluding currency year-over-year. Additionally, we entered into a new multiyear strategic agreement to help the same client advance its digital banking strategy. Both of these new agreements are positive steps forward for us in a region that continues to be challenged by macroeconomic conditions. 
Our consulting business is delivering on expectations and had a good quarter. The overall pipeline is growing, as expected, and supports our belief that 2016 will be an improved year for consulting. 
Turning next to Slide 7. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our first quarter results. The strong performance reinforces our confidence in our 2016 operating plan. To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on our integration efforts with high intensity, driving profitable growth to renew sales, maintaining a strong balance sheet, repaying down debt and returning cash to shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Woody for additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Woody?"

I'll begin on Slide 9.

I'll begin on Slide 9. In the first quarter, adjusted revenue increased to 2.3% billion or 4.2% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $637 million, an 8.1% increase compared to the prior year on an adjusted combined basis as if we owned SunGard in the prior-year period. This represents a 170 basis points of margin expansion. 
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $259 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 22% to $0.79 per share compared to $0.65 per share in the prior-year period. 
As Gary mentioned, we're very pleased with the start of the year and with the efforts of the SunGard integration teams. The integration efforts have provided incremental synergies, which benefited earnings per share for the quarter by about $0.01. As noted earlier, we now have a line of sight to exit the year and an expense synergy run rate of $150 million, ahead of our original expectations of $100 million. 
We expect the earnings impact to this increase and run rate synergies to be more heavily weighted in the second half of the year and drive benefit into 2017. We remain highly focused on accelerating and overdriving our synergies. 
As you know, we closed the SunGard transaction on November 30, 2015, with all the results of the acquired businesses flowing into the GFS segment for the month of December. During the first quarter, we have made minor adjustments to the reporting structure of certain businesses to more accurately reflect the way investment decisions are made and how we're operating the company. We have moved the public sector and education, retail check processing and our commercial services business into the corporate and other segment. We have also included the recently acquired SunGard wealth management and corporate liquidity businesses in the IFS segment. 
Included in the press release this morning, we have also provided historical adjusted combined financial information for 2015 and 2014 by quarter. These historical combined financials include SunGard's results as if we owned in January 1, 2014. And reflect these changes in order to provide greater clarity and better comparisons to the prior years. 
Moving to Slide 10. IFS has been strengthened by combining the acquired wealth management assets with FIS wealth solutions and by adding liquidity solutions to our corporate and digital solutions. This slide highlights the key additions to the IFS segment from the SunGard acquisition. 
Moving to Slide 11. In the first quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions organic revenue grew 5.4% to $1.1 billion. I'm pleased with how IFS has started the year. EBITDA increased to $426 million, an increase of 2.2% compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis with 130 basis points of margin decline. We are pleased with the pace of revenue growth in the quarter, although the overdrive came in lower margin solutions and services revenue. This revenue mix cost approximately 30 basis points of decline in margin for the quarter compared to our expectations. Additionally, as planned, we had higher incentive accruals in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 12. Banking and wealth grew 5.1% for the quarter. This was driven primarily by wealth solutions and continued market demand for regulatory and compliance solutions. We're also pleased with Payments growth of 6.7%. This was driven by volume in debit, payments over the NYCE network and EMV card production. 
Corporate and digital grew 3.7%, with mobile banking posting a double-digit growth rate in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13. The GFS segment has been strengthened by the institutional and wholesale solutions from the SunGard acquisition. These businesses include capital markets, global trading and buy-side and now comprised of about 50% of the total revenue for GFS. Our traditional GFS banking and payments and consulting businesses remain part of GFS. 
Moving to Slide 14. In the quarter, Global Financial Solutions organic revenue grew 4.4% to $990 million and EBITDA increased 251 -- to $251 million, a 12.1% increase compared to the prior year on adjusted combined basis. This represents 270 basis points of margin expansion. The addition of SunGard improves the revenue stream in this segment by increasing the mission-critical, intellectual property driven recurring revenue of GFS, while providing opportunities to accelerate margin expansion in the segment. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our institutional and wholesale business grew 5.4% and we're very pleased with the start to the year. Growth was driven primarily by strong demand in global trading and capital markets risk and compliance solution. Banking and payments organic revenue grew 4% to $351 million, which was supported by double-digit growth in Clear2Pay. 
Despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges in Brazil, we continue to see strong growth in card processing volumes in that market. In addition, our first 2 fully outsourced clients in India continued to experience good growth. The consulting business performance was in line with our expectations. We are building momentum based on a strong pipeline, which gives us confidence that 2016 will have improved results. 
Moving to Slide 16. As stated earlier, the Corporate and Other segment now includes the public sector and education, retail check processing and commercial services business. This reporting structure change reflects how we make investment decisions to support these nonfinancial services customers. 
Adjusted revenue in the quarter was $151 million with an EBITDA loss of $40 million. The Corporate and Other segment also includes results of $76 million of corporate expenses, which compares favorably to adjusted combined corporate expense of $89 million in the prior year, reflecting cost management and synergy attainment. The Corporate and Other segment declined 5% on an organic basis. The public sector and education business had strong organic growth of 7.1%. Organic growth in the commercial services business declined 13%, driven by a final stub period of the nonstrategic contract nonrenewal discussed last year. Retail check processing declined 6.1% reflecting the continued decline in check processing volumes.
Moving to Slide 17. For the quarter, free cash flow was $338 million. As of March 31, we had $11.3 billion of debt outstanding. During the quarter, we repaid $150 million of debt. We returned $85 million to shareholders through dividends. We also ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of $327 million on a fully diluted basis. 
We are highly focused on cash flow generation to delever the balance sheet and it will continue to be a priority for us in the upcoming quarters. As expected, the effective tax rate increased to 35% for the quarter driven primarily by the inclusion of SunGard in the results. 
Moving to Slide 18. In conclusion, we're very pleased with the start to 2016, top line growth and synergy execution. We are highly confident in our full year 2016 plan, and we continue to expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%; adjusted EPS of $3.70 to $3.80 per share, a 15% to 18% increase; and free cash flow to adjusted -- to approximate adjusted net earnings. Further, we believe that the market's current consensus view of the second quarter is in line with our expectation. We remain focused on constantly improving cash flow generation, delevering our balance sheet, investing for growth and returning cash to shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

We also had some strong sales that we signaled in the back half of last year. They are now translating to the growth this year. We've seen some improvement in our people-based services business, which is also was a pretty big headwind throughout the year for us last year. But I would just say, across the board, we saw improvement. We highlighted a number of those areas with good, strong transaction growth in our network. We're seeing strong demand for some of our next generation innovations we are doing. We also continue to see good response from the sales team around core offerings and all of the pull-through that they can generate across our product suite. And to Woody's point, SunGard, the former SunGard business performed very well for us. We were pleased with the results of that. We had modeled that acquisition in that 3% to 4% range, so that came in on the high end. So all in all, just a good quarter across the board."

I mean the nice thing about SunGard is they look very similar to the way FIS has looked for years. These are very mission-critical, highly reoccurring software products that are required in order for a financial institution to open its doors. So while sometimes we can see impact due to  transaction volumes or trading volumes, no different than we can on, for example, our debit network, the reality is for these institutions to open their doors, they need it. So this mission-critical nature is very important. We are seeing some really nice opportunities for pull-through actually highlighted one in this quarter with that large commercial leasing company. This was a fantastic relationship that FIS had. And by the combination with SunGard, we were able to pull in our new offerings into -- in a particular area that they were looking at and win that transaction. So we're already starting to see some of that. As I've said in the past, what you'll watch for is that really in the back half of the year and early '17 because sales cycles are long in this business.

I [ph] certainly won't go into a lot more detail next week at our investor update. But when you look at the complement of SunGard products and services and the amount of assets that they brought into GFS from that acquisition, the percentage of revenue tied to now through software and software solutions, whether it's license, maintenance or outsourcing, has increased that segment and now have to be about 85% of the revenue. So this is a huge shift that's occurred since prior to the acquisition. As you know, product-related sales tend to take longer, right? And then you have to go through an implementation cycle to onboard. So naturally, growth is going to slow a little bit than say traditional people-based services businesses that are somewhat detached from software. But the vantage of that concentration, is now you're going to see margins less significantly in GFS. And we think we're going to have a great opportunity with some nice margin expansion in the coming years in that business as it starts taking on more of the characteristics of a true classic IT-type company."

You're looking at a company that looked very similar to FIS, either the early part of this century or in the late '90s that had a heavy license fee concentration. So we were very focused on the license fee component of the revenue because that can be more cyclical and also be somewhat more volatile. What we like about what SunGard has done is those licenses were then formed the term licenses and back to the mission criticality of it. If people don't renew those licenses, those products can no longer be utilized in the particular institution. And therefore now in the mission critical they're very large and very complex to implement. So we continue to watch that metric, but we also feel much better about that now after we've owned the company for some period of time. We continue to watch just like in all of our large global institutions, the macroeconomic issues that are going to impact spend. One of the things that we like about FIS is the fact that we have such a diversified revenue portfolio. So what you're finding is the spend can move around the institution. So increased regulatory change can perhaps drive more focus on regulatory and compliance. We now have a suite of solutions to deal with regulatory compliance. We also have a robust professional services capabilities around that as an example. And so what we've got to do is just to make sure that our sales teams are tracking where the revenue is being spent so that we can continue to maximize our growth through as the industry shifts."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm very pleased to open this morning's call reporting that FIS had a strong first quarter, with good performance overall, exceeding our expectations. We delivered strong and profitable growth. We have a solid pipeline and our sales teams are doing a nice job of converting opportunities to new wins and cross-selling and upselling to existing clients. 
Market and client demand for our solutions continues with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies and implementing transformational solutions. These results and trends underscore our confidence in achieving our full year 2016 plan. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our first quarter top line growth was driven by positive results across both operating segments. Adjusted revenue increased more than 4% organically compared to the prior-year period to $2.3 billion with the EBITDA growing almost twice as fast as revenue at 8%. Adjusted earnings per share rose 22%. And we are ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration. In fact, we see clear line of sight to exit the year with $150 million in run rate synergy. By all accounts, this is a good start to the year and creates a strong foundation for achieving our 2016 goals. 
These results are further confirmation that executing on our strategy, including integrating and repositioning SunGard into our FIS business is delivering the desired results. Steady execution, coupled with continued improvements in our cost structure and overall performance remains our focus this year to drive continued earnings growth. We are in the right market serving financial institutions and empowering our clients of all sizes, from community and regional banks to large global institutions. 
Strategically, we are investing in the business to deliver long-term growth and consistent shareholder returns. Our growth strategy remains consistent and has the following key components: First, we are focused on our base business growth by effectively selling to and delivering for our existing clients. The acquisition of SunGard broadens our base business through a wider set of solutions, allowing us to expand into new and adjacent markets and provide deeper value to our clients of all sizes. Second, we are focused on continually creating enterprise value. We will accomplish this through disciplined integration of our strategic investments and innovation and by capitalizing on our expanded scale and operating leverage. This focus will enable us to create new sales opportunities to drive earnings growth. Third, we are focused on financial discipline to maintain our strong balance sheet and improve our cash flow. We will efficiently use our strong cash flow to pay down debt in the near term and invest for growth for the longer term. We believe our strategy will consistently drive performance and results for the long-term, and we remain confident in this strategy. 
Turn to Slide 6 to review our segment highlights. We entered the first quarter with strong momentum driven in part by increased interest in our expanded portfolio. This momentum has translated into strong deal closure for the quarter and a robust, quality pipeline of diversified opportunities across both operating segments. In our Integrated Financial Solutions business, we saw strong cross-sell activity delivering top line growth of greater than 5% organically. This growth is driven by a balance of demand in each of our solution areas, including core banking and wealth, payments and our corporate and digital solutions. This is a strong start to the year for this segment, and we are pleased with its first quarter growth. 
In our banking and wealth management business, we signed several strategic long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks, seeking the benefits of our fully integrated solution suite. In March, we signed a new multiyear strategic agreement with a $6 billion community bank replacing their long-term core banking, digital, network and item processing applications with FIS solutions. 
We also signed a long-term agreement with the U.S. arm of $900 billion global institution that renewed and expanded their core processing relationship to include a full suite of item processing and associated print and mail solutions. 
In our enterprise governance, risk and compliance business, we saw double-digit growth, primarily driven by institutions seeking to remediate regulatory compliance issues by working with our governance and compliance experts. Our Payments business also drove double-digit growth in both our high-margin, high-reoccurring network business called NYCE, which saw a significant increase in transaction volumes from a large major online retailer. And in our card production business, where we signed a new multiyear master services agreement with a bank with assets in excess of $65 billion as well as continued strength in our EMV card deployments. Demand for our digital solution suite was strong, representing double-digit growth in our user bases for our digital banking platforms. Our mobile banking platform now supports more than 36 million end users. 
Additionally, our FIS cardless cash solution has now been deployed at more than 30 early adopter institutions across the U.S. We are proud of our leadership position in digital money movement innovation and expect it to continue to deliver new opportunities. 
Within our corporate liquidity business, we signed a multi-million dollar agreement with a leading commercial financing and leasing company to upgrade and host its trade management solution. This is a great early example of how FIS scale and global distribution creates value and growth advantages for our acquired companies. 
Two weeks ago, we hosted over 1,200 North American community and regional bankers at one of our annual conferences. The event was focused on disruptive technologies, particularly in digital and it enabled us to showcase and demo many FIS solutions to these bank executives. Client response was overwhelmingly positive as they look to run their banks more efficiently and invest in new innovative technologies so they can effectively compete and grow their institutions. 
All of these new and extended relationships demonstrate FIS' strength in serving the banking and payment needs of North American institutions, regardless of size, creating predictable revenues, tied to long-term contracts and deployed in a one-to-many model. 
Turning to our Global Financial Solutions business, we are very pleased with the early progress in this segment attributable to the changes we implemented last year, combined with a new portfolio of offerings from the SunGard acquisition. 
In the quarter, we delivered top line growth greater than 4% organically. A significant change from last year, approximately 85% of total revenue for this segment is now driven from IP-led solutions due to the SunGard acquisition. We also have a much more diversified pipeline, primarily driven by the addition of new offerings from SunGard and our Clear2Pay next-generation payment solutions. While this will bring slower than historical growth for this segment due to the IP-lead nature of future deals, it will also bring higher profit margins, accompanied with more predictable revenue. 
The segment's institutional and wholesale business comprised primarily of the former SunGard business drove more than 5% organic growth with good margin expansion in the quarter. Growth was driven from demand in trading volumes and strong demand for capital markets risk and compliance solutions. We also saw a good renewal activity in the quarter. 
Our Clear2Pay solutions drove double-digit growth to the top line and our integration efforts have nearly doubled the margin profile of this business since we acquired the company in October of 2014. This global payments delivery platform continues to gain momentum with increased client demand as the need for more real-time and least-cost routing of payments gains momentum. 
In Europe, we continue to see success with challenger banks. Adam Bank, the U.K.'s first all-digital bank went live last month, ahead of schedule. FIS will continue to be their long-term strategic technology partner of choice. 
And in Brazil, we were encouraged to see continuing gains in transaction volumes, primarily due to the expanded relationship with one of our strategic clients in the region. Overall card processing in Brazil was up 11%, excluding currency, year-over-year. Additionally, we entered into a new multiyear strategic agreement to help this same client advance its digital banking strategy. Both of these new agreements are positive steps forward for us in a region that continues to be challenged by macroeconomic conditions. 
Our consulting business is delivering on expectations and had a good quarter. The overall pipeline is growing, as expected, and supports our belief that 2016 will be an improved year for consulting. 
Turning next to Slide 7. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our first quarter results. The strong performance reinforces our confidence in our 2016 operating plan. To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on our integration efforts with high intensity, driving profitable growth to renew sales, maintaining a strong balance sheet through paying down debt and returning cash to shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Woody for additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Woody?"

I'll begin on Slide 9.

I'll begin on Slide 9. In the first quarter, adjusted revenue increased to $2.3 billion or 4.2% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $637 million, an 8.1% increase compared to the prior year on an adjusted combined basis as if we owned SunGard in the prior-year period. This represents a 170 basis points of margin expansion. 
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $259 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 22% to $0.79 per share compared to $0.65 per share in the prior-year period. 
As Gary mentioned, we're very pleased with the start of the year and with the efforts of the SunGard integration teams. The integration efforts have provided incremental synergies, which benefited earnings per share for the quarter by about $0.01. As noted earlier, we now have line of sight to exit the year and an expense synergy run rate of $150 million, ahead of our original expectations of $100 million. 
We expect the earnings impact of this increase and run rate synergies to be more heavily weighted in the second half of the year and drive benefit into 2017. We remain highly focused on accelerating and overdriving our synergies. 
As you know, we closed the SunGard transaction on November 30, 2015, with all the results of the acquired businesses flowing into the GFS segment for the month of December. During the first quarter, we have made minor adjustments to the reporting structure of certain businesses to more accurately reflect the way investment decisions are made and how we're operating the company. We have moved the public sector and education, retail check processing and our commercial services business into the corporate and other segment. We have also included the recently acquired SunGard wealth management and corporate liquidity businesses in the IFS segment. 
Included in the press release this morning, we have also provided historical adjusted combined financial information for 2015 and 2014 by quarter. These historical combined financials include SunGard's results as if we owned them January 1, 2014. And reflect these changes in order to provide you greater clarity and better comparisons to the prior years. 
Moving to Slide 10. IFS has been strengthened by combining the acquired wealth management assets with FIS wealth solutions and by adding liquidity solutions to our corporate and digital solutions. This slide highlights the key additions to the IFS segment from the SunGard acquisition. 
Moving to Slide 11. In the first quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions organic revenue grew 5.4% to $1.1 billion. I'm pleased with how IFS has started the year. EBITDA increased to $426 million, an increase of 2.2% compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis with 130 basis points of margin decline. We are pleased with the pace of revenue growth in the quarter, although the overdrive came in lower margin solutions and services revenue. This revenue mix cost approximately 30 basis points of decline in margin for the quarter compared to our expectations. Additionally, as planned, we had higher incentive accruals in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 12. Banking and wealth grew 5.1% for the quarter. This was driven primarily by wealth solutions and continued market demand for regulatory and compliance solutions. We're also pleased with Payments growth of 6.7%. This was driven by volume in debit, payments over the NYCE network and EMV card production. 
Corporate and digital grew 3.7%, with mobile banking posting a double-digit growth rate in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13. The GFS segment has been strengthened by the institutional and wholesale solutions from the SunGard acquisition. These businesses include capital markets, global trading and buy-side and now comprised of about 50% of the total revenue for GFS. Our traditional GFS banking and payments and consulting businesses remain part of GFS. 
Moving to Slide 14. In the quarter, Global Financial Solutions organic revenue grew 4.4% to $990 million and EBITDA increased 251 -- to $251 million, a 12.1% increase compared to the prior year on an adjusted combined basis. This represents 270 basis points of margin expansion. The addition of SunGard improves the revenue stream in this segment by increasing the mission-critical, intellectual property driven recurring revenue of GFS, while providing opportunities to accelerate margin expansion in the segment. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our institutional and wholesale business grew 5.4% and we're very pleased with the start to the year. Growth was driven primarily by strong demand in global trading and capital markets risk and compliance solution. Banking and payments organic revenue grew 4% to $351 million, which was supported by double-digit growth in Clear2Pay. 
Despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges in Brazil, we continue to see strong growth in card processing volumes in that market. In addition, our first 2 fully outsourced clients in India continued to experience good growth. The consulting business performance was in line with our expectations. We are building momentum based on a strong pipeline, which gives us confidence that 2016 will have improved results. 
Moving to Slide 16. As stated earlier, the Corporate and Other segment now includes the public sector and education, retail check processing and commercial services business. This reporting structure change reflects how we make investment decisions to support these non-financial services customers. 
Adjusted revenue in the quarter was $151 million with an EBITDA loss of $40 million. The Corporate and Other segment also includes results of $76 million of corporate expenses, which compares favorably to adjusted combined corporate expense of $89 million in the prior year, reflecting cost management and synergy attainment. The Corporate and Other segment declined 5% on an organic basis. The public sector and education business had strong organic growth of 7.1%. Organic growth in the commercial services business declined 13%, driven by a final stub period of the nonstrategic contract nonrenewal discussed last year. Retail check processing declined 6.1% reflecting the continued decline in check processing volumes.
Moving to Slide 17. For the quarter, free cash flow was $338 million. As of March 31, we had $11.3 billion of debt outstanding. During the quarter, we repaid $150 million of debt. We returned $85 million to shareholders through dividends. We also ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of $327 million on a fully diluted basis. 
We are highly focused on cash flow generation to delever the balance sheet and it will continue to be a priority for us in the coming quarters. As expected, the effective tax rate increased to 35% for the quarter driven primarily by the inclusion of SunGard in the results. 
Moving to Slide 18. In conclusion, we're very pleased with the start to 2016, top line growth and synergy execution. We are highly confident in our full year 2016 plan, and we continue to expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%; adjusted EPS of $3.70 to $3.80 per share, a 15% to 18% increase; and free cash flow to adjusted -- to approximate adjusted net earnings. Further, we believe that the market's current consensus view of the second quarter is in line with our expectation. We remain focused on constantly improving cash flow generation, delevering our balance sheet, investing for growth and returning cash to shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

The SunGard integration is going extremely well, so the sales teams have not had much distraction at all. We had a real solid kickoff this year. We also had some strong sales that we signaled in the back half of last year that are now translating to the growth this year. We've seen some improvement in our people-based services business, which is also -- was a pretty big headwind throughout the year for us last year. But I would just say, across the board, we saw improvement. We highlighted a number of those areas with good, strong transaction growth in our network. We're seeing strong demand for some of our next generation innovations we are doing. We also continue to see good response from the sales team around core offerings and all of the pull-through that, that can generate across our product suite. And to Woody's point, SunGard, the former SunGard business performed very well for us. We were pleased with the results of that. We had modeled that acquisition in that 3% to 4% range, so that came in on the high end. So all in all, just a good quarter across the board."

I mean the nice thing about SunGard is they look very similar to the way FIS has looked for years. These are very mission-critical, highly reoccurring software products that are required in order for a financial institution to open its doors. So while sometimes we can see impact due to transaction volumes or trading volumes, no different than we can on, for example, our debit network, the reality is for these institutions to open their doors, they need it. So this mission-critical nature is very important. We are seeing some really nice opportunities for pull-through. I actually highlighted one in this quarter with that large commercial leasing company. This was a fantastic relationship that FIS had. And by the combination with SunGard, we were able to pull in our new offerings into -- in a particular area that they were looking at and win that transaction. So we're already starting to see some of that. As I've said in the past, what you'll watch for is that really in the back half of the year and early '17 because sales cycles are long in this business.

That certainly we'll go into a lot more detail next week at our investor update. But when you look at the complement of SunGard products and services and the amount of assets that they brought into GFS from that acquisition, the percentage of revenue tied to now through software and software solutions, whether it's license, maintenance or outsourcing, has increased that segment and it now -- to be about 85% of the revenue. So this is a huge shift that's occurred since prior to the acquisition. As you know, product-related sales tend to take longer, right? And then you have to go through an implementation cycle to onboard. So naturally, growth is going to slow a little bit than, say, traditional people-based services businesses that are somewhat detached from software. But the advantage of that concentration, is now you're going to see margins lift significantly in GFS. And we think we're going to have a great opportunity with some nice margin expansion in the coming years in that business as it starts taking on more of the characteristics of a true classic IT-type company."

You're looking at a company that looked very similar to FIS, either the early part of this century or in the late '90s that had a heavy license fee concentration. So we were very focused on the license fee component of the revenue because that can be more cyclical and also be somewhat more volatile. What we like about what SunGard had done is those licenses were then formed of term licenses and back to the mission criticality of it. If people don't renew those licenses, those products can no longer be utilized in the particular institution. And therefore, not only are they mission critical, they're very large and very complex to implement. So we continue to watch that metric, but we also feel much better about that now after we've owned the company for some period of time. We continue to watch just like in all of our large global institutions, the macroeconomic issues that are going to impact spend. One of the things that we like about FIS is the fact that we have such a diversified revenue portfolio. So what you're finding is this spend can move around the institution. So increased regulatory change can perhaps drive more focus on regulatory and compliance. We now have a suite of solutions to deal with regulatory compliance. We also have robust professional services capabilities around that, as an example. And so what we've got to do is just to make sure that our sales teams are tracking where the revenue is being spent so that we can continue to maximize our growth through -- as the industry shifts."

I'm extremely pleased to open the call to the reporting that FIS had another strong quarter, outperforming our expectations. We saw a growth across both operating segments and exceeded our consolidated revenue, EBITDA and EPS targets. These results build on the positive momentum established in Q1 and characterized the first half of the year with strong profitable growth delivering outstanding shareholder returns.
Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive. As a result, we will be increasing our guidance. 
Turning to Slide 5. Second quarter top line growth exceeded expectations. Adjusted revenue increased more than 5% organically compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to see EBITDA contribution from our organic revenue growth and also strong benefit from our synergy attainment to date. This resulted in EBITDA growing more than twice as fast as revenue at 13% and adjusted earnings per share rose 22%.
As we reported last quarter, we remain ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration and are confident that we will exit the year with $150 million in run rate synergy. We remain on track to beat our stated end goal of $200 million. 
The team continues to perform well against both committed cost synergies and sales execution, which is beginning to yield results in new and existing client sales. They also have maintained a heightened level of focus on this integration with a clear line of sight to all of our targets. As highlighted previously, FIS has a proven track record of meeting or exceeding our synergy targets and based on our progress to-date, improving integration processes, this trend will continue.
While the markets have experienced some turmoil, FIS has continued to deliver impressive results. Our mission-critical applications, which serve clients of all sizes in the diverse geographic regions where we operate, drive both revenue diversification and predictable stability and scale for our clients. 
Brexit is obviously creating some uncertainty in the market. At this time, we've not seen any impact or currently relationships. While this will continue to unfold over the next several years, change typically creates opportunity for FIS. Our pipeline for the remainder of the year is robust. Market and client demand for our solutions continues with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies and implementing transformational solutions. 
Our sales teams are doing a good job of converting these opportunities to new wins and creating cross-sell and upsell programs to existing clients.
By all accounts, this is an exceptional first half to the year. It creates a strong foundation for achieving our full year 2016 goals and longer-term growth objectives. We are confident in driving continued earnings growth in the back half of the year while remaining focused on continued improvement in our cost structure and steady execution of our four-pronged growth strategy, which is to grow our base business, unlock enterprise value through strategic investments, expand our solution portfolio all while focusing on strong financial discipline.
Turning to Slide 6 to review our segment highlights. In our Integrated Financial Solutions business, we had a very strong revenue growth of over 8% organically. We saw expressly strong growth in our digital, payments and enterprise governance, risk and compliance solution businesses. 
Looking to the future, our sales teams are on target to deliver on our cross-sell and new sell goals for the year. In our banking and wealth management business, we signed several strategic long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks seeking the benefits of our fully integrated solution suite. For example, in April, we signed a new multiyear strategic agreement with $16 billion community bank to expand its FIS core banking solution across its entire banking enterprise. This bank, which recently nearly doubled its size has also added new FIS digital, mobile, item capture and bill pay solutions to its customer-facing capabilities. 
Our Payments business another strong quarter with 8% organic growth, driven by our high-margin, high reoccurring EFT processing business and our mobile wallet enablement. There is a growth was also supplemented by continued to strong growth in our card production business, especially from our EMV card deployments. We also signed a multiyear electronic benefits transfer processing deal with 1 of the largest states in the U.S., providing benefits to more than 2 million households. All of these new and extended relationships demonstrate FIS' strength in serving the banking and payment needs in North American institutions regardless of size. 
This demand created reoccurring revenues of more than 85%, which is driven by our long-term mission-critical software applications deployed in our one-to-many model. 
Turning to our Global Financial Solutions business, we also had solid sales performance overall leading to end quarter and future quarter results. In the quarter, we delivered top line organic growth of 3%. 
Our institutional and wholesale business, which consist of the majority of the former SunGard business, delivered top line organic growth of more than 5% with strong IP-led services and licensed product sales in the quarter, representing 2 consecutive quarters of over 5% growth. 
In May, we announced that Crédit Suisse had adopted the FIS derivatives utility, becoming the second major capital markets firm to join. We are pleased to see continued interest in this offering where clients are benefiting from moving to  highly scalable, consumption-based solution to deliver cost and efficiency gains. This further illustrates the move towards outsourcing in the global financial markets. 
Our Clear2Pay global enterprise payments delivery platform continues to perform very well. We saw strong deal closure for this solution in the quarter, including a new multiyear deals with the U.S.-based financial institution with more than $60 billion in assets, and with one of the largest global banks, Crédit Suisse. The 2 Credit Suisse deals illustrate the value FIS brings in having solutions across our request total needs as well as proving that financial solutions of this global size and scale are making big decisions to drive their business forward even in uncertain times. 
We also saw a nice growth in Brazil, mainly due to the strong client relationships we have established in our reoccurring revenue model. Despite continuing unfavorable market conditions, we anticipate a good second half of the year in this market. 
In India, we continue to see strong progress with our newly chartered financial institutions signing a significant multiyear deals with 3 of these institutions. Our focus on enabling financial inclusion in India is making a positive difference in this under bank country where we've driven tremendous growth. 
Turning next to Slide 7. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize today by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our second quarter results and our first half of the year, where our overall results outperformed our expectations. Our performance combined with a robust pipeline and clear line of sight to the back half of the year, gives us confidence in our full year results. To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on our integration efforts with high intensity, driving profitable growth through new sales, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. 
Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Woody?"
10081196,370156116,1011746,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9. Adjusted revenue increased 5.4% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew $696 million, a 12.7% increase compared to the prior year on an adjusted combined basis as if we had own SunGard in the prior-year period. Th",1489,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9. Adjusted revenue increased 5.4% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew $696 million, a 12.7% increase compared to the prior year on an adjusted combined basis as if we had own SunGard in the prior-year period. This represents 220 basis points of margin expansion and now gives us 2 quarters of strong validation in the earnings power of our business model, our portfolio solutions enhanced by SunGard and our ability to execute on large strategic acquisitions. 
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $295 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 21.6% to $0.90 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the prior-year period. 
For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue increased 4.8% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $1.3 billion, a 10.6% increase compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis. 
EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points to 28.8%. Earnings per share grew 21.6% to $1.69 per share. 
Before I move to our segment results, I want to provide an update on our integration efforts. We continue to execute on our integration plans and close the second quarter at over $100 million in run rate synergies for the year. 
We remain confident in meeting our 2016 goal of $150 million in run rate synergies and exceeding our 2017 target of $200 million. As Gary said, this was a very strong quarter and we're pleased with the results for the first half of the year. 
Moving to Slide 10. In the second quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue grew on an organic basis by 8.3%. More importantly, adjusted EBITDA increased to $450 million, an increase of 8.7% compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis. 
For the first half of the year, revenue increased 6.9% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $876 million, a 5.4% increase compared to the prior-year period. 
Turning to Slide 11. Banking and wealth grew 9.7% organically for the quarter. This was driven primarily by continued market demand for regulatory and compliance solutions and in particular, a large risk and compliance project that is nearing completion. We are extremely pleased with payments growth of 8.3%, representing one of the strongest quarters for this group in the last decade. This was driven by continued strong demand for EMV card production, continued mobile wallet enablement and an uptick in front processing volumes. 
Corporate and digital grew 4.8% with digital banking again posting double -- strong double-digit growth in the quarter. This was partially offset by corporate liquidity products, which have been a difficult comparison to the prior-year period. While we're very pleased with these results, we don't anticipate this level of federated growth to be sustainable for the back half of the year and also recognize that we had more difficult comparisons to the prior-year period for the IFS segment. 
Turning to Slide 12. In the second quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue grew 2.9% organically. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $287 million, a 9.2% increase compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis. For the quarter, this represents 210 basis points of margin expansion and speaks to our ability to integrate our acquisitions, coupled with the growth of higher-margin IP-led solutions from SunGard. A combination of these factors creates a structural improvement to the GFS segment, representing approximately 650 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion compared to the prior-year period on a reported basis. 
As we discussed in May at our Investor Day, we expect GFS margins to continue to improve over the next several years with the completion of our integration efforts and the ongoing growth in these IP-led solutions. 
For the first half of the year, revenue increased 3.6% organically. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $538 million, a 10.7% increase compared to the prior-year period. This represents 240 basis points of margin expansion. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our institutional and wholesale business, which is comprised primary of the former SunGard assets, grew 5.4% organically in the quarter. This is a second quarter in a row of greater than 5% organic growth and speaks to the consistency of the business model. 
Growth was driven primarily by IP-led services and strong software renewables. Banking and payments organic growth was relatively flat in the quarter. As Gary noted, we continue to see sale success in India by signing 3 newly chartered banks as well as growth in our India ATM Payments business. These new signings and increasing adoption rates of ATM usage in the Indian market provide a long-term tailwinds for GFS with recurring high-margin processing revenues. These positive wins were partially offset by difficult comparison to the prior-year period, which included a large software license sale. 
Our consulting business was in line with our expectations. As Gary mentioned, global markets continue to experience uncertainty. I'd like to give some color around our business in the U.K. and exposure to the British pound sterling. Revenues tied to the pound sterling account for approximately 9% of GFS segment revenue and approximately 4% of consolidated revenue. All of the pound sterling is in a meaningful decline recently. We do not anticipate any change or affect to EPS. A significant portion of our operations that support our European clients are located in the U.K. and those sterling-denominated costs reduced our overall U.S. dollar expenses as the sterling weakens compare to the U.S. dollar. 
Our global diversification tends to limit our FX exposure to any 1 currency. For example, Brazilian real has strengthened during the year which help offset the effect of the decline in the pound sterling. As a result, we continue to believe the impact to revenue from foreign currency translation to be a headwind of approximately $100 million for the full year. 
Moving to Slide 14. Corporate and Other adjusted revenue in the second quarter was $154 million with adjusted EBITDA loss of $41 million. The Corporate and Other segment results include $78 million of corporate expenses, which compares favorably to adjusted combined corporate expense of $95 million in the prior-year period, reflecting ongoing execution of our integration plans. 
The segment grew revenue 1.3% on an organic basis. Our public sector and education business is executing strongly and produced good results with continued strong organic revenue of 6.4% for the quarter. 
Public sector and education grew revenue 6.8% for the first half of the year while also increasing EBITDA margins by over 300 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our business model continues to generate significant cash flow. For the quarter, free cash flow was $291 million and $629 million for the first half of the year. We paid down over $300 million of debt since December 31 and have approximately $11.1 billion of debt outstanding as of June 30. 
We remain highly focused on cash flow generation to delever the balance sheet and this continues to be a priority for us in the coming quarters. In the second quarter, we returned $86 million to shareholders through dividends and have returned $171 million in dividends year-to-date. We ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of $329 million on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate was 35% for the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 16. Based on our progress to-date and our current visibility into the second half of 2016, we are increasing our full year guidance as follows: Organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% versus original guidance of 3% to 4%; and adjusted EPS of $3.75 to $3.85 per share versus original guidance of $3.70 to $3.80. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to provide additional thoughts in the second half of the year and the third quarter in particular. In the third quarter of 2015, we eliminated all incentive accruals. This year, we are funding these accruals based on higher performance in the first half of the year, which is creating an increasingly difficult comparison to the prior-year period. 
We also plan the next wave of additional cost synergies will flow mainly into the fourth quarter. Given those factors, we view the markets current consensus estimates for the third quarter to be approximately $0.06 ahead of our expectations, offset by the fourth quarter estimates being about $0.06 below our expectations. 
We continue to have strong confidence in our operating planning fundamentals as evidenced by our results through the first half of the year and the increase to our full year guidance. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our results for the first half of 2016 and our outlook for the full year. Our business model generates predictable and consistent earnings per share growth and creates strong cash flow allowing us to reinvest in the business and return cash to shareholders. We believe that strength of the business model will continue to drive shareholder returns for many years. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

If you look at the SunGard growth itself, we talked about it being about a 3% to 4% grower. If you card SunGard out of the various segment, it was at the high end of that at about 4%. So again, higher growth in the institutional and wholesale on the lower growth in the corporate treasury and liquidity business. So that's the first item there. With regard to synergies, we originally talked about our $100 million as our target. In the first quarter, we talked about it being about a $0.02 to $0.03 expectation and thus beating that by about $0.01 or about $0.04 in the first quarter. I would say the second quarter was close to that $0.04, exiting the second quarter through over $100 million in run rate synergies. What you've got is some of the first phase items that as we've gotten up relatively quickly and are seen the benefit of that, then we'll go into a second phase that we will see more of the benefit of that into the fourth quarter. That's the biggest delta in terms of the synergy delta between third and fourth quarter. The other items in the third quarter, again, was really around incentive accruals we're having a better year this year and our incentive accruals are accordingly a little higher than normal levels. That coupled with last year, we reversed incentive accruals, which gave a lift in operating expenses that we don't expect to recur and greeting a difficult comp in the third quarter. So a combination of those the factors that are really what you're seeing in that third to fourth quarter shift."

You're exactly right, the comps in IFS get more difficult. We don't anticipate his level of growth from the IFS group in the back half of the year but we would anticipate to be higher than the midpoint of our midterm revenue guidance, higher than the 4.5 midpoint of the guidance that we gave. We also have a flattening, if you will, of synergies. We expect the same level of synergies in Q3 and accelerated level of surges in Q4 based on the timing of activities that we have going right now. The third item we talked about was the third quarter having a more and more difficult comp related to incentive accruals. Last year, we reduced incentive accruals significantly. In fact, [ph] ticked them [ph] 0 as of the end of the third quarter. This year, we are performing better and incentive accruals are higher than 100% right now. Those are the 3 big items that you see in ther e. So as we look to understand SunGard better and better to your seeing a little bit more seasonality as we flow between the third and the fourth quarter, as they have a higher level of revenue and renewal growth in the fourth quarter than originally anticipated. Those are the 4 big items, Brett, to look at. Net-net, again, about $0.06 below expectations compared to the market consensus for third quarter, increasing about $0.06 compared to market expectations in the fourth quarter and the full year, I think, you guys are about 3 80 on a consensus basis, which is midpoint of the updated guidance."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm extremely pleased to open the call today reporting that FIS had another strong quarter, outperforming our expectations. We saw growth across both operating segments and excee",1201,"Thank you, Pete. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm extremely pleased to open the call today reporting that FIS had another strong quarter, outperforming our expectations. We saw growth across both operating segments and exceeded our consolidated revenue, EBITDA and EPS targets. These results build on the positive momentum established in Q1 and characterize the first half of the year with strong profitable growth, delivering outstanding shareholder returns.
Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive. As a result, we will be increasing our guidance. 
Turning to Slide 5. Second quarter top line growth exceeded expectations. Adjusted revenue increased more than 5% organically compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to see EBITDA contribution from our organic revenue growth and also strong benefit from our synergy attainment to date. This resulted in EBITDA growing more than twice as fast as revenue at 13%, and adjusted earnings per share rose 22%.
As we reported last quarter, we remain ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration and are confident that we will exit the year with $150 million in run rate synergy. We remain on track to beat our stated end goal of $200 million. 
The team continues to perform well against both committed cost synergies and sales execution, which is beginning to yield results in new and existing client sales. They also have maintained a heightened level of focus on this integration with a clear line of sight to all of our targets. As highlighted previously, FIS has a proven track record of meeting or exceeding our synergy targets. And based on our progress to date, improving integration processes, this trend will continue.
While the markets have experienced some turmoil, FIS has continued to deliver impressive results. Our mission-critical applications, which serve clients of all sizes in the diverse geographic regions where we operate, drive both revenue diversification and predictable stability and scale for our clients. 
Brexit is obviously creating some uncertainty in the market. At this time, we have not seen any impact to our current relationships. While this will continue to unfold over the next several years, change typically creates opportunity for FIS. Our pipeline for the remainder of the year is robust. Market and client demand for our solutions continues with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies and implementing transformational solutions. Our sales teams are doing a good job of converting these opportunities to new wins and creating cross-sell and upsell programs to existing clients.
By all accounts, this is an exceptional first half to the year and creates a strong foundation for achieving our full year 2016 goals and longer-term growth objectives. We are confident in driving continued earnings growth in the back half of the year while remaining focused on continued improvements on our cost structure and steady execution of our four-pronged growth strategy, which is to grow our base business, unlock enterprise value through strategic investments, expand our solution portfolio all while focusing on strong financial discipline.
Turning to Slide 6 to review our segment highlights. In our Integrated Financial Solutions business, we had a very strong revenue growth of over 8% organically. We saw especially strong growth in our digital, payments and enterprise governance, risk and compliance solution businesses. Looking to the future, our sales teams are on target to deliver on our cross-sell and new sell goals for the year. 
In our banking and wealth management business, we signed several strategic long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks seeking the benefits of our fully integrated solution suite. For example, in April, we signed a new multiyear strategic agreement with a $16 billion community bank to extend its FIS core banking solution across its entire banking enterprise. This bank, which recently nearly doubled its size, has also added new FIS digital, mobile, item capture and bill pay solutions to its customer-facing capabilities. 
Our Payments business had another strong quarter with 8% organic growth, driven by our high-margin, high-reoccurring EFT processing business and our mobile wallet enablement. This growth was also supplemented by continued strong growth in our card production business, especially from our EMV card deployments. We also signed a multiyear electronic benefits transfer processing deal with one of the largest states in the U.S., providing benefits to more than 2 million households. All of these new and extended relationships demonstrate FIS' strength in serving the banking and payment needs of North American institutions regardless of size. This demand created reoccurring revenues of more than 85%, which is driven by our long-term mission-critical software applications deployed in our one-to-many model. 
Turning to our Global Financial Solutions business. We also had solid sales performance overall leading to end-quarter and future-quarter results. In the quarter, we delivered top line organic growth of 3%. 
Our institutional and wholesale business, which consists of the majority of the former SunGard business, delivered top line organic growth of more than 5% with strong IP-led services and licensed product sales in the quarter, representing 2 consecutive quarters of over 5% growth. 
In May, we announced that Credit Suisse had adopted the FIS derivatives utility, becoming the second major capital markets firm to join. We are pleased to see continued interest in this offering, where clients are benefiting from moving to a highly scalable, consumption-based solution to deliver cost and efficiency gains. This further illustrates the move towards outsourcing in the global financial markets. 
Our Clear2Pay global enterprise payments delivery platform continues to perform very well. We saw strong deal closure for this solution in the quarter, including new multiyear deals with a U.S.-based financial institution with more than $60 billion in assets and with one of the world's largest global banks, Credit Suisse. The 2 Credit Suisse deals illustrate the value FIS brings in having solutions across our clients' total needs as well as proving that financial solutions of this global size and scale are making big decisions to drive their business forward even in uncertain times. 
We also saw nice growth in Brazil, mainly due to the strong client relationships we have established in our reoccurring revenue model. Despite continuing unfavorable market conditions, we anticipate a good second half of the year in this market. 
In India, we continue to see strong progress, with newly chartered financial institutions signing significant multiyear deals with 3 of these institutions. Our focus on enabling financial inclusion in India is making a positive difference in this underbanked country, where we've driven tremendous growth. 
Turning next to Slide 7. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize today by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our second quarter results and our first half of the year, where our overall results outperformed our expectations. Our performance, combined with a robust pipeline and clear line of sight to the back half of the year, gives us confidence in our full year results. To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on our integration efforts with high intensity, driving profitable growth through new sales, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. 
Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Woody?"

This represents 220 basis points of margin expansion and now gives us 2 quarters of strong validation in the earnings power of our business model, our portfolio solutions enhanced by SunGard and our ability to execute on large strategic acquisitions. 
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $295 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 21.6% to $0.90 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the prior year period. 
For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue increased 4.8% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $1.3 billion, a 10.6% increase compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis. 
EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points to 28.8%. Earnings per share grew 21.6% to $1.69 per share. 
Before I move to our segment results, I want to provide an update on our integration efforts. We continue to execute on our integration plans and closed the second quarter at over $100 million in run rate synergies for the year. We remain confident in meeting our 2016 goal of $150 million in run rate synergies and exceeding our 2017 target of $200 million. As Gary said, this was a very strong quarter, and we're pleased with the results for the first half of the year. 
Moving to Slide 10. In the second quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue grew on an organic basis by 8.3%. More importantly, adjusted EBITDA increased to $450 million, an increase of 8.7% compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis. For the first half of the year, revenue increased 6.9% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $876 million, a 5.4% increase compared to the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 11. Banking and wealth grew 9.7% organically for the quarter. This was driven primarily by continued market demand for regulatory and compliance solutions and in particular, a large risk and compliance project that is nearing completion. We're extremely pleased with payments growth of 8.3%, representing one of the strongest quarters for this group in the last decade. This was driven by continued strong demand for EMV card production, continued mobile wallet enablement and an uptick in fraud processing volumes. 
Corporate and digital grew 4.8%, with digital banking again posting double -- strong double-digit growth in the quarter. This was partially offset by our corporate liquidity products, which had a more difficult comparison to the prior year period. While we're very pleased with these results, we don't anticipate this level of accelerated growth to be sustainable for the back half of the year and also recognize that we had more difficult comparisons to the prior year period for the IFS segment. 
Turning to Slide 12. In the second quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue grew 2.9% organically. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $287 million, a 9.2% increase compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis. For the quarter, this represents 210 basis points of margin expansion and speaks to our ability to integrate our acquisitions, coupled with the growth of higher-margin, IP-led solutions from SunGard. A combination of these factors creates a structural improvement to the GFS segment, representing approximately 650 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion compared to the prior year period on a reported basis. As we discussed in May at our Investor Day, we expect GFS margins to continue to improve over the next several years with the completion of our integration efforts and the ongoing growth in these IP-led solutions. 
For the first half of the year, revenue increased 3.6% organically. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $538 million, a 10.7% increase compared to the prior year period. This represents 240 basis points of margin expansion. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our institutional and wholesale business, which is comprised primarily of the former SunGard assets, grew 5.4% organically in the quarter. This is the second quarter in a row of greater than 5% organic growth and speaks to the consistency of the business model. Growth was driven primarily by IP-led services and strong software renewables. 
Banking and payments organic growth was relatively flat in the quarter. As Gary noted, we continue to see sales success in India by signing 3 newly chartered banks as well as growth in our India ATM Payments business. These new signings and increasing adoption rates of ATM usage in the Indian market provide a long-term tailwind for GFS with recurring high-margin processing revenues. These positive wins were partially offset by a difficult comparison to the prior year period, which included a large software license sale. 
Our consulting business was in line with our expectations. As Gary mentioned, global markets continue to experience uncertainty. I'd like to give some color around our business in the U.K. and exposure to the British pound sterling. Revenues tied to the pound sterling account for approximately 9% of GFS segment revenue and approximately 4% of consolidated revenue. Although the pound sterling is in a meaningful decline recently, we do not anticipate any change or effect to EPS. A significant portion of our operations that support our European clients are located in the U.K., and those sterling-denominated costs reduced our overall U.S. dollar expenses as the sterling weakens compared to the U.S. dollar. 
Our global diversification tends to limit our FX exposure to any one currency. For example, the Brazilian real has strengthened during the year, which helps offset the effect of the decline in the pound sterling. As a result, we continue to believe the impact to revenue from foreign currency translation to be a headwind of approximately $100 million for the full year. 
Moving to Slide 14. Corporate and Other adjusted revenue in the second quarter was $154 million with adjusted EBITDA loss of $41 million. The Corporate and Other segment results include $78 million of corporate expenses, which compares favorably to adjusted combined corporate expense of $95 million in the prior year period, reflecting ongoing execution of our integration plans. 
The segment grew revenue 1.3% on an organic basis. Our public sector and education business is executing strongly and produced good results with continued strong organic revenue of 6.4% for the quarter. Public sector and education grew revenue 6.8% for the first half of the year while also increasing EBITDA margins by over 300 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our business model continues to generate significant cash flow. For the quarter, free cash flow was $291 million and $629 million for the first half of the year. We paid down over $300 million of debt since December 31 and have an approximately $11.1 billion of debt outstanding as of June 30. We remain highly focused on cash flow generation to delever the balance sheet, and this continues to be a priority for us in the coming quarters. 
In the second quarter, we returned $86 million to shareholders through dividends and have returned $171 million in dividends year-to-date. We ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of 329 million on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate was 35% for the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 16. Based on our progress to-date and our current visibility into the second half of 2016, we are increasing our full year guidance as follows: organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% versus the original guidance of 3% to 4% and adjusted EPS of $3.75 to $3.85 per share versus the original guidance of $3.70 to $3.80 per share. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to provide some additional thoughts on the second half of the year and the third quarter, in particular. In the third quarter of 2015, we eliminated all incentive accruals. This year, we are funding these accruals based on higher performance in the first half of the year, which is creating an increasingly difficult comparison to the prior year period. We also plan that the next wave of additional cost synergies will flow mainly into the fourth quarter. Given those factors, we view the market's current consensus estimates for the third quarter to be approximately $0.06 ahead of our expectations, offset by the fourth quarter estimates being about $0.06 below our expectations. We continue to have strong confidence in our operating and planning fundamentals, as evidenced by our results through the first half of the year and the increase to our full year guidance. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our results for the first half of 2016 and our outlook for the full year. Our business model generates predictable and consistent earnings per share growth and creates strong cash flow, allowing us to reinvest in the business and return cash to shareholders. We believe the strength of the business model will continue to drive shareholder returns for many years. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

Let me try to answer one at a time. If you look at the SunGard growth itself, we talked about it being about a 3% to 4% grower.

If you look at the SunGard growth itself, we talked about it being about a 3% to 4% grower. If you carve SunGard out of the various segments, it was at the high end of that, at about 4%. So again, higher growth in institutional and wholesale, a little lower growth in the corporate treasury and liquidity business. So that's the first item there. With regard to synergies, we originally talked about $100 million as our target. In the first quarter, we talked about it being about a $0.02 to $0.03 expectation and us beating that by about $0.01 or about $0.04 in the first quarter. I would say, the second quarter was close to that $0.04, exiting the second quarter a little over $100 million in run rate synergies. What you've got is some of the first phase items that we've gotten up relatively quickly and are seeing the benefit of that. Then you'll go into a second phase that will see more of the benefit of that into the fourth quarter. That's the biggest delta in terms of the synergy delta between third and fourth quarter. The other items in the third quarter, again, was really around incentive accruals. We're having a better year this year, and our incentive accruals are, accordingly, a little higher than normal levels. That coupled with last year, we reversed incentive accruals, which gave a lift in the operating expenses that we don't expect to recur and are creating a difficult comp in the third quarter. So a combination of those 2 factors are really what you're seeing in that third to fourth quarter shift."

We really have pushed back into more transformational thought leadership-type consulting engagements. Our book-to-bill continues to be very high. So are we onboarding new clients all the time? And we're refilling that. As you mentioned, in the back half the year, we do have easier comps. We'll see that growth rate accelerate. As we talked about in the last quarter, we intentionally will -- we don't expect that -- our consulting business to accelerate growth much beyond the overall GFS growth rate historically. But the team has done an excellent job and continues to bring on new business with all this uncertainty and -- oftentimes that drives consulting engagements for us. So we're certainly available to help our clients as they deal through all of these changes."

We highlighted the Credit Suisse situation and the post traits outsourcing all of that capabilities to our utility. You see a number of other institutions when I highlighted that $16 billion institution on an outsource basis. So the reality is the larger institutions are accelerating. They're looking for ways to take cost out. They're looking for ways to accelerate their deployment of solutions to compete across the spectrum, and that's just going to naturally drive outsourcing. We also continue to see that accelerate in the global markets. Frankly, we saw the India ATM deal a couple of years ago. We highlighted that is really the first significant step for outsourcing in that country. We now highlighted 3 brand-new institutions coming on to our full capabilities. That's all on an outsourced basis. So we're seeing outsourcing accelerate definitely across the globe."

We also have a flattening, if you will, of synergies. We would expect the same level of synergies in Q3 and accelerated level of synergies in Q4 based on the timing of activities that we have going right now. The third item that we talked about was the third quarter having a more and more difficult comp related to incentive accruals. Last year, we reduced incentive accruals significantly. In fact, ticked them to 0 as of the end of the third quarter. This year, we're performing better, and incentive accruals are higher than 100% right now. Those are the 3 big items that you see in there. As we look to understand SunGard better and better, you're seeing a little bit more seasonality as we flow between the third and the fourth quarter as they have a higher level of revenue and renewal growth in the fourth quarter than originally anticipated. Those are your 4 big items, Brett, to look at. Net-net, again, about $0.06 below expectations compared to the market consensus for third quarter, increasing about $0.06 compared to market expectations in the fourth quarter.

I think the other thought around -- on Brexit, specifically, would be we anticipate it's going to take a couple of years at least for things to sort themselves out. Again, traditionally, we've seen upside. The more difficult time we saw at Capco was in the fourth quarter of last year. We saw a 10% decline. We think we don't anticipate anything like that, given the nature of the consulting engagements and then refocusing on the more boutique and strategic consulting versus the larger projects. So feel good about it. Again, easier comp in the back half of the year for the consulting business, but we don't anticipate a lot of growth out of it this year.

I'm extremely pleased to open the call today reporting that FIS had another strong quarter, outperforming our expectations. We saw growth across both operating segments and exceeded our consolidated revenue, EBITDA and EPS targets. These results build on the positive momentum established in Q1 and characterize the first half of the year with strong profitable growth, delivering outstanding shareholder returns.
Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive. As a result, we will be increasing our guidance. 
Turning to Slide 5. Second quarter top line growth exceeded expectations. Adjusted revenue increased more than 5% organically compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to see EBITDA contribution from our organic revenue growth and also strong benefit from our synergy attainment to date. This resulted in EBITDA growing more than twice as fast as revenue at 13%, and adjusted earnings per share rose 22%.
As we reported last quarter, we remain ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration and are confident that we will exit the year with $150 million in run rate synergy. We remain on track to beat our stated end goal of $200 million. 
The team continues to perform well against both committed cost synergies and sales execution, which is beginning to yield results in new and existing client sales. They also have maintained a heightened level of focus on this integration with a clear line of sight to all of our targets. As highlighted previously, FIS has a proven track record of meeting or exceeding our synergy targets. And based on our progress to date and proven integration processes, this trend will continue.
While the markets have experienced some turmoil, FIS has continued to deliver impressive results. Our mission-critical applications, which serve clients of all sizes in the diverse geographic regions where we operate, drive both revenue diversification and predictable stability and scale for our clients. 
Brexit is obviously creating some uncertainty in the market. At this time, we have not seen any impact to our current relationships. While this will continue to unfold over the next several years, change typically creates opportunity for FIS. Our pipeline for the remainder of the year is robust. Market and client demand for our solutions continues with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies and implementing transformational solutions. Our sales teams are doing a good job of converting these opportunities to new wins and creating cross-sell and upsell programs to existing clients.
By all accounts, this is an exceptional first half to the year and creates a strong foundation for achieving our full year 2016 goals and longer-term growth objectives. We are confident in driving continued earnings growth in the back half of the year while remaining focused on continued improvements in our cost structure and steady execution of our four-pronged growth strategy, which is to grow our base business, unlock enterprise value through strategic investments, expand our solution portfolio, all while focusing on strong financial discipline.
Turning to Slide 6 to review our segment highlights. In our Integrated Financial Solutions business, we had a very strong revenue growth of over 8% organically. We saw especially strong growth in our digital, payments and enterprise governance, risk and compliance solution businesses. Looking to the future, our sales teams are on target to deliver on our cross-sell and new sell goals for the year. 
In our banking and wealth management business, we signed several strategic long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks seeking the benefits of our fully integrated solution suite. For example, in April, we signed a new multiyear strategic agreement with a $16 billion community bank to extend its FIS core banking solution across its entire banking enterprise. This bank, which recently nearly doubled its size, has also added new FIS digital, mobile, item capture and bill pay solutions to its customer-facing capabilities. 
Our Payments business had another strong quarter with 8% organic growth, driven by our high-margin, high-reoccurring EFT processing business and our mobile wallet enablement. This growth was also supplemented by continued strong growth in our card production business, especially from our EMV card deployments. We also signed a multiyear electronic benefits transfer processing deal with one of the largest states in the U.S., providing benefits to more than 2 million households. All of these new and extended relationships demonstrate FIS' strength in serving the banking and payment needs of North American institutions regardless of size. This demand created reoccurring revenues of more than 85%, which is driven by our long-term mission-critical software applications deployed in our one-to-many model. 
Turning to our Global Financial Solutions business. We also had solid sales performance overall leading to in-quarter and future-quarter results. In the quarter, we delivered top line organic growth of 3%. 
Our institutional and wholesale business, which consists of the majority of the former SunGard business, delivered top line organic growth of more than 5% with strong IP-led services and licensed product sales in the quarter, representing 2 consecutive quarters of over 5% growth. 
In May, we announced that Crédit Suisse had adopted the FIS derivatives utility, becoming the second major capital markets firm to join. We are pleased to see continued interest in this offering, where clients are benefiting from moving to a highly scalable, consumption-based solution to deliver cost and efficiency gains. This further illustrates the move towards outsourcing in the global financial markets. 
Our Clear2Pay global enterprise payments delivery platform continues to perform very well. We saw strong deal closure for this solution in the quarter, including new multiyear deals with a U.S.-based financial institution with more than $60 billion in assets and with one of the world's largest global banks, Crédit Suisse. The 2 Crédit Suisse deals illustrate the value FIS brings in having solutions across our clients' total needs as well as proving that financial institutions of this global size and scale are making big decisions to drive their business forward even in uncertain times. 
We also saw nice growth in Brazil, mainly due to the strong client relationships we have established in our reoccurring revenue model. Despite continuing unfavorable market conditions, we anticipate a good second half of the year in this market. 
In India, we continue to see strong progress, with newly chartered financial institutions signing significant multiyear deals with 3 of these institutions. Our focus on enabling financial inclusion in India is making a positive difference in this underbanked country, where we've driven tremendous growth. 
Turning next to Slide 7. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize today by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our second quarter results and our first half of the year, where our overall results outperformed our expectations. Our performance, combined with a robust pipeline and clear line of sight to the back half of the year, gives us confidence in our full year results. To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on our integration efforts with high intensity, driving profitable growth through new sales, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. 
Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Woody?"
10081196,370156116,1012279,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9. Adjusted revenue increased 5.4% on an organic basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew $696 million, a 12.7% increase compared to the prior year on an adjusted combined basis as if we had owned SunGard in the prior year period.",1508,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9. Adjusted revenue increased 5.4% on an organic basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew $696 million, a 12.7% increase compared to the prior year on an adjusted combined basis as if we had owned SunGard in the prior year period. This represents 220 basis points of margin expansion and now gives us 2 quarters of strong validation in the earnings power of our business model, our portfolio solutions enhanced by SunGard and our ability to execute on large strategic acquisitions. 
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $295 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 21.6% to $0.90 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the prior year period. 
For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue increased 4.8% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $1.3 billion, a 10.6% increase compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis. 
EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points to 28.8%. Earnings per share grew 21.6% to $1.69 per share. 
Before I move to our segment results, I want to provide an update on our integration efforts. We continue to execute on our integration plans and closed the second quarter at over $100 million in run rate synergies for the year. We remain confident in meeting our 2016 goal of $150 million in run rate synergies and exceeding our 2017 target of $200 million. As Gary said, this was a very strong quarter, and we're pleased with the results for the first half of the year. 
Moving to Slide 10. In the second quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue grew on an organic basis by 8.3%. More importantly, adjusted EBITDA increased to $450 million, an increase of 8.7% compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis. For the first half of the year, revenue increased 6.9% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $876 million, a 5.4% increase compared to the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 11. Banking and wealth grew 9.7% organically for the quarter. This was driven primarily by continued market demand for regulatory and compliance solutions and in particular, a large risk and compliance project that is nearing completion. We're extremely pleased with payments growth of 8.3%, representing one of the strongest quarters for this group in the last decade. This was driven by continued strong demand for EMV card production, continued mobile wallet enablement and an uptick in fraud processing volumes. 
Corporate and digital grew 4.8%, with digital banking again posting double -- strong double-digit growth in the quarter. This was partially offset by our corporate liquidity products, which had a more difficult comparison to the prior year period. While we're very pleased with these results, we don't anticipate this level of accelerated growth to be sustainable for the back half of the year and also recognize that we had more difficult comparisons to the prior year period for the IFS segment. 
Turning to Slide 12. In the second quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue grew 2.9% organically. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $287 million, a 9.2% increase compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis. For the quarter, this represents 210 basis points of margin expansion and speaks to our ability to integrate our acquisitions, coupled with the growth of higher-margin, IP-led solutions from SunGard. A combination of these factors creates a structural improvement to the GFS segment, representing approximately 650 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion compared to the prior year period on a reported basis. As we discussed in May at our Investor Day, we expect GFS margins to continue to improve over the next several years with the completion of our integration efforts and the ongoing growth in these IP-led solutions. 
For the first half of the year, revenue increased 3.6% organically. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $538 million, a 10.7% increase compared to the prior year period. This represents 240 basis points of margin expansion. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our institutional and wholesale business, which is comprised primarily of the former SunGard assets, grew 5.4% organically in the quarter. This is the second quarter in a row of greater than 5% organic growth and speaks to the consistency of the business model. Growth was driven primarily by IP-led services and strong software renewals. 
Banking and payments organic growth was relatively flat in the quarter. As Gary noted, we continue to see sales success in India by signing 3 newly chartered banks as well as growth in our India ATM Payments business. These new signings and increasing adoption rates of ATM usage in the Indian market provide a long-term tailwind for GFS with recurring high-margin processing revenues. These positive wins were partially offset by a difficult comparison to the prior year period, which included a large software license sale. 
Our consulting business was in line with our expectations. As Gary mentioned, global markets continue to experience uncertainty. I'd like to give some color around our business in the U.K. and exposure to the British pound sterling. Revenues tied to the pound sterling account for approximately 9% of GFS segment revenue and approximately 4% of consolidated revenue. Although the pound sterling has seen a meaningful decline recently, we do not anticipate any change or effect to EPS. A significant portion of our operations that support our European clients are located in the U.K., and those sterling-denominated costs reduce our overall U.S. dollar expenses as the sterling weakens compared to the U.S. dollar. 
Our global diversification tends to limit our FX exposure to any one currency. For example, the Brazilian real has strengthened during the year, which helps offset the effect of the decline in the pound sterling. As a result, we continue to believe the impact to revenue from foreign currency translation to be a headwind of approximately $100 million for the full year. 
Moving to Slide 14. Corporate and Other adjusted revenue in the second quarter was $154 million with adjusted EBITDA loss of $41 million. The Corporate and Other segment results include $78 million of corporate expenses, which compare favorably to adjusted combined corporate expense of $95 million in the prior year period, reflecting ongoing execution of our integration plans. 
The segment grew revenue 1.3% on an organic basis. Our public sector and education business is executing strongly and produced good results with continued strong organic revenue of 6.4% for the quarter. Public sector and education grew revenue 6.8% for the first half of the year while also increasing EBITDA margins by over 300 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our business model continues to generate significant cash flow. For the quarter, free cash flow was $291 million and $629 million for the first half of the year. We paid down over $300 million of debt since December 31 and have an approximately $11.1 billion of debt outstanding as of June 30. We remain highly focused on cash flow generation to delever the balance sheet, and this continues to be a priority for us in the coming quarters. 
In the second quarter, we returned $86 million to shareholders through dividends and have returned $171 million in dividends year-to-date. We ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of 329 million on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate was 35% for the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 16. Based on our progress to-date and our current visibility into the second half of 2016, we are increasing our full year guidance as follows: organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% versus original guidance of 3% to 4% and adjusted EPS of $3.75 to $3.85 per share versus original guidance of $3.70 to $3.80 per share. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to provide some additional thoughts on the second half of the year and the third quarter, in particular. In the third quarter of 2015, we eliminated all incentive accruals. This year, we are funding these accruals based on higher performance in the first half of the year, which is creating an increasingly difficult comparison to the prior year period. We also plan that the next wave of additional cost synergies will flow mainly into the fourth quarter. Given those factors, we view the market's current consensus estimates for the third quarter to be approximately $0.06 ahead of our expectations, offset by the fourth quarter estimates being about $0.06 below our expectations. We continue to have strong confidence in our operating plan and fundamentals, as evidenced by our results through the first half of the year and the increase to our full year guidance. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our results for the first half of 2016 and our outlook for the full year. Our business model generates predictable and consistent earnings per share growth and creates strong cash flow, allowing us to reinvest in the business and return cash to shareholders. We believe the strength of the business model will continue to drive shareholder returns for many years. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

If you look at the SunGard growth itself, we talked about it being about a 3% to 4% grower. If you carve SunGard out of the various segments, it was at the high end of that, at about 4%. So again, higher growth in institutional and wholesale, a little lower growth in the corporate treasury and liquidity business. So that's the first item there. With regard to synergies, we originally talked about $100 million as our target. In the first quarter, we talked about it being about a $0.02 to $0.03 expectation and us beating that by about $0.01 or about $0.04 in the first quarter. I would tell you the second quarter was close to that $0.04, exiting the second quarter a little over $100 million in run rate synergies. What you've got is some of the first phase items that as we've gotten that relatively quickly and are seeing the benefit of that. Then you'll go into a second phase that will see more of the benefit of that into the fourth quarter. That's the biggest delta in the terms of the synergy delta between third and fourth quarter. The other item in the third quarter, again, was really around incentive accruals. We're having a better year this year, and our incentive accruals are, accordingly, a little higher than normal levels. That coupled with last year, we reversed incentive accruals, which gave a lift in operating expenses that we don't expect to recur and are creating a difficult comp in the third quarter. So a combination of those 2 factors are really what you're seeing in that third to fourth quarter shift."

In fact, took them to 0 as of the end of the third quarter. This year, we're performing better, and incentive accruals are higher than 100% right now. Those are the 3 big items that you see in there.

I am pleased to open the call affirming another strong quarter of execution for FIS. We saw expected growth across all operating segments. Our Q3 results continued the positive momentum we built in the first half of the year, delivering profitable growth and outstanding cash flow. This is the third consecutive strong quarter, which speaks to the fundamental strength of our underlying business and the success of our focused execution. 
Now turning to the remainder of the year. We are pleased that our outlook remains positive. Despite continuing macroeconomic pressures, our sales teams continued converting opportunities to new wins in cross-selling and upselling to existing clients. Market and client demand for our solution continues with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies to run and grow their business. These results and trends underscore confidence and a strong finish to 2016. 
As a result of our solid performance year-to-date and remaining outlook, we will be increasing our current guidance for the second time this year, which Woody will open[ph]  later in the call. 
Turning to Slide 5. As expected in the quarter, adjusted revenue increased 4% organically compared to the prior year quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA grew more than twice as fast as revenue at 8% and adjusted earnings per share rose 11%. We are very pleased with these results given the difficult comparisons of the prior year quarter. As you will recall, last year was a very good quarter for license fees, especially with regards to the former SunGard business. Also Q3 2015 marked the quarter where we reversed short-term incentives due to the year-to-date results. 
But less than 90 days until year-end, we remain ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration. We are very pleased to report that we are on track to exceed our run rate synergy commitments and the have line of sight to exit the year with $200 million in run rate synergies for 2016. This milestone is a full 12 months ahead of schedule from originally targeted dates. 
We are confident that we will also exceed our long-term target and deliver more than $250 million in run rate synergies by year-end 2017, continuing our positive track record of exceeding our synergy commitments. More importantly, our intense focus on the integration is continuing to yield results in new and existing client sales. 
On all accounts, we are pleased with our strong performance through the first 3 quarters of the year. We are on track to exceed our full year 2016 goals and are well positioned to achieve our longer-term growth objectives, which are to: grow our base business; unlock enterprise value through strategic investments; expand our solution portfolio within our existing client base; and remain focused on strong financial discipline. 
Turn to Slide 6 to review segment highlights. Our Integrated Financial Solutions business continues to grow, driving top line organic revenue growth of more than 4% this quarter. We saw solid growth in our retail banking, wealth and payment businesses, entering into several strategic, long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks seeking [ph] the benefits of our fully integrated solution suite. In the third quarter, we signed several new competitive takeaways encompassing our core banking, digital and payment solution offerings. 
For example, as you've seen in our recent press release, a multi-state community bank with approximately $10 billion in assets selected FIS to provide a complete suite of banking and payment solutions spanning our core processing, digital payments, EFT, card personalization and fully managed IP outsourcing to help drive its digital and commercial growth through next-generation technologies. 
In another example, a fast-growing community bank in the Pacific Northwest will be implementing FIS core banking, bill pay, lending and processing solutions to support its growth and efficiency goals. 
Our Payments business had another strong quarter with nearly 6% organic growth, driven by continued growth in debit processing volumes and our card production business, especially from our EMV card deployments. 
In addition, our innovation investments are showing early promise with the successful rollout of a new mobile-based fraud prevention solution, driving demand as institutions look to help their customers better combat fraud. 
Importantly, these new wins characterize the strength of FIS' growth profile, which is long-term, mission-critical, software applications deployed in our one-to-many model that create significant and predictable reoccurring revenues. 
Turning next to our Global Financial Solutions business. We delivered another strong quarter with top line organic growth of 4.5%. Opportunities in this segment were driven by client demand for our transformational and next-generation institutional and wholesale and banking and payments capabilities. Demand for our banking payment solutions outside of North America remains strong, driving organic revenue growth of 11% this quarter. While Asia continues to be a high-growth market, we were pleased to see steady growth in EMEA with continued progress in Brazil. In late September, Sainsbury Bank went live on its new FIS-hosted banking platform, enabling the bank to support its customers with next-generation capabilities and technology. This delivery milestone moves the FIS and Sainsbury Bank relationship into an exciting new phase, as we begin the long-term, decade-plus operating agreement where we are focused on running the daily operations of the bank. With this successful implementation, we are proud to be the FinTech partner of choice for 2 of the U.K.'s most innovative financial services providers, Sainsbury Bank and Atom Bank, both having gone live on FIS solutions in the last few months. 
In Asia, we continue to build on our already strong market presence, signing significant multiyear deals with 2 de novo institutions in India this quarter. In addition, we entered into an agreement to provide new payment capabilities to one of India's largest government-owned banks, showcasing our ability to serve clients of all sizes in this fast-growing market. 
Within our institutional and wholesale business, Crédit Suisse became the second major client to go live on the FIS derivatives utility, approximately 4 months after choosing to join this highly scalable consumption-based solution. We're also pleased to have renewed a significant post-trade agreement to one of the world's largest global institutions. While the IMW business brings more quarterly volatility due to the timing of license fees, we're extremely pleased with the overall year-to-date growth of 4%, which is more than what was originally modeled during the SunGard due diligence. 
Finally, while the amplification of Brexit are still unknown in these early stages, demand for our consulting services are in line with our expectations, as we work with institutions to help them prepare for future scenarios. 
Turning next to Slide 7. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize today by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. Our performance, combined with a strong pipeline and clear line of sight for the remainder of the year, gives us confidence on our full year results. To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on our integration efforts with high intensity, driving profitable growth through new sales, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. 
Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter."
10081196,402494297,1067962,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9. Adjusted revenue increased 3.8% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $766 million, a 7.7% increase compared to the prior year on adjusted combined basis as if SunGard was owned in both periods. Adjusted net",1751,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9. Adjusted revenue increased 3.8% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $766 million, a 7.7% increase compared to the prior year on adjusted combined basis as if SunGard was owned in both periods. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $330 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 11.1% to $1 per share. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue increased to 4.5% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $2.1 billion, a 9.5% increase compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis. EBITDA margin expanded 180 basis points to 30.1% and adjusted earnings per share grew 17.5% to $2.69 per share. As Gary said, we are pleased with the quarter and year-to-date results. 
Moving to Slide 10. In the third quarter, IFS revenue grew on an organic basis by 4.1%, while adjusted EBITDA grew 1% on an adjusted combined basis. As Gary mentioned, in the third quarter of 2015, we reversed incentive accruals due to business performance. In 2016, we're performing ahead of plan and have booked incentive accruals accordingly. This has created a difficult comparison in the third quarter 2016. Absent this difficult comparable, IFS EBITDA would have grown 4.4% or expanded margins by approximately 10 basis points. For the first 9 months, revenue increased 5.9% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew 3.9% compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis. 
Turning to Slide 11. Banking and wealth grew 3.9% organically for the quarter. This was partially driven by a large risk and compliance project and strengthen our IT and print solutions. Payments continue its growth posting 5.8% this quarter. EMV card production, debit and fraud processing all contributed to this growth. As we previously discussed, EMV growth comparables become more difficult in the coming quarters. Corporate and digital grew about 1% for the quarter. Mobile banking continued to grow double digits. The strong growth in mobile was partially offset by timing of license fees and corporate liquidity and the grow-over of a termination fee creating a difficult comparable to the prior year period. 
As discussed in the last quarter's call, we did not expect results for IFS in the second half of the year to replicate the exceptional growth in the first half. We remain confident in IFS producing full year organic growth, exceeding the midpoint of our long-term guidance and are pleased with the year-to-date performance of this segment. 
Turning to Slide 12. In the third quarter, GFS revenue grew 4.5% organically while adjusted EBITDA grew 13.3% on an adjusted combined basis. For the quarter, this represents 290 basis points of margin expansion to 32.1%. Year-to-date, revenue increased 3.9% organically. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.5% compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis reflecting 250 basis points of margin expansion for the first 9 months of 2016. As we've discussed in the last few quarters, the addition of SunGard to the GFS segment is driving a long-term structural improvement to the segment. EBITDA margins for this segment have increased by 630 basis points over the prior year reported margin of 25.8%. The inclusion of the SunGard assets increases revenue contribution from intellectual property-led sales of mission-critical applications and enhances the profit margin profile of the segment. The combination of revenue growth and higher-margin solutions and execution on synergies has driven 3 quarters of meaningful margin expansion. In fact, we now expect to deliver approximately 30% margins in this segment for the full year, ahead of our initial expectations. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our institutional and wholesale business grew approximately 1% for the quarter. As we discussed in the second quarter commentary, we expect a lower growth in institutional and wholesale for the third quarter and expect higher growth in Q4 related to the timing of license signings and including renewals. As we look forward, we're seeing a longer-term trend developing in this market where clients are demanding processing solutions versus a traditional license model. This will be a long-term positive for recurring revenue, but will have some quarterly lumpiness as these contract renewals and sales move to Processing Solutions. Banking and payments grew 11% organically. Growth was led by a onetime fee related to the successful conversion of Sainsbury, and continued strength in Brazil and Asia Pac across both retail banking and payment processing. 
Gary highlighted the continued sales wins and momentum, driving long-term growth for the business creating recurring high-margin revenues. As we've previously discussed, while our consulting business continues to provide value to our clients, it's becoming a smaller part of the overall business. Results for the quarter were in line with our expectations and we continue to see softness in discretionary spending. We do anticipate higher growth in the fourth quarter due primarily to an easier comparison to the prior year period. We continue to project a revenue headwind from foreign currency translation of approximately $100 million for the full year with no adverse impact to EPS guidance. 
Moving to Slide 14. Corporate and Other adjusted revenue in the third quarter was $154 million with adjusted EBITDA loss of $34 million on an adjusted combined basis. The Corporate and Other segment results include $75 million of corporate expenses for the quarter compared to $80 million in the prior year period. This reduction in corporate expense reflects ongoing cost management efforts and synergies. 
As you are aware, the businesses in the segment are nonstrategic and now aligned with our long-term strategy, serving clients in the financial services market. While our public sector and education business again posted very strong organic growth of 6.2%, retail check processing and global commercial services was and will continue to be a headwind for the segment. Despite these headwinds within the Corporate and Other, these do not impact our consolidated 3-year outlook. And our IFS and GFS segments continue to perform well and in line with our expectations. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our business model continues to generate significant cash flow. Free cash flow was $426 million for the quarter and over $1 billion for the first 9 months. In the third quarter, our free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings exceeded 100%. We have reduced our debt by more than $650 million since December 31 and have approximately $10.8 billion of debt outstanding as of September 30. We remain highly focused on cash flow generation to delever the balance sheet, which continues to be a top priority for us. 
In August, we successfully completed the debt refinancing, including a 2-year extension out to 2021 of our $3 billion credit facility and a $2.5 billion bond issuance. These activities reduced our near-term exposure to market uncertainty, increased our liquidity, extended the tenure of our debt by about 2.5 years and locked in attractive rates. These benefits are substantial, although they do create additional interest expense. We are very pleased with the results of these activities and the strong support from fixed income investors. 
In the third quarter, we returned $84 million to shareholders through dividends and have returned $225 million in dividends year-to-date. We ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of 330 million on a fully diluted basis. In line with our previous guidance, the effective tax rate was 35% for the quarter. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to provide some final thoughts as we finish the year. As Gary mentioned, we continue to execute on synergies and expect to exceed our revised 2016 target of $150 million. We now have a line of sight to $200 million in run rate synergies exiting 2016. The team has continued to work diligently on accelerating activities, in addition to identifying new cost take-out opportunities and anticipate exiting 2017 with a cost synergy run rate of more than $250 million. We will continue to provide you updates on our address. 
These higher-than-originally anticipated synergy benefits will be partially offset by 2 factors from an earnings perspective. As discussed, we recently completed a debt refinancing and are incurring additional interest expense. Our original full year guidance for 2016 outlined in February, we  forecasted net interest expense of $370 million. We now expect net interest expense for the full year 2016 to be $12 million higher, primarily impacting Q4. 
Earlier this year, we also provided guidance on depreciation and amortization costs, excluding purchase accounting of $570 million. Due to accelerated integration efforts, including, but not limited to, data center consolidation, implementing enterprise corporate systems, we had increased our short-term capital spend to drive future cost benefits. 
In addition, we continue to invest in our products for future growth, highlighted this quarter by the example Gary provided in his remarks. Based on these discontinued activities and investing to reduce ongoing costs and investing for growth, we now expect depreciation and amortization expense to exceed our original guidance by $10 million to $15 million. We also anticipate our capital expenditures to rose [ph] approximately 6.5% of revenue versus our previous guidance of 6% of revenue for 2016. 
In May of this year, we provided you with a 3-year outlook on revenue growth and profitability and remain comfortable with those views. While I know you want me to discuss 2017 in more detail, we will limit our commentary regarding 2017 at this time and, as usual, provide you full guidance in February. 
Given our performance to date, we're tightening our full year organic revenue growth to the midpoint of our previous guidance range or approximately 4.5% for the year. We also expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $3.80 to $3.85 per share, which increases the low end of our previous range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share. 
As you will recall in the first quarter, we raised our synergy targets for the year. In the second quarter, we raised our revenue and EPS guidance. Today, we are again increasing our synergy targets and tightening our EPS expectations for the year. These increases speak to the fundamental strength of our underlying business and the focused execution of our teams. 
We remain very pleased with our results for the first 9 months of 2016 despite a continued difficult macro environment. Our business model generates consistent earnings per share growth, creates strong cash flow and allows us to return cash to shareholders. We believe the strength of our business model and our company will continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

I am pleased to open the call affirming another strong quarter of execution for FIS. We saw expected growth across all operating segments. Our Q3 results continued the positive momentum we built in the first half of the year, delivering profitable growth and outstanding cash flow. This is the third consecutive strong quarter, which speaks to the fundamental strength of our underlying business and the success of our focused execution. 
Now turning to the remainder of the year. We are pleased that our outlook remains positive. Despite continuing macroeconomic pressures, our sales teams continued converting opportunities to new wins in cross-selling and upselling to existing clients. Market and client demand for our solution continues with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies to run and grow their business. These results and trends underscore confidence and a strong finish to 2016. 
As a result of our solid performance year-to-date and remaining outlook, we will be increasing our current guidance for the second time this year, which Woody will open later in the call.  
Turning to Slide 5. As expected in the quarter, adjusted revenue increased 4% organically compared to the prior year quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA grew more than twice as fast as revenue at 8% and adjusted earnings per share rose 11%. We are very pleased with these results given the difficult comparisons of the prior year quarter. As you will recall, last year was a very good quarter for license fees, especially with regards to the former SunGard business. Also Q3 2015 marked the quarter where we reversed short-term incentives due to the year-to-date results. 
But less than 90 days until year-end, we remain ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration. We are very pleased to report that we are on track to exceed our run rate synergy commitments and the have line of sight to exit the year with $200 million in run rate synergies for 2016. This milestone is a full 12 months ahead of schedule from originally targeted dates. 
We are confident that we will also exceed our long-term target and deliver more than $250 million in run rate synergies by year-end 2017, continuing our positive track record of exceeding our synergy commitments. More importantly, our intense focus on the integration is continuing to yield results in new and existing client sales. 
On all accounts, we are pleased with our strong performance through the first 3 quarters of the year. We are on track to exceed our full year 2016 goals and are well positioned to achieve our longer-term growth objectives, which are to: grow our base business; unlock enterprise value through strategic investments; expand our solution portfolio within our existing client base; and remain focused on strong financial discipline. 
Turn to Slide 6 to review segment highlights. Our Integrated Financial Solutions business continues to grow, driving top line organic revenue growth of more than 4% this quarter. We saw solid growth in our retail banking, wealth and payment businesses, entering into several strategic, long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks, taking the benefits of our fully integrated solution suite. In the third quarter, we signed several new competitive takeaways encompassing our core banking, digital and payment solution offerings. 
For example, as you've seen in our recent press release, a multi-state community bank with approximately $10 billion in assets selected FIS to provide a complete suite of banking and payment solutions spanning our core processing, digital payments, EFT, card personalization and fully managed IP outsourcing to help drive its digital and commercial growth through next-generation technologies. 
In another example, a fast-growing community bank in the Pacific Northwest will be implementing FIS core banking, bill pay, lending and processing solutions to support its growth and efficiency goals. 
Our Payments business had another strong quarter with nearly 6% organic growth, driven by continued growth in debit processing volumes and our card production business, especially from our EMV card deployments. 
In addition, our innovation investments are showing early promise with the successful rollout of a new mobile-based fraud prevention solution, driving demand as institutions look to help their customers better combat fraud. 
Importantly, these new wins characterize the strength of FIS' growth profile, which is long-term, mission-critical, software applications deployed in our one-to-many model that create significant and predictable reoccurring revenues. 
Turning next to our Global Financial Solutions business. We delivered another strong quarter with top line organic growth of 4.5%. Opportunities in this segment were driven by client demand for our transformational and next-generation institutional and wholesale and banking and payments capabilities. Demand for our banking payment solutions outside of North America remains strong, driving organic revenue growth of 11% this quarter. While Asia continues to be a high-growth market, we were pleased to see steady growth in EMEA with continued progress in Brazil. In late September, Sainsbury Bank went live on its new FIS-hosted banking platform, enabling the bank to support its customers with next-generation capabilities and technology. This delivery milestone moves the FIS and Sainsbury Bank relationship into an exciting new phase, as we begin the long-term, decade-plus operating agreement where we are focused on running the daily operations of the bank. With this successful implementation, we are proud to be the FinTech partner of choice for 2 of the U.K.'s most innovative financial services providers, Sainsbury Bank and Atom Bank, both having gone live on FIS solutions in the last few months. 
In Asia, we continue to build on our already strong market presence, signing significant multiyear deals with 2 de novo institutions in India this quarter. In addition, we entered into an agreement to provide new payment capabilities to one of India's largest government-owned banks, showcasing our ability to serve clients of all sizes in this fast-growing market. 
Within our institutional and wholesale business, Crédit Suisse became the second major client to go live on the FIS derivatives utility, approximately 4 months after choosing to join this highly scalable consumption-based solution. We're also pleased to have renewed a significant post-trade agreement to one of the world's largest global institutions. While the I&W business brings more quarterly volatility due to the timing of license fees, we're extremely pleased with the overall year-to-date growth of 4%, which is more than what was originally modeled during the SunGard due diligence. 
Finally, while the amplification of Brexit are still unknown in these early stages, demand for our consulting services are in line with our expectations, as we work with institutions to help them prepare for future scenarios. 
Turning next to Slide 7. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize today by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. Our performance, combined with a strong pipeline and clear line of sight for the remainder of the year, gives us confidence on our full year results. To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on our integration efforts with high intensity, driving profitable growth through new sales, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. 
Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter."
10081196,402494297,1068129,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9. Adjusted revenue increased 3.8% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $766 million, a 7.7% increase compared to the prior year on adjusted combined basis as if SunGard was owned in both periods. Adjusted net",1750,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9. Adjusted revenue increased 3.8% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $766 million, a 7.7% increase compared to the prior year on adjusted combined basis as if SunGard was owned in both periods. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $330 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 11.1% to $1 per share. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue increased to 4.5% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $2.1 billion, a 9.5% increase compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis. EBITDA margin expanded 180 basis points to 30.1% and adjusted earnings per share grew 17.5% to $2.69 per share. As Gary said, we are pleased with the quarter and year-to-date results. 
Moving to Slide 10. In the third quarter, IFS revenue grew on an organic basis by 4.1%, while adjusted EBITDA grew 1% on an adjusted combined basis. As Gary mentioned, in the third quarter of 2015, we reversed incentive accruals due to business performance. In 2016, we're performing ahead of plan and have booked incentive accruals accordingly. This has created a difficult comparison in the third quarter 2016. Absent this difficult comparable, IFS EBITDA would have grown 4.4% or expanded margins by approximately 10 basis points. For the first 9 months, revenue increased 5.9% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew 3.9% compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis. 
Turning to Slide 11. Banking and wealth grew 3.9% organically for the quarter. This was partially driven by a large risk and compliance project and strengthen our IT and print solutions. Payments continue its growth posting 5.8% this quarter. EMV card production, debit and fraud processing all contributed to this growth. As we previously discussed, EMV growth comparables become more difficult in the coming quarters. Corporate and digital grew about 1% for the quarter. Mobile banking continued to grow double digits. The strong growth in mobile was partially offset by timing of license fees and corporate liquidity and the grow-over of a termination fee creating a difficult comparable to the prior year period. 
As discussed in the last quarter's call, we did not expect results for IFS in the second half of the year to replicate the exceptional growth in the first half. We remain confident in IFS producing full year organic growth, exceeding the midpoint of our long-term guidance and are pleased with the year-to-date performance of this segment. 
Turning to Slide 12. In the third quarter, GFS revenue grew 4.5% organically while adjusted EBITDA grew 13.3% on an adjusted combined basis. For the quarter, this represents 290 basis points of margin expansion to 32.1%. Year-to-date, revenue increased 3.9% organically. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.5% compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis reflecting 250 basis points of margin expansion for the first 9 months of 2016. As we've discussed in the last few quarters, the addition of SunGard to the GFS segment is driving a long-term structural improvement to the segment. EBITDA margins for this segment have increased by 630 basis points over the prior year reported margin of 25.8%. The inclusion of the SunGard assets increases revenue contribution from intellectual property-led sales of mission-critical applications and enhances the profit margin profile of the segment. The combination of revenue growth and higher-margin solutions and execution on synergies has driven 3 quarters of meaningful margin expansion. In fact, we now expect to deliver approximately 30% margins in this segment for the full year, ahead of our initial expectations. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our institutional and wholesale business grew approximately 1% for the quarter. As we discussed in the second quarter commentary, we expect a lower growth in institutional and wholesale for the third quarter and expect higher growth in Q4 related to the timing of license signings and including renewals. As we look forward, we're seeing a longer-term trend developing in this market where clients are demanding processing solutions versus a traditional license model. This will be a long-term positive for recurring revenue, but will have some quarterly lumpiness as these contract renewals and sales move to Processing Solutions. Banking and payments grew 11% organically. Growth was led by a onetime fee related to the successful conversion of Sainsbury, and continued strength in Brazil and Asia Pac across both retail banking and payment processing. 
Gary highlighted the continued sales wins and momentum, driving long-term growth for the business creating recurring high-margin revenues. As we've previously discussed, while our consulting business continues to provide value to our clients, it's becoming a smaller part of the overall business. Results for the quarter were in line with our expectations and we continue to see softness in discretionary spending. We do anticipate higher growth in the fourth quarter due primarily to an easier comparison to the prior year period. We continue to project a revenue headwind from foreign currency translation of approximately $100 million for the full year with no adverse impact to EPS guidance. 
Moving to Slide 14. Corporate and Other adjusted revenue in the third quarter was $154 million with adjusted EBITDA loss of $34 million on an adjusted combined basis. The Corporate and Other segment results include $75 million of corporate expenses for the quarter compared to $80 million in the prior year period. This reduction in corporate expense reflects ongoing cost management efforts and synergies. 
As you are aware, the businesses in the segment are nonstrategic and now aligned with our long-term strategy, serving clients in the financial services market. While our public sector and education business again posted very strong organic growth of 6.2%, retail check processing and global commercial services was and will continue to be a headwind for the segment. Despite these headwinds within the Corporate and Other, these do not impact our consolidated 3-year outlook. And our IFS and GFS segments continue to perform well and in line with our expectations. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our business model continues to generate significant cash flow. Free cash flow was $426 million for the quarter and over $1 billion for the first 9 months. In the third quarter, our free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings exceeded 100%. We have reduced our debt by more than $650 million since December 31 and have approximately $10.8 billion of debt outstanding as of September 30. We remain highly focused on cash flow generation to delever the balance sheet, which continues to be a top priority for us. 
In August, we successfully completed the debt refinancing, including a 2-year extension out to 2021 of our $3 billion credit facility and a $2.5 billion bond issuance. These activities reduced our near-term exposure to market uncertainty, increased our liquidity, extended the tenure of our debt by about 2.5 years and locked in attractive rates. These benefits are substantial, although they do create additional interest expense. We are very pleased with the results of these activities and the strong support from fixed income investors. 
In the third quarter, we returned $84 million to shareholders through dividends and have returned $225 million in dividends year-to-date. We ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of 330 million on a fully diluted basis. In line with our previous guidance, the effective tax rate was 35% for the quarter. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to provide some final thoughts as we finish the year. As Gary mentioned, we continue to execute on synergies and expect to exceed our revised 2016 target of $150 million. We now have a line of sight to $200 million in run rate synergies exiting 2016. The team has continued to work diligently on accelerating activities, in addition to identifying new cost take-out opportunities and anticipate exiting 2017 with a cost synergy run rate of more than $250 million. We will continue to provide you updates on our address. 
These higher-than-originally anticipated synergy benefits will be partially offset by 2 factors from an earnings perspective. As discussed, we recently completed a debt refinancing and are incurring additional interest expense. Our original full year guidance for 2016 outlined in February, we  forecasted net interest expense of $370 million. We now expect net interest expense for the full year 2016 to be $12 million higher, primarily impacting Q4. 
Earlier this year, we also provided guidance on depreciation and amortization costs, excluding purchase accounting of $570 million. Due to accelerated integration efforts, including, but not limited to, data center consolidation, implementing enterprise corporate systems, we had increased our short-term capital spend to drive future cost benefits. 
In addition, we continue to invest in our products for future growth, highlighted this quarter by the example Gary provided in his remarks. Based on these discontinued activities and investing to reduce ongoing costs and investing for growth, we now expect depreciation and amortization expense to exceed our original guidance by $10 million to $15 million. We also anticipate our capital expenditures to rose approximately 6.5% of revenue versus our previous guidance of 6% of revenue for 2016. 
In May of this year, we provided you with a 3-year outlook on revenue growth and profitability and remain comfortable with those views. While I know you want me to discuss 2017 in more detail, we will limit our commentary regarding 2017 at this time and, as usual, provide you full guidance in February. 
Given our performance to date, we're tightening our full year organic revenue growth to the midpoint of our previous guidance range or approximately 4.5% for the year. We also expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $3.80 to $3.85 per share, which increases the low end of our previous range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share. 
As you will recall in the first quarter, we raised our synergy targets for the year. In the second quarter, we raised our revenue and EPS guidance. Today, we are again increasing our synergy targets and tightening our EPS expectations for the year. These increases speak to the fundamental strength of our underlying business and the focused execution of our teams. 
We remain very pleased with our results for the first 9 months of 2016 despite a continued difficult macro environment. Our business model generates consistent earnings per share growth, creates strong cash flow and allows us to return cash to shareholders. We believe the strength of our business model and our company will continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

We're pleased with 4% growth in banking and wealth. And payments will have a little bit more of a difficult comparable in the fourth quarter around EMV as we've been outlining for the last couple of quarters. But we certainly like the growth year-to-date and certainly feel like we're going to be above midpoint, particularly being the November 1 with a couple of months to go there."

What we're seeing and frankly seeing some of that in the capital needs, we're able to accelerate a lot of our projects that exist in our playbook. We talk about our integration playbook all the time and we're just able to accelerate those programs and get to them on a much faster basis. Frankly, the cultural elements of the 2 companies came together much cleaner than what we've seen in other large acquisitions we've done, the alignment of leadership teams and the focus. And so it's allowed us to accelerate a lot of the programs that are in our existing playbook. It's actually driven our capital a little hotter than what we would typically see, but they offer a good outcome. And so that's why we're very confident of hitting the run rate of $200 million this year and, as Woody said, more than $250 million next year. But we're not done. We're very focused on continuing to execute the integration, continuing to look for opportunities to drive out synergies. But it's really just been the acceleration of our integration playbook."

To Woody's point, we're now more in the maintenance rollout phase where we've got our clients as they're normally coming and their mag stripes are coming up for maintenance replacement tenures than were  replacement.

We saw a significant deceleration last year given our book-to-bill and where it is right now. We're very confident going into the quarter. Frankly, as we've discussed, we have focus now. We had moved Capco back more towards truly transformative consulting engagements. We're seeing the results of that in our margin. Our margins were coming up in that consulting business, which is good. Lance and his team are doing an outstanding job running that business for us. As we've also talked about, we really are looking for Capco to augment our engagements where we have product involved in large-scale engagements. And so that's an important role for us. So intentionally, by design, we're not going to be running Capco on the top line as hot as we have in the past. You can do that, but obviously, it comes with the margin sacrifice. So we're just very focused on the right type of engagements and having Capco perform the purpose that it was designed when we did the acquisition. But we're pleased where the business is today.

They want to outsource it to process in our environments to help lower their overall cost, which is a very good outcome. When you get to discretionary spending specifically, because of those 2 fundamental demands, financial institutions are looking for ways, especially in the area when they've got something that's truly discretionary in nature of lowering that -- those dollars, to free up those dollars to invest in something that's nondiscretionary, such as risk, such as compliance, such as modernizing their digital platforms, et cetera.

And just to build on that. Woody hit it, Glenn, earlier in an earlier call. But the structural improvement in GFS with the percentage of our revenue truly tied to a software solution now, whether it's on an outsource or a license basis. With synergies, a lot of those synergies come into GFS. The incremental margins on those dollars being produced are just higher and we're seeing that. I mean, so the -- as Woody talked about in his prepared remarks, we're now -- if you remember, when we started off this year, we were thinking that we could get GFS from a low 21%, 22% margin business up to that 27%, 28% margin business. Now it looks like, we'll be exiting the year at 30%. So you can see where the synergies are falling and then that plays to the contribution going forward as our revenue. While revenue growth continues in that market, it's continuing now in software solutions instead of services-based solution. So that structural transformation is significant for us."

I am pleased to open the call affirming another strong quarter of execution for FIS. We saw expected growth across all operating segments. Our Q3 results continued the positive momentum we built in the first half of the year, delivering profitable growth and outstanding cash flow. This is the third consecutive strong quarter, which speaks to the fundamental strength of our underlying business and the success of our focused execution. 
Now turning to the remainder of the year. We are pleased that our outlook remains positive. Despite continuing macroeconomic pressures, our sales teams continued converting opportunities to new wins and cross-selling and upselling to existing clients. Market and client demand for our solution continues with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies to run and grow their business. These results and trends underscore our confidence and a strong finish to 2016. 
As a result of our solid performance year-to-date and remaining outlook, we will be increasing our current guidance for the second time this year, which Woody will outline later in the call.  
Turning to Slide 5. As expected in the quarter, adjusted revenue increased 4% organically compared to the prior-year quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA grew more than twice as fast as revenue at 8% and adjusted earnings per share rose 11%. We are very pleased with these results given the difficult comparisons of the prior-year quarter. As you will recall, last year was a very good quarter for license fees, especially with regards to the former SunGard business. Also Q3 2015 marked the quarter where we reversed short-term incentives due to the year-to-date results. 
With less than 90 days until year-end, we remain ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration. We are very pleased to report that we are on track to exceed our run rate synergy commitments and the have line of sight to exit the year with $200 million in run rate synergies for 2016. This milestone is a full 12 months ahead of schedule from originally targeted dates. 
We are confident that we will also exceed our long-term target and deliver more than $250 million in run rate synergies by year-end 2017, continuing our positive track record of exceeding our synergy commitments. More importantly, our intense focus on the integration is continuing to yield results in new and existing client sales. 
On all accounts, we are pleased with our strong performance through the first 3 quarters of the year. We are on track to exceed our full year 2016 goals and are well positioned to achieve our longer-term growth objectives, which are to: grow our base business; unlock enterprise value through strategic investments; expand our solution portfolio within our existing client base; and remain focused on strong financial discipline. 
Turn to Slide 6 to review segment highlights. Our Integrated Financial Solutions business continues to grow, driving top line organic revenue growth of more than 4% this quarter. We saw solid growth in our retail banking, wealth and payment businesses, entering into several strategic, long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks, taking the benefits of our fully integrated solution suite. In the third quarter, we signed several new competitive takeaways encompassing our core banking, digital and payment solution offerings. 
For example, as you've seen in our recent press release, a multi-state community bank with approximately $10 billion in assets selected FIS to provide a complete suite of banking and payment solutions spanning our core processing, digital payments, EFT, card personalization and fully managed IP outsourcing to help drive its digital and commercial growth through next-generation technologies. 
In another example, a fast-growing community bank in the Pacific Northwest will be implementing FIS core banking, bill pay, lending and item processing solutions to support its growth and efficiency goals. 
Our Payments business had another strong quarter with nearly 6% organic growth, driven by continued growth in debit processing volumes and our card production business, especially from our EMV card deployments. 
In addition, our innovation investments are showing early promise with the successful rollout of a new mobile-based fraud prevention solution, driving demand as institutions look to help their customers better combat fraud. 
Importantly, these new wins characterize the strength of FIS' growth profile, which is long-term, mission-critical software applications deployed in our one-to-many model that creates significant and predictable reoccurring revenues. 
Turning next to our Global Financial Solutions business. We delivered another strong quarter with top line organic growth of 4.5%. Opportunities in this segment were driven by client demand for our transformational and next-generation institutional and wholesale and banking and payments capabilities. Demand for our banking payment solutions outside of North America remains strong, driving organic revenue growth of 11% this quarter. While Asia continues to be a high-growth market, we were pleased to see steady growth in EMEA with continued progress in Brazil. 
In late September, Sainsbury Bank went live on its new FIS-hosted banking platform, enabling the bank to support its customers with next-generation capabilities and technology. This delivery milestone moves the FIS and Sainsbury Bank relationship into an exciting new phase, as we begin the long-term, decade-plus operating agreement where we are focused on running the daily operations of the bank. With this successful implementation, we are proud to be the FinTech partner of choice for 2 of the U.K.'s most innovative financial services providers, Sainsbury Bank and Atom Bank, both having gone live on FIS solutions in the last few months. 
In Asia, we continue to build on our already strong market presence, signing significant multiyear deals with 2 de novo institutions in India this quarter. In addition, we entered into an agreement to provide new payment capabilities to one of India's largest government-owned banks, showcasing our ability to serve clients of all sizes in this fast-growing market. 
Within our institutional and wholesale business, Crédit Suisse became the second major client to go live on the FIS derivatives utility, approximately 4 months after choosing to join this highly scalable consumption-based solution. We're also pleased to have renewed a significant post-trade agreement with one of the world's largest global institutions. While the I&W business brings more quarterly volatility due to the timing of license fees, we're extremely pleased with the overall year-to-date growth of 4%, which is more than what was originally modeled during the SunGard due diligence. 
Finally, while the implications of Brexit are still unknown in these early stages, demand for our consulting services are in line with our expectations, as we work with institutions to help them prepare for future scenarios. 
Turning next to Slide 7. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize today by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. Our performance, combined with the strong pipeline and clear line of sight for the remainder of the year, gives us confidence in our full year results. To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on: our integration efforts with high intensity; driving profitable growth through new sales; maintaining a strong balance sheet; and returning cash to shareholders. 
Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter."

Adjusted revenue increased 3.8% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $766 million, a 7.7% increase compared to the prior year on adjusted combined basis as if SunGard was owned in both periods. 
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $330 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 11.1% to $1 per share. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue increased to 4.5% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $2.1 billion, a 9.5% increase compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis. EBITDA margin expanded 180 basis points to 30.1% and adjusted earnings per share grew 17.5% to $2.69 per share. As Gary said, we are pleased with the quarter and year-to-date results. 
Moving to Slide 10. In the third quarter, IFS revenue grew on an organic basis by 4.1%, while adjusted EBITDA grew 1% on an adjusted combined basis. As Gary mentioned, in the third quarter of 2015, we reversed incentive accruals due to business performance. In 2016, we're performing ahead of plan and have booked incentive accruals accordingly. This has created a difficult comparison in the third quarter 2016. Absent this difficult comparable, IFS EBITDA would have grown 4.4% or expanded margins by approximately 10 basis points. For the first 9 months, revenue increased 5.9% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew 3.9% compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis. 
Turning to Slide 11. Banking and wealth grew 3.9% organically for the quarter. This was partially driven by a large risk and compliance project and strength in our IT and print solutions. Payments continued its growth posting 5.8% this quarter. EMV card production, debit and fraud processing all contributed to this growth. As we previously discussed, EMV growth comparables become more difficult in the coming quarters. Corporate and digital grew about 1% for the quarter. Mobile banking continued to grow double digits. The strong growth in mobile was partially offset by timing of license fees and corporate liquidity and the grow-over of a termination fee creating a difficult comparable to the prior=year period. 
As discussed on last quarter's call, we did not expect results for IFS in the second half of the year to replicate the exceptional growth in the first half. We remain confident in IFS producing full year organic growth exceeding the midpoint of our long-term guidance and are pleased with the year-to-date performance of this segment. 
Turning to Slide 12. In the third quarter, GFS revenue grew 4.5% organically while adjusted EBITDA grew 13.3% on an adjusted combined basis for the quarter. This represents 290 basis points of margin expansion to 32.1%. Year-to-date, revenue increased 3.9% organically. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.5% compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis reflecting 250 basis points of margin expansion for the first 9 months of 2016. 
As we've discussed in the last few quarters, the addition of SunGard to the GFS segment is driving a long-term structural improvement to the segment. EBITDA margins for this segment have increased by 630 basis points over the prior-year reported margin of 25.8%. The inclusion of the SunGard assets increases revenue contribution from intellectual property-led sales of mission-critical applications and enhances the profit margin profile of the segment. The combination of revenue growth and higher-margin solutions and execution on synergies has driven 3 quarters of meaningful margin expansion. In fact, we now expect to deliver approximately 30% margins in this segment for the full year, ahead of our initial expectations. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our institutional and wholesale business grew approximately 1% for the quarter. As we discussed in the second quarter commentary, we expect a lower growth in institutional and wholesale for the third quarter and expect higher growth in Q4 related to the timing of license signings and including renewals. 
As we look forward, we're seeing a longer-term trend developing in this market where clients are demanding processing solutions versus a traditional license model. This will be a long-term positive for recurring revenue, but will have some quarterly lumpiness as these contract renewals and sales move to Processing Solutions. 
Banking and payments grew 11% organically. Growth was led by a onetime fee related to the successful conversion of Sainsbury, and continued strength in Brazil and Asia Pac across both retail banking and payment processing. 
Gary highlighted the continued sales wins and momentum driving long-term growth for the business creating recurring high-margin revenues. As we've previously discussed, while our consulting business continues to provide value to our clients, it's becoming a smaller part of the overall business. Results for the quarter were in line with our expectations and we continue to see softness in discretionary spending. We do anticipate higher growth in the fourth quarter due primarily to an easier comparison to the prior-year period. We continue to project a revenue headwind from foreign currency translation of approximately $100 million for the full year with no adverse impact to EPS guidance. 
Moving to Slide 14. Corporate and Other adjusted revenue in the third quarter was $154 million with adjusted EBITDA loss of $34 million on an adjusted combined basis. The Corporate and Other segment results include $75 million of corporate expenses for the quarter compared to $80 million in the prior-year period. This reduction in corporate expense reflects ongoing cost management efforts and synergies. 
As you are aware, the businesses in the segment are nonstrategic and not aligned with our long-term strategy of serving clients in the financial services market. While our public sector and education business again posted very strong organic growth of 6.2%, retail check processing and global commercial services was and will continue to be a headwind for the segment. Despite these headwinds within the Corporate and Other, these do not impact our consolidated 3-year outlook. And our IFS and GFS segments continue to perform well and in line with our expectations. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our business model continues to generate significant cash flow. Free cash flow was $426 million for the quarter and over $1 billion for the first 9 months. In the third quarter, our free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings exceeded 100%. 
We have reduced our debt by more than $650 million since December 31 and have approximately $10.8 billion of debt outstanding as of September 30. We remain highly focused on cash flow generation to delever the balance sheet, which continues to be a top priority for us. 
In August, we successfully completed a debt refinancing, including a 2-year extension out to 2021 of our $3 billion credit facility and a $2.5 billion bond issuance. These activities reduced our near-term exposure to market uncertainty, increased our liquidity, extended the tenure of our debt by about 2.5 years and locked in attractive rates. These benefits are substantial, although they do create additional interest expense. We are very pleased with the results of these activities and the strong support from fixed income investors. 
In the third quarter, we returned $84 million to shareholders through dividends and have returned $225 million in dividends year-to-date. We ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of 330 million on a fully diluted basis. 
In line with our previous guidance, the effective tax rate was 35% for the quarter. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to provide some final thoughts as we finish the year. As Gary mentioned, we continue to execute on synergies and expect to exceed our revised 2016 target of $150 million. We now have a line of sight to $200 million in run rate synergies exiting 2016. The teams continue to work diligently on accelerating activities, in addition to identifying new cost take-out opportunities and anticipate exiting 2017 with a cost synergy run rate of more than $250 million. We will continue to provide you updates on our address. 
These higher-than-originally anticipated synergy benefits will be partially offset by 2 factors from an earnings perspective. As discussed, we recently completed a debt refinancing and are incurring additional interest expense. Our original full year guidance for 2016 outlined in February, we forecasted net interest expense of $370 million. We now expect net interest expense for the full year 2016 to be $12 million higher, primarily impacting Q4. 
Earlier this year, we also provided guidance on depreciation and amortization cost, excluding purchase accounting of $570 million. Due to accelerated integration efforts, including, but not limited to, data center consolidation, implementing enterprise corporate systems, we have increased our short-term capital spend to drive future cost benefits. 
In addition, we continue to invest in our products for future growth, highlighted this quarter by the example Gary provided in his remarks. Based on these continued activities and investing to reduce ongoing cost and investing for growth, we now expect depreciation and amortization expense to exceed our original guidance by $10 million to $15 million. We also anticipate our capital expenditures to erode approximately 6.5% of revenue versus our previous guidance of 6% of revenue for 2016. 
In May of this year, we provided you with a 3-year outlook on revenue growth and profitability and remain comfortable with those views. While I know you'll want me to discuss 2017 in more detail, we will limit our commentary regarding 2017 at this time and, as usual, provide you full guidance in February. 
Given our performance to date, we're tightening our full year organic revenue growth to the midpoint of our previous guidance range or approximately 4.5% for the year. We also expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $3.80 to $3.85 per share, which increases the low end of our previous range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share. 
As you will recall, in the first quarter, we raised our synergy targets for the year. In the second quarter, we raised our revenue and EPS guidance. Today, we are again increasing our synergy targets and tightening our EPS expectations for the year. These increases speak to the fundamental strength of our underlying business and the focused execution of our teams. 
We remain very pleased with our results for the first 9 months of 2016 despite a continued difficult macro environment. Our business model generates consistent earnings per share growth, creates strong cash flow and allows us to return cash to shareholders. We believe the strength of our business model and our company will continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

What we're seeing and frankly seeing some of that in the capital needs, we're able to accelerate a lot of our projects that exist in our playbook. We talk about our integration playbook all the time and we're just able to accelerate those programs and get to them on a much faster basis. Frankly, the cultural elements of the 2 companies came together much cleaner than what we've seen in other large acquisitions we've done, the alignment of leadership teams and the focus. And so it's allowed us to accelerate a lot of the programs that are in our existing playbook. It's actually driven our capital a little hotter than what we would typically see, but all for a good outcome.

We'll continue to see those businesses be a tailwind within FIS. We continue to see the need for our clients to drive more cost out of the structure. So as Woody highlighted, we're seeing a trend that our license fees are consistently going to be pressured because more and more of our customers don't want to license the software; they want to outsource it to process in our environments to help lower their overall cost, which is a very good outcome. When you get to discretionary spending specifically, because of those 2 fundamental demands, financial institutions are looking for ways, especially in the area when they've got something that's truly discretionary in nature, of lowering that -- those dollars, to free up those dollars to invest in something that's nondiscretionary, such as risk, such as compliance, such as modernizing their digital platforms, et cetera.

I am pleased to open the call affirming another strong quarter of execution for FIS. We saw expected growth across all operating segments. Our Q3 results continued the positive momentum we built in the first half of the year, delivering profitable growth and outstanding cash flow. This is the third consecutive strong quarter, which speaks to the fundamental strength of our underlying business and the success of our focused execution. 
Now turning to the remainder of the year. We are pleased that our outlook remains positive. Despite continuing macroeconomic pressures, our sales teams continued converting opportunities to new wins and cross-selling and upselling to existing clients. Market and client demand for our solution continues with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies to run and grow their business. These results and trends underscore our confidence and a strong finish to 2016. 
As a result of our solid performance year-to-date and remaining outlook, we will be increasing our current guidance for the second time this year, which Woody will outline later in the call.  
Turning to Slide 5. As expected in the quarter, adjusted revenue increased 4% organically compared to the prior-year quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA grew more than twice as fast as revenue at 8% and adjusted earnings per share rose 11%. We are very pleased with these results given the difficult comparisons of the prior-year quarter. As you will recall, last year was a very good quarter for license fees, especially with regards to the former SunGard business. Also Q3 2015 marked the quarter where we reversed short-term incentives due to the year-to-date results. 
With less than 90 days until year-end, we remain ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration. We are very pleased to report that we are on track to exceed our run rate synergy commitments and the have line of sight to exit the year with $200 million in run rate synergies for 2016. This milestone is a full 12 months ahead of schedule from originally targeted dates. 
We are confident that we will also exceed our long-term target and deliver more than $250 million in run rate synergies by year-end 2017, continuing our positive track record of exceeding our synergy commitments. More importantly, our intense focus on the integration is continuing to yield results in new and existing client sales. 
On all accounts, we are pleased with our strong performance through the first 3 quarters of the year. We are on track to exceed our full year 2016 goals and are well positioned to achieve our longer-term growth objectives, which are to: grow our base business; unlock enterprise value through strategic investments; expand our solution portfolio within our existing client base; and remain focused on strong financial discipline. 
Turn to Slide 6 to review segment highlights. Our Integrated Financial Solutions business continues to grow, driving top line organic revenue growth of more than 4% this quarter. We saw solid growth in our retail banking, wealth and payment businesses, entering into several strategic, long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks, taking the benefits of our fully integrated solution suite. In the third quarter, we signed several new competitive takeaways encompassing our core banking, digital and payment solution offerings. 
For example, as you've seen in our recent press release, a multi-state community bank with approximately $10 billion in assets selected FIS to provide a complete suite of banking and payment solutions spanning our core processing, digital payments, EFT, card personalization and fully managed IP outsourcing to help drive its digital and commercial growth through next-generation technologies. 
In another example, a fast-growing community bank in the Pacific Northwest will be implementing FIS core banking, bill pay, lending and item processing solutions to support its growth and efficiency goals. 
Our Payments business had another strong quarter with nearly 6% organic growth, driven by continued growth in debit processing volumes and our card production business, especially from our EMV card deployments. 
In addition, our innovation investments are showing early promise with the successful rollout of a new mobile-based fraud prevention solution, driving demand as institutions look to help their customers better combat fraud. 
Importantly, these new wins characterize the strength of FIS' growth profile, which is long-term, mission-critical software applications deployed in our one-to-many model that creates significant and predictable reoccurring revenues. 
Turning next to our Global Financial Solutions business. We delivered another strong quarter with top line organic growth of 4.5%. Opportunities in this segment were driven by client demand for our transformational and next-generation institutional and wholesale and banking and payments capabilities. Demand for our banking payment solutions outside of North America remains strong, driving organic revenue growth of 11% this quarter. While Asia continues to be a high-growth market, we were pleased to see steady growth in EMEA with continued progress in Brazil. 
In late September, Sainsbury Bank went live on its new FIS-hosted banking platform, enabling the bank to support its customers with next-generation capabilities and technology. This delivery milestone moves the FIS and Sainsbury Bank relationship into an exciting new phase, as we begin the long-term, decade-plus operating agreement where we are focused on running the daily operations of the bank. With this successful implementation, we are proud to be the FinTech partner of choice for 2 of the U.K.'s most innovative financial services providers, Sainsbury Bank and Atom Bank, both having gone live on FIS solutions in the last few months. 
In Asia, we continue to build on our already strong market presence, signing significant multiyear deals with 2 de novo institutions in India this quarter. In addition, we entered into an agreement to provide new payment capabilities to one of India's largest government-owned banks, showcasing our ability to serve clients of all sizes in this fast-growing market. 
Within our institutional and wholesale business, Crédit Suisse became the second major client to go live on the FIS derivatives utility, approximately 4 months after choosing to join this highly scalable consumption-based solution. We're also pleased to have renewed a significant post-trade agreement with one of the world's largest global institutions. While the I&W business brings more quarterly volatility due to the timing of license fees, we're extremely pleased with the overall year-to-date growth of 4%, which is more than what was originally modeled during the SunGard due diligence. 
Finally, while the implications of Brexit are still unknown in these early stages, demand for our consulting services are in line with our expectations, as we work with institutions to help them prepare for future scenarios. 
Turning next to Slide 7. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize today by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. Our performance, combined with the strong pipeline and clear line of sight for the remainder of the year, gives us confidence in our full year results. To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on: our integration efforts with high intensity; driving profitable growth through new sales; maintaining a strong balance sheet; and returning cash to shareholders. 
Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter."
10081196,402494297,1069275,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9. Adjusted revenue increased 3.8% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $766 million, a 7.7% increase compared to the prior year on adjusted combined basis as if SunGard was owned in both periods. Adjusted ne",1743,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9. Adjusted revenue increased 3.8% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $766 million, a 7.7% increase compared to the prior year on adjusted combined basis as if SunGard was owned in both periods. 
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $330 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 11.1% to $1 per share. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue increased to 4.5% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $2.1 billion, a 9.5% increase compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis. EBITDA margin expanded 180 basis points to 30.1% and adjusted earnings per share grew 17.5% to $2.69 per share. As Gary said, we are pleased with the quarter and year-to-date results. 
Moving to Slide 10. In the third quarter, IFS revenue grew on an organic basis by 4.1%, while adjusted EBITDA grew 1% on an adjusted combined basis. As Gary mentioned, in the third quarter of 2015, we reversed incentive accruals due to business performance. In 2016, we're performing ahead of plan and have booked incentive accruals accordingly. This has created a difficult comparison in the third quarter 2016. Absent this difficult comparable, IFS EBITDA would have grown 4.4% or expanded margins by approximately 10 basis points. For the first 9 months, revenue increased 5.9% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew 3.9% compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis. 
Turning to Slide 11. Banking and wealth grew 3.9% organically for the quarter. This was partially driven by a large risk and compliance project and strength in our IT and print solutions. Payments continued its growth posting 5.8% this quarter. EMV card production, debit and fraud processing all contributed to this growth. As we previously discussed, EMV growth comparables become more difficult in the coming quarters. Corporate and digital grew about 1% for the quarter. Mobile banking continued to grow double digits. The strong growth in mobile was partially offset by timing of license fees and corporate liquidity and the grow-over of a termination fee creating a difficult comparable to the prior=year period. 
As discussed on last quarter's call, we did not expect results for IFS in the second half of the year to replicate the exceptional growth in the first half. We remain confident in IFS producing full year organic growth exceeding the midpoint of our long-term guidance and are pleased with the year-to-date performance of this segment. 
Turning to Slide 12. In the third quarter, GFS revenue grew 4.5% organically while adjusted EBITDA grew 13.3% on an adjusted combined basis for the quarter. This represents 290 basis points of margin expansion to 32.1%. Year-to-date, revenue increased 3.9% organically. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.5% compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis reflecting 250 basis points of margin expansion for the first 9 months of 2016. 
As we've discussed in the last few quarters, the addition of SunGard to the GFS segment is driving a long-term structural improvement to the segment. EBITDA margins for this segment have increased by 630 basis points over the prior-year reported margin of 25.8%. The inclusion of the SunGard assets increases revenue contribution from intellectual property-led sales of mission-critical applications and enhances the profit margin profile of the segment. The combination of revenue growth and higher-margin solutions and execution on synergies has driven 3 quarters of meaningful margin expansion. In fact, we now expect to deliver approximately 30% margins in this segment for the full year, ahead of our initial expectations. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our institutional and wholesale business grew approximately 1% for the quarter. As we discussed in the second quarter commentary, we expect a lower growth in institutional and wholesale for the third quarter and expect higher growth in Q4 related to the timing of license signings and including renewals. 
As we look forward, we're seeing a longer-term trend developing in this market where clients are demanding processing solutions versus a traditional license model. This will be a long-term positive for recurring revenue, but will have some quarterly lumpiness as these contract renewals and sales move to Processing Solutions. 
Banking and payments grew 11% organically. Growth was led by a onetime fee related to the successful conversion of Sainsbury, and continued strength in Brazil and Asia Pac across both retail banking and payment processing. 
Gary highlighted the continued sales wins and momentum driving long-term growth for the business creating recurring high-margin revenues. As we've previously discussed, while our consulting business continues to provide value to our clients, it's becoming a smaller part of the overall business. Results for the quarter were in line with our expectations and we continue to see softness in discretionary spending. We do anticipate higher growth in the fourth quarter due primarily to an easier comparison to the prior-year period. We continue to project a revenue headwind from foreign currency translation of approximately $100 million for the full year with no adverse impact to EPS guidance. 
Moving to Slide 14. Corporate and Other adjusted revenue in the third quarter was $154 million with adjusted EBITDA loss of $34 million on an adjusted combined basis. The Corporate and Other segment results include $75 million of corporate expenses for the quarter compared to $80 million in the prior-year period. This reduction in corporate expense reflects ongoing cost management efforts and synergies. 
As you are aware, the businesses in the segment are nonstrategic and not aligned with our long-term strategy of serving clients in the financial services market. While our public sector and education business again posted very strong organic growth of 6.2%, retail check processing and global commercial services was and will continue to be a headwind for the segment. Despite these headwinds within the Corporate and Other, these do not impact our consolidated 3-year outlook. And our IFS and GFS segments continue to perform well and in line with our expectations. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our business model continues to generate significant cash flow. Free cash flow was $426 million for the quarter and over $1 billion for the first 9 months. In the third quarter, our free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings exceeded 100%. 
We have reduced our debt by more than $650 million since December 31 and have approximately $10.8 billion of debt outstanding as of September 30. We remain highly focused on cash flow generation to delever the balance sheet, which continues to be a top priority for us. 
In August, we successfully completed a debt refinancing, including a 2-year extension out to 2021 of our $3 billion credit facility and a $2.5 billion bond issuance. These activities reduced our near-term exposure to market uncertainty, increased our liquidity, extended the tenure of our debt by about 2.5 years and locked in attractive rates. These benefits are substantial, although they do create additional interest expense. We are very pleased with the results of these activities and the strong support from fixed income investors. 
In the third quarter, we returned $84 million to shareholders through dividends and have returned $225 million in dividends year-to-date. We ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of 330 million on a fully diluted basis. 
In line with our previous guidance, the effective tax rate was 35% for the quarter. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to provide some final thoughts as we finish the year. As Gary mentioned, we continue to execute on synergies and expect to exceed our revised 2016 target of $150 million. We now have a line of sight to $200 million in run rate synergies exiting 2016. The teams continue to work diligently on accelerating activities, in addition to identifying new cost take-out opportunities and anticipate exiting 2017 with a cost synergy run rate of more than $250 million. We will continue to provide you updates on our address. 
These higher-than-originally anticipated synergy benefits will be partially offset by 2 factors from an earnings perspective. As discussed, we recently completed a debt refinancing and are incurring additional interest expense. Our original full year guidance for 2016 outlined in February, we forecasted net interest expense of $370 million. We now expect net interest expense for the full year 2016 to be $12 million higher, primarily impacting Q4. 
Earlier this year, we also provided guidance on depreciation and amortization cost, excluding purchase accounting of $570 million. Due to accelerated integration efforts, including, but not limited to, data center consolidation, implementing enterprise corporate systems, we have increased our short-term capital spend to drive future cost benefits. 
In addition, we continue to invest in our products for future growth, highlighted this quarter by the example Gary provided in his remarks. Based on these continued activities and investing to reduce ongoing cost and investing for growth, we now expect depreciation and amortization expense to exceed our original guidance by $10 million to $15 million. We also anticipate our capital expenditures to erode approximately 6.5% of revenue versus our previous guidance of 6% of revenue for 2016. 
In May of this year, we provided you with a 3-year outlook on revenue growth and profitability and remain comfortable with those views. While I know you'll want me to discuss 2017 in more detail, we will limit our commentary regarding 2017 at this time and, as usual, provide you full guidance in February. 
Given our performance to date, we're tightening our full year organic revenue growth to the midpoint of our previous guidance range or approximately 4.5% for the year. We also expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $3.80 to $3.85 per share, which increases the low end of our previous range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share. 
As you will recall, in the first quarter, we raised our synergy targets for the year. In the second quarter, we raised our revenue and EPS guidance. Today, we are again increasing our synergy targets and tightening our EPS expectations for the year. These increases speak to the fundamental strength of our underlying business and the focused execution of our teams. 
We remain very pleased with our results for the first 9 months of 2016 despite a continued difficult macro environment. Our business model generates consistent earnings per share growth, creates strong cash flow and allows us to return cash to shareholders. We believe the strength of our business model and our company will continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

What we're seeing and frankly seeing some of that in the capital needs, we're able to accelerate a lot of our projects that exist in our playbook. We talk about our integration playbook all the time and we're just able to accelerate those programs and get to them on a much faster basis. Frankly, the cultural elements of the 2 companies came together much cleaner than what we've seen in other large acquisitions we've done, the alignment of leadership teams and the focus. And so it's allowed us to accelerate a lot of the programs that are in our existing playbook. It's actually driven our capital a little hotter than what we would typically see, but all for a good outcome.
