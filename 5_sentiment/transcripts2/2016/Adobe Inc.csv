Adobe's year is off to a strong start with first quarter revenue of $1.38 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66. Adobe's opportunity has never been greater. Every brand, government agency and educational institution is undergoing large-scale digital transformation. Creating a compelling experience for their customers and constituents across every touch point is paramount to their success and they're turning to Adobe for help.
In Digital Media, Creative Cloud momentum continued in Q1 with strong adoption across all segments. There have never been more people creating content. Whether it's creative professionals, photographers, students or hobbyists, creating compelling images, videos, websites or mobile applications, our opportunity is to provide them with a one-stop shop for all their creative needs.
There are 3 primary growth drivers for Creative Cloud as we target a $17 billion addressable market: continuing to migrate our core base of creative users, market expansion into new segments and value expansion through new services. 
Our migration strategy focuses on driving Creative Suite users to our core offerings, Creative Cloud for individuals, teams and enterprises. In Q1, we executed well against this opportunity, driving adoption across all routes to market, including Adobe.com, our channel partners and Adobe direct sales.
Our market expansion strategy is to bring in new users, including photo enthusiasts and hobbyists with our Creative Cloud Photography plan. Over 30% of Creative Cloud subscribers are new to Adobe, and many are coming to us through our mobile apps. Over 23 million new Adobe IDs have been created through our mobile apps to date.
In terms of value expansion, we have begun to see the positive effect of Adobe Stock, our stock content marketplace on our creative revenue and ARR. Millions of creators use Stock content, and we believe Adobe has a tremendous opportunity to deliver additional value by seamlessly integrating Adobe Stock and directly into the Creative Cloud service.
We intend to become the leader in the space through further product integration and new offerings, including Stock video. In February, we added more than 100,000 native 4K video assets to Adobe Stock, which already includes more than 1 million video assets and more than 45 million images and graphics.
The primary benefit of a Creative Cloud subscription is access to Adobe's continuous innovation. Earlier this week, we announced the preview release of a brand-new product, Adobe Experience Design CC, a design and prototyping product that empowers user-experienced designers to deliver new mobile apps and websites quickly and easily. 
User-experienced design is one of the fastest-growing creative disciplines. According to data from our Behance Creative community of over 6.6 million Creatives, interaction design projects grew by 52% in 2015, more than any other creative field. We look forward to hearing feedback from our community as we work toward launching the product later this year.
Adobe's momentum continues in the video space where we are now the leader in video production and editing. Over 175 films debuting at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival used Adobe Premiere Pro CC and other Creative Cloud tools. Deadpool is the latest blockbuster film to be edited exclusively with Adobe Premiere Pro.
Our footprint is extending beyond creative pros to creative consumers. In February, we introduced Adobe Post, a free mobile app that allows consumers to quickly and easily turn photos and text into beautifully designed graphics and share them on social media. It joins our other consumer mobile apps, Adobe Voice and Adobe Slate, in bringing fast and fun storytelling capabilities to a broad audience, including students and small businesses.
Adobe Document Cloud is becoming critical to the paper-to-digital transformation of document processes. More than 6 billion digital and electronic signature transactions are now processed through Document Cloud each year. Global businesses like the Royal Bank of Scotland, Scottrade and NetApp rely on Document Cloud and Adobe Sign for fast, secure and mobile e-signatures.
In Q1, Document Cloud revenue was $199 million and we exited the quarter with $393 million in ARR. Across our Creative and Document Cloud businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $3.13 billion as of the end of Q1.
We're the leader in the exploding digital marketing category. In Q1, we achieved strong Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings with revenue of $377 million, which represents a 21% year-over-year increase. We continue to drive large-scale, multi-solution engagements with Marketing Cloud customers. Significant customer engagements in Q1 included RR Donnelly, Samsung Electronics, MGM Resorts International, Nissan, Workday and Goldman Sachs.
At Adobe, we are focused on product innovation, and Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions continue to garner accolades from industry analysts. Earlier this month, we were recognized by IDC as a leader in its Worldwide Marketing Cloud Platforms Vendor Assessment. And Forrester Research recognized Adobe Analytics, the data and analytics backbone of Adobe Marketing Cloud, as a leader in its Customer Analytics' Solutions Wave Report. In January, Gartner named Adobe as a leader in the 2016 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs.
Adobe managed over 51 trillion customer data transactions through the Marketing Cloud over the past 4 quarters. And our Adobe Digital Index reports are increasingly being viewed as the source for reporting and predicting major retail and consumer trends. Yesterday, we launched our new Digital Economy Project, which includes 3 digital indicators of the U.S. economy: a digital price index, a housing index and a jobseeking index.
Next week, we will hold our Adobe Summit event in Las Vegas, and we're expecting record-breaking attendance, including hundreds of our partners and mainstage speakers from top brands, including Cirque du Soleil, McDonald's, Comedy Central, Mattel and Royal Bank of Scotland. Adobe Summit is the industry's leading digital marketing conference and the venue to learn where the industry is headed and see Adobe's latest technical advancements in mobile, video and data science.
For over 30 years, Adobe employees have demonstrated a sense of purpose and commitment to our communities, and we're proud of the recognition we received in Q1 as both an employer and a good corporate citizen. We were included as 1 of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations and were recognized as Fortune's Most Admired Company within the software category.
While Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud are all leaders in their respective categories, our true opportunity is in bringing these solutions together. We have been unwavering in our mission to use content and data to deliver world-class experiences to our customers, whether they're on the web, in an app, in a retail store or in a car.
Adobe is the only software company with deep history and content and vast data capabilities to deliver consistent, continuous and compelling experiences. We have a robust technology platform, a thriving ecosystem of partners and developers and a strong brand that has affinity worldwide with the world's largest enterprises, agencies, governments and educational institutions.
Our Q1 results demonstrate strong execution against this vast opportunity. Our market leadership, product differentiation and continued momentum give us confidence to raise our fiscal '16 revenue and earnings targets. Mark?"

Before I comment on Q1 results, as a reminder, 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year with a 14-week first quarter. This was factored into all of the targets we provided in December.In the first quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue",1380,"Thanks, Shantanu. Before I comment on Q1 results, as a reminder, 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year with a 14-week first quarter. This was factored into all of the targets we provided in December.
In the first quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,383,000,000, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. We estimate the extra week added approximately $75 million of revenue to the quarter, but this was mainly offset by a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue of approximately $69 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 were $0.50, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.66. These strong results reflect continued momentum across our Cloud businesses.
Highlights in our first quarter include: better-than-expected growth in Digital Media ARR, exiting the quarter with $3.13 billion; record Creative revenue of $733 million, which represents 44% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $377 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth; strong growth in operating and net income, with cash flow from operations of $498 million; and exiting Q1 with a record 81% of Q1 revenue as recurring.
In Digital Media, we grew Q1 segment revenue by 33% year-over-year and exited the quarter with Digital Media ARR of $3.13 billion. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $733 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 44%. We increased Creative ARR by $238 million during Q1. 
Driving this strong performance was demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market, including the addition of 798,000 net new Creative Cloud subscriptions during the quarter. Migration continues to represent a large opportunity. Creative Cloud continues to distance itself from Creative Suite, and Creatives are migrating as well as renewing at non-promotional pricing.
New customer adoption continues to increase our install base. Creative Cloud mobile apps are driving new top-of-funnel traffic and first-time customer adoption. Market expansion is being driven by offerings such as the Creative Cloud Photography Plan, which targets photo enthusiasts. Value expansion with new services like Adobe Stock are increasing ARPU and ARR.
Our performance across all of these offerings and the health of the business is best reflected in ARR. Because of this, moving forward, we have decided to provide forward-looking quarterly ARR targets to help you better model the total business. 
With respect to subscriptions, it has been our stated goal to attract tens of millions of customers at widely varying price points. We reviewed this strategy with you back in October at our analyst meeting. Creative Cloud Photography Plan was our first market expansion offering and has resulted in well over 1 million subscribers. New SKUs such as the recently announced K-12 education offering will make Creative cloud available to millions of students. And as we said at the analyst meeting, we are also considering a mobile-only offering. All of this further dilutes the relevance of the number of subscribers as a measure of the health of the business.
In addition, with respect to Acrobat, customers have been able to choose to subscribe to Acrobat either through Creative Cloud, which has been reflected as Creative Cloud subscriptions and Creative ARR, or via Document Cloud, which has been reflected in Document Cloud ARR. For all of these reasons, while we might choose to periodically report subscriptions, we no longer intend to provide actuals on a quarterly basis.
With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $199 million, with Document Cloud ARR exiting the quarter of $393 million. Adoption of our new Acrobat DC offering was strong in Q1, both through the perpetual offering as well as in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings on Adobe.com, all of which is captured in Digital Media ARR.
In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $377 million. We delivered strong bookings during the quarter, and both the revenue and bookings in Q1 put us on pace to achieve our annual targets of approximately 20% revenue growth and 30% bookings growth.
Other Marketing Cloud highlights in Q1 include: strong year-over-year revenue growth across all Marketing Cloud solutions; continued growth in multi-solution adoption by our biggest customers; and mobile data transactions grew to 49% of total Adobe Analytics transactions.
Our Digital Marketing segment revenue also includes life cycle and Connect, which declined as expected. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.5 million. We had $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '16 versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '15, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $7.6 million.
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $48.1 million. We had $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '16 versus $23.7 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '15, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $68.6 million.
In Q1, Adobe's effective tax rate was 13% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted, primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2015 R&D tax credit. Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 14,154 versus 13,893 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 42 days, which compares to 44 days in the year-ago quarter and 47 days last quarter.
Cash flow from operations was $498 million in the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $1.61 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.1 billion compared to $3.99 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of $133 million. We currently have $1.48 billion remaining under our latest repurchase authority granted in January 2015.
Now I will provide our financial outlook. When considering our targets for the second quarter of fiscal '16, it is important to remember that the first quarter had an extra week of revenue, which we estimate had an approximate benefit of $75 million. Based on Q2 being a standard 13-week quarter, we are targeting a second quarter revenue range of $1,365,000,000 to $1,415,000,000. In Digital Media, we expect to add approximately $275 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q2, with strong year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth.
In Digital Marketing, as we said in December, we expect Marketing Cloud quarterly year-over-year revenue growth will fluctuate below and above our annual FY '16 target of approximately 20% growth based on the amount of perpetual revenue achieved in the prior year-ago quarter. Given this, we are targeting approximately 17% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth in Q2 with continued momentum in bookings.
We expect our Q2 share count to be between 506 million to 508 million shares. We are targeting net nonoperating expense to be between $14 million and $16 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 23% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis.
These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.42 to $0.48 per share and a Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.64 to $0.70. Based on Q1 upside and the benefit of strong Digital Media ARR momentum, we are raising certain full year financial targets.
In Digital Media, we are increasing our Digital Media ARR exiting FY '16 to approximately $4 billion, which is above our prior target of approximately $3.875 billion. We are increasing our targeted revenue for the year to approximately $5.8 billion, up from our prior target of approximately $5.7 billion. FY '16 targeted EPS is now approximately $2 on a GAAP basis and approximately $2.80 on a non-GAAP basis. Our prior FY '16 EPS targets were approximately $1.80 on a GAAP basis and approximately $2.70 on a non-GAAP basis. 
In terms of color for the rest of the year, in Q3, we expect a slight sequential increase in both total revenue and Digital Media ARR. We also expect Q3 marketing cloud revenue growth of less than 20% year-over-year due to the large amount of perpetual revenue in the year-ago quarter. In Q4, we expect seasonally strong sequential growth in both total revenue and Digital Media ARR. And we expect Q4 Marketing Cloud revenue growth greater than 20% year-over-year.
In summary, Q1 was a great start to what will be another strong year for Adobe. Mike?"

And part of it is because they all recognize that the content that they're creating is going to be consumed in mobile. And in terms of working in groups, that's the other thing that's driving both tablet, mobile as well as PC usage. The new Experience Design project as well. Initial feedback has been very positive. People have been asking about how they can get that also as well on mobile and touch. And so we just look at the explosion of mobile devices and where both content is created and consumed. And it's clearly being a tailwind not just in the Digital Media business but also in the Digital Marketing business.

We certainly believe that there's tens of millions of Creatives as they come into the market as part of the education segment, that's a growth for us.

More and more, people are using our Creative products. Internationally also, we are starting to have education be adopted.

The first is as it relates to revenue for Stock, during the quarter, it was in line with our expectations so it's doing well. Again, just to refresh folks, we offer on-demand Stock as a way for people to buy particular Stock assets. We certainly offer a Stock-only subscription, and we then offer a combined subscription, which allows people to both access Stock as well as our desktop products. And so across all of them, we're continuing to see accelerated usage of the Stock subscription. We don't break that out, Kash, in terms of what it is. And that's the reason we're focused on just continuing to make sure we gain market share in the stock and deliver value. I think big picture, as we've always said, over 80% of the people who are buying or selling Stock are using or products and that's the opportunity. From a roadmap point of view, we look at integrating the Stock service more directly within our applications as a way to both increase awareness for our customers and to improve their workflows. So as the year progresses, we continue to expect to do better in Stock moving forward. So off to a good start and it's early in the entire marketplace strategy for Adobe. And with respect to bookings, I think Mark also alluded to the fact that they were strong. We did not see a meme seasonal slowdown from Q4 to Q1 in terms of how we look at the business. and one of the things I should probably state is when you look at the Digital Marketing revenue for Q1, it's actually being driven primarily by the bookings that we had last year now translating into things getting life. There really wasn't much perpetual revenue in the quarter. So the good news is that marketing is all as a result of the strong bookings we experienced last year."

The first is when you look at the number of new users that we've stated who are part of the Creative platform, which is 30% of the people who are doing business with us, there's no question that our surveys and anecdotal evidence speak to the fact that people who may have a formally pirated or used that products casually are paying for the service because it's far more affordable. As you know, we are seeing increased growth in international markets where there was more piracy. The reality is we still haven't offered the Creative Cloud product in China as Creative Cloud. So all of that is upside for us in terms of combating piracy. There's so much opportunity in the developed markets, that's where we focused. So making progress and we continue to think, as we roll it out in other markets around the world, it's going to impact it. With respect to the single app versus the complete, as we said, it's going to gravitate towards 50%, 50% in the quarter. I think it was 52% CC complete."

So that's 1 big opportunity. And we're clearly seeing, as people come on to the Creative Cloud platform, they typically come from CS6 and prior versions, where we give them a proportional pricing and then convert into the full pricing. The other opportunity for ARPU expansion is moving from single app to the entire product. The third opportunity for ARPU expansion is Acrobat. We're certainly seeing a lot of people and that's why we're moving them more through the Creative Cloud funnel as opposed to the Document Cloud funnel, upselling them into the entire product. And last but certainly not least, while it's not called ARPU, within the enterprise as well as we move from selling what used to be custom-like solutions of Creative Suite into the entire Creative Cloud Complete. So even on the core desktop products, there's ARPU expansion against all of those 4. Then in addition to that, it's the new services that we have introduced and will continue to introduce that represents ARPU expansion.

As I'm traveling around the world, meeting both customers and partners, it's really clear that consumer expectations and what's happening with technology is causing every business to rethink how they interact with customers. And I think that's a digital-first strategy right now for every one of them.
From our point of view, that great experience starts with great content. We're clearly the company that's helping bringing their concepts to life for Creatives. And Creative Cloud's clearly the one-stop shop for these customers, providing everything from inspiration to monetization.
I think the other thing we see is delivering that experience to the right person at the right time, requires a technology platform that deals with large volumes of content and data but more importantly, with the right intelligence. And that's the goal of the Adobe Marketing Cloud.
All of these tailwinds we see now benefiting our businesses. And I think in Q1, we saw strength across Creative Cloud adoption and ARR growth, DC and Acrobat adoption as well as strong bookings and revenue. And implementations that are going live with the Adobe Marketing Cloud. And that's the reason why our Q1 upside and Q2 outlook give us confidence to raise the revenue as well as earnings target.
We think we're in great shape. We remain focused on driving innovation and strong financial results. And I want to thank our customers and partners worldwide for their ongoing commitment and to our employees for continuing to drive innovation in our industry.
We hope to see you folks next week at Summit, and otherwise, we look forward to our next call. Thank you for joining us today."

Adobe's year is off to a strong start with first quarter revenue of $1.38 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66. Adobe's opportunity has never been greater. Every brand, government agency and educational institution is undergoing large-scale digital transformation. Creating a compelling experience for their customers and constituents across every touchpoint is paramount to their success, and they're turning to Adobe for help.
In Digital Media, Creative Cloud momentum continued in Q1 with strong adoption across all segments. There have never been more people creating content. Whether it's creative professionals, photographers, students or hobbyists creating compelling images, videos, websites or mobile applications, our opportunity is to provide them with a one-stop shop for all their creative needs.
There are 3 primary growth drivers for Creative Cloud as we target a $17 billion addressable market: continuing to migrate our core base of creative users, market expansion into new segments and value expansion through new services.
Our migration strategy focuses on driving Creative Suite users to our core offerings, Creative Cloud for individuals, teams and enterprises. In Q1, we executed well against this opportunity, driving adoption across all routes to market, including Adobe.com, our channel partners and Adobe direct sales.
Our market expansion strategy is to bring in new users, including photo enthusiasts and hobbyists, with our Creative Cloud Photography Plan. Over 30% of Creative Cloud subscribers are new to Adobe, and many are coming to us through our mobile apps. Over 23 million new Adobe IDs have been created through our mobile apps to date.
In terms of value expansion, we have begun to see the positive effect of Adobe Stock, our stock content marketplace, on our Creative revenue and ARR. Millions of creatives use stock content, and we believe Adobe has a tremendous opportunity to deliver additional value by seamlessly integrating Adobe Stock directly into the Creative Cloud service.
We intend to become the leader in this space through further product integration and new offerings, including stock video. In February, we added more than 100,000 native 4K video assets to Adobe Stock, which already includes more than 1 million video assets and more than 45 million images and graphics.
The primary benefit of a Creative Cloud subscription is access to Adobe's continuous innovation. Earlier this week, we announced the preview release of a brand-new product, Adobe Experience Design CC, a design and prototyping product that empowers user experience designers to deliver new mobile apps and websites quickly and easily.
User experience design is one of the fastest-growing creative disciplines. According to data from our Behance creative community of over 6.6 million creatives, interaction design projects grew by 52% in 2015, more than any other creative field. We look forward to hearing feedback from our community as we work toward launching the product later this year.
Adobe's momentum continues in the video space where we are now the leader in video production and editing. Over 175 films debuting at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival used Adobe Premiere Pro CC and other Creative Cloud tools. Deadpool is the latest blockbuster film to be edited exclusively with Adobe Premiere Pro.
Our footprint is extending beyond creative pros to creative consumers. In February, we introduced Adobe Post, a free mobile app that allows consumers to quickly and easily turn photos and text into beautifully designed graphics and share them on social media. It joins our other consumer mobile apps, Adobe Voice and Adobe Slate, in bringing fast and fun storytelling capabilities to a broad audience, including students and small businesses.
Adobe Document Cloud is becoming critical to the paper-to-digital transformation of document processes. More than 6 billion digital and electronic signature transactions are now processed through Document Cloud each year. Global businesses like the Royal Bank of Scotland, Scottrade and NetApp rely on Document Cloud and Adobe Sign for fast, secure and mobile e-signatures.
In Q1, Document Cloud revenue was $199 million, and we exited the quarter with $393 million in ARR. Across our Creative and Document Cloud businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $3.13 billion as of the end of Q1.
We're the leader in the exploding digital marketing category. In Q1, we achieved strong Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings with revenue of $377 million, which represents a 21% year-over-year increase. We continue to drive large-scale, multi-solution engagements with Marketing Cloud customers. Significant customer engagements in Q1 included RR Donnelly, Samsung Electronics, MGM Resorts International, Nissan, Workday and Goldman Sachs.
At Adobe, we are focused on product innovation, and Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions continue to garner accolades from industry analysts. Earlier this month, we were recognized by IDC as a Leader in its Worldwide Marketing Cloud Platforms Vendor Assessment. And Forrester Research recognized Adobe Analytics, the data and analytics backbone of Adobe Marketing Cloud, as a Leader in its Customer Analytics Solutions Wave report. In January, Gartner named Adobe as a Leader in the 2016 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs.
Adobe managed over 51 trillion customer data transactions through the Marketing Cloud over the past 4 quarters. And our Adobe Digital Index reports are increasingly being viewed as the source for reporting and predicting major retail and consumer trends. Yesterday, we launched our new Digital Economy Project, which includes 3 digital indicators of the U.S. economy: a digital price index, a housing index and a jobseeking index.
Next week, we will hold our Adobe Summit event in Las Vegas, and we're expecting record-breaking attendance, including hundreds of our partners and mainstage speakers from top brands, including Cirque du Soleil, McDonald's, Comedy Central, Mattel and Royal Bank of Scotland. Adobe Summit is the industry's leading digital marketing conference and the venue to learn where the industry is headed and see Adobe's latest technical advancements in mobile, video and data science.
For over 30 years, Adobe employees have demonstrated a sense of purpose and commitment to our communities, and we're proud of the recognition we received in Q1 as both an employer and a good corporate citizen. We were included as one of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations and were recognized as Fortune's Most Admired Company within the software category.
While Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud are all leaders in their respective categories, our true opportunity is in bringing these solutions together. We have been unwavering in our mission to use content and data to deliver world-class experiences to our customers, whether they're on the web, in an app, in a retail store or in a car.
Adobe is the only software company with deep history and content and vast data capabilities to deliver consistent, continuous and compelling experiences. We have a robust technology platform, a thriving ecosystem of partners and developers and a strong brand that has affinity worldwide with the world's largest enterprises, agencies, governments and educational institutions.
Our Q1 results demonstrate strong execution against this vast opportunity. Our market leadership, product differentiation and continued momentum give us confidence to raise our fiscal '16 revenue and earnings targets. Mark?"

Before I comment on Q1 results, as a reminder, 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year with a 14-week first quarter. This was factored into all of the targets we provided in December.In the first quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue",1379,"Thanks, Shantanu. Before I comment on Q1 results, as a reminder, 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year with a 14-week first quarter. This was factored into all of the targets we provided in December.
In the first quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,383,000,000, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. We estimate the extra week added approximately $75 million of revenue to the quarter, but this was mainly offset by a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue of approximately $69 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 were $0.50, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.66. These strong results reflect continued momentum across our Cloud businesses.
Highlights in our first quarter include: better-than-expected growth in Digital Media ARR, exiting the quarter with $3.13 billion; record Creative revenue of $733 million, which represents 44% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $377 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth; strong growth in operating and net income, with cash flow from operations of $498 million; and exiting Q1 with a record 81% of Q1 revenue as recurring.
In Digital Media, we grew Q1 segment revenue by 33% year-over-year and exited the quarter with Digital Media ARR of $3.13 billion. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $733 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 44%. We increased Creative ARR by $238 million during Q1.
Driving this strong performance was demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market, including the addition of 798,000 net new Creative Cloud subscriptions during the quarter. Migration continues to represent a large opportunity. Creative Cloud continues to distance itself from Creative Suite, and creatives are migrating as well as renewing at non-promotional pricing.
New customer adoption continues to increase our installed base. Creative Cloud mobile apps are driving new top-of-funnel traffic and first-time customer adoption. Market expansion is being driven by offerings such as the Creative Cloud Photography Plan, which targets photo enthusiasts. Value expansion with new services like Adobe Stock are increasing ARPU and ARR.
Our performance across all of these offerings and the health of the business is best reflected in ARR. Because of this, moving forward, we have decided to provide forward-looking quarterly ARR targets to help you better model the total business.
With respect to subscriptions, it has been our stated goal to attract tens of millions of customers at widely varying price points. We reviewed this strategy with you back in October at our analyst meeting. Creative Cloud Photography Plan was our first market expansion offering and has resulted in well over 1 million subscribers. New SKUs such as the recently announced K-12 education offering will make Creative cloud available to millions of students. And as we said at the analyst meeting, we are also considering a mobile-only offering. All of this further dilutes the relevance of the number of subscribers as a measure of the health of the business.
In addition, with respect to Acrobat, customers have been able to choose to subscribe to Acrobat either through Creative Cloud, which has been reflected as Creative Cloud subscriptions and Creative ARR, or via Document Cloud, which has been reflected in Document Cloud ARR. For all of these reasons, while we might choose to periodically report subscriptions, we no longer intend to provide actuals on a quarterly basis.
With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $199 million, with Document Cloud ARR exiting the quarter of $393 million. Adoption of our new Acrobat DC offering was strong in Q1, both through the perpetual offering as well as in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings on Adobe.com, all of which is captured in Digital Media ARR.
In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $377 million. We delivered strong bookings during the quarter, and both the revenue and bookings in Q1 put us on pace to achieve our annual targets of approximately 20% revenue growth and 30% bookings growth.
Other Marketing Cloud highlights in Q1 include: strong year-over-year revenue growth across all Marketing Cloud solutions; continued growth in multi-solution adoption by our biggest customers; and mobile data transactions grew to 49% of total Adobe Analytics transactions.
Our Digital Marketing segment revenue also includes LiveCycle and Connect, which declined as expected. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.5 million. We had $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '16 versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '15, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $7.6 million.
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $48.1 million. We had $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '16 versus $23.7 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '15, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $68.6 million.
In Q1, Adobe's effective tax rate was 13% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted, primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2015 R&D tax credit. Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 14,154 versus 13,893 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 42 days, which compares to 44 days in the year-ago quarter and 47 days last quarter.
Cash flow from operations was $498 million in the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $1.61 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.1 billion compared to $3.99 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of $133 million. We currently have $1.48 billion remaining under our latest repurchase authority granted in January 2015.
Now I will provide our financial outlook. When considering our targets for the second quarter of fiscal '16, it is important to remember that the first quarter had an extra week of revenue, which we estimate had an approximate benefit of $75 million. Based on Q2 being a standard 13-week quarter, we are targeting a second quarter revenue range of $1,365,000,000 to $1,415,000,000. In Digital Media, we expect to add approximately $275 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q2, with strong year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth.
In Digital Marketing, as we said in December, we expect Marketing Cloud quarterly year-over-year revenue growth will fluctuate below and above our annual FY '16 target of approximately 20% growth based on the amount of perpetual revenue achieved in the prior year-ago quarter. Given this, we are targeting approximately 17% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth in Q2 with continued momentum in bookings.
We expect our Q2 share count to be between 506 million to 508 million shares. We are targeting net nonoperating expense to be between $14 million and $16 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 23% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis.
These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.42 to $0.48 per share and a Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.64 to $0.70. Based on Q1 upside and the benefit of strong Digital Media ARR momentum, we are raising certain full year financial targets.
In Digital Media, we are increasing our Digital Media ARR exiting FY '16 to approximately $4 billion, which is above our prior target of approximately $3.875 billion. We are increasing our targeted revenue for the year to approximately $5.8 billion, up from our prior target of approximately $5.7 billion. FY '16 targeted EPS is now approximately $2 on a GAAP basis and approximately $2.80 on a non-GAAP basis. Our prior FY '16 EPS targets were approximately $1.80 on a GAAP basis and approximately $2.70 on a non-GAAP basis.
In terms of color for the rest of the year, in Q3, we expect a slight sequential increase in both total revenue and Digital Media ARR. We also expect Q3 Marketing Cloud revenue growth of less than 20% year-over-year due to the large amount of perpetual revenue in the year-ago quarter. In Q4, we expect seasonally strong sequential growth in both total revenue and Digital Media ARR. And we expect Q4 Marketing Cloud revenue growth greater than 20% year-over-year.
In summary, Q1 was a great start to what will be another strong year for Adobe. Mike?"

The first is as it relates to revenue for Stock, during the quarter, it was in line with our expectations. So it's doing well. Again, just to refresh folks, we offer on-demand Stock as a way for people to buy particular stock assets. We certainly offer a Stock-only subscription, and we then offer a combined subscription, which allows people to both access Stock as well as our desktop products. And so across all of them, we're continuing to see accelerated usage of the Stock subscription. We don't break that out, Kash, in terms of what it is. And that's the reason we're focused on just continuing to make sure we gain market share in the Stock and deliver value. I think big picture, as we've always said, over 80% of the people who are buying or selling stock are using our products, and that's the opportunity. From a road map point of view, we look at integrating the Stock service more directly within our applications as a way to both increase awareness for our customers and to improve their workflows. So as the year progresses, we continue to expect to do better in Stock moving forward. So off to a good start, and it's early in the entire marketplace strategy for Adobe. And with respect to bookings, I think Mark also alluded to the fact that they were strong. We did not see any seasonal slowdown from Q4 to Q1 in terms of how we look at the business. And one of the things I should probably state is when you look at the Digital Marketing revenue for Q1, it's actually being driven primarily by the bookings that we had last year now translating into things getting live. There really wasn't much perpetual revenue in the quarter. So the good news is that marketing is all as a result of the strong bookings we experienced last year."

As you know, we are seeing increased growth in international markets where there was more piracy. The reality is we still haven't offered the Creative Cloud product in China as Creative Cloud. So all of that is upside for us in terms of combating piracy. There's so much opportunity in the developed markets. That's where we're focused. So making progress and we continue to think, as we roll it out in other markets around the world, it's going to impact it. With respect to the single app versus the Complete, as we said, it's going to gravitate towards 50-50 in the quarter. I think it was 52% CC Complete."

The other opportunity for ARPU expansion is moving from single app to the entire product. The third opportunity for ARPU expansion is Acrobat. We're certainly seeing a lot of people, and that's why we are moving them more through the Creative Cloud funnel as opposed to the Document Cloud funnel, upselling them into the entire product. And last but certainly not least, while it's not called ARPU, within the enterprise as well as we move from selling what used to be custom-like solutions of Creative Suite into the entire Creative Cloud Complete. So even on the core desktop products, there's ARPU expansion against all of those 4.

And since that was the last question, I mean, just a couple of comments. As I'm traveling around the world, meeting both customers and partners, it's really clear that consumer expectations and what's happening with technology is causing every business to rethink how they interact with customers. And I think that's a digital-first strategy right now for every one of them.
From our point of view, that great experience starts with great content. We're clearly the company that's helping bringing their concepts to life for creatives. And Creative Cloud's clearly the one-stop shop for these customers, providing everything from inspiration to monetization.
I think the other thing we see is delivering that experience to the right person at the right time requires a technology platform that deals with large volumes of content and data but more importantly, with the right intelligence. And that's the goal of the Adobe Marketing Cloud.
All of these tailwinds we see now benefiting our businesses. And I think in Q1, we saw strength across Creative Cloud adoption and ARR growth, DC and Acrobat adoption as well as strong bookings and revenue and implementations that are going live with the Adobe Marketing Cloud. And that's the reason why our Q1 upside and Q2 outlook give us confidence to raise the revenue as well as earnings target.
We think we're in great shape. We remain focused on driving innovation and strong financial results. And I want to thank our customers and partners worldwide for their ongoing commitment and to our employees for continuing to drive innovation in our industry.
We hope to see you folks next week at Summit, and otherwise, we look forward to our next call. Thank you for joining us today."

Adobe's year is off to a strong start with first quarter revenue of $1.38 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66. Adobe's opportunity has never been greater. Every brand, government agency and educational institution is undergoing large-scale digital transformation. Creating a compelling experience for their customers and constituents across every touchpoint is paramount to their success, and they're turning to Adobe for help.
In Digital Media, Creative Cloud momentum continued in Q1 with strong adoption across all segments. There have never been more people creating content. Whether it's creative professionals, photographers, students or hobbyists creating compelling images, videos, websites or mobile applications, our opportunity is to provide them with a one-stop shop for all their creative needs.
There are 3 primary growth drivers for Creative Cloud as we target a $17 billion addressable market: continuing to migrate our core base of creative users, market expansion into new segments and value expansion through new services.
Our migration strategy focuses on driving Creative Suite users to our core offerings, Creative Cloud for individuals, teams and enterprises. In Q1, we executed well against this opportunity, driving adoption across all routes to market, including Adobe.com, our channel partners and Adobe direct sales.
Our market expansion strategy is to bring in new users, including photo enthusiasts and hobbyists, with our Creative Cloud Photography Plan. Over 30% of Creative Cloud subscribers are new to Adobe, and many are coming to us through our mobile apps. Over 23 million new Adobe IDs have been created through our mobile apps to date.
In terms of value expansion, we have begun to see the positive effect of Adobe Stock, our stock content marketplace, on our Creative revenue and ARR. Millions of creatives use stock content, and we believe Adobe has a tremendous opportunity to deliver additional value by seamlessly integrating Adobe Stock directly into the Creative Cloud service.
We intend to become the leader in this space through further product integration and new offerings, including stock video. In February, we added more than 100,000 native 4K video assets to Adobe Stock, which already includes more than 1 million video assets and more than 45 million images and graphics.
The primary benefit of a Creative Cloud subscription is access to Adobe's continuous innovation. Earlier this week, we announced the preview release of a brand-new product, Adobe Experience Design CC, a design and prototyping product that empowers user experience designers to deliver new mobile apps and websites quickly and easily.
User experience design is one of the fastest-growing creative disciplines. According to data from our Behance creative community of over 6.6 million creatives, interaction design projects grew by 52% in 2015, more than any other creative field. We look forward to hearing feedback from our community as we work toward launching the product later this year.
Adobe's momentum continues in the video space where we are now the leader in video production and editing. Over 175 films debuting at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival used Adobe Premiere Pro CC and other Creative Cloud tools. Deadpool is the latest blockbuster film to be edited exclusively with Adobe Premiere Pro.
Our footprint is extending beyond creative pros to creative consumers. In February, we introduced Adobe Post, a free mobile app that allows consumers to quickly and easily turn photos and text into beautifully designed graphics and share them on social media. It joins our other consumer mobile apps, Adobe Voice and Adobe Slate, in bringing fast and fun storytelling capabilities to a broad audience, including students and small businesses.
Adobe Document Cloud is becoming critical to the paper-to-digital transformation of document processes. More than 6 billion digital and electronic signature transactions are now processed through Document Cloud each year. Global businesses like the Royal Bank of Scotland, Scottrade and NetApp rely on Document Cloud and Adobe Sign for fast, secure and mobile e-signatures.
In Q1, Document Cloud revenue was $199 million, and we exited the quarter with $393 million in ARR. Across our Creative and Document Cloud businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $3.13 billion as of the end of Q1.
We're the leader in the exploding digital marketing category. In Q1, we achieved strong Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings with revenue of $377 million, which represents a 21% year-over-year increase. We continue to drive large-scale, multi-solution engagements with Marketing Cloud customers. Significant customer engagements in Q1 included RR Donnelly, Samsung Electronics, MGM Resorts International, Nissan, Workday and Goldman Sachs.
At Adobe, we are focused on product innovation, and Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions continue to garner accolades from industry analysts. Earlier this month, we were recognized by IDC as a Leader in its Worldwide Marketing Cloud Platforms Vendor Assessment. And Forrester Research recognized Adobe Analytics, the data and analytics backbone of Adobe Marketing Cloud, as a Leader in its Customer Analytics Solutions Wave report. In January, Gartner named Adobe as a Leader in the 2016 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs.
Adobe managed over 51 trillion customer data transactions through the Marketing Cloud over the past 4 quarters. And our Adobe Digital Index reports are increasingly being viewed as the source for reporting and predicting major retail and consumer trends. Yesterday, we launched our new Digital Economy Project, which includes 3 digital indicators of the U.S. economy: a digital price index, a housing index and a job-seeking index.
Next week, we will hold our Adobe Summit event in Las Vegas, and we're expecting record-breaking attendance, including hundreds of our partners and mainstage speakers from top brands, including Cirque du Soleil, McDonald's, Comedy Central, Mattel and Royal Bank of Scotland. Adobe Summit is the industry's leading digital marketing conference and the venue to learn where the industry is headed and see Adobe's latest technical advancements in mobile, video and data science.
For over 30 years, Adobe employees have demonstrated a sense of purpose and commitment to our communities, and we're proud of the recognition we received in Q1 as both an employer and a good corporate citizen. We were included as one of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations and were recognized as Fortune's Most Admired Company within the software category.
While Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud are all leaders in their respective categories, our true opportunity is in bringing these solutions together. We have been unwavering in our mission to use content and data to deliver world-class experiences to our customers, whether they're on the web, in an app, in a retail store or in a car.
Adobe is the only software company with deep history in content and vast data capabilities to deliver consistent, continuous and compelling experiences. We have a robust technology platform, a thriving ecosystem of partners and developers and a strong brand that has affinity worldwide with the world's largest enterprises, agencies, governments and educational institutions.
Our Q1 results demonstrate strong execution against this vast opportunity. Our market leadership, product differentiation and continued momentum give us confidence to raise our fiscal '16 revenue and earnings targets. Mark?"

This was factored into all of the targets we provided in December.In the first quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue",1379,"Thanks, Shantanu. Before I comment on Q1 results, as a reminder, 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year with a 14-week first quarter. This was factored into all of the targets we provided in December.
In the first quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,383,000,000, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. We estimate the extra week added approximately $75 million of revenue to the quarter, but this was mainly offset by a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue of approximately $69 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 were $0.50, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.66. These strong results reflect continued momentum across our Cloud businesses.
Highlights in our first quarter include: better-than-expected growth in Digital Media ARR, exiting the quarter with $3.13 billion; record Creative revenue of $733 million, which represents 44% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $377 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth; strong growth in operating and net income, with cash flow from operations of $498 million; and exiting Q1 with a record 81% of Q1 revenue as recurring.
In Digital Media, we grew Q1 segment revenue by 33% year-over-year and exited the quarter with Digital Media ARR of $3.13 billion. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $733 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 44%. We increased Creative ARR by $238 million during Q1.
Driving this strong performance was demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market, including the addition of 798,000 net new Creative Cloud subscriptions during the quarter. Migration continues to represent a large opportunity. Creative Cloud continues to distance itself from Creative Suite, and creatives are migrating as well as renewing at non-promotional pricing.
New customer adoption continues to increase our installed base. Creative Cloud mobile apps are driving new top-of-funnel traffic and first-time customer adoption. Market expansion is being driven by offerings such as the Creative Cloud Photography Plan, which targets photo enthusiasts. Value expansion with new services like Adobe Stock are increasing ARPU and ARR.
Our performance across all of these offerings and the health of the business is best reflected in ARR. Because of this, moving forward, we have decided to provide forward-looking quarterly ARR targets to help you better model the total business.
With respect to subscriptions, it has been our stated goal to attract tens of millions of customers at widely varying price points. We reviewed this strategy with you back in October at our analyst meeting. Creative Cloud Photography Plan was our first market expansion offering and has resulted in well over 1 million subscribers. New SKUs such as the recently announced K-12 education offering will make Creative cloud available to millions of students. And as we said at the analyst meeting, we are also considering a mobile-only offering. All of this further dilutes the relevance of the number of subscribers as a measure of the health of the business.
In addition, with respect to Acrobat, customers have been able to choose to subscribe to Acrobat either through Creative Cloud, which has been reflected as Creative Cloud subscriptions and Creative ARR, or via Document Cloud, which has been reflected in Document Cloud ARR. For all of these reasons, while we might choose to periodically report subscriptions, we no longer intend to provide actuals on a quarterly basis.
With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $199 million, with Document Cloud ARR exiting the quarter of $393 million. Adoption of our new Acrobat DC offering was strong in Q1, both through the perpetual offering as well as in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings on Adobe.com, all of which is captured in Digital Media ARR.
In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $377 million. We delivered strong bookings during the quarter, and both the revenue and bookings in Q1 put us on pace to achieve our annual targets of approximately 20% revenue growth and 30% bookings growth.
Other Marketing Cloud highlights in Q1 include: strong year-over-year revenue growth across all Marketing Cloud solutions; continued growth in multi-solution adoption by our biggest customers; and mobile data transactions grew to 49% of total Adobe Analytics transactions.
Our Digital Marketing segment revenue also includes LiveCycle and Connect, which declined as expected. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.5 million. We had $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '16 versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '15, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $7.6 million.
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $48.1 million. We had $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '16 versus $23.7 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '15, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $68.6 million.
In Q1, Adobe's effective tax rate was 13% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted, primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2015 R&D tax credit. Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 14,154 versus 13,893 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 42 days, which compares to 44 days in the year-ago quarter and 47 days last quarter.
Cash flow from operations was $498 million in the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $1.61 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.1 billion compared to $3.99 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of $133 million. We currently have $1.48 billion remaining under our latest repurchase authority granted in January 2015.
Now I will provide our financial outlook. When considering our targets for the second quarter of fiscal '16, it is important to remember that the first quarter had an extra week of revenue, which we estimate had an approximate benefit of $75 million. Based on Q2 being a standard 13-week quarter, we are targeting a second quarter revenue range of $1,365,000,000 to $1,415,000,000. In Digital Media, we expect to add approximately $275 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q2, with strong year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth.
In Digital Marketing, as we said in December, we expect Marketing Cloud quarterly year-over-year revenue growth will fluctuate below and above our annual FY '16 target of approximately 20% growth based on the amount of perpetual revenue achieved in the prior year-ago quarter. Given this, we are targeting approximately 17% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth in Q2 with continued momentum in bookings.
We expect our Q2 share count to be between 506 million to 508 million shares. We are targeting net nonoperating expense to be between $14 million and $16 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 23% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis.
These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.42 to $0.48 per share and a Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.64 to $0.70. Based on Q1 upside and the benefit of strong Digital Media ARR momentum, we are raising certain full year financial targets.
In Digital Media, we are increasing our Digital Media ARR exiting FY '16 to approximately $4 billion, which is above our prior target of approximately $3.875 billion. We are increasing our targeted revenue for the year to approximately $5.8 billion, up from our prior target of approximately $5.7 billion. FY '16 targeted EPS is now approximately $2 on a GAAP basis and approximately $2.80 on a non-GAAP basis. Our prior FY '16 EPS targets were approximately $1.80 on a GAAP basis and approximately $2.70 on a non-GAAP basis.
In terms of color for the rest of the year, in Q3, we expect a slight sequential increase in both total revenue and Digital Media ARR. We also expect Q3 Marketing Cloud revenue growth of less than 20% year-over-year due to the large amount of perpetual revenue in the year-ago quarter. In Q4, we expect seasonally strong sequential growth in both total revenue and Digital Media ARR. And we expect Q4 Marketing Cloud revenue growth greater than 20% year-over-year.
In summary, Q1 was a great start to what will be another strong year for Adobe. Mike?"

More and more people are using our Creative products. Internationally also, we are starting to have education be adopted. But big picture, we look at it and say whether it's a student-teacher single edition, whether it's an institution or whether it's a lab usage, we want to make sure that our offering is applicable in all of those settings."

The first is as it relates to revenue for Stock, during the quarter, it was in line with our expectations. So it's doing well. Again, just to refresh folks, we offer on-demand Stock as a way for people to buy particular stock assets. We certainly offer a Stock-only subscription, and we then offer a combined subscription, which allows people to both access Stock as well as our desktop products. And so across all of them, we're continuing to see accelerated usage of the Stock subscriptions. We don't break that out, Kash, in terms of what it is. And that's the reason we're focused on just continuing to make sure we gain market share in the Stock and deliver value. I think big picture, as we've always said, over 80% of the people who are buying or selling stock are using our products, and that's the opportunity. From a road map point of view, we look at integrating the Stock service more directly within our applications as a way to both increase awareness for our customers and to improve their workflows. So as the year progresses, we continue to expect to do better in Stock moving forward. So off to a good start, and it's early in the entire marketplace strategy for Adobe. And with respect to bookings, I think Mark also alluded to the fact that they were strong. We did not see any seasonal slowdown from Q4 to Q1 in terms of how we look at the business. And one of the things I should probably state is when you look at the Digital Marketing revenue for Q1, it's actually being driven primarily by the bookings that we had last year now translating into things getting live. There really wasn't much perpetual revenue in the quarter. So the good news is that marketing is all as a result of the strong bookings we experienced last year."

The first is when you look at the number of new users that we've stated who are part of the Creative platform, which is 30% of the people who are doing business with us, there's no question that our surveys and anecdotal evidence speak to the fact that people who may have formerly pirated or used our products casually are paying for the service because it's far more affordable. As you know, we are seeing increased growth in international markets where there was more piracy. The reality is we still haven't offered the Creative Cloud product in China as Creative Cloud. So all of that is upside for us in terms of combating piracy. There's so much opportunity in the developed markets. That's where we focus. So making progress and we continue to think, as we roll it out in other markets around the world, it's going to impact it.

And since that was the last question, I mean, just a couple of comments. As I'm traveling around the world, meeting both customers and partners, it's really clear that consumer expectations and what's happening with technology is causing every business to rethink how they interact with customers. And I think that's a digital-first strategy right now for every one of them.
From our point of view, that great experience starts with great content. We're clearly the company that's helping bringing their concepts to life for creatives. And Creative Cloud's clearly the one-stop shop for these customers, providing everything from inspiration to monetization.
I think the other thing we see is delivering that experience to the right person at the right time requires a technology platform that deals with large volumes of content and data but more importantly, with the right intelligence. And that's the goal of the Adobe Marketing Cloud.
All of these are tailwinds we see now benefiting our businesses. And I think in Q1, we saw strength across Creative Cloud adoption and ARR growth, DC and Acrobat adoption as well as strong bookings and revenue and implementations that are going live with the Adobe Marketing Cloud. And that's the reason why our Q1 upside and Q2 outlook give us confidence to raise the revenue as well as earnings target.
We think we're in great shape. We remain focused on driving innovation and strong financial results. And I want to thank our customers and partners worldwide for their ongoing commitment and to our employees for continuing to drive innovation in our industry.
We hope to see you folks next week at Summit, and otherwise, we look forward to our next call. Thank you for joining us today."

Adobe's year is off to a strong start with first quarter revenue of $1.38 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66. Adobe's opportunity has never been greater. Every brand, government agency and educational institution is undergoing large-scale digital transformation. Creating a compelling experience for their customers and constituents across every touchpoint is paramount to their success, and they're turning to Adobe for help.
In Digital Media, Creative Cloud momentum continued in Q1 with strong adoption across all segments. There have never been more people creating content. Whether it's creative professionals, photographers, students or hobbyists creating compelling images, videos, websites or mobile applications, our opportunity is to provide them with a one-stop shop for all their creative needs.
There are 3 primary growth drivers for Creative Cloud as we target a $17 billion addressable market: continuing to migrate our core base of creative users, market expansion into new segments and value expansion through new services.
Our migration strategy focuses on driving Creative Suite users to our core offerings, Creative Cloud for individuals, teams and enterprises. In Q1, we executed well against this opportunity, driving adoption across all routes to market, including Adobe.com, our channel partners and Adobe direct sales.
Our market expansion strategy is to bring in new users, including photo enthusiasts and hobbyists, with our Creative Cloud Photography Plan. Over 30% of Creative Cloud subscribers are new to Adobe, and many are coming to us through our mobile apps. Over 23 million new Adobe IDs have been created through our mobile apps to date.
In terms of value expansion, we have begun to see the positive effect of Adobe Stock, our stock content marketplace, on our Creative revenue and ARR. Millions of creatives use stock content, and we believe Adobe has a tremendous opportunity to deliver additional value by seamlessly integrating Adobe Stock directly into the Creative Cloud service.
We intend to become the leader in this space through further product integration and new offerings, including stock video. In February, we added more than 100,000 native 4K video assets to Adobe Stock, which already includes more than 1 million video assets and more than 45 million images and graphics.
The primary benefit of a Creative Cloud subscription is access to Adobe's continuous innovation. Earlier this week, we announced the preview release of a brand-new product, Adobe Experience Design CC, a design and prototyping product that empowers user experience designers to deliver new mobile apps and websites quickly and easily.
User experience design is one of the fastest-growing creative disciplines. According to data from our Behance creative community of over 6.6 million creatives, interaction design projects grew by 52% in 2015, more than any other creative field. We look forward to hearing feedback from our community as we work toward launching the product later this year.
Adobe's momentum continues in the video space where we are now the leader in video production and editing. Over 175 films debuting at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival used Adobe Premiere Pro CC and other Creative Cloud tools. Deadpool is the latest blockbuster film to be edited exclusively with Adobe Premiere Pro.
Our footprint is extending beyond creative pros to creative consumers. In February, we introduced Adobe Post, a free mobile app that allows consumers to quickly and easily turn photos and text into beautifully designed graphics and share them on social media. It joins our other consumer mobile apps, Adobe Voice and Adobe Slate, in bringing fast and fun storytelling capabilities to a broad audience, including students and small businesses.
Adobe Document Cloud is becoming critical to the paper-to-digital transformation of document processes. More than 6 billion digital and electronic signature transactions are now processed through Document Cloud each year. Global businesses like the Royal Bank of Scotland, Scottrade and NetApp rely on Document Cloud and Adobe Sign for fast, secure and mobile e-signatures.
In Q1, Document Cloud revenue was $199 million, and we exited the quarter with $393 million in ARR. Across our Creative and Document Cloud businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $3.13 billion as of the end of Q1.
We're the leader in the exploding digital marketing category. In Q1, we achieved strong Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings with revenue of $377 million, which represents a 21% year-over-year increase. We continue to drive large-scale, multi-solution engagements with Marketing Cloud customers. Significant customer engagements in Q1 included RR Donnelly, Samsung Electronics, MGM Resorts International, Nissan, Workday and Goldman Sachs.
At Adobe, we are focused on product innovation, and Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions continue to garner accolades from industry analysts. Earlier this month, we were recognized by IDC as a Leader in its Worldwide Marketing Cloud Platforms Vendor Assessment. And Forrester Research recognized Adobe Analytics, the data and analytics backbone of Adobe Marketing Cloud, as a Leader in its Customer Analytics Solutions Wave report. In January, Gartner named Adobe as a Leader in the 2016 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs.
Adobe managed over 51 trillion customer data transactions through the Marketing Cloud over the past 4 quarters. And our Adobe Digital Index reports are increasingly being viewed as the source for reporting and predicting major retail and consumer trends. Yesterday, we launched our new Digital Economy Project, which includes 3 digital indicators of the U.S. economy: a digital price index, a housing index and a job-seeking index.
Next week, we will hold our Adobe Summit event in Las Vegas, and we're expecting record-breaking attendance, including hundreds of our partners and mainstage speakers from top brands, including Cirque du Soleil, McDonald's, Comedy Central, Mattel and Royal Bank of Scotland. Adobe Summit is the industry's leading digital marketing conference and the venue to learn where the industry is headed and see Adobe's latest technical advancements in mobile, video and data science.
For over 30 years, Adobe employees have demonstrated a sense of purpose and commitment to our communities, and we're proud of the recognition we received in Q1 as both an employer and a good corporate citizen. We were included as one of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations and were recognized as Fortune's Most Admired Company within the software category.
While Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud are all leaders in their respective categories, our true opportunity is in bringing these solutions together. We have been unwavering in our mission to use content and data to deliver world-class experiences to our customers, whether they're on the web, in an app, in a retail store or in a car.
Adobe is the only software company with deep history in content and vast data capabilities to deliver consistent, continuous and compelling experiences. We have a robust technology platform, a thriving ecosystem of partners and developers and a strong brand that has affinity worldwide with the world's largest enterprises, agencies, governments and educational institutions.
Our Q1 results demonstrate strong execution against this vast opportunity. Our market leadership, product differentiation and continued momentum give us confidence to raise our fiscal '16 revenue and earnings targets. Mark?"

Before I comment on Q1 results, as a reminder, 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year with a 14-week first quarter. This was factored into all of the targets we provided in December.In the first quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue",1379,"Thanks, Shantanu. Before I comment on Q1 results, as a reminder, 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year with a 14-week first quarter. This was factored into all of the targets we provided in December.
In the first quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,383,000,000, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. We estimate the extra week added approximately $75 million of revenue to the quarter, but this was mainly offset by a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue of approximately $69 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 were $0.50, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.66. These strong results reflect continued momentum across our Cloud businesses.
Highlights in our first quarter include: better-than-expected growth in Digital Media ARR, exiting the quarter with $3.13 billion; record Creative revenue of $733 million, which represents 44% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $377 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth; strong growth in operating and net income, with cash flow from operations of $498 million; and exiting Q1 with a record 81% of Q1 revenue as recurring.
In Digital Media, we grew Q1 segment revenue by 33% year-over-year and exited the quarter with Digital Media ARR of $3.13 billion. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $733 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 44%. We increased Creative ARR by $238 million during Q1.
Driving this strong performance was demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market, including the addition of 798,000 net new Creative Cloud subscriptions during the quarter. Migration continues to represent a large opportunity. Creative Cloud continues to distance itself from Creative Suite, and creatives are migrating as well as renewing at non-promotional pricing.
New customer adoption continues to increase our installed base. Creative Cloud mobile apps are driving new top-of-funnel traffic and first-time customer adoption. Market expansion is being driven by offerings such as the Creative Cloud Photography Plan, which targets photo enthusiasts. Value expansion with new services like Adobe Stock are increasing ARPU and ARR.
Our performance across all of these offerings and the health of the business is best reflected in ARR. Because of this, moving forward, we have decided to provide forward-looking quarterly ARR targets to help you better model the total business.
With respect to subscriptions, it has been our stated goal to attract tens of millions of customers at widely varying price points. We reviewed this strategy with you back in October at our analyst meeting. Creative Cloud Photography Plan was our first market expansion offering and has resulted in well over 1 million subscribers. New SKUs such as the recently announced K-12 education offering will make Creative cloud available to millions of students. And as we said at the analyst meeting, we are also considering a mobile-only offering. All of this further dilutes the relevance of the number of subscribers as a measure of the health of the business.
In addition, with respect to Acrobat, customers have been able to choose to subscribe to Acrobat either through Creative Cloud, which has been reflected as Creative Cloud subscriptions and Creative ARR, or via Document Cloud, which has been reflected in Document Cloud ARR. For all of these reasons, while we might choose to periodically report subscriptions, we no longer intend to provide actuals on a quarterly basis.
With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $199 million, with Document Cloud ARR exiting the quarter of $393 million. Adoption of our new Acrobat DC offering was strong in Q1, both through the perpetual offering as well as in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings on Adobe.com, all of which is captured in Digital Media ARR.
In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $377 million. We delivered strong bookings during the quarter, and both the revenue and bookings in Q1 put us on pace to achieve our annual targets of approximately 20% revenue growth and 30% bookings growth.
Other Marketing Cloud highlights in Q1 include: strong year-over-year revenue growth across all Marketing Cloud solutions; continued growth in multi-solution adoption by our biggest customers; and mobile data transactions grew to 49% of total Adobe Analytics transactions.
Our Digital Marketing segment revenue also includes LiveCycle and Connect, which declined as expected. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.5 million. We had $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '16 versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '15, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $7.6 million.
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $48.1 million. We had $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '16 versus $23.7 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '15, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $68.6 million.
In Q1, Adobe's effective tax rate was 13% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted, primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2015 R&D tax credit. Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 14,154 versus 13,893 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 42 days, which compares to 44 days in the year-ago quarter and 47 days last quarter.
Cash flow from operations was $498 million in the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $1.61 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.1 billion compared to $3.99 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of $133 million. We currently have $1.48 billion remaining under our latest repurchase authority granted in January 2015.
Now I will provide our financial outlook. When considering our targets for the second quarter of fiscal '16, it is important to remember that the first quarter had an extra week of revenue, which we estimate had an approximate benefit of $75 million. Based on Q2 being a standard 13-week quarter, we are targeting a second quarter revenue range of $1,365,000,000 to $1,415,000,000. In Digital Media, we expect to add approximately $275 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q2, with strong year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth.
In Digital Marketing, as we said in December, we expect Marketing Cloud quarterly year-over-year revenue growth will fluctuate below and above our annual FY '16 target of approximately 20% growth based on the amount of perpetual revenue achieved in the prior year-ago quarter. Given this, we are targeting approximately 17% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth in Q2 with continued momentum in bookings.
We expect our Q2 share count to be between 506 million to 508 million shares. We are targeting net nonoperating expense to be between $14 million and $16 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 23% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis.
These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.42 to $0.48 per share and a Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.64 to $0.70. Based on Q1 upside and the benefit of strong Digital Media ARR momentum, we are raising certain full year financial targets.
In Digital Media, we are increasing our Digital Media ARR exiting FY '16 to approximately $4 billion, which is above our prior target of approximately $3.875 billion. We are increasing our targeted revenue for the year to approximately $5.8 billion, up from our prior target of approximately $5.7 billion. FY '16 targeted EPS is now approximately $2 on a GAAP basis and approximately $2.80 on a non-GAAP basis. Our prior FY '16 EPS targets were approximately $1.80 on a GAAP basis and approximately $2.70 on a non-GAAP basis.
In terms of color for the rest of the year, in Q3, we expect a slight sequential increase in both total revenue and Digital Media ARR. We also expect Q3 Marketing Cloud revenue growth of less than 20% year-over-year due to the large amount of perpetual revenue in the year-ago quarter. In Q4, we expect seasonally strong sequential growth in both total revenue and Digital Media ARR. And we expect Q4 Marketing Cloud revenue growth greater than 20% year-over-year.
In summary, Q1 was a great start to what will be another strong year for Adobe. Mike?"

So big picture, what we are trying to do is make sure that in any setting that exists, that we have the right Creative products. Creative in the education season tends to be Q3. We certainly believe that there's tens of millions of creatives as they come into the market as part of the education segment. That's a growth for us. And that's part of the reason why in Mark's prepared remarks also, he talked about as we continue to offer our Creative products as a site license that we don't talk about subs. So it's going well. More and more people are using our Creative products. Internationally also, we are starting to have education be adopted. But big picture, we look at it and say whether it's a student-teacher single edition, whether it's an institution or whether it's a lab usage, we want to make sure that our offering is applicable in all of those settings."

The first is as it relates to revenue for Stock, during the quarter, it was in line with our expectations. So it's doing well. Again, just to refresh folks, we offer on-demand Stock as a way for people to buy particular stock assets. We certainly offer a Stock-only subscription, and we then offer a combined subscription, which allows people to both access Stock as well as our desktop products. And so across all of them, we're continuing to see accelerated usage of the Stock subscriptions. We don't break that out, Kash, in terms of what it is. And that's the reason we're focused on just continuing to make sure we gain market share in the Stock and deliver value. I think big picture, as we've always said, over 80% of the people who are buying or selling stock are using our products, and that's the opportunity. From a road map point of view, we look at integrating the Stock service more directly within our applications as a way to both increase awareness for our customers and to improve their workflows. So as the year progresses, we continue to expect to do better in Stock moving forward. So off to a good start, and it's early in the entire marketplace strategy for Adobe. And with respect to bookings, I think Mark also alluded to the fact that they were strong. We did not see any seasonal slowdown from Q4 to Q1 in terms of how we look at the business. And one of the things I should probably state is when you look at the Digital Marketing revenue for Q1, it's actually being driven primarily by the bookings that we had last year now translating into things getting live. There really wasn't much perpetual revenue in the quarter. So the good news is that marketing is all as a result of the strong bookings we experienced last year."

As you know, we are seeing increased growth in international markets where there was more piracy. The reality is we still haven't offered the Creative Cloud product in China as Creative Cloud. So all of that is upside for us in terms of combating piracy. There's so much opportunity in the developed markets. That's where we focus. So making progress and we continue to think, as we roll it out in other markets around the world, it's going to impact it.

But team did well. Team continues to do well. And so we're seeing strength. International, Japan and Germany that we've identified as areas for growth are growing nicely. There still is a significant opportunity there to migrate existing customers and attract new customers. So I would say those markets are a couple of years behind, but we haven't seen any slowdown in the U.S. yet."

And since that was the last question, I mean, just a couple of comments. As I'm traveling around the world, meeting both customers and partners, it's really clear that consumer expectations and what's happening with technology is causing every business to rethink how they interact with customers. And I think that's a digital-first strategy right now for every one of them.
From our point of view, that great experience starts with great content. We're clearly the company that's helping bringing their concepts to life for creatives. And Creative Cloud's clearly the one-stop shop for these customers, providing everything from inspiration to monetization.
I think the other thing we see is delivering that experience to the right person at the right time requires a technology platform that deals with large volumes of content and data but more importantly, with the right intelligence. And that's the goal of the Adobe Marketing Cloud.
All of these are tailwinds we see now benefiting our businesses. And I think in Q1, we saw strength across Creative Cloud adoption and ARR growth, DC and Acrobat adoption as well as strong bookings and revenue and implementations that are going live with the Adobe Marketing Cloud. And that's the reason why our Q1 upside and Q2 outlook give us confidence to raise the revenue as well as earnings target.
We think we're in great shape. We remain focused on driving innovation and strong financial results. And I want to thank our customers and partners worldwide for their ongoing commitment and to our employees for continuing to drive innovation in our industry.
We hope to see you folks next week at Summit, and otherwise, we look forward to our next call. Thank you for joining us today."

In Q2, Adobe delivered another record quarter, reporting revenue of $1.4 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.71, our momentum as a result of the continuous delivery of breakthrough product innovation across each of our 3 cloud offerings. We advanced our strategy of enabling the world's biggest brands, governments and educational institutions to develop well-designed, data-led and personalized digital experiences to their customers across every channel.
In our digital media segment, we exited Q2 with $3.41 billion of annualized recurring revenue, a net increase of $285 million. We exceeded our ARR target as a result of continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. 
Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creators from inspiration to monetization. Q2 ARR performance was driven by strong demand across all offerings, routes to market and geographies. We continue to execute against our strategy of migrating CS customers, expanding into new market segments and adding value by introducing new services.
In addition to continued strength on Adobe.com, we were particularly pleased with the strength of renewals of enterprise term license agreements, which drove an increase in enterprise ARPU.
Creative Cloud innovation continues at a pace. Our goal is to make the creative process more fun, seamless and efficient for creators, enabling them to go from a blank page to a brilliant composition in record time. We announced a major Creative Cloud update today that includes new features in flagship applications like Content-Aware crop in Photoshop, performance enhancements in cross-product capabilities like CreativeSync and a significant update to Adobe Stock, which now includes a premium collection of stock content and deeper integration within the CC desktop and mobile applications. We believe this innovation will promote migration and enhance retention.
We continue to introduce new applications to target new design categories. Adobe XD, our solution for user interface design, has already garnered more than 200,000 downloads as a preview release. In addition to delivering cutting-edge innovation for use by professionals, we're excited about the broader opportunity to enable anybody with an idea to create and share high-impact visual stories. Adobe Spark was introduced in May to address this need and enables students and consumers to create professional quality, social post, web stories and animated video in minutes. 
Adobe Document Cloud, the leading digital document service, enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes into 100% digital workflows. Net new Document Cloud ARR grew quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating the continued momentum of this business. Document Cloud revenue was $188 million in Q2, and we exited the quarter with $415 million of Document Cloud ARR.
Cross-cloud integration remains a high priority for Adobe. In April, we announced the first integration between Adobe Sign and Adobe Experience Manager, eliminating the cost and frustration of manual paper-based processes for enrollment, onboarding and servicing across the customer journey. We announced new Document Cloud storage integrations with Box and Microsoft OneDrive to seamlessly and securely connect workflows across enterprise content collaboration platforms.
In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud remains the leader in the emerging high-growth customer experience category. Through our unique combination of content and data, Adobe Marketing Cloud enables businesses to deliver highly personalized digital experiences across devices and digital channels. Adobe Marketing Cloud customer retention remains high, and we continue to drive adoption of multiple solutions by our customers. Q2 customer wins include Southwest Airlines, eBay, the NFL, FedEx, American Red Cross, Logitech and Singapore Workforce Development Agency.
In Q2, we had record attendance at Adobe Summit events in Las Vegas and London as well as Symposia in Mumbai and New York. We unveiled the next-generation Adobe Marketing Cloud, shared our Adobe Cloud platform roadmap and announced the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Coop, a network that will enable the world's biggest brands to work together to better identify consumers across digital devices. A key takeaway from these customer events was the strong growth of partners and developers who are building vertical applications on our platform.
In March, we announced Adobe Primetime over-the-top capabilities that make it easy for TV networks and pay-TV providers to bring more personalized TV and add experiences directly to consumers via Apple TV, Microsoft Xbox, Roku and other connected devices. In May, we introduced expanded virtual reality and augmented reality capabilities within Adobe Primetime with ad insertion, digital rights management and playback.
In May, we acquired Livefyre, a social content curation company. Livefyre will continue to be available as a standalone service and will be integrated within Adobe Experience Manager. With this integration, customers will be able to collect, curate and publish user-generated content from major social networks into digital experiences across their own marketing channels. 
Based on these announcements, innovation and momentum, industry analysts continue to recognize Adobe's Marketing Cloud solutions as market leaders in their respective categories. In Q2, Adobe's Campaign Solution was named the leader by both Gartner and Forrester Research in their 2016 Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management and the 2016 Cross-channel Campaign Management Wave Reports, respectively. 
Last week, Gartner named Adobe as a leader in its 2016 Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms Report. Finally, Forrester Research recognized Adobe as a leader in its 2016 Enterprise Marketing Software Suites Wave Report, where we once again received the highest scores for our overall Adobe Marketing Cloud offering and strategy.
In Q2, Adobe Marketing Cloud managed nearly 19 trillion customer data transactions for our customers, reinforcing Adobe as the leading big data company in Digital Marketing. With unique insights from this data, we launched our new Digital Economy Project in March, which has quickly garnered broad attention as a critical indicator for the U.S. digital economy. The monthly report includes a digital price index, a housing index and a jobseeking index.
Dealing with digital disruption is the main concern we hear about in every meeting we have with business, education and government leaders the world over. A key strategy for dealing with this disruption is to deliver a compelling digital experience which is the new basis for customer satisfaction, loyalty and growth.
This business imperative creates great opportunity for Adobe, and we're the only company that helps with every stage of a digital experience from creation through monetization. With another strong quarter behind us, we continue to be bullish about our growth prospects. Mark?"

In the second quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,399,000,000, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.48 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.71. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our targeted range, GAAP earnings were at the high end of our targeted range and non-GAAP earnings were above our targeted range. These strong results reflect continued momentum across our business.
Highlights in our second quarter include: strong growth in Digital Media ARR, which reflects the overall health of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses; record Creative revenue of $755 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $385 million, which represents 18% [ph] year-over-year growth; strong growth in operating and net income, with cash flow from operations of $489 million; and 81% of Q2 revenue was from recurring sources.
In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 26% year-over-year. More importantly, we exceeded our Q2 target for Digital Media ARR. We added $285 million during the quarter and exited Q2 with $3.41 billion. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $755 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 37%. We increased Creative ARR by $263 million during Q2.
Driving this momentum was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions. Retention rates remain consistent with prior periods. 
We continue to execute well against our key Creative Cloud opportunities: growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users and growing our installed base in the education market; driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the Photography Plan, and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to drive new member adoption; and achieving higher ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock, where revenue has grown sequentially over each of the past 3 quarters.
With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $188 million, which was in line with our expectations. In addition, Document Cloud ARR exiting Q2 grew to $415 million, which represents higher quarter-over-quarter growth when compared to Q1. We continued to drive adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, which is benefiting ARR and building a foundation for growth in the future.
In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $385 million, driven by multi-solution adoption. We achieved another strong quarter with Adobe Campaign, and Adobe AudienceManager is becoming a strategic asset as our customers are increasingly utilizing data to enhance their Digital Marketing programs to deliver personalized engaging experiences. In Q2, for the first time, mobile transactions grew to 50% of total Adobe Analytics transactions.
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $5.2 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '16 versus $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '16, thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $5.6 million.
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $21.7 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '16 versus $22.2 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '15, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $40.3 million. 
In Q2, Adobe's effective tax rate was 26% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP tax rate was higher than expected, primarily due to the acquisition of Livefyre.
Our trade DSO was 43 days, which compares to 39 days in the year-ago quarter and 42 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $489 million in the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $1.68 billion, up 37% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.32 billion compared to $4.1 billion at the end of Q1. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at a cost of $205 million. We currently have $1.2 billion remaining under our current authority granted January 2015.
I'll now provide our financial outlook. Based on our strong first half performance and business momentum, we expect to meet or exceed our FY '16 annual targets, which we raised in March. We expect the second half of the year to play out as we outlined in our Q1 call.
We are targeting a third quarter revenue range of $1,420,000,000 to $1,470,000,000. In Digital Media, we expect to add approximately $285 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q3, with strong year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth.
In Digital Marketing, we expect continued momentum in bookings and approximately 7% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth in Q3, factoring in the strong perpetual revenue in the year-ago quarter. 
We are targeting our Q3 share count to be between 504 million to 506 million shares. We expect net nonoperating expense to be between $11 million and $13 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q3 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q3 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.46 to $0.52 per share and a Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.69 to $0.75.
In summary, Q2 was another solid quarter for Adobe, and we look forward to our momentum continuing in the second half of fiscal 2016. Mike?"

Now we are seeing services as part of it. So the enterprise continues to be an opportunity. International, to your point, also continues to be an opportunity. We've always highlighted Japan and Germany, which are continuing to show progress against the migration goals that we have as well as new customer acquisition. Education also continues to be an area where we're seeing interest in the Creative Suite. And I think if you see some of the announcements we made today, whether it was the new product in XD, adding virtual-reality to premiere, things that we're doing with touch, there's just so much innovation possible. I think the core elements of migrating existing customers, adding new customers and adding new services, we continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead of us.

I think both of those relate to the big picture question of how are we making progress of migrating from individual solutions to customers adopting our entire Digital Marketing platform. I think the big 3 as it relates to solution revenue continue to be the Adobe Analytics, the Adobe Experience Manager as well as the Adobe Campaign Solutions. But I think what's really exciting about Adobe AudienceManager is that it's one of the core services that's helping integrate all of these other 3 products into a more meaningful offering to marketers and Chief Revenue and Chief Digital Officers. And the traction that we're seeing with that, I think, reflects the growing trend in the industry where people don't want to buy individual solutions but they want to buy an entire platform that they can deploy and see the benefit of it easily. So I think that's the reason to highlight the success that we're seeing with AudienceManager as a core service. And with respect to your second question, I mean, we're continuing to clearly see that the multiproduct solutions are being adopted, and that will continue to be our focus and delivery."

I think those numbers still show significant headroom relative to where we are today. So I think that's a good metric for you to look at. I think with enterprise ETLAs, 3 years ago, when we started this move of having enterprise customers license our software rather than buy it outright, we were just starting on this journey and it was nice as those 3-year terms are coming up to see that there's actually a fairly nice upsell associated with that. People are now adopting the entire Creative Cloud they may have only had single applications there and are adopting services. So we certainly will continue to focus on that trend of driving significant upsell as people come up for retention and demonstrating the value. So we're pleased with it. And certainly, from an execution point of view, we're going to focus on continuing to drive that over the next few years."

And in Digital Marketing, we continue to be the leader in this explosive customer experience category. I think most important though for me, we continue to innovate in our major businesses.

In Q2, Adobe delivered another record quarter, reporting revenue of $1.4 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.71. 
Our momentum is a result of the continuous delivery of breakthrough product innovation across each of our 3 cloud offerings. We advanced our strategy of enabling the world's biggest brands, governments and educational institutions to develop well-designed, data-led and personalized digital experiences to their customers across every channel.
In our Digital Media segment, we exited Q2 with $3.41 billion of annualized recurring revenue, a net increase of $285 million. We exceeded our ARR target as a result of continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. 
Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creators from inspiration to monetization. Q2 ARR performance was driven by strong demand across all offerings, routes to market and geographies. We continue to execute against our strategy of migrating CS customers, expanding into new market segments and adding value by introducing new services.
In addition to continued strength on Adobe.com, we were particularly pleased with the strength of renewals of enterprise term license agreements, which drove an increase in enterprise ARPU.
Creative Cloud innovation continues at a torrid pace. Our goal is to make the creative process more fun, seamless and efficient for creators, enabling them to go from a blank page to a brilliant composition in record time. 
We announced a major Creative Cloud update today that includes new features in flagship applications like Content-Aware Crop in Photoshop, performance enhancements in cross-product capabilities like CreativeSync  and a significant update to Adobe Stock, which now includes a premium collection of stock content and deeper integration within the CC desktop and mobile applications. We believe this innovation will promote migration and enhance retention.
We continue to introduce new applications to target new design categories. Adobe XD, our solution for user interface design, has already garnered more than 200,000 downloads as a preview release. 
In addition to delivering cutting-edge innovation for use by professionals, we're excited about the broader opportunity to enable anybody with an idea to create and share high-impact visual stories. Adobe Spark was introduced in May to address this need, and enables students and consumers to create professional quality, social posts, web stories and animated video in minutes. 
Adobe Document Cloud, the leading digital document service, enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes into 100% digital workflows. Net new Document Cloud ARR grew quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating the continued momentum of this business. Document Cloud revenue was $188 million in Q2, and we exited the quarter with $415 million of Document Cloud ARR.
Cross-cloud integration remains a high priority for Adobe. In April, we announced the first integration between Adobe Sign and Adobe Experience Manager, eliminating the cost and frustration of manual paper-based processes for enrollment, onboarding and servicing across the customer journey. We announced new Document Cloud storage integrations with Box and Microsoft OneDrive to seamlessly and securely connect workflows across enterprise content collaboration platforms.
In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud remains the leader in the emerging high-growth customer experience category. Through our unique combination of content and data, Adobe Marketing Cloud enables businesses to deliver highly personalized digital experiences across devices and digital channels. Adobe Marketing Cloud customer retention remains high, and we continue to drive adoption of multiple solutions by our customers. Q2 customer wins include Southwest Airlines, eBay, the NFL, FedEx, American Red Cross, Logitech and Singapore Workforce Development Agency.
In Q2, we had record attendance at Adobe Summit events in Las Vegas and London as well as Symposia in Mumbai and New York. We unveiled the next-generation Adobe Marketing Cloud, shared our Adobe Cloud platform roadmap and announced the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op, a network that will enable the world's biggest brands to work together to better identify consumers across digital devices. 
A key takeaway from these customer events was the strong growth of partners and developers who are building vertical applications on our platform.
In March, we announced Adobe Primetime over-the-top capabilities that make it easy for TV networks and pay-TV  providers to bring more personalized TV and add experiences directly to consumers via Apple TV, Microsoft Xbox, Roku and other connected devices. In May, we introduced expanded virtual reality and augmented reality capabilities within Adobe Primetime, with ad insertion, digital rights management and playback.
In May, we acquired Livefyre, a social content curation company. Livefyre will continue to be available as a standalone service and will be integrated within Adobe Experience Manager. With this integration, customers will be able to collect, curate and publish user-generated content from major social networks into digital experiences across their own marketing channels. 
Based on these announcements, innovation and momentum, industry analysts continue to recognize Adobe's Marketing Cloud solutions as market leaders in their respective categories. In Q2, Adobe's Campaign solution was named the leader by both Gartner and Forrester Research in their 2016 Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management and the 2016 Cross-Channel Campaign Management Wave reports, respectively. 
Last week, Gartner named Adobe as a leader in its 2016 Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms report. Finally, Forrester Research recognized Adobe as a leader in its 2016 Enterprise Marketing Software Suites Wave report, where we once again received the highest scores for our overall Adobe Marketing Cloud offering and strategy.
In Q2, Adobe Marketing Cloud managed nearly 19 trillion customer data transactions for our customers, reinforcing Adobe as the leading big data company in digital marketing. With unique insights from this data, we launched our new Digital Economy Project in March, which has quickly garnered broad attention as a critical indicator for the U.S. digital economy. The monthly report includes a digital price index, a housing index and a jobseeking index.
Dealing with digital disruption is the main concern we hear about in every meeting we have with business, education and government leaders the world over. A key strategy for dealing with this disruption is to deliver a compelling digital experience, which is the new basis for customer satisfaction, loyalty and growth.
This business imperative creates great opportunity for Adobe, and we're the only company that helps with every stage of a digital experience from creation through monetization. With another strong quarter behind us, we continue to be bullish about our growth prospects. Mark?"

In the second quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,399,000,000, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.48 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.71. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our targeted range, GAAP earnings were at the high end of our targeted range and non-GAAP earnings were above our targeted range. These strong results reflect continued momentum across our business.
Highlights in our second quarter include: strong growth in Digital Media ARR, which reflects the overall health of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses; record Creative revenue of $755 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $385 million, which represents 18% year-over-year growth; strong growth in operating and net income, with cash flow from operations of $489 million; and 81% of Q2 revenue was from recurring sources.
In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 26% year-over-year. More importantly, we exceeded our Q2 target for Digital Media ARR. We added $285 million during the quarter and exited Q2 with $3.41 billion. 
Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $755 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 37%. We increased Creative ARR by $263 million during Q2.
Driving this momentum was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions. Retention rates remain consistent with prior periods. 
We continue to execute well against our key Creative Cloud opportunities: growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users and growing our installed base in the education market; driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the Photography Plan, and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to drive new member adoption; and achieving higher ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock, where revenue has grown sequentially over each of the past 3 quarters.
With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $188 million, which was in line with our expectations. In addition, Document Cloud ARR exiting Q2 grew to $415 million, which represents higher quarter-over-quarter growth when compared to Q1. We continued to drive adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, which is benefiting ARR and building a foundation for growth in the future.
In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $385 million, driven by multi-solution adoption. We achieved another strong quarter with Adobe Campaign, and Adobe AudienceManager is becoming a strategic asset as our customers are increasingly utilizing data to enhance their Digital Marketing programs to deliver personalized, engaging experiences. In Q2, for the first time, mobile transactions grew to 50% of total Adobe Analytics transactions.
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $5.2 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '16 versus $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '16, thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $5.6 million.
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $21.7 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '16 versus $22.2 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '15, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $40.3 million. 
In Q2, Adobe's effective tax rate was 26% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP tax rate was higher than expected primarily due to the acquisition of Livefyre.
Our trade DSO was 43 days, which compares to 39 days in the year ago quarter and 42 days last quarter. 
Cash flow from operations was $489 million in the quarter. 
Deferred revenue grew to $1.68 billion, up 37% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.32 billion compared to $4.1 billion at the end of Q1. 
In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at a cost of $205 million. We currently have $1.2 billion remaining under our current authority granted January 2015.
I'll now provide our financial outlook. Based on our strong first half performance and business momentum, we expect to meet or exceed our FY '16 annual targets, which we raised in March. We expect the second half of the year to play out as we outlined in our Q1 call.
We are targeting a third quarter revenue range of $1,420,000,000 to $1,470,000,000. In Digital Media, we expect to add approximately $285 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q3, with strong year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth.
In Digital Marketing, we expect continued momentum in bookings and approximately 7% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth in Q3, factoring in the strong perpetual revenue in the year ago quarter. 
We are targeting our Q3 share count to be between 504 million to 506 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be between $11 million and $13 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q3 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q3 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.46 to $0.52 per share and a Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.69 to $0.75.
In summary, Q2 was another solid quarter for Adobe, and we look forward to our momentum continuing in the second half of fiscal 2016. Mike?"

But this next quarter, even when you adjust for some of that deal that fell into 3Q last year, which I understand is quite a little bit of a tougher comp, it seems like that gap between bookings in that segment and sort of revenue growth still isn't closing perhaps as fast as one might be thinking. So can you just walk through that if there's changes in terms of implementation times are taking longer so there's some issue there, or if you have longer deals that are -- can span over say 6 quarters versus 4. I'm just kind of getting -- I want to get a sense of when do we start to see the inflection in the revenue growth for that business come back and align a little bit closer with the bookings terms."

So there's no change. There's no change in implementations or any of the other factors that you mentioned. It's really just how the quarters play out relative to perpetual last year."

And I think I highlighted in particular, as the 3-year ETLAs are now all coming up for renewal, the first time around, we had actually done a lot of the ETLAs as sort of custom deals. Now we are seeing services as part of it. So the enterprise continues to be an opportunity. International, to your point, also continues to be an opportunity. We've always highlighted Japan and Germany, which are continuing to show progress against the migration goals that we have as well as new customer acquisition. Education also continues to be an area where we're seeing interest in the Creative Suite. And I think if you see some of the announcements we made today, whether it was the new product in XD, adding virtual reality to premiere, things that we're doing with touch, there's just so much innovation possible. I think the core elements of migrating existing customers, adding new customers and adding new services, we continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead of us.

The second area is in the cross-integration between Adobe Sign as well as AEM forms, thereby allowing people to automate their inefficient paper-based processes. And the third area of cross-cloud integration and selling that we're doing is in the Creative Cloud enterprise offering, where people both have access to all of the Creative Cloud desktop applications as well as asset management through our Digital Marketing solutions to improve their content velocity. So those are the 3 areas where we're continuing to both see traction from our customers, cross-sell into those specific accounts and continue with innovation on an integration."

I think both of those relate to the big picture question of how are we making progress of migrating from individual solutions to customers adopting our entire Digital Marketing platform?

But I think what's really exciting about Adobe AudienceManager is that it's one of the core services that's helping integrate all of these other 3 products into a more meaningful offering to marketers and Chief Revenue and Chief Digital Officers. And the traction that we are seeing with that, I think, reflects the growing trend in the industry, where people don't want to buy individual solutions but they want to buy an entire platform that they can deploy and see the benefit of it easily.

And I think those numbers still show significant headroom relative to where we are today. So I think that's a good metric for you to look at. I think with enterprise ETLAs, 3 years ago, when we started this move of having enterprise customers license our software rather than buy it outright, we were just starting on this journey and it was nice as those 3-year terms are coming up to see that there's actually a fairly nice upsell associated with that. People are now adopting the entire Creative Cloud. They may have only had single applications there and are adopting services. So we certainly will continue to focus on that trend of driving significant upsell as people come up for retention and demonstrating the value. So we're pleased with it.

In Q2, Adobe delivered another record quarter, reporting revenue of $1.4 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.71. 
Our momentum is a result of the continuous delivery of breakthrough product innovation across each of our 3 cloud offerings. We advanced our strategy of enabling the world's biggest brands, governments and educational institutions to develop well-designed, data-led and personalized digital experiences to their customers across every channel.
In our Digital Media segment, we exited Q2 with $3.41 billion of annualized recurring revenue, a net increase of $285 million. We exceeded our ARR target as a result of continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. 
Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creators from inspiration to monetization. Q2 ARR performance was driven by strong demand across all offerings, routes to market and geographies. We continue to execute against our strategy of migrating CS customers, expanding into new market segments and adding value by introducing new services.
In addition to continued strength on Adobe.com, we were particularly pleased with the strength of renewals of enterprise term license agreements, which drove an increase in enterprise ARPU.
Creative Cloud innovation continues at a torrid pace. Our goal is to make the creative process more fun, seamless and efficient for creators, enabling them to go from a blank page to a brilliant composition in record time. 
We announced a major Creative Cloud update today that includes new features in flagship applications like Content-Aware Crop in Photoshop, performance enhancements in cross-product capabilities like CreativeSync and a significant update to Adobe Stock, which now includes a premium collection of stock content and deeper integration within the CC desktop and mobile applications. We believe this innovation will promote migration and enhance retention.
We continue to introduce new applications to target new design categories. Adobe XD, our solution for user interface design, has already garnered more than 200,000 downloads as a preview release. 
In addition to delivering cutting-edge innovation for use by professionals, we're excited about the broader opportunity to enable anybody with an idea to create and share high-impact visual stories. Adobe Spark was introduced in May to address this need, and enables students and consumers to create professional-quality social posts, web stories and animated video in minutes. 
Adobe Document Cloud, the leading digital document service, enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes into 100% digital workflows. Net new Document Cloud ARR grew quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating the continued momentum of this business. Document Cloud revenue was $188 million in Q2, and we exited the quarter with $415 million of Document Cloud ARR.
Cross-cloud integration remains a high priority for Adobe. In April, we announced the first integration between Adobe Sign and Adobe Experience Manager, eliminating the cost and frustration of manual paper-based processes for enrollment, onboarding and servicing across the customer journey. We announced new Document Cloud storage integrations with Box and Microsoft OneDrive to seamlessly and securely connect workflows across enterprise content collaboration platforms.
In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud remains the leader in the emerging high-growth customer experience category. Through our unique combination of content and data, Adobe Marketing Cloud enables businesses to deliver highly personalized digital experiences across devices and digital channels. Adobe Marketing Cloud customer retention remains high, and we continue to drive adoption of multiple solutions by our customers. Q2 customer wins include Southwest Airlines, eBay, the NFL, FedEx, American Red Cross, Logitech and Singapore Workforce Development Agency.
In Q2, we had record attendance at Adobe Summit events in Las Vegas and London as well as Symposia in Mumbai and New York. We unveiled the next-generation Adobe Marketing Cloud, shared our Adobe Cloud platform roadmap and announced the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op, a network that will enable the world's biggest brands to work together to better identify consumers across digital devices. 
A key takeaway from these customer events was the strong growth of partners and developers who are building vertical applications on our platform.
In March, we announced Adobe Primetime over-the-top capabilities that make it easy for TV networks and pay-TV providers to bring more personalized TV and add experiences directly to consumers via Apple TV, Microsoft Xbox, Roku and other connected devices. In May, we introduced expanded virtual reality and augmented reality capabilities within Adobe Primetime, with ad insertion, digital rights management and playback.
In May, we acquired Livefyre, a social content curation company. Livefyre will continue to be available as a standalone service and will be integrated within Adobe Experience Manager. With this integration, customers will be able to collect, curate and publish user-generated content from major social networks into digital experiences across their own marketing channels. 
Based on these announcements, innovation and momentum, industry analysts continue to recognize Adobe's Marketing Cloud solutions as market leaders in their respective categories. In Q2, Adobe's Campaign solution was named a leader by both Gartner and Forrester Research in their 2016 Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management and the 2016 Cross-Channel Campaign Management Wave reports, respectively. 
Last week, Gartner named Adobe as a leader in its 2016 Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms report. Finally, Forrester Research recognized Adobe as a leader in its 2016 Enterprise Marketing Software Suites Wave report, where we once again received the highest scores for our overall Adobe Marketing Cloud offering and strategy.
In Q2, Adobe Marketing Cloud managed nearly 19 trillion customer data transactions for our customers, reinforcing Adobe as the leading big data company in digital marketing. With unique insights from this data, we launched our new Digital Economy Project in March, which has quickly garnered broad attention as a critical indicator for the U.S. digital economy. The monthly report includes a digital price index, a housing index and a job seeking index.
Dealing with digital disruption is the main concern we hear about in every meeting we have with business, education and government leaders the world over. A key strategy for dealing with this disruption is to deliver a compelling digital experience, which is the new basis for customer satisfaction, loyalty and growth.
This business imperative creates great opportunity for Adobe, and we're the only company that helps with every stage of a digital experience from creation through monetization. With another strong quarter behind us, we continue to be bullish about our growth prospects. Mark?"

In the second quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,399,000,000, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.48 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.71. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our targeted range, GAAP earnings were at the high end of our targeted range and non-GAAP earnings were above our targeted range. These strong results reflect continued momentum across our business.
Highlights in our second quarter include: strong growth in Digital Media ARR, which reflects the overall health of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses; record Creative revenue of $755 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $385 million, which represents 18% year-over-year growth; strong growth in operating and net income, with cash flow from operations of $489 million; and 81% of Q2 revenue was from recurring sources.
In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 26% year-over-year. More importantly, we exceeded our Q2 target for Digital Media ARR. We added $285 million during the quarter and exited Q2 with $3.41 billion. 
Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $755 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 37%. We increased Creative ARR by $263 million during Q2.
Driving this momentum was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions. Retention rates remain consistent with prior periods. 
We continue to execute well against our key Creative Cloud opportunities: growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users and growing our installed base in the education market; driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the Photography Plan, and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to drive new member adoption; and achieving higher ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock, where revenue has grown sequentially over each of the past 3 quarters.
With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $188 million, which was in line with our expectations. In addition, Document Cloud ARR exiting Q2 grew to $415 million, which represents higher quarter-over-quarter growth when compared to Q1. We continued to drive adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, which is benefiting ARR and building a foundation for growth in the future.
In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $385 million, driven by multi-solution adoption. We achieved another strong quarter with Adobe Campaign, and Adobe AudienceManager is becoming a strategic asset as our customers are increasingly utilizing data to enhance their Digital Marketing programs to deliver personalized, engaging experiences. In Q2, for the first time, mobile transactions grew to 50% of total Adobe Analytics transactions.
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $5.2 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '16 versus $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '16, thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $5.6 million.
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $21.7 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '16 versus $22.2 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '15, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $40.3 million. 
In Q2, Adobe's effective tax rate was 26% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP tax rate was higher than expected primarily due to the acquisition of Livefyre.
Our trade DSO was 43 days, which compares to 39 days in the year ago quarter and 42 days last quarter. 
Cash flow from operations was $489 million in the quarter. 
Deferred revenue grew to $1.68 billion, up 37% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.32 billion compared to $4.1 billion at the end of Q1. 
In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at a cost of $205 million. We currently have $1.2 billion remaining under our current authority granted January 2015.
I'll now provide our financial outlook. Based on our strong first half performance and business momentum, we expect to meet or exceed our FY '16 annual targets, which we raised in March. We expect the second half of the year to play out as we outlined in our Q1 call.
We are targeting a third quarter revenue range of $1,420,000,000 to $1,470,000,000. In Digital Media, we expect to add approximately $285 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q3, with strong year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth.
In Digital Marketing, we expect continued momentum in bookings and approximately 7% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth in Q3, factoring in the strong perpetual revenue in the year ago quarter. 
We are targeting our Q3 share count to be between 504 million to 506 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be between $11 million and $13 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q3 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q3 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.46 to $0.52 per share and a Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.69 to $0.75.
In summary, Q2 was another solid quarter for Adobe, and we look forward to our momentum continuing in the second half of fiscal 2016. Mike?"

I realized that there's been some, I guess, changes in sort of how the rev rec has been going, given the shift from perpetual to more subscription-based rev rec. But this next quarter, even when you adjust for some of that deal that fell into 3Q last year, which I understand creates a little bit of a tougher comp, it seems like that gap between bookings in that segment and sort of revenue growth still isn't closing perhaps as fast as one might be thinking. So can you just walk through that if there's changes in terms of implementation times or taking longer so there's some issue there, or you have longer deals that are being spread out over say 6 quarters versus 4. I'm just kind of getting -- I just want to get a sense of when do we start to see the inflection in the revenue growth in that business come back and align a little bit closer with the bookings trends."

So as you pointed out, in Q3 of last year, we did have an unusual amount of perpetual revenue. In fact, if you normalized last year for that perpetual revenue that was kind of above and beyond, the growth this year would have been somewhere in the 20% area. So that is the reason why you're seeing 7% instead of what would have normally been something like 20%. We're still on a path to do 20% for the year, which is what we guided to quite a while ago. So there's no change. There's no change in implementations or any of the other factors that you mentioned. It's really just how the quarters play out relative to perpetual last year."

From the point of view of color, we said that we actually saw strength across all of the offerings as well as all of the geographies. And I think I highlighted in particular, as the 3-year ETLAs are now all coming up for renewal, the first time around, we had actually done a lot of the ETLAs as sort of custom deals. Now we are seeing services as part of it. So the enterprise continues to be an opportunity. International, to your point, also continues to be an opportunity. We've always highlighted Japan and Germany, which are continuing to show progress against the migration goals that we have as well as new customer acquisition. Education also continues to be an area where we're seeing interest in the Creative Suite. And I think if you see some of the announcements we made today, whether it was the new product in XD, adding virtual reality to premiere, things that we're doing with touch, there's just so much innovation possible. I think the core elements of migrating existing customers, adding new customers and adding new services, we continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead of us.

So it's leading to both revenue as well as ARPU and ARR."

That's where it goes. To the extent that in any given quarter, we don't need it and we don't have a responsible place to put it, we're going to give it back to shareholders.

But I think what's really exciting about Adobe AudienceManager is that it's one of the core services that's helping integrate all of these other 3 products into a more meaningful offering to marketers and Chief Revenue and Chief Digital Officers. And the traction that we are seeing with that, I think, reflects the growing trend in the industry, where people don't want to buy individual solutions but they want to buy an entire platform that they can deploy and see the benefit of it easily.

And I think those numbers still show significant headroom relative to where we are today. So I think that's a good metric for you to look at. I think with enterprise ETLAs, 3 years ago, when we started this move of having enterprise customers license our software rather than buy it outright, we were just starting on this journey and it was nice as those 3-year terms are coming up to see that there's actually a fairly nice upsell associated with that. People are now adopting the entire Creative Cloud. They may have only had single applications there and are adopting services.

In Q2, Adobe delivered another record quarter, reporting revenue of $1.4 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.71. 
Our momentum is a result of the continuous delivery of breakthrough product innovation across each of our 3 cloud offerings. We advanced our strategy of enabling the world's biggest brands, governments and educational institutions to develop well-designed, data-led and personalized digital experiences to their customers across every channel.
In our Digital Media segment, we exited Q2 with $3.41 billion of annualized recurring revenue, a net increase of $285 million. We exceeded our ARR target as a result of continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. 
Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creators from inspiration to monetization. Q2 ARR performance was driven by strong demand across all offerings, routes to market and geographies. We continue to execute against our strategy of migrating CS customers, expanding into new market segments and adding value by introducing new services.
In addition to continued strength on Adobe.com, we were particularly pleased with the strength of renewals of enterprise term license agreements, which drove an increase in enterprise ARPU.
Creative Cloud innovation continues at a torrid pace. Our goal is to make the creative process more fun, seamless and efficient for creators, enabling them to go from a blank page to a brilliant composition in record time. 
We announced a major Creative Cloud update today that includes new features in flagship applications like Content-Aware Crop in Photoshop, performance enhancements in cross-product capabilities like CreativeSync and a significant update to Adobe Stock, which now includes a premium collection of stock content and deeper integration within the CC desktop and mobile applications. We believe this innovation will promote migration and enhance retention.
We continue to introduce new applications to target new design categories. Adobe XD, our solution for user interface design, has already garnered more than 200,000 downloads as a preview release. 
In addition to delivering cutting-edge innovation for use by professionals, we're excited about the broader opportunity to enable anybody with an idea to create and share high-impact visual stories. Adobe Spark was introduced in May to address this need, and enables students and consumers to create professional-quality social posts, web stories and animated video in minutes. 
Adobe Document Cloud, the leading digital document service, enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes into 100% digital workflows. Net new Document Cloud ARR grew quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating the continued momentum of this business. Document Cloud revenue was $188 million in Q2, and we exited the quarter with $415 million of Document Cloud ARR.
Cross-cloud integration remains a high priority for Adobe. In April, we announced the first integration between Adobe Sign and Adobe Experience Manager, eliminating the cost and frustration of manual paper-based processes for enrollment, onboarding and servicing across the customer journey. We announced new Document Cloud storage integrations with Box and Microsoft OneDrive to seamlessly and securely connect workflows across enterprise content collaboration platforms.
In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud remains the leader in the emerging high-growth customer experience category. Through our unique combination of content and data, Adobe Marketing Cloud enables businesses to deliver highly personalized digital experiences across devices and digital channels. Adobe Marketing Cloud customer retention remains high, and we continue to drive adoption of multiple solutions by our customers. Q2 customer wins include Southwest Airlines, eBay, the NFL, FedEx, American Red Cross, Logitech and Singapore Workforce Development Agency.
In Q2, we had record attendance at Adobe Summit events in Las Vegas and London as well as Symposia in Mumbai and New York. We unveiled the next-generation Adobe Marketing Cloud, shared our Adobe Cloud platform roadmap and announced the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op, a network that will enable the world's biggest brands to work together to better identify consumers across digital devices. 
A key takeaway from these customer events was the strong growth of partners and developers who are building vertical applications on our platform.
In March, we announced Adobe Primetime over-the-top capabilities that make it easy for TV networks and pay-TV providers to bring more personalized TV and add experiences directly to consumers via Apple TV, Microsoft Xbox, Roku and other connected devices. In May, we introduced expanded virtual reality and augmented reality capabilities within Adobe Primetime, with ad insertion, digital rights management and playback.
In May, we acquired Livefyre, a social content curation company. Livefyre will continue to be available as a standalone service and will be integrated within Adobe Experience Manager. With this integration, customers will be able to collect, curate and publish user-generated content from major social networks into digital experiences across their own marketing channels. 
Based on these announcements, innovation and momentum, industry analysts continue to recognize Adobe's Marketing Cloud solutions as market leaders in their respective categories. In Q2, Adobe's Campaign solution was named a leader by both Gartner and Forrester Research in their 2016 Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management and the 2016 Cross-Channel Campaign Management Wave reports, respectively. 
Last week, Gartner named Adobe as a leader in its 2016 Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms report. Finally, Forrester Research recognized Adobe as a leader in its 2016 Enterprise Marketing Software Suites Wave report, where we once again received the highest scores for our overall Adobe Marketing Cloud offering and strategy.
In Q2, Adobe Marketing Cloud managed nearly 19 trillion customer data transactions for our customers, reinforcing Adobe as the leading big data company in digital marketing. With unique insights from this data, we launched our new Digital Economy Project in March, which has quickly garnered broad attention as a critical indicator for the U.S. digital economy. The monthly report includes a digital price index, a housing index and a job seeking index.
Dealing with digital disruption is the main concern we hear about in every meeting we have with business, education and government leaders the world over. A key strategy for dealing with this disruption is to deliver a compelling digital experience, which is the new basis for customer satisfaction, loyalty and growth.
This business imperative creates great opportunity for Adobe, and we're the only company that helps with every stage of a digital experience from creation through monetization. With another strong quarter behind us, we continue to be bullish about our growth prospects. Mark?"

In the second quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,399,000,000, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.48 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.71. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our targeted range, GAAP earnings were at the high end of our targeted range and non-GAAP earnings were above our targeted range. These strong results reflect continued momentum across our business.
Highlights in our second quarter include: strong growth in Digital Media ARR, which reflects the overall health of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses; record Creative revenue of $755 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $385 million, which represents 18% year-over-year growth; strong growth in operating and net income, with cash flow from operations of $489 million; and 81% of Q2 revenue was from recurring sources.
In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 26% year-over-year. More importantly, we exceeded our Q2 target for Digital Media ARR. We added $285 million during the quarter and exited Q2 with $3.41 billion. 
Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $755 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 37%. We increased Creative ARR by $263 million during Q2.
Driving this momentum was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions. Retention rates remain consistent with prior periods. 
We continue to execute well against our key Creative Cloud opportunities: growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users and growing our installed base in the education market; driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the Photography Plan, and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to drive new member adoption; and achieving higher ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock, where revenue has grown sequentially over each of the past 3 quarters.
With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $188 million, which was in line with our expectations. In addition, Document Cloud ARR exiting Q2 grew to $415 million, which represents higher quarter-over-quarter growth when compared to Q1. We continued to drive adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, which is benefiting ARR and building a foundation for growth in the future.
In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $385 million, driven by multi-solution adoption. We achieved another strong quarter with Adobe Campaign, and Adobe AudienceManager is becoming a strategic asset as our customers are increasingly utilizing data to enhance their Digital Marketing programs to deliver personalized, engaging experiences. In Q2, for the first time, mobile transactions grew to 50% of total Adobe Analytics transactions.
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $5.2 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '16 versus $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '16, thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $5.6 million.
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $21.7 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '16 versus $22.2 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '15, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $40.3 million. 
In Q2, Adobe's effective tax rate was 26% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP tax rate was higher than expected primarily due to the acquisition of Livefyre.
Our trade DSO was 43 days, which compares to 39 days in the year ago quarter and 42 days last quarter. 
Cash flow from operations was $489 million in the quarter. 
Deferred revenue grew to $1.68 billion, up 37% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.32 billion compared to $4.1 billion at the end of Q1. 
In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at a cost of $205 million. We currently have $1.2 billion remaining under our current authority granted January 2015.
I'll now provide our financial outlook. Based on our strong first half performance and business momentum, we expect to meet or exceed our FY '16 annual targets, which we raised in March. We expect the second half of the year to play out as we outlined in our Q1 call.
We are targeting a third quarter revenue range of $1,420,000,000 to $1,470,000,000. In Digital Media, we expect to add approximately $285 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q3, with strong year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth.
In Digital Marketing, we expect continued momentum in bookings and approximately 7% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth in Q3, factoring in the strong perpetual revenue in the year ago quarter. 
We are targeting our Q3 share count to be between 504 million to 506 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be between $11 million and $13 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q3 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q3 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.46 to $0.52 per share and a Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.69 to $0.75.
In summary, Q2 was another solid quarter for Adobe, and we look forward to our momentum continuing in the second half of fiscal 2016. Mike?"

I realized that there's been some, I guess, changes in sort of how the rev rec has been going, given the shift from perpetual to more subscription-based rev rec. But this next quarter, even when you adjust for some of that deal that fell into 3Q last year, which I understand creates a little bit of a tougher comp, it seems like that gap between bookings in that segment and sort of revenue growth still isn't closing perhaps as fast as one might be thinking. So can you just walk through that if there's changes in terms of implementation times or taking longer so there's some issue there, or you have longer deals that are being spread out over say 6 quarters versus 4. I'm just kind of getting -- I just want to get a sense of when do we start to see the inflection in the revenue growth in that business come back and align a little bit closer with the bookings trends."

So there's no change. There's no change in implementations or any of the other factors that you mentioned. It's really just how the quarters play out relative to perpetual last year."

And I think I highlighted in particular, as the 3-year ETLAs are now all coming up for renewal, the first time around, we had actually done a lot of the ETLAs as sort of custom deals. Now we are seeing services as part of it. So the enterprise continues to be an opportunity. International, to your point, also continues to be an opportunity. We've always highlighted Japan and Germany, which are continuing to show progress against the migration goals that we have as well as new customer acquisition. Education also continues to be an area where we're seeing interest in the Creative Suite. And I think if you see some of the announcements we made today, whether it was the new product in XD, adding virtual reality to premiere, things that we're doing with touch, there's just so much innovation possible. I think the core elements of migrating existing customers, adding new customers and adding new services, we continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead of us.

I think when you look at the number of people who are using Adobe Stock, the percentage of them who represent -- who are CC subscribers is a very high percentage. So clearly, we are targeting folks who already have a strong affinity towards our products strategically and view this as a value-added service. With respect to how we are going to market, Heather, we have offerings that allow people who have a CC subscription to add a Stock subscription to that. And we also offer a complete offering, which includes both access to CC desktop applications as well as Stock. And we're seeing uptake in both of those categories in addition to the traditional on-demand business that existed in Stock. And when I look at the revenue numbers over the last 3 quarters, we've been seeing good growth in the Adobe Stock line item across all 3 quarters. So it's leading to both revenue as well as ARPU and ARR."

I think with enterprise ETLAs, 3 years ago, when we started this move of having enterprise customers license our software rather than buy it outright, we were just starting on this journey and it was nice as those 3-year terms are coming up to see that there's actually a fairly nice upsell associated with that. People are now adopting the entire Creative Cloud. They may have only had single applications there and are adopting services.

In Q3, Adobe delivered another record quarter, with revenue of $1.46 billion; GAAP earnings per share of $0.54; and non-GAAP earnings share of $0.75. These strong results are a reflection of our market leadership and momentum we have with Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud. We're enabling world's leading brands to develop design and data-driven digital experiences for their customers across every channel. Our unique value proposition continues to distance Adobe from our competitors.
In our Digital Media segment, we exited Q3 with $3.7 billion of annualized recurring revenue, ARR, which represents an increase of $285 million quarter-over-quarter. The increase was a result of the continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments.
Creative Cloud is a one-stop shop for creativity and design, offering the world's best creative apps, services and training as well as a vibrant marketplace and community. We achieved record Creative revenue of $803 million in Q3, which represents 39% year-over-year growth. Creative ARR grew in line with our expectations and was driven by continued migration of Creative Suite users, the addition of new value to existing subscribers with services such as Adobe Stock, new customer acquisition in the education and hobbyist photography markets and retention of existing subscribers.
Creative Cloud continues to deliver powerful new innovations across our segments at a rapid pace. As the leader in digital photography, Adobe has set the standard for professional-grade photography across cameras and mobile devices with Adobe DNG, a raw file format we created. As of last week's iOS 10 release, Adobe DNG is now supported natively by iOS and Android, and Lightroom is the first cross-platform app to empower users with an end-to-end raw mobile photography workflow for high quality image capture and editing.
New Creative Cloud innovation enables subscribers to design for emerging categories like Experience Design. Adobe XD, our solution for designing and prototyping websites and mobile apps, continues to gain momentum among users and industry watchers. Although still only available as a preview release, last week it was selected as 1 of 15 winners in the Fast Company Innovation by Design Awards, a distinct honor given there's 1,700 entries.
Earlier this month, we showcased Adobe's leadership in the video category, unveiling advancements in virtual reality, character animation and 3D at the IDC Conference in Amsterdam. These new capabilities are enabling video creators of all kinds from YouTubers to Hollywood Studios to create, deliver, monetize and measure innovative and immersive media across multiple suites.
This morning we announced the beta release of our new Adobe Stock Contributor Site, which reduces the friction for Creative Cloud users to promote and sell their work. The new site is integrated with Creative Cloud apps and introduces auto keywording, which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and tag content, streamlining the submission process and increasing the discoverability of Adobe Stock content.
In November we will hold our annual MAX Creativity Conference in San Diego. We expect this year's MAX to be the largest gathering ever of designers, photographers, film makers and other Creative professionals from around the world. As always, we look forward to unveiling new technology at MAX, including whole new categories of cloud-first Creative solutions.
The world's leading digital document service, Document Cloud, leverages PDF and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital, using Acrobat desktop and mobile apps as well as integrated cloud services like Adobe Sign. In Q3, Individual Acrobat subscription units exceeded perpetual units for the first time. And on adobe.com, over 90% of Acrobat customers chose the subscription offering. Document Cloud revenue was $187 million in Q3. Combined with Acrobat adoption reflected in Creative Cloud, Document Cloud continues to be an important growth business for Adobe.
In June, we announced the Cloud Signature Consortium, a group comprised of leading industry and academic organizations committed to building a new open standard for cloud-based digital signatures across mobile and web, so anyone can digitally sign documents from anywhere. Adobe led the way in establishing PDF as a digital document standard and is now raising the awareness of electronic signatures as a key to any business' digital transformation.
In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels. Whether it's financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment or automotive, entire industries are experiencing disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger loyalty and growth. Success hinges on a strong foundation of content and data, which enable a deep understanding of customer needs, development and delivery of consistent, personalized experiences and the ability to monitor business performance in real time.
In Q3, Adobe managed a record 23 trillion data transactions. Our customers in every major category of business are utilizing our machine learning algorithms to predict customer behavior and drive their business. Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, including Adobe Campaign, Adobe AudienceManager and Adobe Media Optimizer are achieving strong growth as our customers invest more in data-driven solutions.
In August, Adobe Marketing Cloud once again played a key role in the digital broadcast of the Olympic Games. NBC Sports used Adobe Primetime to power the digital delivery of the 2016 Rio Olympics, the largest digital Olympic Games in history.
In addition to being listed earlier this year as the Marketing Cloud platform category leader, Adobe Marketing Cloud was recognized by industry analysts during the quarter as a leader in categories such as Mobile Application Development, Cross Channel Campaign Management and enterprise marketing, software. We continue to drive new logo wins and expand our business across geographies and vertical markets. Some Q3 customer wins include: T-Mobile, Nordstrom, Subaru, SunTrust Bank, AstraZeneca and the state of Tennessee.
At the core of our business are the people that make it happen. As a software business, we know that employees are our most strategic asset and we're committed to increasing diversity. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including coding initiatives focusing on young women. We were recently recognized as one of Forbes' Most Innovative Companies, and we continue to Garner Best Place to Work honors around the world, most recently in Australia and India.
In addition, our focus as a company on the environment and sustainability is important to our employees and to many investors. We were pleased to learn Adobe has been selected as a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time.
Today, every company is under pressure to be more connected and in tune with its customers, to know their history, their preferences and to create and deliver powerful, personalized experiences to them anywhere they go. Content and data are at the core of these exceptional experiences and Adobe is the only company that brings these critical capabilities together in our market-leading cloud solutions.
The market opportunity is significant. Our strategy is sound. And our results demonstrate the leverage in our model. All of these are what make us excited about the opportunities ahead. Mark?"

GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.54, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.75. Strong perf",1224,"Thanks, Shantanu. In the third quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,464,000,000 which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.54, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.75. Strong performance across our 3 cloud offerings helped to deliver revenue towards the high end of our targeted range. Our cost discipline helped to deliver earnings upside while we continue to invest in the business to drive future growth.
Highlights in our third quarter include: solid growth with Digital Media ARR; we achieved our target of $285 million net new ARR during what is typically a seasonally soft quarter, and keeps us on pace to achieve our annual target that we increased earlier this year; record Creative revenue of $803 million, which represents 39% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $404 million, which represents 10% year-over-year growth and was above our target for the quarter; strong growth in operating and net income; record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue; and 83% of Q3 revenue from recurring sources, an all-time high.
In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 29% year-over-year. The addition of $285 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $3.7 billion exiting Q3. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $803 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 39%. In addition, we increased created ARR by $258 million during Q3 and exited the quarter with $3.26 billion of Creative ARR. Our Creative ARR is more than $1 billion higher than the peak annual Creative revenue we achieved when it was just perpetual licensing of Creative Suite.
Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals. Retention rates for subscriptions overall remain ahead of our original targeted projections. Creative Cloud ARPU across each of our commercial offerings continues to grow quarter-on-quarter as new users on promotion pricing renew at full price after their promotions expire. We also drove strong subscription growth in the education market during the back-to-school season in Q3.
Our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in 3 key areas: growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users, addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market; driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the Photography Plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption; and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock, where revenue grew by over 40% year-over-year in Q3.
With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $187 million, which was in line with our expectations as we gradually migrate this business to be more recurring. Document Cloud ARR exiting Q3 grew to $442 million, which represents the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Helping this growth is our effort to drive adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future.
In Digital Marketing, we drove strong year-over-year growth in annual Adobe Marketing Cloud subscription bookings and greater than 25% year-over-year growth in subscription revenue. Reported Marketing Cloud revenue was a record $404 million, ahead of our Q3 target as a result of accelerated second half pipeline conversion and resulted in year-over-year growth of 10%.
Marketing Cloud retention, bookings in Q3 and our pipeline set us up for a strong Q4. Our increased focus on first year annual subscription value will help us more quickly convert our bookings into reported revenue as we look to FY '17 and beyond.
Mobile remains a key market trend for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 52% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $0.9 million. We had $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '16 versus $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '16, thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $1.2 million.
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.2 million. We had $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '16 versus $9.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '15. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $19.4 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. Although there was a short-term impact on demand following the Brexit announcement in the U.K., it did not affect our ability to achieve our Q3 goals, and we do not anticipate any significant impact through the rest of FY '16.
In Q3, Adobe's effective tax rate was 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 45 days, which compares to 44 days in the year ago quarter and 43 days last quarter.
Deferred revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion, up 38% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.45 billion compared to $4.32 billion at the end of Q2. Cash flow from operations was a record $518 million in the quarter.
During this year we have been using excess domestic cash to buy back stock and drive our share count down. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares at a cost of $344 million. We currently have $800 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015.
Now I'll provide our financial outlook. We are targeting a fourth quarter revenue range of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion. In Digital Media, we expect to add slightly more than $300 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q4 to achieve our full year target of approximately $4 billion of ARR exiting the year.
In Digital Marketing, we expect our business momentum to enable us to achieve Q4 Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 30%, which puts us on pace to achieve our annual growth target of approximately 20% for the year. We are targeting our Q4 share count to be between 503 million to 505 million shares. We expect net nonoperating expenses to be between $8 million and $10 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.60 to $0.66 per share, and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.83 to $0.89.
For the year, our updated annual targets reflect our year-to-date results and our Q4 targets. We expect FY '16 annual revenue between $5.8 billion and $5.85 billion, GAAP EPS between $2.12 and $2.18 and non-GAAP EPS between $2.94 and $3.
In summary, Q3 was yet another strong quarter for Adobe, with the leverage in our model continuing to be reflected in our bottom line performance. Our year-to-date results and targets for Q4 keep us on track to meet or exceed all of the financial targets we provided at the outset of the year. We look forward to finishing the year strong, and hope to see you at MAX and our upcoming financial analyst meeting in San Diego. Mike?"

And while I won't be updating our TAMs at this point, we are pleased with our performance, and I'll be happy to give you some color on how we see the opportunity ahead of us in terms of what the Creative Cloud as well as the Document Cloud. The Creative Cloud business is certainly being driven both by customer migration, as well as by new customer adoption, and we certainly think that's going to be true for the document business as well. As you know, we have tens of millions of people who have bought Acrobat over the lifetime of the Acrobat product. And for the first time as we mentioned again in our prepared remarks, the number of subscription units of Acrobat actually exceeded the perpetual units, so we are pleased with how that transition is going. The playbook is exactly the same. It's about how do we migrate Acrobat customers to Acrobat DC. It's about adding new services like Sign. It's about enhancing new services that we can add to the business. But the thing I would also caution folks listening is to recognize that part of the Creative ARR that's being driven is also already being driven by the document business. And so while we report the document segment separately, let's already reflect that it's actually helping not just the Document business but also the Creative business. So we're pleased with that on mobile. PDF has continued to be adopted as a white standard, which I think also all bodes well for its continued growth."

Number one, when you hire people during the quarter you don't get the full effect of their expense in the quarter. They're averaged out over the course of the quarter, so you don't get the full impact until the following quarter. And as you saw, we did add 500 heads this quarter. There's also a lot of spending that we do that's non-headcount related, particularly in marketing. And that can come and go despite what we do from a headcount perspective. But let me comment briefly on EPS overall because I know this could be a follow-up question. We have consistently shown that we have leverage in our model. I think Adobe has been a poster child of that for a number of years now. And with good revenue execution and good cost discipline, I think you've come to expect that from us. When we don't have very specific short-term investment needs, you're going to see earnings upside like you saw in the back half of this year, both in Q3 and our guidance in Q4. In the longer term, we see a lot of tremendous opportunity that's going to continue to require investment in sales and marketing. I mean, you saw that in the 500 heads that I mentioned we hired this quarter. So for the longer term, '17, '18, I would encourage you not to raise your EPS models right now. I would encourage you to recognize that we're going to continue to invest in sales and marketing and wait as we provide '17 revenue and earnings guidance later this year."

As you know, there was fairly healthy cohort of CS6 customers that continues to be an opportunity for us in the U.S. And we talked about international expansion also as an opportunity. Both Japan and Germany had a good quarter. Now when we looked at Q3, Japan and Germany grew -- run rate units grew greater than the overall units, so that's continuing to please us in terms of now seeing CS customers in those geographies migrate. Education had another great subscription units quarter, which means we're attracting that next generation of customers. When you look at the overall subs in the quarter, it was a very healthy number. So we're attracting new customers to the platform but even the migration opportunity continues to be won. I think one of the areas where we're executing well is whether you're an existing customer or whether you're a new customer, the work we are doing in terms of delivering new innovative products, what they're seeing with XD, you'll see some new announcements as well at MAX that I'm not going to preview here today.

And if you are trying to create the experience business, the only way to transform your company is by adopting an entire platform rather than piece-meal trying to buy Individual products and trying to fit that together. Virtually every new logo that we get is a multi-solution deal because what they want is a complete offering that enables them to do that transformation. Given the breadth of existing customer base, certainly we're up selling all of them to multiple solutions. But whether it's a new logo acquisition or whether it's renewals, most of the deals are now multi-solution deals and much larger revenue to Adobe and value to the customer. So hopefully that gives you some color in terms of the number of solutions that they are all adopting and how that's certainly migrating.

I mean, if you look at the macro level, and we used to sell approximately 3 million units of Creative Suite a year and if you look at the numbers right now of where we are with Creative Cloud, it's clear that we have seen significant acceleration. Without a doubt, a large part of that acceleration is people who want Creative Cloud and are no longer pirating Creative products but are actually, as a result of the low price and the value that we're delivering am I using the entire subscription-based offering. So what we've done from a technical perspective already we've actually ensured that people who download the trials that once the trial expires that they don't have access to the products. And as you know, we've also shut down places, online website where people could buy a repackaged box. So there's no question that we've already addressed piracy in a meaningful way. In terms of the installed base of pirates, I think the numbers for that are all over the map. But I think you can go back and look at the last numbers that we gave in terms of the addressable market and you would see that there's still significant headroom. And the last thing I will mention is I think later this year, we launched some announcements. There's still a number of countries where we actually sell only CS6 and we're going to start to offer CC in those markets. And for the first time we have the ability to offer differential pricing. So this is playing out exactly as we expected.

When you think about it, Mark may have mentioned in his prepared remarks that when we think about all of the commercial offerings, the ARPU of all of the commercial offerings are increasing. And that, as you point out, is a reflection of high retention rates of people who are moving off of promotions. And again, the strategy very much is let's have promotions to bring people onto our platform. And once we deliver the value as they retain at the annual boundaries, then we get the additional revenue. So it certainly has had an impact on ARR. The same thing is also true in the enterprise. When we first introduced the enterprise offerings, we had what we would call sort of the custom enterprise offering, which was more of a middle of what they were accustomed to buying with the Creative Suite. As they all move off the 3-year cycle and they are renewing, we are definitely marketing to them the value of the entire Creative Cloud offering. And we've seen adoption of that is fairly high again, which again leads to increased revenue per customer."

And clearly you've gotten to a point where I think you mentioned 80-plus percent of revenues are recurring. And as you have you this recurring revenue business that renews at very high margins, the secondary level starts to slow down, although the overall growth still looks pretty good. You don't have to grow your new subscription revenues quite at the pace that you've been growing before. So therefore that has some positive consequences for acquisition cost and sales and marketing. Or perhaps are we missing some other consideration in relation to your statement that you continue to see investment opportunities? So just trying to measure or square off the merits of the subscription model vis-a-vis your comments that we should be more muted as far as how much margin expansion we should be expecting."

I'm saying just don't get a little carried away based on what we're delivering in the second half of this year level. Yes, we gave you guys a 3-year model a year ago that shows some pretty significant margin expansion over the next several years and we're ahead of that phase in the back half of this year. As I said because when we don't have some short-term investment it needs we can deliver that to you in the form of upside to EPS and deliver that to shareholders. You're right, 83% recurring revenue model, particularly on the Creative side, that you're going to over time have less cost of acquisition. You can drive more margin. On the Digital Marketing side as we've discussed, that business is a very different business. We've got a lot of variable cost that comes with that business in the form of hosted infrastructure. It's going to be a very different margin profile. So we've got 2 different businesses with 2 different margin profiles, both growing very fast right now.

Our vision for the Marketing Cloud is exactly the same, which is we are building a data platform that enables all of our products to work seamlessly together. We made a lot of progress in that space. And the benefit for customers is certainly as they think about the campaign, as they think about customer segments, it naturally flows from the analytics product to the target product, to the campaign product. And in the enterprise space, we certainly see that our Marketing Cloud, while it's a leader, we have aspirations for that not to be an island unto itself but really to be the hub that interconnects all of the enterprise software. And so investing, as you point out, in these core data platforms to enable our customers to derive value and for us to continue to build a technology moat that will serve us well for many years is very much part of strategy. And last but not least, customer expectations right now across the globe are that content flows seamlessly from our Creative Cloud into our Marketing Cloud, and so we do that. The one other comment I will make there's a lot of conversation right now about machine learning and AI. It's something that we've invested in for years. I mean, we won't be building the Magic that we've built in Creative Cloud or Creative Suite without very deep technology in terms of machine learning. And the reality is, when we think about Marketing Cloud, it's not about data collection. It's all about how we are driving insight and predictive, which is another form of machine learning, and that's what's really fueled our Marketing Cloud business. So continue to invest in deep technology across the company."

What's becoming table states increasingly is having that kind of personalized experience across all digital channels, whether you're in airlines and that's the experience in the kiosk or in a terminal, whether it's in retail and that's the particular experience when you walk into a retail store, whether it's in food and functionality, whether it you're coming to a drive-in. And so what's fueling our business is the ability to actually deliver that same experience across each of those different channels. And more specifically, what that means is as people are creating new mobile applications and using our AEM mobile solutions or as people are corresponding more with people and addressing there our campaign solutions. And it's certainly our goal to provide that's an stop shop for all communication and all experience across all different channels. it's very definitely driving it. The one product that I will again single out is AudienceManager really just continues to do it extremely well in the enterprise. And I think the reason for that is all enterprises are starting off with this question who are my customers, what are the demographics and how do I set up that up? And AudienceManager is a much more than just a DMV. It actually allows enterprise to start off in a business strategy and say, ""let me that the real clear understanding of my customers and what I'm trying to deliver to them across all different touch points."" So our vision of the Marketing Cloud and continuing to be the one-stop shop, I think it's paying off and you're seeing that in the results. And a big picture, since that was the last question, I think we continue to focus on the large opportunities ahead of us as a company. And we're helping create the world's content, we're helping enterprises use technology to deliver better customer value. I know Mark and I are pleased with our Q3 results. Our Q4 targets reflect the continued momentum in the business. It's going to be able to win this macro environment continue to reiterate our financial targets.

In Q3, Adobe delivered another record quarter with revenue of $1.46 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75. These strong results are a reflection of our market leadership and momentum we have with Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud. We're enabling the world's leading brands to develop design and data-driven digital experiences for their customers across every channel. Our unique value proposition continues to distance Adobe from our competitors.
In our Digital Media segment, we exited Q3 with $3.7 billion of annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, which represents an increase of $285 million quarter-over-quarter. The increase was a result of the continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments.
Creative Cloud is a one-stop shop for creativity and design, offering the world's best creative apps, services and training as well as a vibrant marketplace and community. We achieved record Creative revenue of $803 million in Q3, which represents 39% year-over-year growth. Creative ARR grew in line with our expectations and was driven by continued migration of Creative Suite users, the addition of new value to existing subscribers with services such as Adobe Stock, new customer acquisition in the education and hobbyist photography markets and retention of existing subscribers.
Creative Cloud continues to deliver powerful new innovations across our segments at a rapid pace. As the leader in digital photography, Adobe has set the standard for professional-grade photography across cameras and mobile devices with Adobe DNG, a raw file format we created. As of last week's iOS 10 release, Adobe DNG is now supported natively by iOS and Android, and Lightroom is the first cross-platform app to empower users with an end-to-end raw mobile photography workflow for high-quality image capture and editing.
New Creative Cloud innovation enables subscribers to design for emerging categories like Experience Design. Adobe XD, our solution for designing and prototyping websites and mobile apps, continues to gain momentum among users and industry watchers. Although still only available as a preview release, last week it was selected as 1 of 15 winners in the Fast Company Innovation by Design Awards, a distinct honor given the 1,700 entries.
Earlier this month, we showcased Adobe's leadership in the video category, unveiling advancements in virtual reality, character animation and 3D at the IBC Conference in Amsterdam. These new capabilities are enabling video creators of all kinds, from YouTubers to Hollywood studios, to create, deliver, monetize and measure innovative and immersive media across multiple screens.
This morning, we announced the beta release of our new Adobe Stock Contributor Site, which reduces the friction for Creative Cloud users to promote and sell their work. The new site is integrated with Creative Cloud apps and introduces auto keywording, which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and tag content, streamlining the submission process and increasing the discoverability of Adobe Stock content.
In November, we will hold our annual MAX Creativity Conference in San Diego. We expect this year's MAX to be the largest gathering ever of designers, photographers, film makers and other creative professionals from around the world. As always, we look forward to unveiling new technology at MAX, including whole new categories of cloud-first Creative solutions.
The world's leading digital document service, Document Cloud, leverages PDF and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital using Acrobat desktop and mobile apps as well as integrated cloud services like Adobe Sign. In Q3, individual Acrobat subscription units exceeded perpetual units for the first time. And on adobe.com, over 90% of Acrobat customers chose the subscription offering. Document Cloud revenue was $187 million in Q3. Combined with Acrobat adoption reflected in Creative Cloud, Document Cloud continues to be an important growth business for Adobe.
In June, we announced the Cloud Signature Consortium, a group comprised of leading industry and academic organizations committed to building a new open standard for cloud-based digital signatures across mobile and web, so anyone can digitally sign documents from anywhere. Adobe led the way in establishing PDF as a digital document standard and is now raising the awareness of electronic signatures as a key to any business' digital transformation.
In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels. Whether it's financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment or automotive, entire industries are experiencing disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger loyalty and growth. Success hinges on a strong foundation of content and data, which enable a deep understanding of customer needs, development and delivery of consistent, personalized experiences and the ability to monitor business performance in real time.
In Q3, Adobe managed a record 23 trillion data transactions. Our customers in every major category of business are utilizing our machine learning algorithms to predict customer behavior and drive their business. Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, including Adobe Campaign, Adobe AudienceManager and Adobe Media Optimizer are achieving strong growth as our customers invest more in data-driven solutions.
In August, Adobe Marketing Cloud once again played a key role in the digital broadcast of the Olympic Games. NBC Sports used Adobe Primetime to power the digital delivery of the 2016 Rio Olympics, the largest digital Olympic Games in history.
In addition to being listed earlier this year as the Marketing Cloud Platform category Leader, Adobe Marketing Cloud was recognized by industry analysts during the quarter as a Leader in categories such as Mobile Application Development, Cross-Channel Campaign Management and Enterprise Marketing Software. We continue to drive new logo wins and expand our business across geographies and vertical markets. Some Q3 customer wins include T-Mobile, Nordstrom, Subaru, SunTrust Bank, AstraZeneca and the state of Tennessee.
At the core of our business are the people that make it happen. As a software business, we know that employees are our most strategic asset, and we're committed to increasing diversity. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including coding initiatives focusing on young women. We were recently recognized as one of Forbes' Most Innovative Companies, and we continue to garner Best Place to Work honors around the world, most recently in Australia and India.
In addition, our focus as a company on the environment and sustainability is important to our employees and to many investors. We were pleased to learn Adobe has been selected as a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time.
Today, every company is under pressure to be more connected and in tune with its customers, to know their history, their preferences and to create and deliver powerful, personalized experiences to them anywhere they go. Content and data are at the core of these exceptional experiences, and Adobe is the only company that brings these critical capabilities together in our market-leading cloud solutions.
The market opportunity is significant. Our strategy is sound. And our results demonstrate the leverage in our model. All of these are what make us excited about the opportunities ahead. Mark?"
24321,311428077,1049136,"Adobe Systems Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 20, 2016",2016-09-20,"Earnings Calls","Adobe Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Shantanu. In the third quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,464,000,000, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.54, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.75. Strong per",1223,"Thanks, Shantanu. In the third quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,464,000,000, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.54, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.75. Strong performance across our 3 cloud offerings helped to deliver revenue towards the high end of our targeted range. Our cost discipline helped to deliver earnings upside while we continue to invest in the business to drive future growth.
Highlights in our third quarter include: solid growth with Digital Media ARR. We achieved our target of $285 million net new ARR during what is typically a seasonally soft quarter and keeps us on pace to achieve our annual target that we increased earlier this year; record Creative revenue of $803 million, which represents 39% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $404 million, which represents 10% year-over-year growth and was above our target for the quarter; strong growth in operating and net income; record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue; and 83% of Q3 revenue from recurring sources, an all-time high.
In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 29% year-over-year. The addition of $285 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $3.7 billion exiting Q3. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $803 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 39%. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $258 million during Q3 and exited the quarter with $3.26 billion of Creative ARR. Our Creative ARR is more than $1 billion higher than the peak annual Creative revenue we achieved when it was just perpetual licensing of Creative Suite.
Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals. Retention rates for subscriptions overall remained ahead of our original targeted projections. Creative Cloud ARPU across each of our commercial offerings continues to grow quarter-on-quarter as new users on promotion pricing renew at full price after their promotions expire. We also drove strong subscription growth in the education market during the back-to-school season in Q3.
Our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in 3 key areas: growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users, addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market; driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the Photography Plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption; and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock, where revenue grew by over 40% year-over-year in Q3.
With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $187 million, which was in line with our expectations as we gradually migrate this business to be more recurring. Document Cloud ARR exiting Q3 grew to $442 million, which represents the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Helping this growth is our effort to drive adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future.
In Digital Marketing, we drove strong year-over-year growth in annual Adobe Marketing Cloud subscription bookings and greater than 25% year-over-year growth in subscription revenue. Reported Marketing Cloud revenue was a record $404 million, ahead of our Q3 target as a result of accelerated second half pipeline conversion and resulted in year-over-year growth of 10%.
Marketing Cloud retention, bookings in Q3 and our pipeline set us up for a strong Q4. Our increased focus on first year annual subscription value will help us more quickly convert our bookings into reported revenue as we look to FY '17 and beyond.
Mobile remains a key market trend for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 52% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter.
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $0.9 million. We had $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '16 versus $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '16. Thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $1.2 million.
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.2 million. We had $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '16 versus $9.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '15. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $19.4 million.
We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. Although there was a short-term impact on demand following the Brexit announcement in the U.K., it did not affect our ability to achieve our Q3 goals, and we do not anticipate any significant impact through the rest of FY '16.
In Q3, Adobe's effective tax rate was 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 45 days, which compares to 44 days in the year-ago quarter and 43 days last quarter.
Deferred revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion, up 38% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.45 billion compared to $4.32 billion at the end of Q2. Cash flow from operations was a record $518 million in the quarter.
During this year, we have been using excess domestic cash to buy back stock and drive our share count down. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares at a cost of $344 million. We currently have $800 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015.
Now I'll provide our financial outlook. We are targeting a fourth quarter revenue range of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion. In Digital Media, we expect to add slightly more than $300 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q4 to achieve our full year target of approximately $4 billion of ARR exiting the year. In Digital Marketing, we expect our business momentum to enable us to achieve Q4 Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 30%, which puts us on pace to achieve our annual growth target of approximately 20% for the year.
We are targeting our Q4 share count to be between 503 million to 505 million shares. We expect net nonoperating expenses to be between $8 million and $10 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.60 to $0.66 per share and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.83 to $0.89.
For the year, our updated annual targets reflect our year-to-date results and our Q4 targets. We expect FY '16 annual revenue between $5.8 billion and $5.85 billion, GAAP EPS between $2.12 and $2.18 and non-GAAP EPS between $2.94 and $3.
In summary, Q3 was yet another strong quarter for Adobe, with the leverage in our model continuing to be reflected in our bottom line performance. Our year-to-date results and targets for Q4 keep us on track to meet or exceed all of the financial targets we provided at the outset of the year. We look forward to finishing the year strong and hope to see you at MAX and our upcoming financial analyst meeting in San Diego. Mike?"

And while I won't be updating our TAMs at this point, we are pleased with our performance, and I'll be happy to give you some color on how we see the opportunity ahead of us in terms of both the Creative Cloud as well as the Document Cloud. The Creative Cloud business is certainly being driven both by customer migration as well as by new customer adoption, and we certainly think that's going to be true for the Document business as well. As you know, we have tens of millions of people who have bought Acrobat over the lifetime of the Acrobat product. And for the first time, as we mentioned again in our prepared remarks, the number of subscription units of Acrobat actually exceeded the perpetual units. So we are pleased with how that transition is going. The playbook is exactly the same. It's about how do we migrate Acrobat customers to Acrobat DC. It's about adding new services like Sign. It's about enhancing new services that we can add to the business. But the thing I would also caution folks listening is to recognize that part of the Creative ARR that's being driven is also already being driven by the Document business. And so while we report the Document segment separately, let's already reflect that it's actually helping not just the Document business but also the Creative business. So we're pleased with that on mobile. PDF has continued to be adopted as a wide standard, which I think also bode as well for its continued growth."

Number one, when you hire people during the quarter, you don't get the full effect of their expense in the quarter. They're averaged out over the course of the quarter, so you don't get the full impact until the following quarter. And as you saw, we did add 500 heads this quarter. There's also a lot of spending that we do that's non-headcount related, particularly in marketing. And that can come and go despite what we do from a headcount perspective. But let me comment briefly on EPS overall because I know this will be a follow-on question. We have consistently shown that we have leverage in our model. I think Adobe has been a poster child of that for a number of years now. And with good revenue execution and good cost discipline, I think you've come to expect that from us. When we don't have very specific short-term investment needs, you're going to see earnings upside like you saw in the back half of this year, both in Q3 and our guidance in Q4. In the longer term, we see a lot of tremendous opportunity that's going to continue to require investment in sales and marketing. I mean, you saw that in the 500 heads that I mentioned we hired this quarter. So for the longer term, '17, '18, I would encourage you not to raise your EPS models right now. I would encourage you to recognize that we're going to continue to invest in sales and marketing and wait as we provide '17 revenue and earnings guidance later this year."

It's not for lack of market opportunity in the marketing space. And we just have to keep innovating as well.

So that's continuing to please us in terms of now seeing CS customers in those geographies migrate. Education had another great subscription units quarter, which means we're attracting that next generation of customers. When you look at overall subs in the quarter, it was a very healthy number. So we're attracting new customers to the platform, but even the migration opportunity continues to be one.

I think we mentioned that when we think about big picture what's happening in the enterprise space, if the first era was all about back office automation and the second era was about what happened with productivity or front office, we really are motivated by this notion that it's going to be the experience business. And if you are trying to create the experience business, the only way to transform your company is by adopting an entire platform rather than piece-meal, trying to buy Individual products and try and fit that together. Virtually every new logo that we get is a multi-solution deal because what they want is a complete offering that enables them to do that transformation. Given the breadth of existing customer base, certainly we're upselling all of them to multiple solutions. But whether it's a new logo acquisition or whether it's renewals, most of the deals are now multi-solution deals and much larger revenue to Adobe and value to the customer.

I mean, if you look at the macro level, and we used to sell approximately 3 million units of Creative Suite a year and if you look at the numbers right now of where we are with Creative Cloud, it's clear that we have seen significant acceleration. Without a doubt, a large part of that acceleration is people who want Creative Cloud and are no longer pirating Creative products but are actually, as a result of the low price and the value that we're delivering, are using the entire subscription-based offering. So what we've done from a technical perspective already, we've actually ensured that people who download the trials that once the trial expires that they don't have access to the products. And as you know, we've also shut down places, online website where people could buy a repackaged box. So there's no question that we've already addressed piracy in a meaningful way. In terms of the installed base of pirates, I think the numbers for that are all over the map. But I think you can go back and look at the last numbers that we gave in terms of the addressable market, and you would see that there is still significant headroom. And the last thing I will mention is I think later this year, we'll also make some announcements. There's still a number of countries where we actually only sell CS6, and we're going to start to offer CC in all of those markets. And for the first time, we have the ability to offer differential pricing. So this is playing out exactly as we expected. Let's get the markets that are most developed. Let's address casual pirates. Let's hit the enterprise, and then let's now expand that into emerging markets where there was more piracy and now we have the ability to counter that, both through pricing as well as through technology."

And again, the strategy very much is let's have promotions to bring people onto our platform. And once we deliver the value, as they retain the annual boundaries, then we get the additional revenue. So it certainly has had an impact on ARR. The same thing is also true in the enterprise. When we first introduced the enterprise offerings, we had what we would call a sort of custom enterprise offering, which was more of a mirror of what they were accustomed to buying with the Creative Suite. As they all move off the 3-year cycle and they are renewing, we are definitely marketing to them the value of the entire Creative Cloud offering. And we've seen adoption of that is fairly high again, which again leads to increased revenue per customer."

And clearly, you've gotten to a point where I think you mentioned 80-plus percent of revenues are recurring. And as you have this recurring revenue business that renews at very high margins, the second derivative starts to slow down, although the overall growth still looks pretty good. You don't have to grow your new subscription revenues quite at the pace that you've been growing before. So therefore, that has some positive consequences for acquisition cost and sales and marketing. Or perhaps are we missing some other consideration in relation to your statement that you continue to see investment opportunities? So just trying to measure or square off the merits of the subscription model vis-à-vis your comments that we should be more muted as far as how much margin expansion we should be expecting."

You're right. In the 83% recurring revenue model, particularly on the Creative side, you're going to, over time, have less cost of acquisition. You can drive more margin. On the Digital Marketing side, as we've discussed, that business is a very different business. We've got a lot of variable cost that comes with that business in the form of hosted infrastructure. It's going to be a very different margin profile. So we've got 2 different businesses with 2 different margin profiles both growing very fast right now.

Our vision for the Marketing Cloud is exactly the same, which is we are building a data platform that enables all of our products to work seamlessly together. We made a lot of progress in that space. And the benefit for customers is certainly as they think about a campaign, as they think about customer segments, it naturally flows from the analytics product to the target product, to the campaign product. And in the enterprise space, we certainly see that our Marketing Cloud, while it's a leader, we have aspirations for that not to be an island unto itself but really to be the hub that interconnects all of the enterprise software. And so investing, as you point out, in these core data platforms to enable our customers to derive value and for us to continue to build a technology moat that will serve us well for many years is very much part of the strategy. And last but not least, customer expectations right now across the globe are that content flows seamlessly from our Creative Cloud into our Marketing Cloud, and so we do that. The one other comment I will make, you're right, there's a lot of conversation right now about machine learning and AI. It's something that we've invested in for years. I mean, we won't be building the magic that we've built in Creative Cloud or Creative Suite without very deep technology in terms of machine learning.

It's all about how we are driving insight and predictive, which is another form of machine learning, and that's what's really fueled our Marketing Cloud business.

I mean, the single point of interaction in the digital world for most customers used to be the website with AEM, as you point out. What's becoming table stakes increasingly is having that same kind of personalized experience across all digital channels, whether you're in airlines and that's the experience in a kiosk or a terminal, whether it's in retail and that's the particular experience when you walk into a retail store, whether it's in food and hospitality, whether you're coming to a drive-in. And so what's fueling our business is the ability to actually deliver that same experience across each of those different channels. And more specifically, what that means is as people are creating new mobile applications and using our AEM mobile solutions or as people are corresponding more with people and addressing our campaign solutions. And it's certainly our goal to provide that single-stop shop for all communication and all experience across all different channels. It's very definitely driving it. The one product that I'll again single out is AudienceManager really just continues to do extremely well in the enterprise. And I think the reason for that is all enterprises are starting off with this question of who are my customers, what are the demographics and how do I set up that up. And AudienceManager is so much more than just a DMP. It actually allows enterprise to start off in a business strategy and say, ""Let me get a real clear understanding of my customers and what I'm trying to deliver to them across all different touch points."" So our vision of the Marketing Cloud and continuing to be the one-stop shop, I think it's paying off, and you're seeing that in the results. And a big picture, since that was the last question, I think we continue to focus on the large opportunities ahead of us as a company. And we're helping create the world's content. We're helping enterprises use technology to deliver better customer value. I know Mark and I are pleased with our Q3 results. Our Q4 targets reflect the continued momentum in the business. It's good to be able to win this macro environment, continue to reiterate our financial targets, and as you saw, increase our EPS target for the year. And so we think we're in great shape. We remain focused on driving innovation for our customers. I again want to thank customers, partners worldwide for their commitment and to our employers -- employees for continuing to drive innovation in this industry. We look forward to seeing you all at MAX. There are going to be some exciting announcements, and we will have an update for you. But thank you for joining us today."

In Q3, Adobe delivered another record quarter with revenue of $1.46 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75. These strong results are a reflection of our market leadership and momentum we have with Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud. We're enabling the world's leading brands to develop designed and data-driven digital experiences for their customers across every channel. Our unique value proposition continues to distance Adobe from our competitors.
In our Digital Media segment, we exited Q3 with $3.7 billion of annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, which represents an increase of $285 million quarter-over-quarter. The increase was a result of the continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments.
Creative Cloud is a one-stop shop for creativity and design, offering the world's best creative apps, services and training as well as a vibrant marketplace and community. We achieved record Creative revenue of $803 million in Q3, which represents 39% year-over-year growth. Creative ARR grew in line with our expectations and was driven by continued migration of Creative Suite users, the addition of new value to existing subscribers with services such as Adobe Stock, new customer acquisition in the education and hobbyist photography markets and retention of existing subscribers.
Creative Cloud continues to deliver powerful new innovations across our segments at a rapid pace. As the leader in digital photography, Adobe has set the standard for professional-grade photography across cameras and mobile devices with Adobe DNG, a raw file format we created. As of last week's iOS 10 release, Adobe DNG is now supported natively by iOS and Android, and Lightroom is the first cross-platform app to empower users with an end-to-end raw mobile photography workflow for high-quality image capture and editing.
New Creative Cloud innovation enables subscribers to design for emerging categories like Experience Design. Adobe XD, our solution for designing and prototyping websites and mobile apps, continues to gain momentum among users and industry watchers. Although still only available as a preview release, last week it was selected as 1 of 15 winners in the Fast Company Innovation by Design Awards, a distinct honor given the 1,700 entries.
Earlier this month, we showcased Adobe's leadership in the video category, unveiling advancements in virtual reality, character animation and 3D at the IBC Conference in Amsterdam. These new capabilities are enabling video creators of all kinds, from YouTubers to Hollywood Studios, to create, deliver, monetize and measure innovative and immersive media across multiple screens.
This morning, we announced the beta release of our new Adobe Stock Contributor Site, which reduces the friction for Creative Cloud users to promote and sell their work. The new site is integrated with Creative Cloud apps and introduces auto keywording, which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and tag content, streamlining the submission process and increasing the discoverability of Adobe Stock content.
In November, we will hold our annual MAX Creativity Conference in San Diego. We expect this year's MAX to be the largest gathering ever of designers, photographers, film makers and other creative professionals from around the world. As always, we look forward to unveiling new technology at MAX, including whole new categories of cloud-first Creative solutions.
The world's leading digital document service, Document Cloud, leverages PDF and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital using Acrobat desktop and mobile apps as well as integrated cloud services like Adobe Sign. In Q3, individual Acrobat subscription units exceeded perpetual units for the first time. And on adobe.com, over 90% of Acrobat customers chose the subscription offering. Document Cloud revenue was $187 million in Q3. Combined with Acrobat adoption reflected in Creative Cloud, Document Cloud continues to be an important growth business for Adobe.
In June, we announced the Cloud Signature Consortium, a group comprised of leading industry and academic organizations committed to building a new open standard for cloud-based digital signatures across mobile and web, so anyone can digitally sign documents from anywhere. Adobe led the way in establishing PDF as a digital document standard and is now raising the awareness of electronic signatures as a key to any business' digital transformation.
In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels. Whether it's financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment or automotive, entire industries are experiencing disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger loyalty and growth. Success hinges on a strong foundation of content and data, which enable a deep understanding of customer needs, development and delivery of consistent, personalized experiences and the ability to monitor business performance in real time.
In Q3, Adobe managed a record 23 trillion data transactions. Our customers in every major category of business are utilizing our machine learning algorithms to predict customer behavior and drive their business. Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, including Adobe Campaign, Adobe AudienceManager and Adobe Media Optimizer are achieving strong growth as our customers invest more in data-driven solutions.
In August, Adobe Marketing Cloud once again played a key role in the digital broadcast of the Olympic Games. NBC Sports used Adobe Primetime to power the digital delivery of the 2016 Rio Olympics, the largest digital Olympic Games in history.
In addition to being listed earlier this year as the Marketing Cloud Platform category Leader, Adobe Marketing Cloud was recognized by industry analysts during the quarter as a Leader in categories such as Mobile Application Development, Cross-Channel Campaign Management and Enterprise Marketing Software. We continue to drive new logo wins and expand our business across geographies and vertical markets. Some Q3 customer wins include T-Mobile, Nordstrom, Subaru, SunTrust Bank, AstraZeneca and the state of Tennessee.
At the core of our business are the people that make it happen. As a software business, we know that employees are our most strategic asset, and we're committed to increasing diversity. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including coding initiatives focusing on young women. We were recently recognized as one of Forbes' Most Innovative Companies, and we continue to garner Best Places to Work honors around the world, most recently in Australia and India.
In addition, our focus as a company on the environment and sustainability is important to our employees and to many investors. We were pleased to learn Adobe has been selected as a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time.
Today, every company is under pressure to be more connected and in tune with its customers, to know their history, their preferences and to create and deliver powerful, personalized experiences to them anywhere they go. Content and data are at the core of these exceptional experiences, and Adobe is the only company that brings these critical capabilities together in our market-leading cloud solutions.
The market opportunity is significant. Our strategy is sound. And our results demonstrate the leverage in our model. All of these are what make us excited about the opportunities ahead. Mark?"

GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.54, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.75. Strong per",1223,"Thanks, Shantanu. In the third quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,464,000,000, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.54, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.75. Strong performance across our 3 cloud offerings helped to deliver revenue towards the high end of our targeted range. Our cost discipline helped to deliver earnings upside while we continued to invest in the business to drive future growth.
Highlights in our third quarter include: solid growth with Digital Media ARR. We achieved our target of $285 million net new ARR during what is typically a seasonally soft quarter and keeps us on pace to achieve our annual target that we increased earlier this year; record Creative revenue of $803 million, which represents 39% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $404 million, which represents 10% year-over-year growth and was above our target for the quarter; strong growth in operating and net income; record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue; and 83% of Q3 revenue from recurring sources, an all-time high.
In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 29% year-over-year. The addition of $285 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $3.7 billion exiting Q3. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $803 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 39%. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $258 million during Q3 and exited the quarter with $3.26 billion of Creative ARR. Our Creative ARR is more than $1 billion higher than the peak annual Creative revenue we achieved when there was just perpetual licensing of Creative Suite.
Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals. Retention rates for subscriptions overall remained ahead of our original targeted projections. Creative Cloud ARPU across each of our commercial offerings continues to grow quarter-on-quarter, as new users on promotion pricing renew at full price after their promotions expire. We also drove strong subscription growth in the education market during the back-to-school season in Q3.
Our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in 3 key areas: growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users; addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market; driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the Photography Plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption; and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock, where revenue grew by over 40% year-over-year in Q3.
With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $187 million, which was in line with our expectations as we gradually migrate this business to be more recurring. Document Cloud ARR exiting Q3 grew to $442 million, which represents the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Helping this growth is our effort to drive adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future.
In Digital Marketing, we drove strong year-over-year growth in annual Adobe Marketing Cloud subscription bookings and greater than 25% year-over-year growth in subscription revenue. Reported Marketing Cloud revenue was a record $404 million, ahead of our Q3 target as a result of accelerated second half pipeline conversion and resulted in year-over-year growth of 10%.
Marketing Cloud retention, bookings in Q3 and our pipeline set us up for a strong Q4. Our increased focus on first year annual subscription value will help us more quickly convert our bookings into reported revenue as we look to FY '17 and beyond.
Mobile remains a key market trend for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 52% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter.
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $0.9 million. We had $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '16 versus $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '16. Thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $1.2 million.
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.2 million. We had $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '16 versus $9.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '15. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $19.4 million.
We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. Although there was a short-term impact on demand following the Brexit announcement in the U.K., it did not affect our ability to achieve our Q3 goals, and we do not anticipate any significant impact through the rest of FY '16.
In Q3, Adobe's effective tax rate was 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 45 days, which compares to 44 days in the year-ago quarter and 43 days last quarter.
Deferred revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion, up 38% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.45 billion compared to $4.32 billion at the end of Q2. Cash flow from operations was a record $518 million in the quarter.
During this year, we have been using excess domestic cash to buy back stock and drive our share count down. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares at a cost of $344 million. We currently have $800 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015.
Now I'll provide our financial outlook. We are targeting a fourth quarter revenue range of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion. In Digital Media, we expect to add slightly more than $300 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q4 to achieve our full year target of approximately $4 billion of ARR exiting the year. In Digital Marketing, we expect our business momentum to enable us to achieve Q4 Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 30%, which puts us on pace to achieve our annual growth target of approximately 20% for the year.
We are targeting our Q4 share count to be between 503 million to 505 million shares. We expect net nonoperating expense to be between $8 million and $10 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.60 to $0.66 per share and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.83 to $0.89.
For the year, our updated annual targets reflect our year-to-date results and our Q4 targets. We expect FY '16 annual revenue between $5.8 billion and $5.85 billion, GAAP EPS between $2.12 and $2.18 and non-GAAP EPS between $2.94 and $3.
In summary, Q3 was yet another strong quarter for Adobe, with the leverage in our model continuing to be reflected in our bottom line performance. Our year-to-date results and targets for Q4 keep us on track to meet or exceed all of the financial targets we provided at the outset of the year. We look forward to finishing the year strong and hope to see you at MAX and our upcoming financial analyst meeting in San Diego. Mike?"

And while I won't be updating our TAMs at this point, we are pleased with our performance, and I'll be happy to give you some color on how we see the opportunity ahead of us in terms of both the Creative Cloud as well as the Document Cloud. The Creative Cloud business is certainly being driven both by customer migration as well as by new customer adoption, and we certainly think that's going to be true for the Document business as well. As you know, we have tens of millions of people who have bought Acrobat over the lifetime of the Acrobat product. And for the first time, as we mentioned again in our prepared remarks, the number of subscription units of Acrobat actually exceeded the perpetual units. So we are pleased with how that transition is going. The playbook is exactly the same. It's about how do we migrate Acrobat customers to Acrobat DC. It's about adding new services like Sign. It's about enhancing new services that we can add to the business. But the thing I would also caution folks listening is to recognize that part of the Creative ARR that's being driven is also already being driven by the Document business. And so while we report the Document segment separately, let's already reflect that it's actually helping not just the Document business but also the Creative business. So we're pleased with that on mobile. PDF has continued to be adopted as a wide standard, which I think also augurs well for its continued growth."

Number one, when you hire people during the quarter, you don't get the full effect of their expense in the quarter. They're averaged out over the course of the quarter, so you don't get the full impact until the following quarter. And as you saw, we did add 500 heads this quarter. There's also a lot of spending that we do that's non-headcount related, particularly in marketing. And that can come and go despite what we do from a headcount perspective. But let me comment briefly on EPS overall because I know this will be a follow-on question. We have consistently shown that we have leverage in our model. I think Adobe has been a poster child of that for a number of years now. And with good revenue execution and good cost discipline, I think you've come to expect that from us. When we don't have very specific short-term investment needs, you're going to see earnings upside like you saw in the back half of this year, both in Q3 and our guidance in Q4. In the longer term, we see a lot of tremendous opportunity that's going to continue to require investment in sales and marketing. I mean, you saw that in the 500 heads that I mentioned we hired this quarter. So for the longer term, '17, '18, I would encourage you not to raise your EPS models right now. I would encourage you to recognize that we're going to continue to invest in sales and marketing, and wait as we provide '17 revenue and earnings guidance later this year."

As you know, there was a fairly healthy cohort of CS6 customers that continues to be an opportunity for us in the U.S. And we talked about international expansion also as an opportunity. Both Japan and Germany had a good quarter. When we looked at Q3, Japan and Germany grew -- run rate units grew greater than the overall units. So that's continuing to please us in terms of now seeing CS customers in those geographies migrate. Education had another great subscription units quarter, which means we're attracting that next generation of customers. When you look at overall subs in the quarter, it was a very healthy number. So we're attracting new customers to the platform, but even the migration opportunity continues to be one. I think one of the areas where we're executing well is whether you're an existing customer or whether you're a new customer, the work we are doing in terms of delivering new innovative products, what they're seeing with XD, you'll see some new announcements as well at MAX that I'm not going to preview here today, what we're doing with the VR and video, I think that also gives a lot of people the confidence that by adopting the Creative Cloud, it is the one-stop shop for all of their Creative needs.

I think we mentioned that when we think about big picture what's happening in the enterprise space, if the first era was all about back office automation and the second era was about what happened with productivity or front office, we really are motivated by this notion that it's going to be the experience business. And if you are trying to create the experience business, the only way to transform your company is by adopting an entire platform rather than piece-meal trying to buy individual products and try and fit that together. Virtually every new logo that we get is a multi-solution deal, because what they want is a complete offering that enables them to do that transformation. Given the breadth of existing customer base, certainly we're upselling all of them to multiple solutions. But whether it's a new logo acquisition or whether it's renewals, most of the deals are now multi-solution deals and much larger revenue to Adobe and value to the customer. So hopefully, that gives you some color in terms of the number of solutions that they're all adopting and how that's certainly migrating. To your point, it is a competitive advantage for us, most definitely."

I mean, if you look at the macro level, and we used to sell approximately 3 million units of Creative Suite a year and if you look at the numbers right now of where we are with Creative Cloud, it's clear that we have seen significant acceleration. Without a doubt, a large part of that acceleration is people who want Creative Cloud and are no longer pirating Creative products but are actually, as a result of the low price and the value that we're delivering, are using the entire subscription-based offering. So what we've done from a technical perspective already, we've actually ensured that people who download the trials, that once the trial expires that they don't have access to the products. And as you know, we've also shut down places, online websites where people could buy a repackaged box. So there's no question that we've already addressed piracy in a meaningful way. In terms of the installed base of pirates, I think the numbers for that are all over the map. But I think you can go back and look at the last numbers that we gave in terms of the addressable market, and you would see that there is still significant headroom. And the last thing I will mention is I think later this year, we'll also make some announcements. There's still a number of countries where we actually only sell CS6, and we're going to start to offer CC in all of those markets. And for the first time, we have the ability to offer differential pricing. So this is playing out exactly as we expected. Let's get the markets that are most developed. Let's address casual pirates. Let's hit the enterprise, and then let's now expand that into emerging markets where there was more piracy and now we have the ability to counter that, both through pricing as well as through technology."

And again, the strategy very much is let's have promotions to bring people onto our platform. And once we deliver the value, as they retain the annual boundaries, then we get the additional revenue. So it certainly has had an impact on ARR. The same thing is also true in the enterprise. When we first introduced the enterprise offerings, we had what we would call a sort of custom enterprise offering, which was more of a mirror of what they were accustomed to buying with the Creative Suite. As they all move off the 3-year cycle and they are renewing, we are definitely marketing to them the value of the entire Creative Cloud offering.

You're right. In an 83% recurring revenue model, particularly on the Creative side, you're going to, over time, have less cost of acquisition. You can drive more margin. On the Digital Marketing side, as we've discussed, that business is a very different business. We've got a lot of variable cost that comes with that business in the form of hosted infrastructure. It's going to be a very different margin profile. So we've got 2 different businesses with 2 different margin profiles both growing very fast right now.

Our vision for the Marketing Cloud is exactly the same, which is we are building a data platform that enables all of our products to work seamlessly together. We've made a lot of progress in that space. And the benefit for customers is certainly as they think about a campaign, as they think about customer segments, it naturally flows from the analytics product to the target product, to the campaign product. And in the enterprise space, we certainly see that our Marketing Cloud, while it's a leader, we have aspirations for that not to be an island unto itself but really to be the hub that interconnects all of the enterprise software. And so investing, as you point out, in these core data platforms to enable our customers to derive value and for us to continue to build a technology moat that will serve us well for many years is very much part of the strategy. And last but not least, customer expectations right now across the globe are that content flows seamlessly from our Creative Cloud into our Marketing Cloud, and so we do that. The one other comment I will make, you're right, there's a lot of conversation right now about machine learning and AI. It's something that we've invested in for years. I mean, we wouldn't be building the magic that we've built in Creative Cloud or Creative Suite without very deep technology in terms of machine learning. And the reality is when we think about Marketing Cloud, it's not about data collection. It's all about how we are driving insight and predictive, which is another form of machine learning, and that's what's really fueled our Marketing Cloud business.

I mean, the single point of interaction in a digital world for most customers used to be the website with AEM, as you point out. What's becoming table stakes increasingly is having that same kind of personalized experience across all digital channels, whether you're in airlines and that's the experience in a kiosk or a terminal, whether it's in retail and that's the particular experience when you walk into a retail store, whether it's in food and hospitality, whether you're coming to a drive-in. And so what's fueling our business is the ability to actually deliver that same experience across each of those different channels. And more specifically, what that means is as people are creating new mobile applications and using our AEM mobile solutions or as people are corresponding more with people and addressing our campaign solutions. And it's certainly our goal to provide that single-stop shop for all communication and all experience across all different channels. It's very definitely driving it. The one product that I'll again single out is AudienceManager really just continues to do extremely well in the enterprise. And I think the reason for that is all enterprises are starting off with this question of who are my customers, what are the demographics and how do I set that up. And AudienceManager is so much more than just a DMP. It actually allows enterprise to start off in a business strategy and say, ""Let me get a real clear understanding of my customers and what I'm trying to deliver to them across all different touch points."" So our vision of the Marketing Cloud and continuing to be the one-stop shop, I think it's paying off, and you're seeing that in the results. And big picture, since that was the last question, I think we continue to focus on the large opportunities ahead of us as a company. And we're helping create the world's content. We're helping enterprises use technology to deliver better customer value. I know Mark and I are pleased with our Q3 results. Our Q4 targets reflect the continued momentum in the business. It's good to be able to win in this macro environment, continue to reiterate our financial targets, and as you saw, increase our EPS target for the year. And so we think we're in great shape. We remain focused on driving innovation for our customers. I again want to thank customers, partners worldwide for their commitment and to our employers -- employees for continuing to drive innovation in this industry. We look forward to seeing you all at MAX. There are going to be some exciting announcements, and we will have an update for you. But thank you for joining us today."

In Q3, Adobe delivered another record quarter with revenue of $1.46 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75. These strong results are a reflection of our market leadership and momentum we have with Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud. We're enabling the world's leading brands to develop designed and data-driven digital experiences for their customers across every channel. Our unique value proposition continues to distance Adobe from our competitors.
In our Digital Media segment, we exited Q3 with $3.7 billion of annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, which represents an increase of $285 million quarter-over-quarter. The increase was a result of the continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments.
Creative Cloud is a one-stop shop for creativity and design, offering the world's best creative apps, services and training as well as a vibrant marketplace and community. We achieved record Creative revenue of $803 million in Q3, which represents 39% year-over-year growth. Creative ARR grew in line with our expectations and was driven by continued migration of Creative Suite users, the addition of new value to existing subscribers with services such as Adobe Stock, new customer acquisition in the education and hobbyist photography markets and retention of existing subscribers.
Creative Cloud continues to deliver powerful new innovations across our segments at a rapid pace. As the leader in digital photography, Adobe has set the standard for professional-grade photography across cameras and mobile devices with Adobe DNG, a raw file format we created. As of last week's iOS 10 release, Adobe DNG is now supported natively by iOS and Android, and Lightroom is the first cross-platform app to empower users with an end-to-end raw mobile photography workflow for high-quality image capture and editing.
New Creative Cloud innovation enables subscribers to design for emerging categories like Experience Design. Adobe XD, our solution for designing and prototyping websites and mobile apps, continues to gain momentum among users and industry watchers. Although still only available as a preview release, last week it was selected as 1 of 15 winners in the Fast Company Innovation by Design Awards, a distinct honor given the 1,700 entries.
Earlier this month, we showcased Adobe's leadership in the video category, unveiling advancements in virtual reality, character animation and 3D at the IBC Conference in Amsterdam. These new capabilities are enabling video creators of all kinds, from YouTubers to Hollywood Studios, to create, deliver, monetize and measure innovative and immersive media across multiple screens.
This morning, we announced the beta release of our new Adobe Stock Contributor Site, which reduces the friction for Creative Cloud users to promote and sell their work. The new site is integrated with Creative Cloud apps and introduces auto keywording, which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and tag content, streamlining the submission process and increasing the discoverability of Adobe Stock content.
In November, we will hold our annual MAX Creativity Conference in San Diego. We expect this year's MAX to be the largest gathering ever of designers, photographers, film makers and other creative professionals from around the world. As always, we look forward to unveiling new technology at MAX, including whole new categories of cloud-first Creative solutions.
The world's leading digital document service, Document Cloud, leverages PDF and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital using Acrobat desktop and mobile apps as well as integrated cloud services like Adobe Sign. In Q3, individual Acrobat subscription units exceeded perpetual units for the first time. And on adobe.com, over 90% of Acrobat customers chose the subscription offering. Document Cloud revenue was $187 million in Q3. Combined with Acrobat adoption reflected in Creative Cloud, Document Cloud continues to be an important growth business for Adobe.
In June, we announced the Cloud Signature Consortium, a group comprised of leading industry and academic organizations committed to building a new open standard for cloud-based digital signatures across mobile and web, so anyone can digitally sign documents from anywhere. Adobe led the way in establishing PDF as a digital document standard and is now raising the awareness of electronic signatures as a key to any business' digital transformation.
In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels. Whether it's financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment or automotive, entire industries are experiencing disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger loyalty and growth. Success hinges on a strong foundation of content and data, which enable a deep understanding of customer needs, development and delivery of consistent, personalized experiences and the ability to monitor business performance in real time.
In Q3, Adobe managed a record 23 trillion data transactions. Our customers in every major category of business are utilizing our machine learning algorithms to predict customer behavior and drive their business. Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, including Adobe Campaign, Adobe AudienceManager and Adobe Media Optimizer are achieving strong growth as our customers invest more in data-driven solutions.
In August, Adobe Marketing Cloud once again played a key role in the digital broadcast of the Olympic Games. NBC Sports used Adobe Primetime to power the digital delivery of the 2016 Rio Olympics, the largest digital Olympic Games in history.
In addition to being listed earlier this year as the Marketing Cloud Platform category Leader, Adobe Marketing Cloud was recognized by industry analysts during the quarter as a Leader in categories such as Mobile Application Development, Cross-Channel Campaign Management and Enterprise Marketing Software. We continue to drive new logo wins and expand our business across geographies and vertical markets. Some Q3 customer wins include T-Mobile, Nordstrom, Subaru, SunTrust Bank, AstraZeneca and the state of Tennessee.
At the core of our business are the people that make it happen. As a software business, we know that employees are our most strategic asset, and we're committed to increasing diversity. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including coding initiatives focusing on young women. We were recently recognized as one of Forbes' Most Innovative Companies, and we continue to garner Best Places to Work honors around the world, most recently in Australia and India.
In addition, our focus as a company on the environment and sustainability is important to our employees and to many investors. We were pleased to learn Adobe has been selected as a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time.
Today, every company is under pressure to be more connected and in tune with its customers, to know their history, their preferences and to create and deliver powerful, personalized experiences to them anywhere they go. Content and data are at the core of these exceptional experiences, and Adobe is the only company that brings these critical capabilities together in our market-leading cloud solutions.
The market opportunity is significant. Our strategy is sound. And our results demonstrate the leverage in our model. All of these are what make us excited about the opportunities ahead. Mark?"

In the third quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,464,000,000, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.54, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.75. Strong performance across our 3 cloud offerings helped to deliver revenue towards the high end of our targeted range. Our cost discipline helped to deliver earnings upside while we continued to invest in the business to drive future growth.
Highlights in our third quarter include: solid growth with Digital Media ARR. We achieved our target of $285 million net new ARR during what is typically a seasonally soft quarter and keeps us on pace to achieve our annual target that we increased earlier this year; record Creative revenue of $803 million, which represents 39% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $404 million, which represents 10% year-over-year growth and was above our target for the quarter; strong growth in operating and net income; record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue; and 83% of Q3 revenue from recurring sources, an all-time high.
In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 29% year-over-year. The addition of $285 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $3.7 billion exiting Q3. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $803 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 39%. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $258 million during Q3 and exited the quarter with $3.26 billion of Creative ARR. Our Creative ARR is more than $1 billion higher than the peak annual Creative revenue we achieved when there was just perpetual licensing of Creative Suite.
Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals. Retention rates for subscriptions overall remained ahead of our original targeted projections. Creative Cloud ARPU across each of our commercial offerings continues to grow quarter-on-quarter as new users on promotion pricing renew at full price after their promotions expire. We also drove strong subscription growth in the education market during the back-to-school season in Q3.
Our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in 3 key areas: growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users; addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market; driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the Photography Plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption; and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock, where revenue grew by over 40% year-over-year in Q3.
With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $187 million, which was in line with our expectations as we gradually migrate this business to be more recurring. Document Cloud ARR exiting Q3 grew to $442 million, which represents the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Helping this growth is our effort to drive adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future.
In Digital Marketing, we drove strong year-over-year growth in annual Adobe Marketing Cloud subscription bookings and greater than 25% year-over-year growth in subscription revenue. Reported Marketing Cloud revenue was a record $404 million, ahead of our Q3 target as a result of accelerated second half pipeline conversion and resulted in year-over-year growth of 10%.
Marketing Cloud retention, bookings in Q3 and our pipeline set us up for a strong Q4. Our increased focus on first year annual subscription value will help us more quickly convert our bookings into reported revenue as we look to FY '17 and beyond.
Mobile remains a key market trend for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 52% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter.
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $0.9 million. We had $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '16 versus $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '16. Thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $1.2 million.
From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.2 million. We had $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '16 versus $9.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '15. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $19.4 million.
We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. Although there was a short-term impact on demand following the Brexit announcement in the U.K., it did not affect our ability to achieve our Q3 goals, and we do not anticipate any significant impact through the rest of FY '16.
In Q3, Adobe's effective tax rate was 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 45 days, which compares to 44 days in the year-ago quarter and 43 days last quarter.
Deferred revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion, up 38% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.45 billion compared to $4.32 billion at the end of Q2. Cash flow from operations was a record $518 million in the quarter.
During this year, we have been using excess domestic cash to buy back stock and drive our share count down. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares at a cost of $344 million. We currently have $800 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015.
Now I'll provide our financial outlook. We are targeting a fourth quarter revenue range of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion. In Digital Media, we expect to add slightly more than $300 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q4 to achieve our full year target of approximately $4 billion of ARR exiting the year. In Digital Marketing, we expect our business momentum to enable us to achieve Q4 Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 30%, which puts us on pace to achieve our annual growth target of approximately 20% for the year.
We are targeting our Q4 share count to be between 503 million to 505 million shares. We expect net nonoperating expense to be between $8 million and $10 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.60 to $0.66 per share and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.83 to $0.89.
For the year, our updated annual targets reflect our year-to-date results and our Q4 targets. We expect FY '16 annual revenue between $5.8 billion and $5.85 billion, GAAP EPS between $2.12 and $2.18 and non-GAAP EPS between $2.94 and $3.
In summary, Q3 was yet another strong quarter for Adobe, with the leverage in our model continuing to be reflected in our bottom line performance. Our year-to-date results and targets for Q4 keep us on track to meet or exceed all of the financial targets we provided at the outset of the year. We look forward to finishing the year strong and hope to see you at MAX and our upcoming financial analyst meeting in San Diego. Mike?"

And while I won't be updating our TAMs at this point, we are pleased with our performance, and I'll be happy to give you some color on how we see the opportunity ahead of us in terms of both the Creative Cloud as well as the Document Cloud. The Creative Cloud business is certainly being driven both by customer migration as well as by new customer adoption, and we certainly think that's going to be true for the Document business as well. As you know, we have tens of millions of people who have bought Acrobat over the lifetime of the Acrobat product. And for the first time, as we mentioned again in our prepared remarks, the number of subscription units of Acrobat actually exceeded the perpetual units. So we are pleased with how that transition is going. The playbook is exactly the same. It's about how do we migrate Acrobat customers to Acrobat DC. It's about adding new services like Sign. It's about enhancing new services that we can add to the business. But the thing I would also caution folks listening is to recognize that part of the Creative ARR that's being driven is also already being driven by the Document business. And so while we report the Document segment separately, let's already reflect that it's actually helping not just the Document business but also the Creative business. So we're pleased with that on mobile. PDF has continued to be adopted as a wide standard, which I think also augurs well for its continued growth."

Number one, when you hire people during the quarter, you don't get the full effect of their expense in the quarter. They're averaged out over the course of the quarter, so you don't get the full impact until the following quarter. And as you saw, we did add 500 heads this quarter. There's also a lot of spending that we do that's non-headcount related, particularly in marketing. And that can come and go despite what we do from a headcount perspective. But let me comment briefly on EPS overall because I know this will be a follow-on question. We have consistently shown that we have leverage in our model. I think Adobe has been a poster child of that for a number of years now. And with good revenue execution and good cost discipline, I think you've come to expect that from us. When we don't have very specific short-term investment needs, you're going to see earnings upside like you saw in the back half of this year, both in Q3 and our guidance in Q4. In the longer term, we see a lot of tremendous opportunity that's going to continue to require investment in sales and marketing. I mean, you saw that in the 500 heads that I mentioned we hired this quarter. So for the longer term, '17, '18, I would encourage you not to raise your EPS models right now. I would encourage you to recognize that we're going to continue to invest in sales and marketing and wait as we provide '17 revenue and earnings guidance later this year."

As you know, there was a fairly healthy cohort of CS6 customers that continues to be an opportunity for us in the U.S. And we talked about international expansion also as an opportunity.

And if you are trying to create the experience business, the only way to transform your company is by adopting an entire platform rather than piece-meal, trying to buy individual products and try and fit that together. Virtually every new logo that we get is a multi-solution deal because what they want is a complete offering that enables them to do that transformation. Given the breadth of existing customer base, certainly we're upselling all of them to multiple solutions. But whether it's a new logo acquisition or whether it's renewals, most of the deals are now multi-solution deals and much larger revenue to Adobe and value to the customer. So hopefully, that gives you some color in terms of the number of solutions that they're all adopting and how that's certainly migrating.

I mean, if you look at the macro level, and we used to sell approximately 3 million units of Creative Suite a year and if you look at the numbers right now of where we are with Creative Cloud, it's clear that we have seen significant acceleration. Without a doubt, a large part of that acceleration is people who want Creative Cloud and are no longer pirating Creative products but are actually, as a result of the low price and the value that we're delivering, are using the entire subscription-based offering. So what we've done from a technical perspective already, we've actually ensured that people who download the trials, that once the trial expires that they don't have access to the products. And as you know, we've also shut down places, online websites where people could buy a repackaged box. So there's no question that we've already addressed piracy in a meaningful way. In terms of the installed base of pirates, I think the numbers for that are all over the map. But I think you can go back and look at the last numbers that we gave in terms of the addressable market, and you would see that there is still significant headroom. And the last thing I will mention is I think later this year, we'll also make some announcements. There's still a number of countries where we actually only sell CS6, and we're going to start to offer CC in all of those markets. And for the first time, we have the ability to offer differential pricing. So this is playing out exactly as we expected. Let's get the markets that are most developed. Let's address casual pirates. Let's hit the enterprise, and then let's now expand that into emerging markets where there was more piracy and now we have the ability to counter that, both through pricing as well as through technology."

When you think about it, Mark may have mentioned in his prepared remarks that when we think about all of the commercial offerings, the ARPU of all of the commercial offerings are increasing.

And again, the strategy very much is let's have promotions to bring people onto our platform. And once we deliver the value, as they retain the annual boundaries, then we get the additional revenue. So it certainly has had an impact on ARR. The same thing is also true in the enterprise. When we first introduced the enterprise offerings, we had what we would call a sort of custom enterprise offering, which was more of a mirror of what they were accustomed to buying with the Creative Suite. As they all move off the 3-year cycle and they are renewing, we are definitely marketing to them the value of the entire Creative Cloud offering. And we've seen adoption of that is fairly high again, which again leads to increased revenue per customer."

You're right. In an 83% recurring revenue model, particularly on the Creative side, you're going to, over time, have less cost of acquisition. You can drive more margin. On the Digital Marketing side, as we've discussed, that business is a very different business. We've got a lot of variable cost that comes with that business in the form of hosted infrastructure.

Is that part of what you were referring to earlier in terms of a frictionless self-service capability that you could offer customers? What does this really mean in terms of functionality and deliverables to the customer?"

Our vision for the Marketing Cloud is exactly the same, which is we are building a data platform that enables all of our products to work seamlessly together. We've made a lot of progress in that space. And the benefit for customers is certainly as they think about a campaign, as they think about customer segments, it naturally flows from the analytics product to the target product, to the campaign product. And in the enterprise space, we certainly see that our Marketing Cloud, while it's a leader, we have aspirations for that not to be an island unto itself but really to be the hub that interconnects all of the enterprise software. And so investing, as you point out, in these core data platforms to enable our customers to derive value and for us to continue to build a technology moat that will serve us well for many years is very much part of the strategy. And last but not least, customer expectations right now across the globe are that content flows seamlessly from our Creative Cloud into our Marketing Cloud, and so we do that. The one other comment I will make, you're right, there's a lot of conversation right now about machine learning and AI. It's something that we've invested in for years. I mean, we wouldn't be building the magic that we've built in Creative Cloud or Creative Suite without very deep technology in terms of machine learning. And the reality is when we think about Marketing Cloud, it's not about data collection. It's all about how we are driving insight and predictive, which is another form of machine learning, and that's what's really fueled our Marketing Cloud business. So continue to invest in deep technology across the company."

As you know, enterprise software, Q4 is the traditionally strong quarter, which, again, to the question that Brent also asked earlier, gives us confidence in the strength of the pipeline for the numbers that we said. But I think we executed well against it. And I think it also reflects the importance of our solutions for the customers that we are serving. I mean, if you are trying to move your business online, if you are trying to create a more personalized relationship with your customers, sure, you can defer the decision. You're only deferring the inevitable in terms of having to invest in technology that helps you automate that process. And so I would say part of it is the offering that we have, part of it is the execution that we have. And we have to just continue to be focused on it."

I mean, the single point of interaction in a digital world for most customers used to be the website with AEM, as you point out. What's becoming table stakes increasingly is having that same kind of personalized experience across all digital channels, whether you're in airlines and that's the experience in a kiosk or a terminal, whether it's in retail and that's the particular experience when you walk into a retail store, whether it's in food and hospitality, whether you're coming to a drive-in. And so what's fueling our business is the ability to actually deliver that same experience across each of those different channels. And more specifically, what that means is as people are creating new mobile applications and using our AEM mobile solutions or as people are corresponding more with people and addressing our campaign solutions. And it's certainly our goal to provide that single-stop shop for all communication and all experience across all different channels. It's very definitely driving it. The one product that I'll again single out is AudienceManager really just continues to do extremely well in the enterprise. And I think the reason for that is all enterprises are starting off with this question of who are my customers, what are the demographics and how do I set that up. And AudienceManager is so much more than just a DMP. It actually allows enterprise to start off in a business strategy and say, ""Let me get a real clear understanding of my customers and what I'm trying to deliver to them across all different touch points."" So our vision of the Marketing Cloud and continuing to be the one-stop shop, I think it's paying off, and you're seeing that in the results. And big picture, since that was the last question, I think we continue to focus on the large opportunities ahead of us as a company. And we're helping create the world's content. We're helping enterprises use technology to deliver better customer value. I know Mark and I are pleased with our Q3 results. Our Q4 targets reflect the continued momentum in the business. It's good to be able to win in this macro environment, continue to reiterate our financial targets, and as you saw, increase our EPS target for the year. And so we think we're in great shape. We remain focused on driving innovation for our customers. I again want to thank customers, partners worldwide for their commitment and to our employers -- employees for continuing to drive innovation in this industry. We look forward to seeing you all at MAX. There are going to be some exciting announcements, and we will have an update for you. But thank you for joining us today."

FY '16 was another great year for Adobe. Our record growth and net income were driven by strong performance in Creative Cloud annualized recurring revenue, continued growth of Adobe Document Cloud subscriptions and strong revenue and bookings for Adobe Marketing Cloud. 
In Q4, we delivered record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $0.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.90. For the year, we grew total revenue to $5.85 billion, which represents 22% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY '16 was $2.32, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.01. 
In Digital Media, we're advancing the state-of-the-art for content and setting the standard for creativity and digital documents. We exited the year with over $4 billion of annualized recurring revenue or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q4 was $316 million and was driven by continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creativity and design, and in FY '16, we expanded our customer base while continuing to deliver a rapid stream of product innovations. We achieved record Creative revenue of $886 million in Q4. For the year, we achieved Creative revenue of $3.2 billion, which represents 38% year-over-year growth. 
At the heart of the Creative Cloud is the promise of continuous innovation and the pace at which we are delivering new technology is accelerating. Last month at our MAX Creativity Conference, we unveiled next-generation desktop, mobile and cloud services for designers, photographers and filmmakers as well as sneak previews of creative technologies in the areas of virtual reality, image matching and digital painting. Our creative customers have always counted on us to turn the future into reality. Creative Cloud is the place designers expect to get the best tools and services in emerging categories like Experience Design and 3D. 
Earlier this week, we released 2 public betas: Adobe XD for Windows, the first all-in-one tool for designing, prototyping and sharing user experiences for web and mobile apps; and Project Felix, a new application that enables designers to create photorealistic composites with 2D images and 3D assets. Adobe Stock continues to gain momentum in the multibillion-dollar stock image category. 
In Q4, we launched the Adobe Stock Contributor Site, a new platform that allows users to upload and sell photos, illustrations, videos and vectors to the world's largest creative community. We also announced a partnership with Reuters that will bring their expansive video and photography library, across news, sports, business and entertainment, to be Adobe Stock service. 
With creativity exploding across the globe, geographic expansion represents a significant growth opportunity. In November, we launched Adobe Creative Cloud for teams in China. China is one of the world's largest digital economies and we can now address its extensive community of designers and creatives. 
We believe everyone is creative and should have the opportunity to express themselves. Adobe Spark, our consumer-friendly web and mobile solution for creating and sharing professional quality animated videos, web stories and social graphics, is gaining traction with small businesses, social marketers and students. We will continue to invest in Adobe Spark, which we see as a key way to reach a broader consumer audiences as part of Creative Cloud. 
The world's leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud, leverages the PDF standard we pioneered and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital. In Q4, Document Cloud revenue was $191 million, and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $475 million. 
Document Cloud represents the modern way for managing digital documents. Core cloud capabilities like mobile and collaboration as well as services like electronic signatures, have become a requirement for our customers. As a result, Document Cloud subscriptions now eclipse licensing of perpetual Acrobat software on adobe.com, and we expect to see stronger migration among our enterprise customers in the coming year. 
As part of the ongoing innovation delivered through Document Cloud, this quarter, we rolled out critical new scan functionality in our Adobe Reader mobile apps. In October, we expanded the global footprint for Adobe Document Cloud with the launch of the Adobe Sign service in Japan. In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels. Whether it's financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment, or automotive, entire industries are experiencing digital disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger brand loyalty and growth. 
Adobe's winning formula is built on a unique foundation of content and data, which enables deep customer insights; development and delivery of consistent personalized experiences; and the ability to monitor and optimize business performance in real time. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to be the most comprehensive offering in the exploding Digital Marketing category with best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaigns and data management as well as media optimization. We're seeing strong demand for the Adobe Marketing Cloud across the globe as evidenced by the sold-out crowds at events this quarter in London, Paris, Munich and Tokyo. Major customer wins this quarter included Lufthansa, Pandora, United Healthcare, UPS, U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency and Verizon. 
In Q4, Adobe managed a record 33.5 trillion data transactions, providing us with an unparalleled view into real-time business and cultural trends. Debuting in 2016, the Adobe Digital Price Index has redefined how inflation and consumer goods prices are tracked and measured and has received broad support from the world's leading economists. Leveraging over 20 billion visits to retail websites, Adobe Digital Insights holiday shopping report accurately predicted online sales for this holiday season within a margin of error of less than 0.5%. 
Adobe measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers, and $7.50 out of every $10 spent online with the top 500 U.S. retailers go through Adobe Marketing Cloud. This tremendous volume of data puts Adobe in the unique position to deliver highly accurate, census-based online sales totals, pricing and product availability trends each holiday season. 
Last month, we announced our intention to acquire TubeMogul, a leading demand-site video advertising platform, further strengthening our leadership in Digital Marketing and adtech. Adobe is currently a leader in search, display and social advertising, planning and delivery with our Adobe Media Optimizer solution. The addition of TubeMogul to our adtech capabilities will enable Adobe's customers to maximize their video advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV. Together, Adobe and TubeMogul will enable our customers to identify the right audience segments and plan, execute and measure paid media performance across any device. We expect the transaction to close in December. 
In September, we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to help enterprises embrace digital transformation. Adobe announced it will make Microsoft Azure, the preferred platform for our cloud services, providing customers with a trusted, enterprise-grade global platform and that we will integrate our Adobe Marketing Cloud technology with Microsoft's Dynamics 365 Enterprise and Power BI. Microsoft announced it will make Adobe Marketing Cloud the preferred marketing service for its enterprise customers and its extensive partner and developer ecosystem. 
Adobe's success has been a result of our ability to predict the future. While others are jumping on the machine learning and AI bandwagon, these capabilities have been the foundation of our innovation for decades. Our engineers and scientists are squarely focused on harnessing the massive volume of content and data assets captured in our cloud solutions to tackle today's complex experience challenges. 
Last month, we announced Adobe Sensei, a new framework and set of intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei's services address the critical demands of our creative, document and marketing customers from image matching across millions of images to understanding the meaning and sentiment of digital documents to finally targeting important audience segments. Dozens of these intelligent services have been deployed in our products to date, and we are significantly increasing our investment. We also intend to make Adobe Sensei available to our ecosystem of partners, ISVs and developers. 
Adobe's success over the decade is in no small part due to the unique culture we have created. In October, we were named a Best Multinational Workplace by the Great Places to Work Institute, and this month, we were among the top 10 employers on Glassdoor's 2017 List of 50 Best Places to Work. We know that a strong workforce is a diverse workforce and we are committed to increasing diversity among our employee base. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including youth coding and media-making initiatives to inspire future female technologists. 
Being a good global citizen is important to our employees, customers and investors. For the first time, Adobe has been selected as a component of the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. For the third year in a row, we received a perfect score on the 2017 Corporate Equality Index report from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In light of these accomplishments, Adobe's brand momentum has never been stronger, and we were honored to be 1 of the 5 fastest-growing brands on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking. 
FY '16 was a great year for Adobe. We're driving growth in each of the large categories we have created. With a $64 billion total addressable market by 2019, our opportunity has never been greater. Our mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant, and our strategy, our technology and our people set us up for continued success. 
I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and innovation over the past year. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead. Mark?"

In FY '16, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $5.85 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $2.32 and non-GAAP EPS was $3.01. This performance is the result of strong execution against our strategy, and noteworthy achievements, including: growing Digital Media ARR by $1.13 billion during the year to exit fiscal 2016 with $4.01 billion, well ahead of our original target of $3.875 billion. Achieving 38% year-over-year revenue growth in our Creative business and exiting the year with $3.54 billion of ARR. 
Delivering Document Cloud revenue of $765 million and growing ARR to $475 million, both of which reflect progress against our goal of migrating this to a subscription business. Achieving record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.63 billion and 20% annual year-over-year growth. Generating $2.2 billion in operating cash flow during the year, which represents 50% year-over-year growth. Growing deferred revenue to $2 billion and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $3.4 billion exiting the year. Together, this represents approximately $5.4 billion of contracted revenue that will be recognized over time, and returning over $1 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. 
In the fourth quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. Highlights in the quarter included: achieving $316 million of net new Digital Media ARR; record Creative revenue of $886 million, which represents 33% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth; strong growth in operating and net income; record cash flow from operations in deferred revenue; and 82% of Q4 revenue from recurring sources. 
In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 23% year-over-year. The addition of 316 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter, grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.01 billion exiting Q4. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $886 million, which represents 33% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $283 million during Q4 and exited the quarter with $3.54 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals and upsells. Creative Cloud ARPU grew quarter-over-quarter across all offerings in Q4. 
As we outlined at our Analyst Meeting in November, our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in 3 key areas: growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users, addressing piracy and growing our installed base of education market; driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as photography plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption; and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock. 
Some highlights against these goals during the year include: 53% year-over-year subscription growth outside the U.S., broadly expanding our base of users by adding more than 1 million Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscribers during the year and growing Adobe stock revenue by more than 40% year-over-year. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $191 million. Document Cloud ARR grew to $475 million, the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Driving this growth was adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future. 
In Digital Marketing. We achieved record quarterly and annual Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue. Entering the year, we targeted approximately 20% Adobe Marketing Cloud annual revenue growth and approximately 30% annual subscription value or ASV bookings growth. Included in these targets in FY '16 was an expectation of approximately $45 million of perpetual revenue. Relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year, we experienced increased demand for on-premise, perpetual licensed solutions by some customers. When we combine ASV bookings for the year with an over achievement in first year value of perpetual contracts, we achieved 30% bookings growth. 
In Q4, we achieved Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth. With this Q4 performance in FY '16, we achieved 20% annual revenue growth. Mobile remains a key driver for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 55% of total Adobe analytics transactions in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $4.5 million. We had $8.1 million in hedged gains in Q4 FY '16 versus $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '16. Thus, the net sequential currency decreased to revenue considering hedging gains was $0.3 million. 
From a year-over-year currency perspective. FX decreased revenue by $9.1 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '16 versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '15. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decreased to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.3 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q4, Adobe's effective tax rate was 12.5% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax audits. Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 47 days in the year-ago quarter, and 45 days last quarter. 
Deferred revenue grew to a record $2 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.76 billion, compared to $4.45 billion at the end of Q3. Cash flow from operations was a record $696 million in the quarter. During this year, we have been using excess domestic cash to buy back stock and reduce our share count. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a cost of $331 million. We currently have $500 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015. 
Now I'll provide our financial outlook. Entering FY '17, we have great momentum and continue to see strength across our 3 cloud businesses. We are excited about our large addressable markets, and are uniquely positioned to drive strong top line and bottom line growth. At our November 2 Financial Analyst Meeting, we outlined our long-term strategy and provided long-term growth rates and preliminary FY '17 financial targets. We remain confident in our ability to operationally execute against those targets and we are reaffirming our long-term FY '15 to FY '18 financial targets today. 
Since the Analyst Meeting, the U.S. dollar has strengthened considerably. Were it not for this currency fluctuation, we would be reaffirming all of the preliminary FY '17 targets we provided on November 2. Based on today's FX rates, we believe our hedging programs will effectively mitigate the impact of these rate changes in Q1 and Q2. But if they persist, current FX rates will affect our ability to achieve the preliminary annual targets due to the impact in the second half of FY '17. 
As a result, we are providing the following FY '17 targets: we expect total revenue of approximately $6.95 billion, which factoring in the extra week in FY '16, represents approximately 21% year-over-year growth. We continue to target Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20%. As you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year, and if necessary, we revalue ARR at year-end for the current currency rates. FX rate changes have resulted in a $27 million reduction and an updated Digital Media ARR exiting FY '16 of $3.99 billion. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated Investor data sheet and we continue to expect approximately 25% Digital Media ARR growth, which equates to approximately $1 billion of net new ARR in the year, leading to approximately $5 billion of Digital Media ARR exiting FY '17. 
By quarter, we expect to add approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1, followed by sequential growth of net new ARR in Q2. Then in Q3, we anticipate a seasonally driven sequential decline followed by strong seasonal growth in the fourth quarter to achieve the target for the year. In Digital Marketing. We continue to target Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth of approximately 20% and Adobe Marketing Cloud ASV bookings growth of approximately 30%. Despite the currency impact, we expect to achieve the same FY '17 EPS targets we provided on November 2, which are a GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.85 and non-GAAP earnings per share targeted at approximately $3.75. 
During the year, we expect revenue and earnings per share to grow sequentially each quarter with the largest sequential increase in Q4. Starting with FY '17. We are providing quarterly estimates for our most likely results rather than providing targeted ranges due to the increased predictability in our business. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.625 billion. We expect to achieve approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1. We expect Digital Media Q1 segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%, and Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%. When comparing Q1 FY '17 targets, it is helpful to remember that Q1 FY '16 had an extra week due to our 52/53-week fiscal year calendar. Factoring the extra week in Q1 FY '16, all Q1 FY '17 revenue targets represent greater than 20% year-over-year growth. 
We are targeting our Q1 share count to be approximately 501 million shares. We expect net nonoperating expense to be approximately $13 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 tax rate of approximately 15% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share target of approximately $0.71 and Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.87. Finally, the targets we are providing today do not reflect our planned acquisition of TubeMogul, which we expect to close in December. We plan to issue updated Q1 and annual FY '17 financial targets after the acquisition closes. We strongly believe analysts and investors should wait for the close of the acquisition to combine expected results of both companies into an updated model for the coming year. We plan to host a brief call to discuss our strategy and targets that factor in items such as a stub quarter period and accounting implications. 
In summary, 2016 was another strong year for Adobe. We are the market leader with all 3 of our cloud solutions, and we are executing well against a large and growing addressable market. We're excited about what lies ahead for Adobe and look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming year. Mike?"

You're right, and thank you for the acknowledgment of how we're executing against the Creative business. From our point of view, our Creative Cloud is very much about not just migrating the core customer segment, but significantly through market expansion, making sure that we're targeting new customers. I'd point out 2 or 3 different initiatives in that space. The first one is clearly in the Creative Cloud Photography Plan. As you know, we used to have Lightroom and Photoshop Elements, we're increasingly seeing those consumers adopt a Creative Cloud Photography Plan, that continues to do really well in terms of the new customer acquisition that we have. The second category that I'll talk about are products like Adobe Spark. We're seeing more and more people who have a story to tell, wanting to use Adobe Spark. And I think in this year, you'll see that also start to get integrated and folded into the Creative Cloud much like mobile apps are. They represent a big customer acquisition and adoption and migration opportunity. And the third, I've continue to impress upon education. Education is a segment does really well in Creative Cloud. It's that next-generation or whether it's K-12 students or higher ed. As they get exposed to our products, clearly as they enter university or the marketplace, they are using our products, all of which we look at as positive trends for the future."

But in addition to that, I would just continue to emphasize this notion of how all enterprises are being transformed by what's happening in digital and the urgency with which they really need to think about technology that they can leverage to become more of an experienced business. I think that continues to be unabated. As you saw, we had a pretty strong Q4 revenue growth over 30% year-over-year in the Digital Marketing business. And I think the opportunity continues to be one that we're excited about not just in the U.S. but internationally as well.

And we're pleased with both the revenue and the bookings growth for the year. I do want to clarify that we think the cloud remains the long-term right offering for our customers, but it is a lot. The fact that we have an on-premise solution, we continue to think it's a competitive advantage. And globally, it's hard to predict which option our customers might prefer on a quarter by quarter basis. But I want to reiterate, it's all from our point of view, good revenue. When we look at the different components of revenue in the Marketing Cloud and you look at subscription, which we think is the healthiest long-term predictor and you look at perpetual and consulting. The subscription bookings revenue grew 29% year-over-year in FY '16, so stronger than the overall 20%. And if you actually go back to what Mark showed at the FA meeting and look at the pie chart, it was exactly in line with what we had predicted for Q4. Relative to the beginning of the year to your question, we certainly over achieved a little bit in perpetual revenue relative to subscription bookings. However, when you normalize that and you take given perpetual revenues a multiyear commitment and look at just the first year component, I think it's really small. And so relative to overall growth, we feel good about it. The mix was slightly different relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year."

The other large opportunity as you know, for us is in the Digital Marketing. And that's driven by 2 different phenomena. The first phenomenon is as we increasingly have global agreements with U.S. multinationals, they expect deployment of our solutions whether it's in retail, financial services or other places, it also be  true in China and in India, and in Australia and Southeast Asia. So that's continuing to drive some growth. And then even local companies in all of those markets as they realize mobile in particular there and the digital disruption there. There's excitement around our products. So in Digital Media, it's all about the adoption of Creative Cloud and Digital Media. It's both about global adoption of our Digital Marketing solutions as well as local companies increasingly recognizing that they have to migrate to digital with mobile being the key driver there."

The first is 3 years ago when we had first introduced the ETLA program for our customers. It was really more of a reflection of what they were licensing for Creative Suite. So I called them more of these custom solutions, which reflected what versions of different products that we're using. Starting in fiscal '16, we move to a more complete solution, which is people were licensing all of the products and the fact that it was integrated. The field organization did a really great job of articulating the benefits of moving to the entire complete solution. And the second thing that actually happened in the year was also true-ups, which is people are finding as they are deploying more and more of Creative Cloud, they were volunteering during true-ups so new logos as well as moving from what I would say, custom to complete. And clearly, resulting in an increase in ARPU for the enterprise. And we continue to believe that, that represents a large opportunity in the U.S. and internationally for FY '17."

And if you look at just the Document Cloud services, ARR, it probably underrepresents the momentum that we had with the Document Cloud and Acrobat businesses because as you know, significant number of people also use Acrobat DC when they're using the Creative Cloud.

And so when you look at the ARR, I think the ARR growth was over 20% for the year.

To your point, we do have now more end-to-end capabilities all the way from delivery to monetization for our publisher as well as our advertiser customers. And I think what's perhaps most strategic, the integration between their DSB offering and our DMV, we're seeing more and more people wanting to integrate with our industry-leading audience manager DMV. That has really become in fiscal '16, a driver of the adoption of the platform.  And so I think our goal when this closes, will be to share more about what we are planning to do strategically. But big picture, it just enables us to be more of a trusted platform for the Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Revenue Officers. And to enable both personalization in terms of delivery and better segmentation in deriving value from all of the data that they have.

If I had to give you a little bit of color as it relates to what happened in retention, I think in 2011 when we first outlined the opportunities, we estimated at that point that even at 80% retention rates for the core Creative, it would be great for the business. Clearly, retention for the call creative is higher than that. And in fact, for the entire base, that includes -- if you could mute your line also, that would be great. Thank you. And so what I said was where retention for the core Creative is really higher than that. And when you think about it for the entire base that includes consumers, it's also higher than 80. So as we look at retention, it's actually a very good indicator of the core health of the business. And we're pleased with that. With respect to the Creative Cloud Photography Plan. It just continues to be a very vibrant way for us to attract new customers to our particular platform. 
And since that was the last question, for me, my summary remarks would be while FY '16 was clearly a great year. In many ways, I'm even more excited about the long-term opportunities that we've created for ourselves as a company. When we think about the 2 big areas of focus for Adobe: Empowering people to create and transforming how businesses compete. It just represents massive opportunities in our content and data platform. Really allow us to uniquely address this need. On the Creative business, just continuing to enable any individual who has a story to tell, to tell them across any medium, any device. And on the enterprise side, enabling them to leverage technology to reinvent themselves as an experienced business, represent large unmet needs. I feel good that we're innovating while staying in an extremely select group of people and companies that are delivering impressive both top line and bottom line growth.

FY '16 was another great year for Adobe. Our record growth and net income were driven by strong performance in Creative Cloud annualized recurring revenue, continued growth of Adobe Document Cloud subscriptions and strong revenue and bookings for Adobe Marketing Cloud. 
In Q4, we delivered record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $0.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.90. For the year, we grew total revenue to $5.85 billion, which represents 22% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY '16 was $2.32, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.01. 
In Digital Media, we're advancing the state-of-the-art for content and setting the standard for creativity and digital documents. We exited the year with over $4 billion of annualized recurring revenue or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q4 was $316 million and was driven by continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creativity and design, and in FY '16, we expanded our customer base while continuing to deliver a rapid stream of product innovations. We achieved record Creative revenue of $886 million in Q4. For the year, we achieved Creative revenue of $3.2 billion, which represents 38% year-over-year growth. 
At the heart of the Creative Cloud is the promise of continuous innovation and the pace at which we are delivering new technology is accelerating. Last month at our MAX Creativity Conference, we unveiled next-generation desktop, mobile and cloud services for designers, photographers and filmmakers as well as sneak previews of creative technologies in the areas of virtual reality, image matching and digital painting. Our creative customers have always counted on us to turn the future into reality. Creative Cloud is the place designers expect to get the best tools and services in emerging categories like Experience Design and 3D. 
Earlier this week, we released 2 public betas: Adobe XD for Windows, the first all-in-one tool for designing, prototyping and sharing user experiences for web and mobile apps; and Project Felix, a new application that enables designers to create photorealistic composites with 2D images and 3D assets. Adobe Stock continues to gain momentum in the multibillion-dollar stock image category. 
In Q4, we launched the Adobe Stock Contributor Site, a new platform that allows users to upload and sell photos, illustrations, videos and vectors to the world's largest creative community. We also announced a partnership with Reuters that will bring their expansive video and photography library, across news, sports, business and entertainment, to be Adobe Stock service. 
With creativity exploding across the globe, geographic expansion represents a significant growth opportunity. In November, we launched Adobe Creative Cloud for teams in China. China is one of the world's largest digital economies and we can now address its extensive community of designers and creatives. 
We believe everyone is creative and should have the opportunity to express themselves. Adobe Spark, our consumer-friendly web and mobile solution for creating and sharing professional quality animated videos, web stories and social graphics, is gaining traction with small businesses, social marketers and students. We will continue to invest in Adobe Spark, which we see as a key way to reach a broader consumer audiences as part of Creative Cloud. 
The world's leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud, leverages the PDF standard we pioneered and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital. In Q4, Document Cloud revenue was $191 million, and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $475 million. 
Document Cloud represents the modern way for managing digital documents. Core cloud capabilities like mobile and collaboration as well as services like electronic signatures, have become a requirement for our customers. As a result, Document Cloud subscriptions now eclipse licensing of perpetual Acrobat software on adobe.com, and we expect to see stronger migration among our enterprise customers in the coming year. 
As part of the ongoing innovation delivered through Document Cloud, this quarter, we rolled out critical new scan functionality in our Adobe Reader mobile apps. In October, we expanded the global footprint for Adobe Document Cloud with the launch of the Adobe Sign service in Japan. In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels. Whether it's financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment, or automotive, entire industries are experiencing digital disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger brand loyalty and growth. 
Adobe's winning formula is built on a unique foundation of content and data, which enables deep customer insights; development and delivery of consistent personalized experiences; and the ability to monitor and optimize business performance in real time. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to be the most comprehensive offering in the exploding Digital Marketing category with best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaigns and data management as well as media optimization. We're seeing strong demand for the Adobe Marketing Cloud across the globe as evidenced by the sold-out crowds at events this quarter in London, Paris, Munich and Tokyo. Major customer wins this quarter included Lufthansa, Pandora, United Healthcare, UPS, U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency and Verizon. 
In Q4, Adobe managed a record 33.5 trillion data transactions, providing us with an unparalleled view into real-time business and cultural trends. Debuting in 2016, the Adobe Digital Price Index has redefined how inflation and consumer goods prices are tracked and measured and has received broad support from the world's leading economists. Leveraging over 20 billion visits to retail websites, Adobe Digital Insights holiday shopping report accurately predicted online sales for this holiday season within a margin of error of less than 0.5%. 
Adobe measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers, and $7.50 out of every $10 spent online with the top 500 U.S. retailers go through Adobe Marketing Cloud. This tremendous volume of data puts Adobe in the unique position to deliver highly accurate, census-based online sales totals, pricing and product availability trends each holiday season. 
Last month, we announced our intention to acquire TubeMogul, a leading demand-site video advertising platform, further strengthening our leadership in Digital Marketing and adtech. Adobe is currently a leader in search, display and social advertising, planning and delivery with our Adobe Media Optimizer solution. The addition of TubeMogul to our adtech capabilities will enable Adobe's customers to maximize their video advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV. Together, Adobe and TubeMogul will enable our customers to identify the right audience segments and plan, execute and measure paid media performance across any device. We expect the transaction to close in December. 
In September, we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to help enterprises embrace digital transformation. Adobe announced it will make Microsoft Azure, the preferred platform for our cloud services, providing customers with a trusted, enterprise-grade global platform and that we will integrate our Adobe Marketing Cloud technology with Microsoft's Dynamics 365 Enterprise and Power BI. Microsoft announced it will make Adobe Marketing Cloud the preferred marketing service for its enterprise customers and its extensive partner and developer ecosystem. 
Adobe's success has been a result of our ability to predict the future. While others are jumping on the machine learning and AI bandwagon, these capabilities have been the foundation of our innovation for decades. Our engineers and scientists are squarely focused on harnessing the massive volume of content and data assets captured in our cloud solutions to tackle today's complex experience challenges. 
Last month, we announced Adobe Sensei, a new framework and set of intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei's services address the critical demands of our creative, document and marketing customers from image matching across millions of images to understanding the meaning and sentiment of digital documents to finally targeting important audience segments. Dozens of these intelligent services have been deployed in our products to date, and we are significantly increasing our investment. We also intend to make Adobe Sensei available to our ecosystem of partners, ISVs and developers. 
Adobe's success over the decade is in no small part due to the unique culture we have created. In October, we were named a Best Multinational Workplace by the Great Places to Work Institute, and this month, we were among the top 10 employers on Glassdoor's 2017 List of 50 Best Places to Work. We know that a strong workforce is a diverse workforce and we are committed to increasing diversity among our employee base. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including youth coding and media-making initiatives to inspire future female technologists. 
Being a good global citizen is important to our employees, customers and investors. For the first time, Adobe has been selected as a component of the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. For the third year in a row, we received a perfect score on the 2017 Corporate Equality Index report from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In light of these accomplishments, Adobe's brand momentum has never been stronger, and we were honored to be 1 of the 5 fastest-growing brands on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking. 
FY '16 was a great year for Adobe. We're driving growth in each of the large categories we have created. With a $64 billion total addressable market by 2019, our opportunity has never been greater. Our mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant, and our strategy, our technology and our people set us up for continued success. 
I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and innovation over the past year. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead. Mark?"

Delivering Document Cloud revenue of $765 million and growing ARR to $475 million, both of which reflect progress against our goal of migrating this to a subscription business. Achieving record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.63 billion and 20% annual year-over-year growth. Generating $2.2 billion in operating cash flow during the year, which represents 50% year-over-year growth. Growing deferred revenue to $2 billion and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $3.4 billion exiting the year. Together, this represents approximately $5.4 billion of contracted revenue that will be recognized over time, and returning over $1 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. 
In the fourth quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. Highlights in the quarter included: achieving $316 million of net new Digital Media ARR; record Creative revenue of $886 million, which represents 33% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth; strong growth in operating and net income; record cash flow from operations in deferred revenue; and 82% of Q4 revenue from recurring sources. 
In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 23% year-over-year. The addition of $316 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.01 billion exiting Q4. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $886 million, which represents 33% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $283 million during Q4 and exited the quarter with $3.54 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals and upsells. Creative Cloud ARPU grew quarter-over-quarter across all offerings in Q4. 
As we outlined at our Analyst Meeting in November, our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in 3 key areas: growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users, addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market; driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the photography plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption; and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock. 
Some highlights against these goals during the year include: 53% year-over-year subscription growth outside the U.S., broadly expanding our base of users by adding more than 1 million Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscribers during the year and growing Adobe stock revenue by more than 40% year-over-year. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $191 million. Document Cloud ARR grew to $475 million, the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Driving this growth was adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future. 
In Digital Marketing. We achieved record quarterly and annual Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue. Entering the year, we targeted approximately 20% Adobe Marketing Cloud annual revenue growth and approximately 30% annual subscription value or ASV bookings growth. Included in these targets in FY '16 was an expectation of approximately $45 million of perpetual revenue. Relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year, we experienced increased demand for on-premise, perpetual licensed solutions by some customers. When we combine ASV bookings for the year with an over achievement in first year value of perpetual contracts, we achieved 30% bookings growth. 
In Q4, we achieved Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth. With this Q4 performance in FY '16, we achieved 20% annual revenue growth. Mobile remains a key driver for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 55% of total Adobe analytics transactions in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $4.5 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '16 versus $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '16. Thus, the net sequential currency decreased to revenue considering hedging gains was $0.3 million. 
From a year-over-year currency perspective. FX decreased revenue by $9.1 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '16 versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '15. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decreased to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.3 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q4, Adobe's effective tax rate was 12.5% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax audits. Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 47 days in the year-ago quarter, and 45 days last quarter. 
Deferred revenue grew to a record $2 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.76 billion compared to $4.45 billion at the end of Q3. Cash flow from operations was a record $696 million in the quarter. During this year, we have been using excess domestic cash to buy back stock and reduce our share count. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a cost of $331 million. We currently have $500 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015. 
Now I'll provide our financial outlook. Entering FY '17, we have great momentum and continue to see strength across our 3 cloud businesses. We are excited about our large addressable markets, and are uniquely positioned to drive strong top line and bottom line growth. 
At our November 2 financial analyst meeting, we outlined our long-term strategy and provided long-term growth rates and preliminary FY '17 financial targets. We remain confident in our ability to operationally execute against those targets and we are reaffirming our long-term FY '15 to FY '18 financial targets today. 
Since the analyst meeting, the U.S. dollar has strengthened considerably. Were it not for this currency fluctuation, we would be reaffirming all of the preliminary FY '17 targets we provided on November 2. Based on today's FX rates, we believe our hedging programs will effectively mitigate the impact of these rate changes in Q1 and Q2. But if they persist, current FX rates will affect our ability to achieve the preliminary annual targets due to the impact in the second half of FY '17. 
As a result, we are providing the following FY '17 targets: we expect total revenue of approximately $6.95 billion, which factoring in the extra week in FY '16, represents approximately 21% year-over-year growth. We continue to target Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20%. As you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year, and if necessary, we revalue ARR at year-end for the current currency rates. FX rate changes have resulted in a $27 million reduction and an updated Digital Media ARR exiting FY '16 of $3.99 billion. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated Investor data sheet, and we continue to expect approximately 25% Digital Media ARR growth, which equates to approximately $1 billion of net new ARR in the year, leading to approximately $5 billion of Digital Media ARR exiting FY '17. 
By quarter, we expect to add approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1, followed by sequential growth of net new ARR in Q2. Then in Q3, we anticipate a seasonally driven sequential decline followed by strong seasonal growth in the fourth quarter to achieve the target for the year. In Digital Marketing. We continue to target Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth of approximately 20% and Adobe Marketing Cloud ASV bookings growth of approximately 30%. Despite the currency impact, we expect to achieve the same FY '17 EPS targets we provided on November 2, which are a GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.85 and non-GAAP earnings per share targeted at approximately $3.75. 
During the year, we expect revenue and earnings per share to grow sequentially each quarter, with the largest sequential increase in Q4. Starting with FY '17, we are providing quarterly estimates for our most likely results rather than providing targeted ranges due to the increased predictability in our business. 
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.625 billion. We expect to achieve approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1. We expect Digital Media Q1 segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%, and Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%. When comparing Q1 FY '17 targets, it is helpful to remember that Q1 FY '16 had an extra week due to our 52/53-week fiscal year calendar. Factoring the extra week in Q1 FY '16, all Q1 FY '17 revenue targets represent greater than 20% year-over-year growth. 
We are targeting our Q1 share count to be approximately 501 million shares. We expect net nonoperating expense to be approximately $13 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 tax rate of approximately 15% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share target of approximately $0.71 and Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.87. 
Finally, the targets we are providing today do not reflect our planned acquisition of TubeMogul, which we expect to close in December. We plan to issue updated Q1 and annual FY '17 financial targets after the acquisition closes. We strongly believe analysts and investors should wait for the close of the acquisition to combine expected results of both companies into an updated model for the coming year. We plan to host a brief call to discuss our strategy and targets that factor in items such as a stub quarter period and accounting implications. 
In summary, 2016 was another strong year for Adobe. We are the market leader with all 3 of our cloud solutions, and we are executing well against a large and growing addressable market. We're excited about what lies ahead for Adobe and look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming year. Mike?"

You're right, and thank you for the acknowledgment of how we're executing against the Creative business. From our point of view, our Creative Cloud is very much about not just migrating the core customer segment, but significantly through market expansion, making sure that we're targeting new customers. I'd point out 2 or 3 different initiatives in that space. The first one clearly is Creative Cloud Photography Plan. As you know, we used to have Lightroom and Photoshop Elements, we're increasingly seeing those consumers adopt a Creative Cloud Photography Plan. That continues to do really well in terms of the new customer acquisition that we have. A second category that I'll talk about are products like Adobe Spark. We're seeing more and more people who have a story to tell, wanting to use Adobe Spark. And I think in this year, you'll see that also start to get integrated and folded into the Creative Cloud much like mobile apps are. They represent a big customer acquisition and adoption and migration opportunity. And the third, I've continued to impress upon education. Education, as a segment, does really well in Creative Cloud. It's that next generation or whether it's K-12 students or higher ed. As they get exposed to our products, clearly as they enter university or the marketplace, they are using our products, all of which we look at as positive trends for the future."

I do want to clarify that we think the cloud remains the long-term right offering for our customers, but it is a -- the fact that we have an on-premise solution, we continue to think it's a competitive advantage. And globally, it's hard to predict which option our customers might prefer on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But I want to reiterate, it's all from our point of view, good revenue. When we look at the different components of revenue in the Marketing Cloud and you look at subscription, which we think is the healthiest long-term predictor and then you look at perpetual and consulting. The subscription bookings revenue grew 29% year-over-year in FY '16, so stronger than the overall 20%. And if you actually go back to what Mark showed at the FA meeting and look at the pie chart, it was exactly in line with what we had predicted for Q4. Relative to the beginning of the year to your question, we certainly over achieved a little bit in perpetual revenue relative to subscription bookings. However, when you normalize that and you take given perpetual revenues, a multiyear commitment and look at just the first year component, I think it's really small. And so relative to overall growth, we feel good about it. The mix was slightly different relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year."

The other large opportunity, as you know, for us is in the Digital Marketing. And that's driven by 2 different phenomena. The first phenomena is as we increasingly have global agreements with U.S. multinationals, they expect deployment of our solutions whether it's in retail, financial services or other places, it will also be true in China and in India, and in Australia and Southeast Asia. So that's continuing to drive some growth. And then even local companies in all of those markets as they realize mobile in particular there and the digital disruption there. There's excitement around our products. So in Digital Media, it's all about the adoption of Creative Cloud and Digital Marketing. It's both about global adoption of our Digital Marketing solutions as well as local companies increasingly recognizing that they have to migrate to digital with mobile being the key driver there."

So I called them more of these custom solutions, which reflected what versions of different products that we're using. Starting in fiscal '16, we move to a more complete solution, which is people were licensing all of the products and the fact that it was integrated. The field organization did a really great job of articulating the benefits of moving to the entire complete solution. And the second thing that actually happened in the year was also true-ups, which is people are finding as they are deploying more and more of Creative Cloud, they were volunteering during true-ups, so new logos as well as moving from what I would say, custom to complete. And clearly, resulting in an increase in ARPU for the enterprise. And we continue to believe that, that represents a large opportunity in the U.S. and internationally for FY '17."

So big picture, it was driven by both the adobe.com where we have very dramatically made the switch from people buying the perpetual product to people buying the subscription offering as well as enterprise and the adoption of new services like Adobe Sign. And so when you look at the ARR, I think the ARR growth was over 20% for the year. And when you think about the unit growth that we're seeing in it, it just reflects that PDF as a standard has continued to be the win, which people share it. For those on the call, I would also really recommend, you try out our new mobile apps and the scan functionality where it's -- I would say one of the easiest ways for people to create a PDF out of any picture that they might have using the camera. So continued innovation, I think in that space just reflects as paper to digital is this macro trend. They're very really -- they're very uniquely positioned to capitalize on that."

To your point, we do have now more end-to-end capabilities all the way from video delivery to monetization for our publisher as well as our advertiser customers. And I think what's perhaps most strategic, the integration between their DSV offering and our DMP, we're seeing more and more people wanting to integrate with our industry-leading audience manager DMP. That has really become in fiscal '16, a driver of the adoption of the platform. And so I think our goal when this closes, will be to share more about what we are planning to do strategically. But big picture, it just enables us to be more of a trusted platform for the Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Revenue Officers, and to enable both personalization in terms of delivery and better segmentation in deriving value from all of the data that they have.

If I had to give you a little bit of color as it relates to what happened in retention, I think in 2011 when we first outlined the opportunities, we estimated at that point that even at 80% retention rates for the core Creative, it would be great for the business. Clearly, retention for the core creative is higher than that. And in fact, for the entire base, that includes -- if you could mute your line also, that would be great. Thank you. And so what I said was where retention for the core Creative is really higher than that. And when you think about it for the entire base that includes consumers, it's also higher than 80%. And so as we look at retention, it's actually a very good indicator of the core health of the business, and we're pleased with that. With respect to the Creative Cloud Photography Plan. It just continues to be a very vibrant way for us to attract new customers to our particular platform. 
And since that was the last question, for me, my summary remarks would be while FY '16 was clearly a great year. In many ways, I'm even more excited about the long-term opportunities that we've created for ourselves as a company. When we think about the 2 big areas of focus for Adobe: Empowering people to create and transforming how businesses compete. It just represents massive opportunities in our content and data platform. Really allow us to uniquely address this need. On the Creative business, just continuing to enable any individual who has a story to tell, to tell them across any medium, any device. And on the enterprise side, enabling them to leverage technology to reinvent themselves as an experienced business, represent large unmet needs. I feel good that we're innovating while staying in an extremely select group of people and companies that are delivering impressive both top line and bottom line growth.

FY '16 was another great year for Adobe. Our record revenue and net income were driven by strong performance in Creative Cloud annualized recurring revenue, continued growth of Adobe Document Cloud subscriptions and strong revenue and bookings for Adobe Marketing Cloud. 
In Q4, we delivered record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $0.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.90. For the year, we grew total revenue to $5.85 billion, which represents 22% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY '16 was $2.32, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.01. 
In Digital Media, we're advancing the state-of-the-art for content and setting the standard for creativity and digital documents. We exited the year with over $4 billion of annualized recurring revenue or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q4 was $316 million and was driven by continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creativity and design, and in FY '16, we expanded our customer base while continuing to deliver a rapid stream of product innovations. We achieved record Creative revenue of $886 million in Q4. For the year, we achieved Creative revenue of $3.2 billion, which represents 38% year-over-year growth. 
At the heart of the Creative Cloud is the promise of continuous innovation and the pace at which we are delivering new technology is accelerating. Last month at our MAX Creativity Conference, we unveiled next-generation desktop, mobile and cloud services for designers, photographers and filmmakers as well as sneak previews of creative technologies in the areas of virtual reality, image matching and digital painting. Our creative customers have always counted on us to turn the future into reality. Creative Cloud is the place designers expect to get the best tools and services in emerging categories like Experience Design and 3D. 
Earlier this week, we released 2 public betas: Adobe XD for Windows, the first all-in-one tool for designing, prototyping and sharing user experiences for web and mobile apps; and Project Felix, a new application that enables designers to create photorealistic composites with 2D images and 3D assets. Adobe Stock continues to gain momentum in the multibillion-dollar stock image category. 
In Q4, we launched the Adobe Stock Contributor Site, a new platform that allows users to upload and sell photos, illustrations, videos and vectors to the world's largest creative community. We also announced a partnership with Reuters that will bring their expansive video and photography library, across news, sports, business and entertainment to the Adobe Stock service. 
With creativity exploding across the globe, geographic expansion represents a significant growth opportunity. In November, we launched Adobe Creative Cloud for teams in China. China is one of the world's largest digital economies and we can now address its extensive community of designers and creatives. 
We believe everyone is creative and should have the opportunity to express themselves. Adobe Spark, our consumer-friendly web and mobile solution for creating and sharing professional quality animated videos, web stories and social graphics, is gaining traction with small businesses, social marketers and students. We will continue to invest in Adobe Spark, which we see as a key way to reach a broader consumer audiences as part of Creative Cloud. 
The world's leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud, leverages the PDF standard we pioneered and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital. In Q4, Document Cloud revenue was $191 million, and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $475 million. 
Document Cloud represents the modern way for managing digital documents. Core cloud capabilities like mobile and collaboration as well as services like electronic signatures, have become a requirement for our customers. As a result, Document Cloud subscriptions now eclipse licensing of perpetual Acrobat software on adobe.com, and we expect to see stronger migration among our enterprise customers in the coming year. 
As part of the ongoing innovation delivered through Document Cloud, this quarter, we rolled out critical new scan functionality in our Adobe Reader mobile apps. In October, we expanded the global footprint for Adobe Document Cloud with the launch of the Adobe Sign service in Japan. In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels. Whether it's financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment, or automotive, entire industries are experiencing digital disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger brand loyalty and growth. 
Adobe's winning formula is built on a unique foundation of content and data, which enables deep customer insights; development and delivery of consistent personalized experiences; and the ability to monitor and optimize business performance in real time. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to be the most comprehensive offering in the exploding Digital Marketing category with best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaigns and data management as well as media optimization. We're seeing strong demand for the Adobe Marketing Cloud across the globe as evidenced by the sold-out crowds at events this quarter in London, Paris, Munich and Tokyo. Major customer wins this quarter included Lufthansa, Pandora, United Healthcare, UPS, U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency and Verizon. 
In Q4, Adobe managed a record 33.5 trillion data transactions, providing us with an unparalleled view into real-time business and cultural trends. Debuting in 2016, the Adobe Digital Price Index has redefined how inflation and consumer goods prices are tracked and measured and has received broad support from the world's leading economists. Leveraging over 20 billion visits to retail websites, Adobe Digital Insights holiday shopping report accurately predicted online sales for this holiday season within a margin of error of less than 0.5%. 
Adobe measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers, and $7.50 out of every $10 spent online with the top 500 U.S. retailers, go through Adobe Marketing Cloud. This tremendous volume of data puts Adobe in the unique position to deliver highly accurate, census-based online sales totals, pricing and product availability trends each holiday season. 
Last month, we announced our intention to acquire TubeMogul, a leading demand-site video advertising platform, further strengthening our leadership in Digital Marketing and adtech. Adobe is currently a leader in search, display and social advertising, planning and delivery with our Adobe Media Optimizer solution. The addition of TubeMogul to our adtech capabilities will enable Adobe's customers to maximize their video advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV. Together, Adobe and TubeMogul will enable our customers to identify the right audience segments and plan, execute and measure paid media performance across any device. We expect the transaction to close in December. 
In September, we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to help enterprises embrace digital transformation. Adobe announced it will make Microsoft Azure, the preferred platform for our cloud services, providing customers with a trusted, enterprise-grade global platform and that we will integrate our Adobe Marketing Cloud technology with Microsoft's Dynamics 365 Enterprise and Power BI. Microsoft announced it will make Adobe Marketing Cloud the preferred marketing service for its enterprise customers and its extensive partner and developer ecosystem. 
Adobe's success has been a result of our ability to predict the future. While others are jumping on the machine learning and AI bandwagon, these capabilities have been the foundation of our innovation for decades. Our engineers and scientists are squarely focused on harnessing the massive volume of content and data assets captured in our cloud solutions to tackle today's complex experience challenges. 
Last month, we announced Adobe Sensei, a new framework and set of intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei's services address the critical demands of our creative, document and marketing customers from image matching across millions of images to understanding the meaning and sentiment of digital documents to finally targeting important audience segments. Dozens of these intelligent services have been deployed in our products to date, and we are significantly increasing our investment. We also intend to make Adobe Sensei available to our ecosystem of partners, ISVs and developers. 
Adobe's success over the decades is in no small part due to the unique culture we have created. In October, we were named a Best Multinational Workplace by the Great Places to Work Institute, and this month, we were among the top 10 employers on Glassdoor's 2017 List of 50 Best Places to Work. We know that a strong workforce is a diverse workforce and we are committed to increasing diversity among our employee base. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including youth coding and media-making initiatives to inspire future female technologists. 
Being a good global citizen is important to our employees, customers and investors. For the first time, Adobe has been selected as a component of the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. For the third year in a row, we received a perfect score on the 2017 Corporate Equality Index report from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In light of these accomplishments, Adobe's brand momentum has never been stronger, and we were honored to be 1 of the 5 fastest-growing brands on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking. 
FY '16 was a great year for Adobe. We're driving growth in each of the large categories we have created. With a $64 billion total addressable market by 2019, our opportunity has never been greater. Our mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant, and our strategy, our technology and our people set us up for continued success. 
I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and innovation over the past year. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead. Mark?"

Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2016 results. In FY '16, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $5.85 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth.

In FY '16, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $5.85 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $2.32 and non-GAAP EPS was $3.01. This performance is the result of strong execution against our strategy, and noteworthy achievements, including: growing Digital Media ARR by $1.13 billion during the year to exit fiscal 2016 with $4.01 billion, well ahead of our original target of $3.875 billion. Achieving 38% year-over-year revenue growth in our Creative business and exiting the year with $3.54 billion of ARR. 
Delivering Document Cloud revenue of $765 million and growing ARR to $475 million, both of which reflect progress against our goal of migrating this to a subscription business. Achieving record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.63 billion and 20% annual year-over-year growth. Generating $2.2 billion in operating cash flow during the year, which represents 50% year-over-year growth. Growing deferred revenue to $2 billion and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $3.4 billion exiting the year. Together, this represents approximately $5.4 billion of contracted revenue that will be recognized over time, and returning over $1 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. 
In the fourth quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. Highlights in the quarter included: achieving $316 million of net new Digital Media ARR; record Creative revenue of $886 million, which represents 33% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth; strong growth in operating and net income; record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue; and 82% of Q4 revenue from recurring sources. 
In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 23% year-over-year. The addition of $316 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.01 billion exiting Q4. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $886 million, which represents 33% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $283 million during Q4 and exited the quarter with $3.54 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals and upsells. Creative Cloud ARPU grew quarter-over-quarter across all offerings in Q4. 
As we outlined at our Analyst Meeting in November, our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in 3 key areas: growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users, addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market; driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the photography plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption; and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock. 
Some highlights against these goals during the year include: 53% year-over-year subscription growth outside the U.S., broadly expanding our base of users by adding more than 1 million Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscribers during the year and growing Adobe stock revenue by more than 40% year-over-year. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $191 million. Document Cloud ARR grew to $475 million, the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Driving this growth was adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future. 
In Digital Marketing, we achieved record quarterly and annual Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue. Entering the year, we targeted approximately 20% Adobe Marketing Cloud annual revenue growth and approximately 30% annual subscription value or ASV bookings growth. Included in these targets in FY '16 was an expectation of approximately $45 million of perpetual revenue. Relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year, we experienced increased demand for on-premise, perpetual licensed solutions by some customers. When we combine ASV bookings for the year with an over achievement in first year value of perpetual contracts, we achieved 30% bookings growth. 
In Q4, we achieved Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth. With this Q4 performance in FY '16, we achieved 20% annual revenue growth. Mobile remains a key driver for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 55% of total Adobe analytics transactions in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $4.5 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '16 versus $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '16. Thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $0.3 million. 
From a year-over-year currency perspective. FX decreased revenue by $9.1 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '16 versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '15. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.3 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q4, Adobe's effective tax rate was 12.5% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax audits. Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 47 days in the year-ago quarter, and 45 days last quarter. 
Deferred revenue grew to a record $2 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.76 billion compared to $4.45 billion at the end of Q3. Cash flow from operations was a record $696 million in the quarter. During this year, we have been using excess domestic cash to buy back stock and reduce our share count. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a cost of $331 million. We currently have $500 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015. 
Now I'll provide our financial outlook. Entering FY '17, we have great momentum and continue to see strength across our 3 cloud businesses. We are excited about our large addressable markets, and are uniquely positioned to drive strong top line and bottom line growth. 
At our November 2 financial analyst meeting, we outlined our long-term strategy and provided long-term growth rates and preliminary FY '17 financial targets. We remain confident in our ability to operationally execute against those targets and we are reaffirming our long-term FY '15 to FY '18 financial targets today. 
Since the analyst meeting, the U.S. dollar has strengthened considerably. Were it not for this currency fluctuation, we would be reaffirming all of the preliminary FY '17 targets we provided on November 2. Based on today's FX rates, we believe our hedging programs will effectively mitigate the impact of these rate changes in Q1 and Q2. But if they persist, current FX rates will affect our ability to achieve the preliminary annual targets due to the impact in the second half of FY '17. 
As a result, we are providing the following FY '17 targets: we expect total revenue of approximately $6.95 billion, which factoring in the extra week in FY '16, represents approximately 21% year-over-year growth. We continue to target Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20%. As you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year, and if necessary, we revalue ARR at year-end for the current currency rates. FX rate changes have resulted in a $27 million reduction and an updated Digital Media ARR exiting FY '16 of $3.99 billion. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated Investor data sheet, and we continue to expect approximately 25% Digital Media ARR growth, which equates to approximately $1 billion of net new ARR in the year, leading to approximately $5 billion of Digital Media ARR exiting FY '17. 
By quarter, we expect to add approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1, followed by sequential growth of net new ARR in Q2. Then in Q3, we anticipate a seasonally driven sequential decline followed by strong seasonal growth in the fourth quarter to achieve the target for the year. In Digital Marketing, we continue to target Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth of approximately 20% and Adobe Marketing Cloud ASV bookings growth of approximately 30%. Despite the currency impact, we expect to achieve the same FY '17 EPS targets we provided on November 2, which are a GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.85 and non-GAAP earnings per share targeted at approximately $3.75. 
During the year, we expect revenue and earnings per share to grow sequentially each quarter, with the largest sequential increase in Q4. Starting with FY '17, we are providing quarterly estimates for our most likely results rather than providing targeted ranges due to the increased predictability in our business. 
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.625 billion. We expect to achieve approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1. We expect Digital Media Q1 segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%, and Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%. When comparing Q1 FY '17 targets, it is helpful to remember that Q1 FY '16 had an extra week due to our 52/53-week fiscal year calendar. Factoring the extra week in Q1 FY '16, all Q1 FY '17 revenue targets represent greater than 20% year-over-year growth. 
We are targeting our Q1 share count to be approximately 501 million shares. We expect net nonoperating expense to be approximately $13 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 tax rate of approximately 15% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share target of approximately $0.71 and Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.87. 
Finally, the targets we are providing today do not reflect our planned acquisition of TubeMogul, which we expect to close in December. We plan to issue updated Q1 and annual FY '17 financial targets after the acquisition closes. We strongly believe analysts and investors should wait for the close of the acquisition to combine expected results of both companies into an updated model for the coming year. We plan to host a brief call to discuss our strategy and targets that factor in items such as a stub quarter period and accounting implications. 
In summary, 2016 was another strong year for Adobe. We are the market leader with all 3 of our cloud solutions, and we are executing well against a large and growing addressable market. We're excited about what lies ahead for Adobe and look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming year. Mike?"

You're right, and thank you for the acknowledgment of how we're executing against the Creative business. From our point of view, Creative Cloud is very much about not just migrating the core customer segment, but significantly through market expansion, making sure that we're targeting new customers. I'd point out 2 or 3 different initiatives in that space. The first one clearly is Creative Cloud Photography Plan. As you know, we used to have Lightroom and Photoshop Elements, we're increasingly seeing those consumers adopt the Creative Cloud Photography Plan. That continues to do really well in terms of the new customer acquisition that we have. A second category that I'll talk about are products like Adobe Spark. We're seeing more and more people who have a story to tell, wanting to use Adobe Spark. And I think in this year, you'll see that also start to get integrated and folded into the Creative Cloud much like mobile apps are. They represent a big customer acquisition and adoption and migration opportunity. And the third, I've continued to impress upon education. Education as a segment does really well in Creative Cloud. It's that next generation or whether it's K-12 students or higher ed. As they get exposed to our products, clearly, as they enter university or the marketplace, they are using our products, all of which we look at as positive trends for the future."

I do want to clarify that we think the cloud remains the long-term right offering for our customers, but it is a -- the fact that we have an on-premise solution, we continue to think it's a competitive advantage. And globally, it's hard to predict which option our customers might prefer on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But I want to reiterate, it's all from our point of view, good revenue. When we look at the different components of revenue in the Marketing Cloud and you look at subscription, which we think is the healthiest long-term predictor and then you look at perpetual and consulting. The subscription bookings revenue grew 29% year-over-year in FY '16, so stronger than the overall 20%. And if you actually go back to what Mark showed at the FA meeting and look at the pie chart, it was exactly in line with what we had predicted for Q4. Relative to the beginning of the year to your question, we certainly over achieved a little bit in perpetual revenue relative to subscription bookings. However, when you normalize that and you take, given perpetual revenues, a multiyear commitment and look at just the first year component, I think it's really small. And so relative to overall growth, we feel good about it. The mix was slightly different relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year."

The other large opportunity, as you know, for us is in Digital Marketing. And that's driven by 2 different phenomenon. The first phenomena is as we increasingly have global agreements with U.S. multinationals, they expect deployment of our solutions whether it's in retail, financial services or other places, to also be true in China and in India, and in Australia and Southeast Asia. So that's continuing to drive some growth. And then even local companies in all of those markets as they realize mobile in particular there and the digital disruption there, there's excitement around our products. So in Digital Media, it's all about the adoption of Creative Cloud and Digital Marketing. It's both about global adoption of our Digital Marketing solutions as well as local companies increasingly recognizing that they have to migrate to digital with mobile being the key driver there."

So I'd call them more of these custom solutions, which reflected what versions of different products that we're using. Starting in fiscal '16, we move to a more complete solution, which is people were licensing all of the products and the fact that it was integrated. The field organization did a really great job of articulating the benefits of moving to the entire complete solution. And the second thing that actually happened in the year was also true-ups, which is people are finding that as they're deploying more and more of Creative Cloud, they were volunteering during true-ups, so new logos as well as moving from what I would say, custom to complete. And clearly, resulting in an increase in ARPU for the enterprise. And we continue to believe that, that represents a large opportunity in the U.S. and internationally for FY '17."

We do have room in the model to invest in the businesses that we need to invest in. And if you look at next year's guidance and you do the P&L based on what we just told you, you're going to come up with operating margins that are increasing by around a point from this year, so from 34% to 35%. We gave you guidance for '18. You can see that margins continue to improve from there. I'm not going to say at this point that we're to go back to 40%, which is where we were in 2008. But you can see that there is still tremendous leverage in our model, and we feel very good about that."

First is, it was a very strong year. And if you look at just the Document Cloud segment ARR, it probably underrepresents the momentum that we had with the Document Cloud and Acrobat businesses because as you know, significant number of people also use Acrobat DC when they're using the Creative Cloud. So big picture, it was driven by both the adobe.com where we have very dramatically made the switch from people buying the perpetual product to people buying the subscription offering as well as enterprise and the adoption of new services like Adobe Sign. And so when you look at the ARR, I think the ARR growth was over 20% for the year. And when you think about the unit growth that we're seeing in it, it just reflects that PDF as a standard has continued to be the win, which people share it. For those on the call, I would also really recommend, you try out our new mobile apps and the scan functionality, where it's, I would say, one of the easiest ways for people to create a PDF out of any picture that they might have using the camera. So continued innovation, I think, in that space just reflects, as paper to digital, is this macro trend, we're very really -- we're very uniquely positioned to capitalize on that."

To your point, we do have now more end-to-end capabilities all the way from video delivery to monetization for our publisher as well as our advertiser customers. And I think what's perhaps most strategic, the integration between their DSV offering and our DMP, we're seeing more and more people wanting to integrate with our industry-leading audience manager DMP. That has really become in fiscal '16, a driver of the adoption of the platform. And so I think our goal when this closes, will be to share more about what we are planning to do strategically. But big picture, it just enables us to be more of a trusted platform for the Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Revenue Officers, and to enable both personalization in terms of delivery and better segmentation in deriving value from all of the data that they have.

If I had to give you a little bit of color as it relates to what happened in retention, I think in 2011 when we first outlined the opportunities, we estimated at that point that even at 80% retention rates for the core Creative, it would be great for the business. Clearly, retention for the core creative is higher than that. And in fact, for the entire base, that includes -- if you could mute your line also, that would be great. Thank you. And so what I said was where retention for the core Creative is really higher than that, and when you think about it for the entire base that includes consumers, it's also higher than 80%. And so as we look at retention, it's actually a very good indicator of the core health of the business, and we're pleased with that. With respect to the Creative Cloud Photography Plan, it just continues to be a very vibrant way for us to attract new customers to our particular platform. 
And since that was the last question, for me, my summary remarks would be, while FY '16 was clearly a great year, in many ways, I'm even more excited about the long-term opportunities that we've created for ourselves as a company. When we think about the 2 big areas of focus for Adobe: Empowering people to create and transforming how businesses compete, it just represents massive opportunities in our content and data platform. Really allow us to uniquely address this need. On the Creative business, just continuing to enable any individual who has a story to tell, to tell them across any medium, any device. And on the enterprise side, enabling them to leverage technology to reinvent themselves as an experienced business, represent large unmet needs. I feel good that we're innovating while staying in an extremely select group of people and companies that are delivering impressive both top line and bottom line growth.

FY '16 was another great year for Adobe. Our record revenue and net income were driven by strong performance in Creative Cloud annualized recurring revenue, continued growth of Adobe Document Cloud subscriptions and strong revenue and bookings for Adobe Marketing Cloud. 
In Q4, we delivered record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $0.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.90. For the year, we grew total revenue to $5.85 billion, which represents 22% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY '16 was $2.32, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.01. 
In Digital Media, we're advancing the state-of-the-art for content and setting the standard for creativity and digital documents. We exited the year with over $4 billion of annualized recurring revenue or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q4 was $316 million and was driven by continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creativity and design, and in FY '16, we expanded our customer base while continuing to deliver a rapid stream of product innovations. We achieved record Creative revenue of $886 million in Q4. For the year, we achieved Creative revenue of $3.2 billion, which represents 38% year-over-year growth. 
At the heart of the Creative Cloud is the promise of continuous innovation and the pace at which we are delivering new technology is accelerating. Last month at our MAX Creativity Conference, we unveiled next-generation desktop, mobile and cloud services for designers, photographers and filmmakers as well as sneak previews of creative technologies in the areas of virtual reality, image matching and digital painting. Our creative customers have always counted on us to turn the future into reality. Creative Cloud is the place designers expect to get the best tools and services in emerging categories like Experience Design and 3D. 
Earlier this week, we released 2 public betas: Adobe XD for Windows, the first all-in-one tool for designing, prototyping and sharing user experiences for web and mobile apps; and Project Felix, a new application that enables designers to create photorealistic composites with 2D images and 3D assets. Adobe Stock continues to gain momentum in the multibillion-dollar stock image category. 
In Q4, we launched the Adobe Stock Contributor Site, a new platform that allows users to upload and sell photos, illustrations, videos and vectors to the world's largest creative community. We also announced a partnership with Reuters that will bring their expansive video and photography library, across news, sports, business and entertainment to the Adobe Stock service. 
With creativity exploding across the globe, geographic expansion represents a significant growth opportunity. In November, we launched Adobe Creative Cloud for teams in China. China is one of the world's largest digital economies and we can now address its extensive community of designers and creatives. 
We believe everyone is creative and should have the opportunity to express themselves. Adobe Spark, our consumer-friendly web and mobile solution for creating and sharing professional quality animated videos, web stories and social graphics, is gaining traction with small businesses, social marketers and students. We will continue to invest in Adobe Spark, which we see as a key way to reach a broader consumer audiences as part of Creative Cloud. 
The world's leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud, leverages the PDF standard we pioneered and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital. In Q4, Document Cloud revenue was $191 million, and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $475 million. 
Document Cloud represents the modern way for managing digital documents. Core cloud capabilities like mobile and collaboration as well as services like electronic signatures, have become a requirement for our customers. As a result, Document Cloud subscriptions now eclipse licensing of perpetual Acrobat software on adobe.com, and we expect to see stronger migration among our enterprise customers in the coming year. 
As part of the ongoing innovation delivered through Document Cloud, this quarter, we rolled out critical new scan functionality in our Adobe Reader mobile apps. In October, we expanded the global footprint for Adobe Document Cloud with the launch of the Adobe Sign service in Japan. In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels. Whether it's financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment, or automotive, entire industries are experiencing digital disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger brand loyalty and growth. 
Adobe's winning formula is built on a unique foundation of content and data, which enables deep customer insights; development and delivery of consistent personalized experiences; and the ability to monitor and optimize business performance in real time. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to be the most comprehensive offering in the exploding Digital Marketing category with best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaigns and data management as well as media optimization. We're seeing strong demand for the Adobe Marketing Cloud across the globe as evidenced by the sold-out crowds at events this quarter in London, Paris, Munich and Tokyo. Major customer wins this quarter included Lufthansa, Pandora, United Healthcare, UPS, U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency and Verizon. 
In Q4, Adobe managed a record 33.5 trillion data transactions, providing us with an unparalleled view into real-time business and cultural trends. Debuting in 2016, the Adobe Digital Price Index has redefined how inflation and consumer goods prices are tracked and measured and has received broad support from the world's leading economists. Leveraging over 20 billion visits to retail websites, Adobe Digital Insights holiday shopping report accurately predicted online sales for this holiday season within a margin of error of less than 0.5%. 
Adobe measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers, and $7.50 out of every $10 spent online with the top 500 U.S. retailers, go through Adobe Marketing Cloud. This tremendous volume of data puts Adobe in the unique position to deliver highly accurate, census-based online sales totals, pricing and product availability trends each holiday season. 
Last month, we announced our intention to acquire TubeMogul, a leading demand-site video advertising platform, further strengthening our leadership in Digital Marketing and adtech. Adobe is currently a leader in search, display and social advertising, planning and delivery with our Adobe Media Optimizer solution. The addition of TubeMogul to our adtech capabilities will enable Adobe's customers to maximize their video advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV. Together, Adobe and TubeMogul will enable our customers to identify the right audience segments and plan, execute and measure paid media performance across any device. We expect the transaction to close in December. 
In September, we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to help enterprises embrace digital transformation. Adobe announced it will make Microsoft Azure, the preferred platform for our cloud services, providing customers with a trusted, enterprise-grade global platform and that we will integrate our Adobe Marketing Cloud technology with Microsoft's Dynamics 365 Enterprise and Power BI. Microsoft announced it will make Adobe Marketing Cloud the preferred marketing service for its enterprise customers and its extensive partner and developer ecosystem. 
Adobe's success has been a result of our ability to predict the future. While others are jumping on the machine learning and AI bandwagon, these capabilities have been the foundation of our innovation for decades. Our engineers and scientists are squarely focused on harnessing the massive volume of content and data assets captured in our cloud solutions to tackle today's complex experience challenges. 
Last month, we announced Adobe Sensei, a new framework and set of intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei's services address the critical demands of our creative, document and marketing customers from image matching across millions of images to understanding the meaning and sentiment of digital documents to finally targeting important audience segments. Dozens of these intelligent services have been deployed in our products to date, and we are significantly increasing our investment. We also intend to make Adobe Sensei available to our ecosystem of partners, ISVs and developers. 
Adobe's success over the decades is in no small part due to the unique culture we have created. In October, we were named a Best Multinational Workplace by the Great Places to Work Institute, and this month, we were among the top 10 employers on Glassdoor's 2017 List of 50 Best Places to Work. We know that a strong workforce is a diverse workforce and we are committed to increasing diversity among our employee base. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including youth coding and media-making initiatives to inspire future female technologists. 
Being a good global citizen is important to our employees, customers and investors. For the first time, Adobe has been selected as a component of the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. For the third year in a row, we received a perfect score on the 2017 Corporate Equality Index report from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In light of these accomplishments, Adobe's brand momentum has never been stronger, and we were honored to be 1 of the 5 fastest-growing brands on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking. 
FY '16 was a great year for Adobe. We're driving growth in each of the large categories we have created. With a $64 billion total addressable market by 2019, our opportunity has never been greater. Our mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant, and our strategy, our technology and our people set us up for continued success. 
I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and innovation over the past year. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead. Mark?"

In FY '16, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $5.85 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $2.32 and non-GAAP EPS was $3.01. This performance is the result of strong execution against our strategy, and noteworthy achievements, including: growing Digital Media ARR by $1.13 billion during the year to exit fiscal 2016 with $4.01 billion, well ahead of our original target of $3.875 billion. Achieving 38% year-over-year revenue growth in our Creative business and exiting the year with $3.54 billion of ARR. 
Delivering Document Cloud revenue of $765 million and growing ARR to $475 million, both of which reflect progress against our goal of migrating this to a subscription business. Achieving record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.63 billion and 20% annual year-over-year growth. Generating $2.2 billion in operating cash flow during the year, which represents 50% year-over-year growth. Growing deferred revenue to $2 billion and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $3.4 billion exiting the year. Together, this represents approximately $5.4 billion of contracted revenue that will be recognized over time, and returning over $1 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. 
In the fourth quarter of FY '16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. Highlights in the quarter included: achieving $316 million of net new Digital Media ARR; record Creative revenue of $886 million, which represents 33% year-over-year growth; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth; strong growth in operating and net income; record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue; and 82% of Q4 revenue from recurring sources. 
In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 23% year-over-year. The addition of $316 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.01 billion exiting Q4. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $886 million, which represents 33% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $283 million during Q4 and exited the quarter with $3.54 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals and upsells. Creative Cloud ARPU grew quarter-over-quarter across all offerings in Q4. 
As we outlined at our Analyst Meeting in November, our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in 3 key areas: growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users, addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market; driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the photography plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption; and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock. 
Some highlights against these goals during the year include: 53% year-over-year subscription growth outside the U.S., broadly expanding our base of users by adding more than 1 million Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscribers during the year and growing Adobe stock revenue by more than 40% year-over-year. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $191 million. Document Cloud ARR grew to $475 million, the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Driving this growth was adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future. 
In Digital Marketing, we achieved record quarterly and annual Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue. Entering the year, we targeted approximately 20% Adobe Marketing Cloud annual revenue growth and approximately 30% annual subscription value or ASV bookings growth. Included in these targets in FY '16 was an expectation of approximately $45 million of perpetual revenue. Relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year, we experienced increased demand for on-premise, perpetual licensed solutions by some customers. When we combine ASV bookings for the year with an over achievement in first year value of perpetual contracts, we achieved 30% bookings growth. 
In Q4, we achieved Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth. With this Q4 performance in FY '16, we achieved 20% annual revenue growth. Mobile remains a key driver for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 55% of total Adobe analytics transactions in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $4.5 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '16 versus $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '16. Thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $0.3 million. 
From a year-over-year currency perspective. FX decreased revenue by $9.1 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '16 versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '15. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.3 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q4, Adobe's effective tax rate was 12.5% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax audits. Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 47 days in the year-ago quarter, and 45 days last quarter. 
Deferred revenue grew to a record $2 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.76 billion compared to $4.45 billion at the end of Q3. Cash flow from operations was a record $696 million in the quarter. During this year, we have been using excess domestic cash to buy back stock and reduce our share count. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a cost of $331 million. We currently have $500 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015. 
Now I'll provide our financial outlook. Entering FY '17, we have great momentum and continue to see strength across our 3 cloud businesses. We are excited about our large addressable markets, and are uniquely positioned to drive strong top line and bottom line growth. 
At our November 2 financial analyst meeting, we outlined our long-term strategy and provided long-term growth rates and preliminary FY '17 financial targets. We remain confident in our ability to operationally execute against those targets and we are reaffirming our long-term FY '15 to FY '18 financial targets today. 
Since the analyst meeting, the U.S. dollar has strengthened considerably. Were it not for this currency fluctuation, we would be reaffirming all of the preliminary FY '17 targets we provided on November 2. Based on today's FX rates, we believe our hedging programs will effectively mitigate the impact of these rate changes in Q1 and Q2. But if they persist, current FX rates will affect our ability to achieve the preliminary annual targets due to the impact in the second half of FY '17. 
As a result, we are providing the following FY '17 targets: we expect total revenue of approximately $6.95 billion, which factoring in the extra week in FY '16, represents approximately 21% year-over-year growth. We continue to target Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20%. As you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year, and if necessary, we revalue ARR at year-end for the current currency rates. FX rate changes have resulted in a $27 million reduction and an updated Digital Media ARR exiting FY '16 of $3.99 billion. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated Investor data sheet, and we continue to expect approximately 25% Digital Media ARR growth, which equates to approximately $1 billion of net new ARR in the year, leading to approximately $5 billion of Digital Media ARR exiting FY '17. 
By quarter, we expect to add approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1, followed by sequential growth of net new ARR in Q2. Then in Q3, we anticipate a seasonally driven sequential decline followed by strong seasonal growth in the fourth quarter to achieve the target for the year. In Digital Marketing, we continue to target Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth of approximately 20% and Adobe Marketing Cloud ASV bookings growth of approximately 30%. Despite the currency impact, we expect to achieve the same FY '17 EPS targets we provided on November 2, which are a GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.85 and non-GAAP earnings per share targeted at approximately $3.75. 
During the year, we expect revenue and earnings per share to grow sequentially each quarter, with the largest sequential increase in Q4. Starting with FY '17, we are providing quarterly estimates for our most likely results rather than providing targeted ranges due to the increased predictability in our business. 
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.625 billion. We expect to achieve approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1. We expect Digital Media Q1 segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%, and Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%. When comparing Q1 FY '17 targets, it is helpful to remember that Q1 FY '16 had an extra week due to our 52/53-week fiscal year calendar. Factoring the extra week in Q1 FY '16, all Q1 FY '17 revenue targets represent greater than 20% year-over-year growth. 
We are targeting our Q1 share count to be approximately 501 million shares. We expect net nonoperating expense to be approximately $13 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 tax rate of approximately 15% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share target of approximately $0.71 and Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.87. 
Finally, the targets we are providing today do not reflect our planned acquisition of TubeMogul, which we expect to close in December. We plan to issue updated Q1 and annual FY '17 financial targets after the acquisition closes. We strongly believe analysts and investors should wait for the close of the acquisition to combine expected results of both companies into an updated model for the coming year. We plan to host a brief call to discuss our strategy and targets that factor in items such as a stub quarter period and accounting implications. 
In summary, 2016 was another strong year for Adobe. We are the market leader with all 3 of our cloud solutions, and we are executing well against a large and growing addressable market. We're excited about what lies ahead for Adobe and look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming year. Mike?"

You're right, and thank you for the acknowledgment of how we're executing against the Creative business. From our point of view, Creative Cloud is very much about not just migrating the core customer segment, but significantly through market expansion, making sure that we're targeting new customers. I'd point out 2 or 3 different initiatives in that space. The first one clearly is Creative Cloud Photography Plan. As you know, we used to have Lightroom and Photoshop Elements, we're increasingly seeing those consumers adopt the Creative Cloud Photography Plan. That continues to do really well in terms of the new customer acquisition that we have. A second category that I'll talk about are products like Adobe Spark. We're seeing more and more people who have a story to tell, wanting to use Adobe Spark. And I think in this year, you'll see that also start to get integrated and folded into the Creative Cloud much like mobile apps are. They represent a big customer acquisition and adoption and migration opportunity. And the third, I've continued to impress upon education. Education as a segment does really well in Creative Cloud. It's that next generation or whether it's K-12 students or higher ed. As they get exposed to our products, clearly, as they enter university or the marketplace, they are using our products, all of which we look at as positive trends for the future."

I do want to clarify that we think the cloud remains the long-term right offering for our customers, but it is a -- the fact that we have an on-premise solution, we continue to think it's a competitive advantage. And globally, it's hard to predict which option our customers might prefer on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But I want to reiterate, it's all from our point of view, good revenue. When we look at the different components of revenue in the Marketing Cloud and you look at subscription, which we think is the healthiest long-term predictor and then you look at perpetual and consulting. The subscription bookings revenue grew 29% year-over-year in FY '16, so stronger than the overall 20%. And if you actually go back to what Mark showed at the FA meeting and look at the pie chart, it was exactly in line with what we had predicted for Q4. Relative to the beginning of the year to your question, we certainly over achieved a little bit in perpetual revenue relative to subscription bookings. However, when you normalize that and you take, given perpetual revenues, a multiyear commitment and look at just the first year component, I think it's really small. And so relative to overall growth, we feel good about it. The mix was slightly different relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year."

The other large opportunity, as you know, for us is in Digital Marketing. And that's driven by 2 different phenomenon. The first phenomena is as we increasingly have global agreements with U.S. multinationals, they expect deployment of our solutions whether it's in retail, financial services or other places, to also be true in China and in India, and in Australia and Southeast Asia. So that's continuing to drive some growth. And then even local companies in all of those markets as they realize mobile in particular there and the digital disruption there, there's excitement around our products. So in Digital Media, it's all about the adoption of Creative Cloud and Digital Marketing.

The first is 3 years ago when we had first introduced the ETLA program for our customers. It was really more a reflection of what they were licensing for Creative Suite. So I'd call them more of these custom solutions, which reflected what versions of different products that we're using. Starting in fiscal '16, we move to a more complete solution, which is people were licensing all of the products and the fact that it was integrated. The field organization did a really great job of articulating the benefits of moving to the entire complete solution. And the second thing that actually happened in the year was also true-ups, which is people are finding that as they're deploying more and more of Creative Cloud, they were volunteering during true-ups, so new logos as well as moving from what I would say, custom to complete. And clearly, resulting in an increase in ARPU for the enterprise. And we continue to believe that, that represents a large opportunity in the U.S. and internationally for FY '17."

First is, it was a very strong year. And if you look at just the Document Cloud segment ARR, it probably underrepresents the momentum that we had with the Document Cloud and Acrobat businesses because as you know, significant number of people also use Acrobat DC when they're using the Creative Cloud. So big picture, it was driven by both the adobe.com where we have very dramatically made the switch from people buying the perpetual product to people buying the subscription offering as well as enterprise and the adoption of new services like Adobe Sign. And so when you look at the ARR, I think the ARR growth was over 20% for the year. And when you think about the unit growth that we're seeing in it, it just reflects that PDF as a standard has continued to be the win, which people share it. For those on the call, I would also really recommend, you try out our new mobile apps and the scan functionality, where it's, I would say, one of the easiest ways for people to create a PDF out of any picture that they might have using the camera.

If I had to give you a little bit of color as it relates to what happened in retention, I think in 2011 when we first outlined the opportunities, we estimated at that point that even at 80% retention rates for the core Creative, it would be great for the business. Clearly, retention for the core creative is higher than that. And in fact, for the entire base, that includes -- if you could mute your line also, that would be great. Thank you. And so what I said was where retention for the core Creative is really higher than that, and when you think about it for the entire base that includes consumers, it's also higher than 80%. And so as we look at retention, it's actually a very good indicator of the core health of the business, and we're pleased with that. With respect to the Creative Cloud Photography Plan, it just continues to be a very vibrant way for us to attract new customers to our particular platform. 
And since that was the last question, for me, my summary remarks would be, while FY '16 was clearly a great year, in many ways, I'm even more excited about the long-term opportunities that we've created for ourselves as a company. When we think about the 2 big areas of focus for Adobe: Empowering people to create and transforming how businesses compete, it just represents massive opportunities in our content and data platform. Really allow us to uniquely address this need. On the Creative business, just continuing to enable any individual who has a story to tell, to tell them across any medium, any device. And on the enterprise side, enabling them to leverage technology to reinvent themselves as an experienced business, represent large unmet needs. I feel good that we're innovating while staying in an extremely select group of people and companies that are delivering impressive both top line and bottom line growth.
