The fourth quarter reflected our continued focus on successfully reshaping our portfolio, expanding margins, enhancing our management team and returning our top line to growth. The biggest action was the sale of NSS to -- International for $550 million in cash. We're pleased with that price, which represents an attractive EBITDA multiple. We expect the sale of NSS to close next week and have reported NSS as a discontinued operation in our fourth quarter and full year results. We also divested Klein Associates, a small sites -- our business during the quarter. These actions reflect our commitment to repositioning our portfolio and improving our financial performance by focusing on our core defense electronics communications and ISR markets where we have leading positions and strong technical discriminators. As we continue to prudently evaluate potential acquisitions and further divestitures, we're taking market considerations -- market conditions into consideration. Consistent with best practices, there are a number of key factors that go into our decision-making process, including return on capital an and improvement of L-3's competitive position, both will make up better equipped to create value for shareholders as well as customers. In the quarter and for the year as a whole, we have strong performance on our re-competes and program execution across our business. I want to thank all of our employees around the world for their contributions and for their continuing support to deliver the best we have for our customers. Things are progressing well from an operational standpoint. Chris Kubasik is advancing our strategic plan and operations. Specifically, he's focusing on improving our margin on an organic growth profile in and coordination with our segment presidents as they continued to restructure business units. These identifying opportunities for consolidation, including supply chain and back-office operations is also actively engaged in our portfolio shaping as well. We are already seeing benefits from our refined strategy. Margins are improving at a nice pace in all 3 segments, and we anticipate our top line, particularly organic growth, will continue to improve. 
Turning to our fourth quarter results. We had net sales of $2.n9 billion, a decrease of 3% year-over-year. Net sales for the year were $10.5 billion, a 5% decrease from last year. Our organic growth for the quarter was $40 million or 1%. Consolidated segment operating margins came in at 8.9% for the quarter. Funded orders were $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter, and we ended the year with a book-to-bill ratio of 0.94. During the quarter and over this past year, we continue to generate robust cash flow, which has been 1 of L-3's long-standing strengths. We anticipate this will continue into the future. In 2015, we repurchased $740 million of our stock and paid $214 million in dividends, returning in aggregate almost $1 billion to cash to shareholders to a balance that met capital allocation, we maintained an efficient capital structure with ample liquidity. We also committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, which is critical to our shareholder value creation strategy of dividends and share repurchases. This disciplined approach enables us to return cash to shareholders and strengthens the company by providing resources for strategic M&A opportunities and investments in growth areas. 
Before I address key awards for the quarter, I'd like to discuss a few important investment and portfolio integration initiatives. In 2015, we invested $260 million in research and development And, consequently, have been some important advances in our R&D program. Our growth investments are focused on 3 key goals: Enhancing our product lines, growing future sales and developing new products and competitive discriminators. For example, our efforts in space modeling and simulation are notable. Here, we leverage technology from the gaming and visualization industry to develop L-3's aviation facility. This unique project enables the formation simulation, capturing capabilities from the others into the space domain. It will enable our customers to clearly visualize the effectiveness of systems in an anti-access area developer or -- environment. This is an area where L-3 is leading in technology development for this marketplace. This is a good example of the innovation and thought leadership that we at L-3 have embraced. And there's more to come. We're developing smaller lighter sat com terminals that maintain a high level of performance as well as future communication capabilities that improve the probability of intercept and detection. We also continue to upgrade our night vision products, specifically the development of a full digital night vision capability. These R&D advances reflect our position as an industry innovator and open the door for new sales opportunity. Our portfolio integration efforts are proceeding beyond our expectations. For example, ForceX is increasing L-3's capabilities and technologies by working internally with west cam, our Communication Systems west and unmanned systems businesses, to provide enhanced center and imagery solutions to our customers. Additionally, the combination of CTC aviation and Link U.K. is successfully expanding that business base. We also completed our Miteq acquisition by acquiring advanced technical materials now called L-3 -- ATM. ATM develops and manufactures specialized -- shield and waveguide RF microwave products and fits in well with our Miteq product lines. We are performing well on key programs. At platform integration, we continue to make progress towards the completion of the first a VIP aircraft and are working closely with our customers. Now. 
Let me address a few significant wins in our defense commercial aviation and our -- businesses. From a macro perspective, the DoD budget has resumed growth, and we have seen improvement in our DoD organic sales growth rate. The DoD's third offset strategy also presents opportunities for L-3 and we're following it closely. it has many capabilities that will enhance our ability to help our customers achieve their goals and objectives. In the fourth quarter, we received a major contract to provide a Power Node Control Center or PNCC for enabled destroyers. This is an advanced and effective power management system, and we see further opportunities for expanding its applications across other U.S. Navy platforms, including carriers and -- previous assault ships and littoral combat ships. Our ISR integration business continues to be robust, and we received new business awards for our major programs, including -- as well as classified programs. In addition, we were selected to provide U.S. Special Operations Command with binoculars night vision equipment. We also received additional funding for a wide range of legacy programs featuring our missile defense corps, fuses, predator mission training systems, C-130 displays, photonics mast work and gravy UAS work, which includes our innovative new composite maintenance systems trainer. Also in the training arena, we received a contract to upgrade over F-18 Tactical Operational Flight Trainers for the U.S. Navy. This award improves the fidelity of the training equipment and provides a new immersive experience for pilots. Finally, we received follow-on funding for programs such us army fleet support as well as a variety of modification and sustainment projects, including a -- among others. 
For commercial aviation, this is a sector with strong growth potential and, as evidenced by our recent awards, we are capitalizing on opportunities and increasing our market share. Our commercial flights simulator and training business continues to be strong. We received orders from Turkish Airlines, Air China, Spring Airlines and Delta Airlines for a variety of simulators. The Delta order is particularly notable because it expands our market. In addition, our security and detection systems business remains solid and, in the fourth quarter, we received orders for a variety of products, including ProVision, checkpoint screening systems. In the U.S. Capitol building, we also received orders for our new ClearScan aircraft baggage screening system from Singapore as well as maintenance contracts with the TSA for our examiner systems. In the international area, despite the ongoing lumpiness in that market, we remain focused on building our business and are pleased to report several developments. We've been increasing our resources by adding personnel and in-country offices to support business development activities. These efforts are paying of. We've been selected to supply night vision equipment to the king of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we received sales for our traveling wave tube equipment from several customers in Asia and China as well. Westcott cam is also doing well supplementing its solid defense business with several international awards. 
In terms of our outlook for 2016, as you know, 2015 was a transformative year for us. As we look ahead to '16, we expect to maintain a positive momentum as we drive margin improvement and continue to reposition the portfolio. Our focus remains concentrated on growing our business and capturing additional market share, and we continue to moved to its higher-margin areas, pioneer innovative technologies through targeted R&D investments and strengthen our core business through strategic M&A. Our approach to M&A remains the same. We regularly monitor and evaluate companies that might meaningfully contribute to the strength of our business, pursuing accretive acquisitions with strong margins and high-growth rates. Smaller acquisitions will be fully integrated into our existing operations wherever possible. Our strategies for growth combined with our strong balance sheet and thoughtful approach to capital allocation position as well for success in the coming year. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Ralph for a more in-depth look at the financials, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Ralph?"
93538,322762948,922468,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Okay, thank you, Mike.

I'll discuss some details about the fourth quarter results and then reviewed the update to our 2016 guidance. First, I want to remind everyone that we reclassified NSS to discontinued operations for all periods. As Mike said, we expect to complete that sale over the next week, so my comments will all be concerned L-3's continuing operations which do not include NSS. 
We had solid performance for the fourth quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share, sales and free cash flow coming in better than our outlook. It was driven primarily by higher sales and lower taxes due to the reenactment of the R&D tax credit. Adjusted diluted EPS excludes losses on business divestitures and non-cash impairment charges, including the fourth quarter impairment charge for Logistics Solutions. Fourth quarter sales were just under $2.9 billion and grew organically by 1%. Sales were about $90 million above the midpoint guidance that we provided, driven by higher U.S. Department of Defense sales mostly in Communication Systems. We believe our fourth quarter demonstrate that the sales growth rate for our U.S. Government and DoD business is improving, and we expect it will continue to improve this year in 2016. 
Consolidated operating margin was 50 basis points below what we anticipated for the fourth quarter and 10 basis points below what we expected for the full year 2015 with lower margins in Electronic Systems and Aerospace Systems. The Electronic Systems margin was 11.3% for the fourth quarter and 11.5% for the full year, and it was impacted by a $20 million refund liability provision for EoTech holographic weapons sites. Aerospace Systems margins was about 15 basis points lower than what we expected, and that was primarily due to higher material and labor costs on fixed price for flight -- and on Logistics Solutions. Communication Systems margin was better than expected, driving its full year margin 25 basis points higher than our guidance. Fourth quarter free cash flow of $406 million was also very solid, bringing the full year to $829 million, which was $19 million better than we expected and essentially to do the unexpected reenactment of the R&D tax credit. As we recently have explained, we invested significant each year in R&D to sustain and grow our business and that R&D also creates a valuable cash taxes reduction for the company. 
Moving on to the 2016. Compared to our initial guidance that we provided at the investor conference on December 8 last month, our 2016 guidance includes increases for EPS, free cash flow and operating margins primarily due to 22 items. First, the R&D tax credit, which was permanently reenacted by Congress last month; and secondly, pension expense will be $32 million lower than our initial estimate. These changes each increased 2016 EPS by about $0.25, lifting the EPS guidance range at the midpoint by $0.50 to $7.50, which is an increase of 9% compared to 2015 adjusted diluted earnings per share. The law also raises consolidated operating margin guidance by about 30 basis points with corresponding increases in each of the segment margins. We made no other changes to 2016 sales and margin guidance. Our consolidated sales guidance remains at $10,050,000,000 at the midpoint for 2016. With 2015 sales coming in a little higher than what we expected, our 2016 guidance now assumes an organic sales decline of approximately 2.5%. We expect our U.S. government, including the DoD business, to be down 2% organically versus '15; commercial to grow about 8%; and international sales to decline about 14% versus '15. With respect to the U.S. Government and DoD business, the final runoff of the Afghanistan drawdown sales in 2016 is expected to reduce sales by about $135 million. And without it, our sales in the U.S. Government and DoD markets will be about flat in 2016. We hold had some upside with our U.S. Government sales in 2016. We increased the consolidated operating margin to 9.8%, which is 130 basis points of an increase over 2015 with margins increasing in all 3 segments. Our diluted shares outstanding estimate stays at 77.5 million for 2016, which is 5% lower than last year and it continues to include share repurchases of $750 million for the year. We increased our free cash flow estimate by $15 million to $825 million and that is comprised of 3 changes. First, the R&D credit will add about $20 million; slightly better working capital performance adds $15 million; and then we're increasing our investment in capital expenditures by $15 million and that -- the increase. The cash flow guidance for 2016 continues to assume about $100 million of pension contributions. 
With respect to our capital allocation, in addition to the planned share repurchases of $750 million for 2016, cash dividends will be slightly above $200 million, and we intend to repay $300 million of debt. We also acquired a small microwave components business that Mike talked about. That closed last week and that was for $27 million, and we're integrating that into our Miteq division in the Communication Systems segment. After these capital deployment actions, we estimate that we'll end 2016 with a cash balance of about $325 million. Our capital allocation and financing strategy continues to include our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade ratings, and I want to underscore we don't view the ratings, the investment-grade ratings as statutory. And for the last point, our 2016 guidance, we expect our book-to-bill ratio to be 1.0. Looking at the first quarter of 2016, we expect sales to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion with an organic sales decline of about 2%. Margin will be about 9% for the first quarter with EPS between $1.50 and $1.60. Free cash flow coming in somewhere between 0 and $50 million, and book-to-bill ratio between 1 point -- between 0.9 and 1.0. 
So to conclude my financial review, L-3 in a process of positive transition. We're focused on program performance, expanding margin and returning our top line to an organic growth position. We're also strengthening our business portfolio to structurally improve our competitive positions, sales growth rate and margin expansion profile. We continue to generate solid free cash flow and are allocating it to increase shareholder value. We recognize we have more work to do. We know what it is to be done, and we look forward to updating you on the company's progress throughout the year. Thank you, and we'll begin the Q&A now."

So we are not satisfied with the performance of the aerospace from both the margin and order standpoint and sales, of course, sales growth. That said, there are strengths in the business, and we do see opportunities to improve results. We've identified a number of new program opportunities and, in fact, customers have indicated that they would like to see L-3 as a better. In fact, we continue to get certain amount of work of all sorts just because of the capability of that business units are unmatched in the country, unmatched. However, they've been through a difficult cycle. So as we anticipate an improving budgetary environment ahead, we believe that there will be opportunities that can lead to better top line growth as well. So in terms of allocating resources, it's something that I've deployed Chris on to monitor closely as well as Dave Van Buren. These are programs that both are very familiar with including all this. We've made several of these visits to the business units during the last quarter, and we have all eyes focused on getting it improved, getting in that now. Unfortunately, there are a number of accessible international contracts that had completed last year. Some of them are a little bit earlier than have been anticipated such as the Airseeker program, and were not backfilled, if you will, with new work because of a slowdown in internationally. So those were significant program so that's causing a bit of a dip in the numbers. And there are opportunities, again, internationally to bring more work in in-house there as well as on the U.S. Government side. So I think a few more quarters of work on it and you'll start to see some results getting new work in-house. But I believe that's the first step in getting that to turn around."

Since these countries have survived without some of these platforms in the past, whether there are sophisticated areas signals, intelligence platforms that require not only the aircraft but ground stations and operators and processing and the like, and they're very big-ticket items. So while we are seeing that slowdown, we're seeing an uptick, if you will, in Asia. Some of the things we've been focusing on is partnering internationally with platform manufacturers, if you will, or other in country industrial partners to help in that regard. And it's been working out pretty well. We have a few aircraft under contract in Japan, for example, that we talked about last year, more in Korea. And this more than ever with up about for competitive reasons, but we are actively in pursuit of several major platform type programs where L-3 will be the prime systems integrator of typically sophisticated ISR systems on commercial type platforms, which is really where this business has been going over the last several years."

So we have been making progress in areas such as aviation training and simulation, advanced avionics equipment, night vision equipment, Sensor Systems, tactical SATCOM, airborne ISR which are the more bigger ticket items, where slippage is apparent as programs again completed like Airseeker and others and have not been backfilled, if you will. So that goes also with multimission-type aircraft. We have been working on systems where 1 platform can fulfill multiple missions addressing a tighter budget carrier environment where some of these customers do not want to buy a separate aircraft for every single mission, whether it's airborne ISR, other type of show, search and rescue, et cetera. There are looking more from our experience, from my experience. Aircraft has been a rapidly reconfigurable to meet the mission so I don't have to buy it once and buy multiple sensor packages that can plug in. Military simulation systems are active. Security detection systems, airports are upgraded built out and anti-submarine warfare. So those are all areas we are seeing some growth. And it's, I would say no sales but the sales cycle is certainly a longer proposition right now."

And then you have our avionics businesses, which have historically done very well. The problem in that space is that anything that were to come online for sale is typically very expensive and hard to make a good business case for. We've looked at several companies over the years and where we see something that fits well with what we do, particularly something that could be consolidated and a lot saved us it requisite to be able to make those numbers work. Because there are typically higher growth, higher margin and other things that we would see in the defense space and they command higher prices, because you know you had to be a lot of for growth in this marketplace the space. So yes, we love to grow the business and we love to grow it through acquisitions. But right now, we obtained a better deal for us being investing in our own products and developing things rather than acquiring them right now and we will pursue that as a strategy. So we are on the NexGen system. We have a quick there and we continually work on developing more avionics for the general aviation marketplace where we continued to do very well.

We do have some covenant requirements, our existing debt arrangements but the allow but are not a problem in terms of maintaining them. So being investment-grade versus not investment-grade is not a trivial decision. I mean, you don't flip the switch back and forth between those positions. So we've been investment-grade since 2009. Event though investment-grade, we do have a very aggressive financial policy in that we deploy most of our cash and we have a good amount of leverage in the balance sheet, and that's responsible in terms of delivering better returns to our shareholders."

I'd use the term prospecting some of the big heavyweight ISR platforms to more affordable these jets. I mean, this 1 you saw is very representative of the trend in many countries and how they're looking at their ISR mission requirements. And we sit well in that space in terms of being able to do that visualization work, which includes racks and racks of electronics and the precise placement of and assistance to increasing range for being on station, which could mean auxiliary fuel tanks and systems and putting a refilling capability and the like. All those things are in our wheelhouse, if you will, and we have excellent performance to show for it over the years in delivering the systems. So when customers think about that crosschecking model, the call is first, I'd like to say. I mean, we do a good job. Part of it has to do with the fact that we make a lot of these subsystems, whether it's beta links or the sensors, cameras, et cetera, and we're able to pull-through our own paths in these models, which also helps the whole business, if you will. If you get on 1 of these, it's not only the integration work but it's only for the buildings and cameras and the like. That is how we intended this model to work to be able to pull-through L-3's systems and subsystems, if you will, on these platforms. But given the economics of operating these jets versus wide-body commercial platform, I think this is a trend of the future."

If you look at the way I've been to think of it we always want to operate with a credit facility. I think it's prudent that the companies have for the M&A that come up or any other matter where cash stated in the short term. So run the assumption that, well, yes, we'll always have that. Then you get to the question of, well, what's that difference if you're investment-grade or not? And as you may know that if you're investment-grade, you don't have the restrictions on the payment of dividends and share repurchases and M&A. You have the restricted payment basket issue. So it's really a question of really what investment-grade versus not. You can look at it as we want a credit facility or not because we will not be able to operate with the cash deployment objectives that we embrace if we're not investment-grade credit facility. It just wouldn't work for us and everybody would be unhappy including me. And so I think it's not a far stretch to keep that investment-grade rating. Now it's typically the leverage ratio that is the operative 1 that gets more restrictive because the way the numbers work. And I believe that if in terms of rating agencies, Moody's is more restrictive of the 3, if you will. So that's the 1 we're watching. Ralph made a comment also as we get back to growth in EBITDA and margins, that should have a natural deleveraging effect, which will give us some more headroom, and then we'll be having that discussion. I just want to give you my perspective on what why that's important."

So some of the things that we're doing or things that we could bring from corporate are: 1, do we have or could we bring in more business development folks to the international side; #2, we are developing more international partnerships, either with aircraft OEMs or with other equipment suppliers or we other investor layers. So we have to see the people in this countries are going to go forward with these systems. We are the world leader in ISR manned platforms. And I believe that that will continue to be a market that will grow. So it's also not 1 of the more margin constrained marketplaces because, again, these are one-of-a-kind platforms and we are not usually be the into a low price. We're usually being too technical capability. And I'm interested in low-priced set about in this space in developing and delivering state-of-the-art platforms at good margins. So I again pointed to the fact that some significant international work have been completed and new work have not been brought in to fill that hole, if you will. And also there are on the U.S. side new platforms that will be coming out that have displaced some of the lifecycles sustainment that have historically being done across that business. So there were a couple of holes that need to get filled in this is an area where I want everybody focused on getting this business area back on track, where from margin standpoint and growth standpoint the execution continues to be excellent. 
So in wrapping up, the current geopolitical environment is volatile but presents new opportunities both in-country, domestically and internationally, and we are well-positioned to capitalize as we move through 2016. We continue to execute our strategy of strengthening our portfolio, investing in businesses that we know well and leveraging our strong cash flow generation to invest in the company and at the same time return cash to shareholders. Our investment in R&D and our market-leading positions make us ready to accommodate the short-term needs of the U.S. Government and to adapt and -- according to the longer-term opposite strategy. We're seeing benefits from our refined strategy, margins are improving in 2016 as is our top line. And we consider, and we will be moving forward with these efforts well into '17, and we're planning on keeping the margin expansion front and center for several years to come until we are satisfied with doing the best we can possibly do, of course, across the company. We're committed to strategic growth and performance and always we will work to enhance value for shareholders.

The fourth quarter reflected our continued focus on successfully reshaping our portfolio, expanding margins, enhancing our management team and returning our top line to growth.

The fourth quarter reflected our continued focus on successfully reshaping our portfolio, expanding margins, enhancing our management team and returning our top line to growth. The biggest action was the sale of NSS to CACI International for $550 million in cash. We're pleased with that price, which represents an attractive EBITDA multiple. We expect the sale of NSS to close next week and have reported NSS as a discontinued operation in our fourth quarter and full year results. We also divested Klein Associates, a small side scan sonar business during the quarter. These actions reflect our commitment to repositioning our portfolio and improving our financial performance by focusing on our core defense electronics communications and ISR markets where we have leading positions and strong technical discriminators. As we continue to prudently evaluate potential acquisitions and further divestitures, we're taking market considerations -- market conditions into consideration consistent with fair practices, there are a number of key factors that go into our decision-making process, including return on capital and improvement of L-3's competitive position, both will make us better equipped to create value for shareholders as well as customers. In the quarter and for the year as a whole, we had strong performance on our re-competes and program execution across our business. I want to thank all of our employees around the world for their contributions and for their continuing support to deliver the best we have for our customers. Things are progressing well from an operational standpoint. Chris Kubasik is advancing our strategic plan and operations. Specifically, he's focusing on improving our margin on organic growth profiles in coordination with our segment presidents as they continue to restructure business units. He is identifying opportunities for consolidation, including in supply chain and back-office operations, he is also actively engaged in our portfolio shaping as well. We are already seeing benefits from our refined strategy. Margins are improving at a nice pace in all 3 segments, and we anticipate that our top line, particularly organic growth, will continue to improve. 
Turning to our fourth quarter results. We had net sales of $2.9 billion, a decrease of 3% year-over-year. Net sales for the year were $10.5 billion, a 5% decrease from last year. Our organic growth for the quarter was $40 million or 1%. Consolidated segment operating margins came in at 8.9% for the quarter. Funded orders were $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter, and we ended the year with a book-to-bill ratio of 0.94. During the quarter and over this past year, we continue to generate robust cash flow, which has been 1 of L-3's long-standing strengths. We anticipate this will continue into the future. In 2015, we repurchased $740 million of our stock and paid $214 million in dividends, returning in aggregate almost $1 billion in cash to shareholders through a balanced commitment of capital allocation, we maintained an efficient capital structure with ample liquidity. We also committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, which is critical to our shareholder value creation strategy of dividends and share repurchases. This disciplined approach enables us to return cash to shareholders and strengthens the company by providing resources for strategic M&A opportunities and investments in growth areas. 
Before I address key awards for the quarter, I'd like to discuss a few important investment and portfolio integration initiatives. In 2015, we invested $260 million in research and development And, consequently, have seen some important advances in our R&D program. Our growth investments are focused on 3 key goals: Enhancing our product lines, growing future sales and developing new products and competitive discriminators. For example, our efforts in physics space modeling and simulation are notable. Here, we leverage technology from the gaming and visualization industry to develop L-3's ideation facility. This unique project enables a full mission simulation, capturing capabilities from the undersea to the space domain. It will enable our customers to clearly visualize the effectiveness of systems in an anti-access/area denial or A2AD environment. This is an area where L-3 is leading in technology development for this marketplace. This is a good example of the innovation and thought leadership that we at L-3 have embraced. And there's more to come. We're developing smaller lighter SATCOM terminals that maintain a high level of performance as well as future communication capabilities that improve the probability of intercept and detection. We also continue to upgrade our night vision products, specifically in the development of full digital night vision capability. These R&D advances reflect our position as an industry innovator and open the door to new sales opportunity. Our portfolio integration efforts are proceeding beyond our expectations. For example, ForceX is increasing L-3's capabilities and technologies by working internally with WESCAM, our Communication Systems-West and unmanned systems businesses, to provide enhanced sensor and imagery solutions to our customers. Additionally, the combination of CTC Aviation and Link U.K. is successfully expanding that business base. We also completed our MITEQ acquisition by acquiring advanced technical materials now called L-3 Narda ETM. ETM develops and manufactures specialized coaxial and waveguide RF microwave products and fits in well with our Narda MITEQ product lines. We are performing well on key programs. At platform integration, we continue to make progress towards the completion of the first VIP aircraft and are working closely with our customers. 
Now let me address a few significant wins in our defense, commercial aviation and our international businesses. From a macro perspective, the DoD budget has resumed growth, and we have seen improvement in our DoD organic sales growth rate. The DoD's third offset strategy also presents opportunities for L-3 and we're following it closely. L3 has many capabilities that will enhance our ability to help our customers achieve their goals and objectives. In the fourth quarter, we received a major contract to provide a Power Node Control Center or PNCC for naval destroyers. This is an advanced and effective power management system, and we see further opportunities for expanding its applications across other U.S. Navy platforms, including carriers, amphibious assault ships and littoral combat ships. Our ISR integration business continues to be robust, and we received new business awards for our major programs, including EMARSS as well as a classified programs. In addition, we were selected to provide U.S. Special Operations Command with binocular night vision equipment. We also received additional funding for a wide range of legacy programs featuring our Missile Defense Work uses Predator Mission Aircrew Training systems, C-130 displays, photonic mast work and Gray Eagle UAS work, which includes our innovative new composite maintenance systems trainer. Also in the training arena, we received a contract to upgrade over F-18 Tactical Operation Flight Trainers for the U.S. Navy. This award improves the fidelity of the training equipment and provides a new immersive experience for pilots. Finally, we received follow-on funding for programs such us army fleet support as well as a variety of modification and sustainment projects, including a Rivet Joint among others. 
For commercial aviation, this is a sector with strong growth potential and, as evidenced by our recent awards, we are capitalizing on opportunities and increasing our market share. Our commercial flight simulator and training business continues to be strong. We received orders from Turkish Airlines, Air China, Spring Airlines and Delta Airlines for a variety of simulators. The Delta order is particularly notable because it expands our market. In addition, our security and detection systems business remained solid and, in the fourth quarter, we received orders for a variety of products, including ProVision, checkpoint screening systems in the U.S. Capitol building. We also received orders for our new ClearScan aircraft baggage screening system from Singapore as well as a maintenance contract with the TSA for our examiner systems. In the international area, despite the ongoing lumpiness in that market, we remain focused on building our business and are pleased to report several developments. We've been increasing our resources by adding personnel and in-country offices to support business development activities. These efforts are paying off. We've been selected to supply night vision equipment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we received sales for our traveling wave tube equipment from several customers in Asia and China as well. WESCAM is also doing well supplementing its solid defense business with several international awards. 
In terms of our outlook for 2016, as you know, 2015 was a transformative year for us. As we look ahead to '16, we expect to maintain a positive momentum as we drive margin improvement and continue to reposition the portfolio. Our focus remains concentrated on growing our business and capturing additional market share, and we continue to move towards higher-margin areas, pioneer innovative technologies through targeted R&D investments and strengthen our core business through strategic M&A. Our approach to M&A remains the same. We regularly monitor and evaluate companies that might meaningfully contribute to the strength of our business, pursuing accretive acquisitions with strong margins and high-growth rates. Smaller acquisitions will be fully integrated into our existing operations wherever possible. Our strategies for growth combined with our strong balance sheet and thoughtful approach to capital allocation position us well for success in the coming year. 
With that, let me now turn it over to, Ralph, for a more in-depth look at the financials, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Ralph?"

I'll discuss some details about the fourth quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. First, I want to remind everyone that we reclassified NSS to discontinued operations for all periods. As Mike said, we expect to complete that sale over the next week, so my comments will only concern L-3's continuing operations which do not include NSS. 
We had solid performance for the fourth quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share, sales and free cash flow coming in better than our outlook. It was driven primarily by higher sales and lower taxes due to the reenactment of the R&E tax credit. Adjusted diluted EPS excludes losses on business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges, including the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge for Logistics Solutions. Fourth quarter sales were just under $2.9 billion and grew organically by 1%. Sales were about $90 million above the midpoint guidance that we provided, driven by higher U.S. Department of Defense sales mostly in Communication Systems. We believe our fourth quarter demonstrate that the sales growth rate for our U.S. Government and DoD business is improving, and we expect it will continue to improve this year in 2016. 
Consolidated operating margin was 50 basis points below what we anticipated for the fourth quarter and 10 basis points below what we expected for the full year 2015 with lower margins in Electronic Systems and Aerospace Systems. The Electronic Systems margin was 11.3% for the fourth quarter and 11.5% for the full year, and it was impacted by a $20 million refund liability provision for EOTech holographic weapon sights. Aerospace Systems margins was about 15 basis points lower than what we expected, and that was primarily due to higher material and labor cost on fixed price per flight [indiscernible] and and Logistics Solutions. Communication Systems margin was better than we expected, driving its full year margin 25 basis points higher than our guidance. Fourth quarter free cash flow of $406 million was also very solid, bringing the full year to $829 million, which was $19 million better than we expected and essentially due to the unexpected reenactment of the R&E tax credit. As we recently have explained, we invested significant amount each year in R&D to sustain and grow our business and that R&D also creates a valuable cash taxes reduction for the company. 
Moving on to 2016. Compared to our initial guidance that we provided at the investor conference on December 8 last month, our 2016 guidance includes increases for EPS, free cash flow and operating margins primarily due to 2 items. First, the R&E tax credit, which was permanently reenacted by Congress last month; and secondly, pension expense will be $32 million lower than our initial estimate. These changes each increased 2016 EPS by about $0.25, lifting the EPS guidance range at the midpoint by $0.50 to $7.50, which is an increase of 9% compared to 2015 adjusted diluted earnings per share. The lots also raises consolidated operating margin guidance by about 30 basis points with corresponding increases in each of the segment margins. We made no other changes to 2016 sales and margin guidance. Our consolidated sales guidance remains at $10,050,000,000 at the midpoint for 2016. With 2015 sales coming in a little higher than what we expected, our 2016 guidance now assumes an organic sales decline of approximately 2.5%. We expect our U.S. Government, including the DoD business, to be down 2% organically versus '15; commercial to grow about 8%; and international sales to decline about 14% versus '15. With respect to the U.S. Government and DoD business, the final runoff of the Afghanistan drawdown sales in 2016 is expected to reduce sales by about $135 million. And without it, our sales in the U.S. Government and DoD markets would be about flat in 2016. We hope to have some upside with our U.S. Government sales in 2016. We increased the consolidated operating margin guidance to 9.8%, which is 130 basis points of an increase over 2015 with margins increasing in all 3 segments. Our diluted shares outstanding estimate stays at 77.5 million for 2016, which is 5% lower than last year and it continues to include share repurchases of $750 million for the year. We increased our free cash flow estimate by $15 million to $825 million and that is comprised of 3 changes. First, the R&E credit will add about $20 million; slightly better working capital performance adds $15 million; and then we're increasing our investment in capital expenditures by $15 million and that nets to the increase. The cash flow guidance for 2016 continues to assume about $100 million of pension contributions. 
With respect to our capital allocation, in addition to the planned share repurchases of $750 million for 2016, cash dividends will be slightly above $200 million, and we intend to repay $300 million of debt. We also acquired a small microwave components business that, Mike talked about. That closed last week and that was for $27 million, and we're integrating that into our Narda MITEQ division in the Communication Systems segment. After these capital deployment actions, we estimate that we'll end 2016 with a cash balance of about $325 million. Our capital allocation and financing strategy continues to include our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade ratings, I want to underscore that we don't view the ratings, the investment-grade ratings as transitory. And for the last point, our 2016 guidance, we expect our book-to-bill ratio to be about 1.0. Looking at the first quarter of 2016, we expect sales to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion with an organic sales decline of about 2%. Margin will be about 9% for the first quarter with EPS between $1.50 and $1.60. Free cash flow coming in somewhere between 0 and $50 million, and book-to-bill ratio between 1 point -- between 0.9 and 1.0. 
So to conclude my financial review, L-3 is in a process of positive transition. We're focused on program performance, expanding margin and returning our top line to an organic growth position. We're also strengthening our business portfolio to structurally improve our competitive positions, sales growth rate and margin expansion profile. We continue to generate solid free cash flow and are allocating it to increase shareholder value. We recognize that we have more work to do. We know what is to be done, and we look forward to updating you on the company's progress throughout the year. Thank you, and we'll begin the Q&A now."

So we are not satisfied with the performance in Aerospace from both a margin and order standpoint and sales, of course, sales growth. That said, there are strengths in the business, and we do see opportunities to improve results. We've identified a number of new program opportunities and, in fact, customers have indicated that they would like to see L-3 as a bidder. In fact, we continue to get certain amounts of work of all sorts just because of the capability at that business units are unmatched in the country, unmatched. However, they've been through a difficult cycle. So as we anticipate in improving budgetary environment ahead, we believe that there will be opportunities that can lead to better top line growth as well. So in terms of allocating resources, it's something that I've deployed, Chris, on to monitor closely as well as Dave Van Buren. These are programs that both are very familiar with including all this. We've made several visits to the business unit during the last quarter, and we have all eyes focused on getting it improved, getting that now. Unfortunately, there are a number of sizeable international contracts that had completed last year. Some of them a little bit earlier than that have been anticipated such as the Airseeker program, and were not backfilled, if you will, with new work because of a slowdown internationally. So those were significant program so that's causing a bit of a dip in the numbers. And there are opportunities, again, internationally to bring more work in in-house there as well as on the U.S. Government side. So I think a few more quarters of work on it and we'll start to see some results getting new work in-house. But I believe that's the first step in getting that to turn around."

And Asia continues to be a growth area for us. Of course, you have the oil price issue in the Middle East that is, I think, putting a bit of a crimp in spending. Since many of these countries have survived without some of these platforms in the past whether they're sophisticated ISR signals, intelligence platforms that require not only the aircraft but ground stations and operators and processing and the like, and they're very big-ticket items. So while we are seeing that slowdown, we're seeing an uptick, if you will, in Asia. Some of the things we've been focusing on is partnering internationally with platform manufacturers, if you will, or other in-country industrial partners to help in that regard. And it's been working out pretty well. We have a few aircraft under contract in Japan, for example, that we talked about last year, more in Korea. And there is more, I don't want to talk about for competitive reasons, but we are actively in pursuit of several major platform type programs where L-3 will be the prime systems integrator of typically sophisticated ISR systems on commercial type platforms, which is really where this business has been going over the last several years."

But the portfolio shaping does remain a core element of our strategy, and we will continue to focus on our core defense electronics communications and ISR markets as we've been saying. However, as we continue to evaluate the portfolio, we're taking the market conditions into consideration. The NSS transaction demonstrates our commitment to acting when we see the right valuations available, and we will continue to be opportunistic, and will consider value-enhancing opportunities. But right now, as you know, the debt market or I guess you would call it high-yield or private equity guys is not really there as it's been. So, of course, there is a bit of a crimp in evaluation, and we're not really looking to give things away. We're dealing one particular business with well over $1 billion in sales where the offers are very disappointing in terms of numbers that have been bantered around. I know there was a piece that was out last weekend. We're not interested in pursuing that kind of a transaction if it's not value accretive to shareholders. We'll stay focused."

So we have been making progress in areas such as aviation training and simulation, advanced avionics equipment, night vision equipment, Sensor Systems, tactical SATCOM, airborne ISR which are the more bigger-ticket items, where the slippage is apparent as programs again completed like Airseeker and others and have not been backfilled, if you will. So that goes also with multimission-type aircraft. We have been working on systems where 1 platform can fulfill multiple missions addressing a tighter budget carrier environment where some of these customers do not want to buy a separate aircraft for every single mission, whether it's airborne ISR, maritime patrol, search and rescue, et cetera. There are looking more from our experience -- from my experience with aircrafts that are rapidly reconfigurable to meet the mission, so I don't have to buy it once and buy multiple sensor packages that can plug in. Military simulation systems are active. Security & Detection Systems, airports are upgraded and built out and anti-submarine warfare. So those are all areas we are seeing some growth. And it's -- I would say its not that there were no sales but the sales cycle is certainly a longer proposition right now."

It's helped 1 of most significant problems we as an industry are faced, which is lack of visibility. So even directionally its a good thing. But you're asking a little more. So we think most of the movement is going to be in the classified area. I think some of the comments made by Secretary Kendall pointed to that as well. The overseas contingency fund, OCO account, may grow as well. As you know, a lot of the growth will be driven by international events as they unfold. And as you know, there is a lot going on all over the place. So I'd say more likely upside than downside there. And we've also been listening very carefully to some of the commentary by those in the building, particularly Secretary Kendall and the acquisition chiefs in terms of the types of capabilities or investments they are looking for. What they have been specifically asking the industry is to be a little more forward leaning on R&D. And as you've seen, we have been trying to respond in that way because there are things that we do that fit some of the requirements they have and it would certainly be good to start to grow a little more organically in that space. So we have been trying to meet those requests and develop more, especially in the classified space, where we are doing very well right now.

We are operating in a couple of markets whether it's the training and simulation area where there is a huge pilot demand, if you will, because of retirements, and the number, if you research, it is I believe 0.5 million pilots over the next 5 -- could be 10 years or so. And then you have our avionics businesses, which have historically done very well. The problem in that space is that anything that were to come online for sale is typically very expensive and hard to make a good business case for. We've looked at several companies over the years and where we see something that fits well with what we do, particularly something that could be consolidated and a lot of overhead saved that usually requisites to be able to make those numbers work. Because there are typically higher growth, higher margin and other things that we would see in the defense space and they command higher prices, as you know you have to pay a lot for growth in this marketplace these days. So yes, we love to grow the business and we love to grow it through acquisitions. But right now, we've seen the better deal for us being investing in our own products and developing things rather than acquiring them right now, and we will also pursue that as a strategy. So we are on -- with the NexGen system we have equipage there and we continually work on developing more avionics for the general aviation marketplace where we continue to do very well. And for the large transport, that seems to be more regulation-driven, whether it's requirement for new recorder or revision to the key tag system, but we keep a robust R&D program that will help us with the growth and should a good deal present itself, we'll certainly be all over it."

I'd use the term prospecting with some of the big heavyweight ISR platforms to more affordable bizjet.

And we sit well in that space in terms of being able to do that mechanisation work, which includes racks and racks of electronics and the precise placement of parent systems to increasing range for being on station, which could mean auxiliary fuel tanks and systems and putting in a refueling capability and the like. All those things are in our wheelhouse, if you will, and we have excellent performance to show for it over the years in delivering these systems. So when customers think about that cross-decking model, they call L-3 first, as I'd like to say. I mean, we do a good job. Part of it has to do with the fact that we make a lot of these subsystems, whether it's data links or the sensors, cameras, et cetera, and we're able to pull-through our own products in these models, which also helps the whole business, if you will. If you get on 1 of these, it's not only the integration work but it's pulling through data links and cameras and the like.

I wanted to make a comment also to follow-up, Howard, on Ralph's comment on the investment-grade. If you look at it the way, I tend to think of it as we'll always want to operate with a credit facility. I think it's prudent that companies have credit facility should an M&A come up or any other matter where cash is needed in the short term. So you run the assumption that, well, yes, we'll always have that. Then you get to the question of, well, what's that difference if you're investment-grade or not? And as you may know that if you're investment-grade, you don't have the restrictions on the payment of dividends and share repurchases and M&A. You have that ""restricted payment basket"" issue. So it's really a question of, we're looking at investment-grade versus not. You can look at it as do we want a credit facility or not because we would not be able to operate with the cash deployment objectives that we embrace if we're not investment-grade credit facility. It just wouldn't work for us and everybody would be unhappy including me. And so I think it's not a far stretch to keep that investment-grade rating now, and it's typically the leverage ratio that is the operative one that gets more restrictive because the way the numbers work. And I believe its -- in terms of rating agencies, Moody's is the more restrictive of the 3, if you will. So that's the one we're watching. Ralph made a comment also as we get back to growth in EBITDA and margins, that should have a natural deleveraging effect, which should give us some more headroom, and we won't be having this discussion, but I just wanted to give you my perspective on what -- why that's important."

So some of the things that we've been doing or things we could bring from corporate are: 1, do we have or could we bring in more business development folks to the international side; #2, we are developing more international partnerships, either with aircraft OEMs or with other equipment suppliers or with other investor players. So we have a seat at the table in these countries that are going to go forward with these systems. We are the world leader in ISR-manned platforms. And I believe that that will continue to be a market that will grow. So it's also not one of the more margin constrained marketplaces because, again, these are one-of-a-kind platforms and we are not usually bidding to a low price. We're usually being to a technical capability. And we're not interested in low-price technically acceptable in this space. We're interested in developing and delivering state-of-the-art platforms at good margins. So -- I again point it to the fact that some significant international work had been completed and new work had not been brought in to fill that hole, if you will. And also they're on the U.S. side new platforms that will be coming out that have displaced some of the life-cycle sustainment that had historically been done across that business. So there were a couple of holes that needed to get filled and this is an area where I want everybody focused on getting this business area back on track, where from a margin standpoint, from a growth standpoint the execution continues to be excellent. 
So in wrapping up, the current geopolitical environment is volatile but presents new opportunities both in-country, domestically and internationally, and we are well-positioned to capitalize as we move through 2016. We continue to execute our strategy of strengthening our portfolio, investing in businesses that we know well and leveraging our strong cash flow generation to invest in the company and at the same time return cash to shareholders. Our investment in R&D and our market-leading positions make us ready to accommodate the short-term needs of the U.S. Government and to adapt and ship according to its longer-term third offset strategy. We're seeing benefits from our refined strategy, margins are improving in 2016 as is our top line. And we consider, and we will be moving forward with these efforts well into '17, and we're planning on keeping the margin expansion front and center for several years to come until we are satisfied we're doing the best we could possibly do across the company. We're committed to strategic growth and performance and as always we will work to enhance value for our shareholders. So thanks again for joining us this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you again in April."

The fourth quarter reflected our continued focus on successfully reshaping our portfolio, expanding margins, enhancing our management team and returning our top line to growth. The biggest action was the sale of NSS",1558,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter reflected our continued focus on successfully reshaping our portfolio, expanding margins, enhancing our management team and returning our top line to growth. The biggest action was the sale of NSS to CACI International for $550 million in cash. We're pleased with that price, which represents an attractive EBITDA multiple. We expect the sale of NSS to close next week and have reported NSS as a discontinued operation in our fourth quarter and full year results. We also divested Klein Associates, a small side scan sonar business during the quarter. These actions reflect our commitment to repositioning our portfolio and improving our financial performance by focusing on our core defense electronics communications and ISR markets where we have leading positions and strong technical discriminators. As we continue to prudently evaluate potential acquisitions and further divestitures, we're taking market considerations -- market conditions into consideration consistent with fair practices. There are a number of key factors that go into our decision-making process, including return on capital and improvement of L-3's competitive position. Both will make us better equipped to create value for shareholders as well as customers. In the quarter and for the year as a whole, we had strong performance on our re-competes and program execution across our business. I want to thank all of our employees around the world for their contributions and for their continuing support to deliver the best we have for our customers. Things are progressing well from an operational standpoint. Chris Kubasik is advancing our strategic plan and operations. Specifically, he's focusing on improving our margin on organic growth profiles in coordination with our segment presidents as they continue to restructure business units. He is identifying opportunities for consolidation, including in supply chain and back-office operations, he is also actively engaged in our portfolio shaping as well. We are already seeing benefits from our refined strategy. Margins are improving at a nice pace in all 3 segments, and we anticipate that our top line, particularly organic growth, will continue to improve. 
Turning to our fourth quarter results. We had net sales of $2.9 billion, a decrease of 3% year-over-year. Net sales for the year were $10.5 billion, a 5% decrease from last year. Our organic growth for the quarter was $40 million or 1%. Consolidated segment operating margins came in at 8.9% for the quarter. Funded orders were $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter, and we ended the year with a book-to-bill ratio of 0.94. During the quarter and over this past year, we continue to generate robust cash flow, which has been one of L-3's long-standing strengths. We anticipate this will continue into the future. In 2015, we repurchased $740 million of our stock and paid $214 million in dividends, returning in aggregate almost $1 billion in cash to shareholders through a balanced commitment of capital allocation, we maintained an efficient capital structure with ample liquidity. We also committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, which is critical to our shareholder value creation strategy of dividends and share repurchases. This disciplined approach enables us to return cash to shareholders and strengthens the company by providing resources for strategic M&A opportunities and investments in growth areas. 
Before I address key awards for the quarter, I'd like to discuss a few important investment and portfolio integration initiatives. In 2015, we invested $260 million in research and development And, consequently, have seen some important advances in our R&D program. Our growth investments are focused on 3 key goals: Enhancing our product lines, growing future sales and developing new products and competitive discriminators. For example, our efforts in physics space modeling and simulation are notable. Here, we leverage technology from the gaming and visualization industry to develop L-3's ideation facility. This unique project enables a full mission simulation, capturing capabilities from the undersea to the space domain. It will enable our customers to clearly visualize the effectiveness of systems in an anti-access/area denial or A2AD environment. This is an area where L-3 is leading in technology development for this marketplace. This is a good example of the innovation and thought leadership that we at L-3 have embraced. And there's more to come. We're developing smaller lighter SATCOM terminals that maintain a high level of performance as well as future communication capabilities that improve the probability of intercept and detection. We also continue to upgrade our night vision products, specifically in the development of full digital night vision capability. These R&D advances reflect our position as an industry innovator and open the door to new sales opportunity. Our portfolio integration efforts are proceeding beyond our expectations. For example, ForceX is increasing L-3's capabilities and technologies by working internally with WESCAM, our Communication Systems-West and unmanned systems businesses, to provide enhanced sensor and imagery solutions to our customers. Additionally, the combination of CTC Aviation and Link U.K. is successfully expanding that business base. We also completed our MITEQ acquisition by acquiring advanced technical materials now called L-3 Narda ETM. ETM develops and manufactures specialized coaxial and waveguide RF microwave products and fits in well with our Narda MITEQ product lines. We are performing well on key programs. At platform integration, we continue to make progress towards the completion of the first VIP aircraft and are working closely with our customers. 
Now let me address a few significant wins in our defense, commercial aviation and our international businesses. From a macro perspective, the DoD budget has resumed growth, and we have seen improvement in our DoD organic sales growth rate. The DoD's third offset strategy also presents opportunities for L-3 and we're following it closely. L3 has many capabilities that will enhance our ability to help our customers achieve their goals and objectives. In the fourth quarter, we received a major contract to provide a Power Node Control Center or PNCC for naval destroyers. This is an advanced and effective power management system, and we see further opportunities for expanding its applications across other U.S. Navy platforms, including carriers, amphibious assault ships and littoral combat ships. Our ISR integration business continues to be robust, and we received new business awards for our major programs, including EMARSS as well as a classified programs. In addition, we were selected to provide U.S. Special Operations Command with binocular night vision equipment. We also received additional funding for a wide range of legacy programs featuring our Missile Defense Work uses Predator Mission Aircrew Training systems, C-130 displays, photonic mast work and Gray Eagle UAS work, which includes our innovative new composite maintenance systems trainer. Also in the training arena, we received a contract to upgrade over F-18 Tactical Operation Flight Trainers for the U.S. Navy. This award improves the fidelity of the training equipment and provides a new immersive experience for pilots. Finally, we received follow-on funding for programs such as army fleet support as well as a variety of modification and sustainment projects, including a Rivet Joint among others. 
For commercial aviation, this is a sector with strong growth potential and, as evidenced by our recent awards, we are capitalizing on opportunities and increasing our market share. Our commercial flight simulator and training business continues to be strong. We received orders from Turkish Airlines, Air China, Spring Airlines and Delta Airlines for a variety of simulators. The Delta order is particularly notable because it expands our market. In addition, our security and detection systems business remained solid and, in the fourth quarter, we received orders for a variety of products, including ProVision, checkpoint screening systems in the U.S. Capitol building. We also received orders for our new ClearScan aircraft baggage screening system from Singapore as well as a maintenance contract with the TSA for our examiner systems. In the international area, despite the ongoing lumpiness in that market, we remain focused on building our business and are pleased to report several developments. We've been increasing our resources by adding personnel and in-country offices to support business development activities. These efforts are paying off. We've been selected to supply night vision equipment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we received sales for our traveling wave tube equipment from several customers in Asia and China as well. WESCAM is also doing well supplementing its solid defense business with several international awards. 
In terms of our outlook for 2016, as you know, 2015 was a transformative year for us. As we look ahead to '16, we expect to maintain a positive momentum as we drive margin improvement and continue to reposition the portfolio. Our focus remains concentrated on growing our business and capturing additional market share, and we continue to move towards higher-margin areas, pioneer innovative technologies through targeted R&D investments and strengthen our core business through strategic M&A. Our approach to M&A remains the same. We regularly monitor and evaluate companies that might meaningfully contribute to the strength of our business, pursuing accretive acquisitions with strong margins and high-growth rates. Smaller acquisitions will be fully integrated into our existing operations wherever possible. Our strategies for growth combined with our strong balance sheet and thoughtful approach to capital allocation position us well for success in the coming year. 
With that, let me now turn it over to, Ralph, for a more in-depth look at the financials, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Ralph?"
93538,322762948,923007,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Okay, thank you, Mike.

I'll discuss some details about the fourth quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. First, I want to remind everyone that we reclassified NSS to discontinued operations for all periods. As Mike said, we expect to complete that sale over the next week, so my comments will only concern L-3's continuing operations which do not include NSS. 
We had solid performance for the fourth quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share, sales and free cash flow coming in better than our outlook. It was driven primarily by higher sales and lower taxes due to the reenactment of the R&E tax credit. Adjusted diluted EPS excludes losses on business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges, including the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge for Logistics Solutions. Fourth quarter sales were just under $2.9 billion and grew organically by 1%. Sales were about $90 million above the midpoint guidance that we provided, driven by higher U.S. Department of Defense sales mostly in Communication Systems. We believe our fourth quarter sales demonstrate that the sales growth rate for our U.S. Government and DoD business is improving, and we expect it will continue to improve this year in 2016. 
Consolidated operating margin was 50 basis points below what we anticipated for the fourth quarter and 10 basis points below what we expected for the full year 2015 with lower margins in Electronic Systems and Aerospace Systems. The Electronic Systems margin was 11.3% for the fourth quarter and 11.5% for the full year, and it was impacted by a $20 million refund liability provision for EOTech holographic weapon sights. Aerospace Systems margins was about 15 basis points lower than what we expected, and that was primarily due to higher material and labor cost on fixed price per flight [indiscernible] and Logistics Solutions. Communication Systems margin was better than we expected, driving its full year margin 25 basis points higher than our guidance. Fourth quarter free cash flow of $406 million was also very solid, bringing the full year to $829 million, which was $19 million better than we expected and essentially due to the unexpected reenactment of the R&E tax credit. As we recently have explained, we invest significant amount each year in R&D to sustain and grow our business and that R&D also creates a valuable cash taxes reduction for the company. 
Moving on to 2016. Compared to our initial guidance that we provided at the investor conference on December 8 last month, our 2016 guidance includes increases for EPS, free cash flow and operating margins primarily due to 2 items. First, the R&E tax credit, which was permanently reenacted by Congress last month; and secondly, pension expense will be $32 million lower than our initial estimate. These changes each increased 2016 EPS by about $0.25, lifting the EPS guidance range at the midpoint by $0.50 to $7.50, which is an increase of 9% compared to 2015 adjusted diluted earnings per share. The law also raises consolidated operating margin guidance by about 30 basis points with corresponding increases in each of the segment margins. We made no other changes to 2016 sales and margin guidance. Our consolidated sales guidance remains at $10,050,000,000 at the midpoint for 2016. With 2015 sales coming in a little higher than what we expected, our 2016 guidance now assumes an organic sales decline of approximately 2.5%. We expect our U.S. Government, including the DoD business, to be down 2% organically versus '15; commercial to grow about 8%; and international sales to decline about 14% versus '15. With respect to the U.S. Government and DoD business, the final runoff of the Afghanistan drawdown sales in 2016 is expected to reduce sales by about $135 million. And without it, our sales in the U.S. Government and DoD markets would be about flat in 2016. We hope to have some upside with our U.S. Government sales in 2016. We increased the consolidated operating margin guidance to 9.8%, which is 130 basis points of an increase over 2015 with margins increasing in all 3 segments. Our diluted shares outstanding estimate stays at 77.5 million for 2016, which is 5% lower than last year and it continues to include share repurchases of $750 million for the year. We increased our free cash flow estimate by $15 million to $825 million and that is comprised of 3 changes. First, the R&E credit will add about $20 million; slightly better working capital performance adds $15 million; and then we're increasing our investment in capital expenditures by $15 million and that nets to the increase. The cash flow guidance for 2016 continues to assume about $100 million of pension contributions. 
With respect to our capital allocation, in addition to the planned share repurchases of $750 million for 2016, cash dividends will be slightly above $200 million, and we intend to repay $300 million of debt. We also acquired a small microwave components business that, Mike talked about. That closed last week and that was for $27 million, and we're integrating that into our Narda MITEQ division in the Communication Systems segment. After these capital deployment actions, we estimate that we'll end 2016 with a cash balance of about $325 million. Our capital allocation and financing strategy continues to include our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade ratings, I want to underscore that we don't view the ratings, the investment-grade ratings as transitory. And for the last point, our 2016 guidance, we expect our book-to-bill ratio to be about 1.0. Looking at the first quarter of 2016, we expect sales to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion with an organic sales decline of about 2%. Margin will be about 9% for the first quarter with EPS between $1.50 and $1.60. Free cash flow coming in somewhere between 0 and $50 million, and book-to-bill ratio between 1 point -- between 0.9 and 1.0. 
So to conclude my financial review, L-3 is in a process of positive transition. We're focused on program performance, expanding margin and returning our top line to an organic growth position. We're also strengthening our business portfolio to structurally improve our competitive positions, sales growth rate and margin expansion profile. We continue to generate solid free cash flow and are allocating it to increase shareholder value. We recognize that we have more work to do. We know what is to be done, and we look forward to updating you on the company's progress throughout the year. Thank you, and we'll begin the Q&A now."

So we are not satisfied with the performance in Aerospace from both a margin and order standpoint and sales, of course, sales growth. That said, there are strengths in the business, and we do see opportunities to improve results. We've identified a number of new program opportunities and, in fact, customers have indicated that they would like to see L-3 as a bidder. In fact, we continue to get certain amounts of work of all sorts just because of the capability at that business units are unmatched in the country, unmatched. However, they've been through a difficult cycle. So as we anticipate in improving budgetary environment ahead, we believe that there will be opportunities that can lead to better top line growth as well. So in terms of allocating resources, it's something that I've deployed, Chris, on to monitor closely as well as Dave Van Buren. These are programs that both are very familiar with including all of us. We've made several visits to the business unit during the last quarter, and we have all eyes focused on getting it improved, getting that now. Unfortunately, there are a number of sizeable international contracts that had completed last year. Some of them a little bit earlier than that had been anticipated such as the Airseeker program, and were not backfilled, if you will, with new work because of a slowdown internationally. So those were significant programs, so that's causing a bit of a dip in the numbers. And there are opportunities, again, internationally to bring more work in in-house there as well as on the U.S. Government side. So I think a few more quarters of work on it and we'll start to see some results in  getting new work in-house. But I believe that's the first step in getting that to turn around."

And Asia continues to be a growth area for us. Of course, you have the oil price issue in the Middle East that is, I think, putting a bit of a crimp in spending. Since many of these countries have survived without some of these platforms in the past whether they're sophisticated ISR signals, intelligence platforms that require not only the aircraft but ground stations and operators and processing and the like, and they're very big-ticket items. So while we are seeing that slowdown, we're seeing an uptick, if you will, in Asia. Some of the things we've been focusing on is partnering internationally with platform manufacturers, if you will, or other in-country industrial partners to help in that regard. And it's been working out pretty well. We have a few aircraft under contract in Japan, for example, that we talked about last year, more in Korea. And there is more that I don't want to talk about for competitive reasons, but we are actively in pursuit of several major platform type programs where L-3 will be the prime systems integrator of typically sophisticated ISR systems on commercial type platforms, which is really where this business has been going over the last several years."

But right now, as you know, the debt market or I guess you would call it high-yield or private equity guys is not really there as it's been. So, of course, there is a bit of a crimp in valuation, and we're not really looking to give things away. We're dealing one particular business with well over $1 billion in sales where the offers are very disappointing in terms of numbers that have been bantered around. I know there was a piece that was out last weekend. We're not interested in pursuing that kind of a transaction if it's not value accretive to shareholders. We'll stay focused."

So we have been making progress on areas such as aviation training and simulation, advanced avionics equipment, night vision equipment, sensor systems, tactical SATCOM, airborne ISR which are the more bigger-ticket items, where the slippage is apparent as programs again completed like Airseeker and others and have not been backfilled, if you will. So that goes also with multimission-type aircraft. We have been working on systems where 1 platform can fulfill multiple missions addressing a tighter budget carrier environment where some of these customers do not want to buy a separate aircraft for every single mission, whether it's airborne ISR, nightime patrol, search and rescue, et cetera. They are looking more from our experience -- from my experience with aircrafts that are rapidly reconfigurable to meet the mission, so they only have to buy it once and buy multiple sensor packages that can plug in. Military simulation systems are active. Security & Detection Systems as airports are upgraded and built out and anti-submarine warfare. So those are all areas we are seeing some growth. And it's -- I would say its not that there were no sales but the sales cycle is certainly a longer proposition right now."

The overseas contingency fund, OCO account, may grow as well. As you know, a lot of the growth will be driven by international events as they unfold. And as you know, there is a lot going on all over the place. So I'd say more likely upside than downside there. And we've also been listening very carefully to some of the commentary by those in the building, particularly Secretary Kendall and the acquisition chiefs in terms of the types of capabilities or investments they are looking for. But they have been specifically asking the industry is to be a little more forward leaning on R&D. And as you've seen, we have been trying to respond in that way because there are things that we do that fit some of the requirements they have and it would certainly be good to start to grow a little more organically in that space.

And then you have our avionics businesses, which have historically done very well. The problem in that space is that anything that were to come online for sale is typically very expensive and hard to make a good business case for. We've looked at several companies over the years and where we see something that fits well with what we do, particularly something that could be consolidated and a lot of overhead saved that usually requisites to be able to make those numbers work. Because there are typically higher growth, higher margin than other things that we would see in the defense space and they command higher prices, as you know you have to pay a lot for growth in this marketplace these days. So yes, we love to grow the business and we love to grow it through acquisitions. But right now, we've seen the better deal for us being investing in our own products and developing things rather than acquiring them right now, and we will also pursue that as a strategy. So we are on  with the NexGen system we have equipage there and we continually work on developing more avionics for the general aviation marketplace where we continue to do very well. And for the large transport, that seems to be more regulation-driven, whether it's requirement for new recorder or revision to the key tag system, but we keep a robust R&D program that will help us with the growth and should a good deal present itself, we'll certainly be all over it."

We do have some covenant requirements on  existing debt arrangements but they allow for -- they're not a problem in terms of maintaining them. So being investment-grade versus not investment-grade is not a trivial decision. I mean, you don't flip the switch back and forth between those positions. So we've been investment-grade since 2009. Event though we're investment-grade, we do have a very aggressive financial policy in that we deploy most of our cash and we have a good amount of leverage on the balance sheet, and that's responsible in terms of delivering better returns to our shareholders."

I'd use the term prospecting with some of the big heavyweight ISR platforms to more affordable bizjets. I mean, this one you saw is very representative of the trend in many countries and how they're looking at their ISR mission requirements. And we sit well in that space in terms of being able to do that mechanisation work, which includes racks and racks of electronics and the precise placement of parent systems to increasing range for being on station, which could mean auxiliary fuel tanks and systems and putting in a refueling capability and the like. All those things are in our wheelhouse, if you will, and we have excellent performance to show for it over the years in delivering these systems. So when customers think about that cross-decking model, they call L-3 first, as I'd like to say. I mean, we do a good job. Part of it has to do with the fact that we make a lot of these subsystems, whether it's data links or the sensors, cameras, et cetera, and we're able to pull-through our own products in these models, which also helps the whole business, if you will. If you get on one of these, it's not only the integration work but it's pulling through data links and cameras and the like. That is how we intended this model to work to be able to pull-through L-3's systems and subsystems, if you will, on these platforms. But given the economics of operating a bizjet versus a wide-body commercial platform, I think this is a trend of the future."

I wanted to make a comment also to follow-up, Howard, on Ralph's comment on the investment-grade. If you look at it the way, I tend to think of it as we'll always want to operate with a credit facility. I think it's prudent that companies have credit facilities should an M&A come up or any other matter where cash is needed in the short term. So you run the assumption that, well, yes, we'll always have that. Then you get to the question of, well, what's that difference if you're investment-grade or not? And as you may know that if you're investment-grade, you don't have the restrictions on the payment of dividends and share repurchases and M&A. You have that ""restricted payments basket"" issue. So it's really a question of, we're looking at investment-grade versus not. You can look at it as do we want a credit facility or not because we would not be able to operate with the cash deployment objectives that we embrace with a non-investment-grade credit facility. It just wouldn't work for us and everybody would be unhappy including me. And so I think it's not a far stretch to keep that investment-grade rating now, and it's typically the leverage ratio that is the operative one that gets more restrictive because the way the numbers work. And I believe its -- in terms of rating agencies, Moody's is the more restrictive of the 3, if you will. So that's the one we're watching. Ralph made a comment also as we get back to growth in EBITDA and margins, that should have a natural deleveraging effect, which should give us some more headroom, and we won't be having this discussion, but I just wanted to give you my perspective on what -- why that's important."

So some of the things that we've been doing or things we could bring from corporate are: 1, do we have or could we bring in more business development folks to the international side; #2, we are developing more international partnerships, either with aircraft OEMs or with other equipment suppliers or with other industrial players. So we have a seat at the table in these countries that are going to go forward with these systems. We are the world leader in ISR-manned platforms. And I believe that that will continue to be a market that will grow. So it's also not one of the more margin constrained marketplaces because, again, these are one-of-a-kind platforms and we are not usually bidding to a low price. We're usually being to a technical capability. And we're not interested in low-price technically acceptable in this space. We're interested in developing and delivering state-of-the-art platforms at good margins. So -- I again pointed to the fact that some significant international work had been completed and new work had not been brought in to fill that hole, if you will. And also they're on the U.S. side new platforms that will be coming out that have displaced some of the life-cycle sustainment that had historically been done across that business. So there were a couple of holes that need to get filled and this is an area where I want everybody focused on getting this business area back on track, where from a margin standpoint, from a growth standpoint. The execution continues to be excellent. 
So in wrapping up, the current geopolitical environment is volatile but presents new opportunities both in-country domestically and internationally, and we are well-positioned to capitalize as we move through 2016. We continue to execute our strategy of strengthening our portfolio, investing in businesses that we know well and leveraging our strong cash flow generation to invest in the company and at the same time return cash to shareholders. Our investment in R&D and our market-leading positions make us ready to accommodate the short-term needs of the U.S. Government and to adapt and ship according to its longer-term third offset strategy. We're seeing benefits from our refined strategy, margins are improving in 2016 as is our top line. And we consider, and we will be moving forward with these efforts well into '17, and we're planning on keeping the margin expansion front and center for several years to come until we are satisfied we're doing the best we could possibly do across the company. We're committed to strategic growth and performance and as always we will work to enhance value for our shareholders.

The fourth quarter reflected our continued focus on successfully reshaping our portfolio, expanding margins, enhancing our management team and returning our top line to growth. The biggest action was the sale of NSS to CACI International for $550 million in cash. We're pleased with that price, which represents an attractive EBITDA multiple. We expect the sale of NSS to close next week and have reported NSS as a discontinued operation in our fourth quarter and full year results. We also divested Klein Associates, a small side scan sonar business during the quarter. These actions reflect our commitment to repositioning our portfolio and improving our financial performance by focusing on our core defense electronics communications and ISR markets where we have leading positions and strong technical discriminators. As we continue to prudently evaluate potential acquisitions and further divestitures, we're taking market considerations -- market conditions into consideration consistent with fair practices. There are a number of key factors that go into our decision-making process, including return on capital and improvement of L-3's competitive position. Both will make us better equipped to create value for shareholders as well as customers. In the quarter and for the year as a whole, we had strong performance on our re-competes and program execution across our business. I want to thank all of our employees around the world for their contributions and for their continuing support to deliver the best we have for our customers. Things are progressing well from an operational standpoint. Chris Kubasik is advancing our strategic plan and operations. Specifically, he's focusing on improving our margin on organic growth profiles in coordination with our segment presidents as they continue to restructure business units. He is identifying opportunities for consolidation, including in supply chain and back-office operations, he is also actively engaged in our portfolio shaping as well. We are already seeing benefits from our refined strategy. Margins are improving at a nice pace in all 3 segments, and we anticipate that our top line, particularly organic growth, will continue to improve. 
Turning to our fourth quarter results. We had net sales of $2.9 billion, a decrease of 3% year-over-year. Net sales for the year were $10.5 billion, a 5% decrease from last year. Our organic growth for the quarter was $40 million or 1%. Consolidated segment operating margins came in at 8.9% for the quarter. Funded orders were $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter, and we ended the year with a book-to-bill ratio of 0.94. During the quarter and over this past year, we continue to generate robust cash flow, which has been one of L-3's long-standing strengths. We anticipate this will continue into the future. In 2015, we repurchased $740 million of our stock and paid $214 million in dividends, returning in aggregate almost $1 billion in cash to shareholders through a balanced commitment of capital allocation, we maintained an efficient capital structure with ample liquidity. We also committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, which is critical to our shareholder value creation strategy of dividends and share repurchases. This disciplined approach enables us to return cash to shareholders and strengthens the company by providing resources for strategic M&A opportunities and investments in growth areas. 
Before I address key awards for the quarter, I'd like to discuss a few important investment and portfolio integration initiatives. In 2015, we invested $260 million in research and development and, consequently, have seen some important advances in our R&D program. Our growth investments are focused on 3 key goals: Enhancing our product lines, growing future sales and developing new products and competitive discriminators. For example, our efforts in physics space modeling and simulation are notable. Here, we leverage technology from the gaming and visualization industry to develop L-3's ideation facility. This unique project enables a full mission simulation, capturing capabilities from the undersea to the space domain. It will enable our customers to clearly visualize the effectiveness of systems in an anti-access/area denial or A2AD environment. This is an area where L-3 is leading in technology development for this marketplace. This is a good example of the innovation and thought leadership that we at L-3 have embraced. And there's more to come. We're developing smaller lighter SATCOM terminals that maintain a high level of performance as well as future communication capabilities that improve the probability of intercept and detection. We also continue to upgrade our night vision products, specifically in the development of full digital night vision capability. These R&D advances reflect our position as an industry innovator and open the door to new sales opportunity. Our portfolio integration efforts are proceeding beyond our expectations. For example, ForceX is increasing L-3's capabilities and technologies by working internally with WESCAM, our Communication Systems-West and unmanned systems businesses, to provide enhanced sensor and imagery solutions to our customers. Additionally, the combination of CTC Aviation and Link U.K. is successfully expanding that business base. We also completed our MITEQ acquisition by acquiring advanced technical materials now called L-3 Narda ETM. ETM develops and manufactures specialized coaxial and waveguide RF microwave products and fits in well with our Narda MITEQ product lines. We are performing well on key programs. At platform integration, we continue to make progress towards the completion of the first VIP aircraft and are working closely with our customers. 
Now let me address a few significant wins in our defense, commercial aviation and our international businesses. From a macro perspective, the DoD budget has resumed growth, and we have seen improvement in our DoD organic sales growth rate. The DoD's third offset strategy also presents opportunities for L-3 and we're following it closely. L3 has many capabilities that will enhance our ability to help our customers achieve their goals and objectives. In the fourth quarter, we received a major contract to provide a Power Node Control Center or PNCC for naval destroyers. This is an advanced and effective power management system, and we see further opportunities for expanding its applications across other U.S. Navy platforms, including carriers, amphibious assault ships and littoral combat ships. Our ISR integration business continues to be robust, and we received new business awards for our major programs, including EMARSS as well as a classified programs. In addition, we were selected to provide U.S. Special Operations Command with binocular night vision equipment. We also received additional funding for a wide range of legacy programs featuring our Missile Defense Work uses Predator Mission Aircrew Training systems, C-130 displays, photonic mast work and Gray Eagle UAS work, which includes our innovative new composite maintenance systems trainer. Also in the training arena, we received a contract to upgrade over F-18 Tactical Operation Flight Trainers for the U.S. Navy. This award improves the fidelity of the training equipment and provides a new immersive experience for pilots. Finally, we received follow-on funding for programs such as army fleet support as well as a variety of modification and sustainment projects, including a Rivet Joint among others. 
For commercial aviation, this is a sector with strong growth potential and, as evidenced by our recent awards, we are capitalizing on opportunities and increasing our market share. Our commercial flight simulator and training business continues to be strong. We received orders from Turkish Airlines, Air China, Spring Airlines and Delta Airlines for a variety of simulators. The Delta order is particularly notable because it expands our market. In addition, our security and detection systems business remained solid and, in the fourth quarter, we received orders for a variety of products, including ProVision, checkpoint screening systems in the U.S. Capitol building. We also received orders for our new ClearScan aircraft baggage screening system from Singapore as well as a maintenance contract with the TSA for our examiner systems. In the international area, despite the ongoing lumpiness in that market, we remain focused on building our business and are pleased to report several developments. We've been increasing our resources by adding personnel and in-country offices to support business development activities. These efforts are paying off. We've been selected to supply night vision equipment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we received sales for our traveling wave tube equipment from several customers in Asia and China as well. WESCAM is also doing well supplementing its solid defense business with several international awards. 
In terms of our outlook for 2016, as you know, 2015 was a transformative year for us. As we look ahead to '16, we expect to maintain a positive momentum as we drive margin improvement and continue to reposition the portfolio. Our focus remains concentrated on growing our business and capturing additional market share, and we continue to move towards higher-margin areas, pioneer innovative technologies through targeted R&D investments and strengthen our core business through strategic M&A. Our approach to M&A remains the same. We regularly monitor and evaluate companies that might meaningfully contribute to the strength of our business, pursuing accretive acquisitions with strong margins and high-growth rates. Smaller acquisitions will be fully integrated into our existing operations wherever possible. Our strategies for growth combined with our strong balance sheet and thoughtful approach to capital allocation position us well for success in the coming year. 
With that, let me now turn it over to, Ralph, for a more in-depth look at the financials, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Ralph?"
93538,322762948,923409,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Okay, thank you, Mike.

I'll discuss some details about the fourth quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. First, I want to remind everyone that we reclassified NSS to discontinued operations for all periods. As Mike said, we expect to complete that sale over the next week, so my comments will only concern L-3's continuing operations which do not include NSS. 
We had solid performance for the fourth quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share, sales and free cash flow coming in better than our outlook. It was driven primarily by higher sales and lower taxes due to the reenactment of the R&E tax credit. Adjusted diluted EPS excludes losses on business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges, including the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge for Logistics Solutions. Fourth quarter sales were just under $2.9 billion and grew organically by 1%. Sales were about $90 million above the midpoint guidance that we provided, driven by higher U.S. Department of Defense sales mostly in Communication Systems. We believe our fourth quarter sales demonstrate that the sales growth rate for our U.S. Government and DoD business is improving, and we expect it will continue to improve this year in 2016. 
Consolidated operating margin was 50 basis points below what we anticipated for the fourth quarter and 10 basis points below what we expected for the full year 2015 with lower margins in Electronic Systems and Aerospace Systems. The Electronic Systems margin was 11.3% for the fourth quarter and 11.5% for the full year, and it was impacted by a $20 million refund liability provision for EOTech holographic weapon sights. Aerospace Systems margins was about 15 basis points lower than what we expected, and that was primarily due to higher material and labor cost on fixed price per flight [indiscernible] and Logistics Solutions. Communication Systems margin was better than we expected, driving its full year margin 25 basis points higher than our guidance. Fourth quarter free cash flow of $406 million was also very solid, bringing the full year to $829 million, which was $19 million better than we expected and essentially due to the unexpected reenactment of the R&E tax credit. As we recently have explained, we invest significant amount each year in R&D to sustain and grow our business and that R&D also creates a valuable cash taxes reduction for the company. 
Moving on to 2016. Compared to our initial guidance that we provided at the investor conference on December 8 last month, our 2016 guidance includes increases for EPS, free cash flow and operating margins primarily due to 2 items. First, the R&E tax credit, which was permanently reenacted by Congress last month; and secondly, pension expense will be $32 million lower than our initial estimate. These changes each increased 2016 EPS by about $0.25, lifting the EPS guidance range at the midpoint by $0.50 to $7.50, which is an increase of 9% compared to 2015 adjusted diluted earnings per share. The law also raises consolidated operating margin guidance by about 30 basis points with corresponding increases in each of the segment margins. We made no other changes to 2016 sales and margin guidance. Our consolidated sales guidance remains at $10,050,000,000 at the midpoint for 2016. With 2015 sales coming in a little higher than what we expected, our 2016 guidance now assumes an organic sales decline of approximately 2.5%. We expect our U.S. Government, including the DoD business, to be down 2% organically versus '15; commercial to grow about 8%; and international sales to decline about 14% versus '15. With respect to the U.S. Government and DoD business, the final runoff of the Afghanistan drawdown sales in 2016 is expected to reduce sales by about $135 million. And without it, our sales in the U.S. Government and DoD markets would be about flat in 2016. We hope to have some upside with our U.S. Government sales in 2016. We increased the consolidated operating margin guidance to 9.8%, which is 130 basis points of an increase over 2015 with margins increasing in all 3 segments. Our diluted shares outstanding estimate stays at 77.5 million for 2016, which is 5% lower than last year and it continues to include share repurchases of $750 million for the year. We increased our free cash flow estimate by $15 million to $825 million and that is comprised of 3 changes. First, the R&E credit will add about $20 million; slightly better working capital performance adds $15 million; and then we're increasing our investment in capital expenditures by $15 million and that nets to the increase. The cash flow guidance for 2016 continues to assume about $100 million of pension contributions. 
With respect to our capital allocation, in addition to the planned share repurchases of $750 million for 2016, cash dividends will be slightly above $200 million, and we intend to repay $300 million of debt. We also acquired a small microwave components business that, Mike talked about. That closed last week and that was for $27 million, and we're integrating that into our Narda MITEQ division in the Communication Systems segment. After these capital deployment actions, we estimate that we'll end 2016 with a cash balance of about $325 million. Our capital allocation and financing strategy continues to include our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade ratings, I want to underscore that we don't view the ratings, the investment-grade ratings as transitory. And for the last point, our 2016 guidance, we expect our book-to-bill ratio to be about 1.0. Looking at the first quarter of 2016, we expect sales to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion with an organic sales decline of about 2%. Margin will be about 9% for the first quarter with EPS between $1.50 and $1.60. Free cash flow coming in somewhere between 0 and $50 million, and book-to-bill ratio between 1 point -- between 0.9 and 1.0. 
So to conclude my financial review, L-3 is in a process of positive transition. We're focused on program performance, expanding margin and returning our top line to an organic growth position. We're also strengthening our business portfolio to structurally improve our competitive positions, sales growth rate and margin expansion profile. We continue to generate solid free cash flow and are allocating it to increase shareholder value. We recognize that we have more work to do. We know what is to be done, and we look forward to updating you on the company's progress throughout the year. Thank you, and we'll begin the Q&A now."

So we are not satisfied with the performance in Aerospace from both a margin and order standpoint and sales, of course, sales growth. That said, there are strengths in the business, and we do see opportunities to improve results. We've identified a number of new program opportunities and, in fact, customers have indicated that they would like to see L-3 as a bidder. In fact, we continue to get certain amounts of work of all sorts just because of the capability at that business units are unmatched in the country, unmatched. However, they've been through a difficult cycle. So as we anticipate in improving budgetary environment ahead, we believe that there will be opportunities that can lead to better top line growth as well. So in terms of allocating resources, it's something that I've deployed, Chris, on to monitor closely as well as Dave Van Buren. These are programs that both are very familiar with including all of us. We've made several visits to the business unit during the last quarter, and we have all eyes focused on getting it improved, getting that now. Unfortunately, there are a number of sizeable international contracts that had completed last year. Some of them a little bit earlier than that had been anticipated such as the Airseeker program, and were not backfilled, if you will, with new work because of a slowdown internationally. So those were significant programs, so that's causing a bit of a dip in the numbers. And there are opportunities, again, internationally to bring more work in in-house there as well as on the U.S. Government side. So I think a few more quarters of work on it and we'll start to see some results in getting new work in-house. But I believe that's the first step in getting that to turn around."

And Asia continues to be a growth area for us. Of course, you have the oil price issue in the Middle East that is, I think, putting a bit of a crimp in spending. Since many of these countries have survived without some of these platforms in the past whether they're sophisticated ISR signals, intelligence platforms that require not only the aircraft but ground stations and operators and processing and the like, and they're very big-ticket items. So while we are seeing that slowdown, we're seeing an uptick, if you will, in Asia. Some of the things we've been focusing on is partnering internationally with platform manufacturers, if you will, or other in-country industrial partners to help in that regard. And it's been working out pretty well. We have a few aircraft under contract in Japan, for example, that we talked about last year, more in Korea. And there is more that I don't want to talk about for competitive reasons, but we are actively in pursuit of several major platform type programs where L-3 will be the prime systems integrator of typically sophisticated ISR systems on commercial type platforms, which is really where this business has been going over the last several years."

And there are a couple ways to deal with it, whether it's working harder to improve the business or an outright divestiture as you saw in the fourth quarter. But some portfolio shaping does remain a core element of our strategy, and we will continue to focus on our core defense electronics communications and ISR markets as we've been saying. However, as we continue to evaluate the portfolio, we're taking the market conditions into consideration. The NSS transaction demonstrates our commitment to acting when we see the right valuations available, and we will continue to be opportunistic, and will consider value-enhancing opportunities. But right now, as you know, the debt market or I guess you would call it high-yield or private equity guys is not really there as it's been. So, of course, there is a bit of a crimp in valuation, and we're not really looking to give things away. We're dealing one particular business with well over $1 billion in sales where the offers are very disappointing in terms of numbers that have been bantered around. I know there was a piece that was out last weekend. We're not interested in pursuing that kind of a transaction if it's not value accretive to shareholders. We'll stay focused."

So we have been making progress on areas such as aviation training and simulation, advanced avionics equipment, night vision equipment, sensor systems, tactical SATCOM, airborne ISR which are the more bigger-ticket items, where the slippage is apparent as programs again completed like Airseeker and others and have not been backfilled, if you will. So that goes also with multimission-type aircraft. We have been working on systems where one platform can fulfill multiple missions addressing a tighter budget carrier environment where some of these customers do not want to buy a separate aircraft for every single mission, whether it's airborne ISR, nighttime patrol, search and rescue, et cetera. They are looking more from our experience -- from my experience with aircrafts that are rapidly reconfigurable to meet the mission, so they only have to buy it once and buy multiple sensor packages that can plug in. Military simulation systems are active. Security & Detection Systems as airports are upgraded and built out and anti-submarine warfare. So those are all areas we are seeing some growth. And it's -- I would say it’s not that there were no sales but the sales cycle is certainly a longer proposition right now."

The overseas contingency fund, OCO account, may grow as well. As you know, a lot of the growth will be driven by international events as they unfold. And as you know, there is a lot going on all over the place. So I'd say more likely upside than downside there. And we've also been listening very carefully to some of the commentary by those in the building, particularly Secretary Kendall and the acquisition chiefs in terms of the types of capabilities or investments they are looking for. But they have been specifically asking the industry is to be a little more forward leaning on R&D. And as you've seen, we have been trying to respond in that way because there are things that we do that fit some of the requirements they have and it would certainly be good to start to grow a little more organically in that space.

And then you have our avionics businesses, which have historically done very well. The problem in that space is that anything that were to come online for sale is typically very expensive and hard to make a good business case for. We've looked at several companies over the years and where we see something that fits well with what we do, particularly something that could be consolidated and a lot of overhead saved that usually requisites to be able to make those numbers work. Because there are typically higher growth, higher margin than other things that we would see in the defense space and they command higher prices, as you know you have to pay a lot for growth in this marketplace these days. So yes, we love to grow the business and we love to grow it through acquisitions. But right now, we've seen the better deal for us being investing in our own products and developing things rather than acquiring them right now, and we will also pursue that as a strategy. So we are on with the NexGen system we have equipage there and we continually work on developing more avionics for the general aviation marketplace where we continue to do very well. And for the large transport, that seems to be more regulation-driven, whether it's requirement for new recorder or revision to the key tag system, but we keep a robust R&D program that will help us with the growth and should a good deal present itself, we'll certainly be all over it."

I'd use the term prospecting with some of the big heavyweight ISR platforms to more affordable bizjets. I mean, this one you saw is very representative of the trend in many countries and how they're looking at their ISR mission requirements. And we sit well in that space in terms of being able to do that mechanization work, which includes racks and racks of electronics and the precise placement of parent systems to increasing range for being on station, which could mean auxiliary fuel tanks and systems and putting in a refueling capability and the like. All those things are in our wheelhouse, if you will, and we have excellent performance to show for it over the years in delivering these systems. So when customers think about that cross-decking model, they call L-3 first, as I'd like to say. I mean, we do a good job. Part of it has to do with the fact that we make a lot of these subsystems, whether it's data links or the sensors, cameras, et cetera, and we're able to pull-through our own products in these models, which also helps the whole business, if you will. If you get on one of these, it's not only the integration work but it's pulling through data links and cameras and the like. That is how we intended this model to work to be able to pull-through L-3's systems and subsystems, if you will, on these platforms.

I wanted to make a comment also to follow-up, Howard, on Ralph's comment on the investment-grade. If you look at it the way, I tend to think of it as we'll always want to operate with a credit facility. I think it's prudent that companies have credit facilities should an M&A come up or any other matter where cash is needed in the short term. So you run the assumption that, well, yes, we'll always have that. Then you get to the question of, well, what's that difference if you're investment-grade or not? And as you may know that if you're investment-grade, you don't have the restrictions on the payment of dividends and share repurchases and M&A. You have that ""restricted payments basket"" issue. So it's really a question of, we're looking at investment-grade versus not. You can look at it as do we want a credit facility or not because we would not be able to operate with the cash deployment objectives that we embrace with a non-investment-grade credit facility. It just wouldn't work for us and everybody would be unhappy including me. And so I think it's not a far stretch to keep that investment-grade rating now, and it's typically the leverage ratio that is the operative one that gets more restrictive because the way the numbers work. And I believe it’s -- in terms of rating agencies, Moody's is the more restrictive of the 3, if you will. So that's the one we're watching. Ralph made a comment also as we get back to growth in EBITDA and margins, that should have a natural deleveraging effect, which should give us some more headroom, and we won't be having this discussion, but I just wanted to give you my perspective on what -- why that's important."

So some of the things that we've been doing or things we could bring from corporate are: 1, do we have or could we bring in more business development folks to the international side; #2, we are developing more international partnerships, either with aircraft OEMs or with other equipment suppliers or with other industrial players. So we have a seat at the table in these countries that are going to go forward with these systems. We are the world leader in ISR-manned platforms. And I believe that that will continue to be a market that will grow. So it's also not one of the more margin constrained marketplaces because, again, these are one-of-a-kind platforms and we are not usually bidding to a low price. We're usually being to a technical capability. And we're not interested in low-price technically acceptable in this space. We're interested in developing and delivering state-of-the-art platforms at good margins. So -- I again pointed to the fact that some significant international work had been completed and new work had not been brought in to fill that hole, if you will. And also they're on the U.S. side new platforms that will be coming out that have displaced some of the life-cycle sustainment that had historically been done across that business. So there were a couple of holes that need to get filled and this is an area where I want everybody focused on getting this business area back on track, where from a margin standpoint, from a growth standpoint. The execution continues to be excellent. 
So in wrapping up, the current geopolitical environment is volatile but presents new opportunities both in-country domestically and internationally, and we are well-positioned to capitalize as we move through 2016. We continue to execute our strategy of strengthening our portfolio, investing in businesses that we know well and leveraging our strong cash flow generation to invest in the company and at the same time return cash to shareholders. Our investment in R&D and our market-leading positions make us ready to accommodate the short-term needs of the U.S. Government and to adapt and ship according to its longer-term third offset strategy. We're seeing benefits from our refined strategy, margins are improving in 2016 as is our top line. And we consider, and we will be moving forward with these efforts well into '17, and we're planning on keeping the margin expansion front and center for several years to come until we are satisfied we're doing the best we could possibly do across the company. We're committed to strategic growth and performance and as always we will work to enhance value for our shareholders.

I'm pleased to report very solid first quarter results, demonstrating our continued progress and increasing margins and driving organic revenue growth as well as aligning our portfolio to our core businesses.",1024,"Okay, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report very solid first quarter results, demonstrating our continued progress and increasing margins and driving organic revenue growth as well as aligning our portfolio to our core businesses. 
I'll start out with an overview of our results and and then will provide some color on the current environment, our strategic focus areas and where we see opportunities for growth moving forward then Chris will discuss our operational performance and Ralph will provide financial details before we take your questions. 
For the first quarter, we reported net sales of $2.4 billion, a decrease of 5% over the same period last year. Excluding the impacts of divestitures and acquisitions, sales decreased by 2% organically. Our EPS was $2.08, which is a 50% increase over the first quarter of 2015. We recorded net cash from operations of $112 million, funded orders with $2.6 billion and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.1. 
Our segment margin performance was very strong in the quarter, increasing 230 basis points to 10.7%. This includes better-than-expected contract performance at Aerospace Systems where margins increased to 10.5%. 
As we look at the overall environment, we've seen improvement in the U.S. defense budget in 2016, and we're expecting that the budget will continue to grow over the next several years. Our customer continues to focus on affordable solutions and L-3 is well positioned to compete effectively. We've mopped our strategy to address the DoD spending priorities, which we feel are oriented towards weapon system sustainment, space, the classified area, protected communications as well as next-generation products. 
The DoD remains L-3's largest customer, and we work hard to anticipate and adapt to its needs so that our capabilities and solutions align with their current budget. 
A major win for us in the quarter was the maintenance and sustainment work for the F-18 A, B, C and D aircraft. Building on our U.K. and Canadian F-18 experience, this U.S. Navy competitive win is strategic for us and it represents the first time will are from sustainment work on this platform on our Waco, Texas facility and we expect additional follow on work in the years ahead. 
Similarly in commercial aviation, we are pursuing opportunities to increase market share and are encouraged with what we believe are very favorable long-term fundamentals. There's a particular demand for cockpit solutions -- I'm sorry, for checkpoint solutions as the airports around the globe upgrade their security infrastructure. In fact, Singapore's airport is currently conducting a test of our advanced ProVision and ClearScan check point solutions. We also will be providing a variety of printed screening systems as part of the Bahrain International Airport modernization program. Also airlines are continuing to modernize and upgrade their fleets with the latest technology. 
We're well equipped to meet those needs with our market-leading aviation products and next-generation solutions. As you know, pilot training is another focus area for L-3. There remains a shortage of trained pilots. In fact, it's estimated that more than 0.5 million pilots will be needed in the decade ahead. L-3 has the world's most advanced military and commercial total training solutions business. 
The combination of our recently acquired CTC Aviation business with our Link U.K. operation now offer certification training for a wide range of pilots using reconfigurable simulator that can address virtually any commercial air transport platform. In the international area, there are longer lead times for new business awards and opportunities that are driven by customer needs that are ever-changing. However, we continue to push our strong track record and reputation for quality and affordability. 
We're expanding our international marketing and sales infrastructure by opening new locations and hiring additional in-country resources in order to increase our visibility in important markets. 
Our Far East operations has been helping to market L-3 products in that region and last quarter, we received an order for our F-16 mission training system from Taiwan. We've had some other successes, which Chris will discuss in a moment. 
We continue to is international as an attractive, high-margin market and a long-time growth driver for us. Our results for the first quarter and our outlook for 2016 reflect the actions we've taken to transform L-3 into a more focused and flexible company with a goal of gaining market share in core areas and driving profitable growth. 
Our efforts to improve our market position and focus on strengthening our portfolio and targeted R&D investments. In the first quarter, we saw improvements in our margins, proof that we are on the right track in achieving our goals. We continue to have a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation and to that end, in Q1, we completed the sale of NSS, National Security Solutions, which was essential to our portfolio shaping efforts. We believe our business is strongly positioned and do not anticipate actions along the scale of NSS in the near term. That along with the MSI divestiture in 2015 has outlined L-3 with a changing macro environment. We do have a few minor divestitures in process but going forward, our portfolio-shaping efforts will be focused on acquisitions. 
In January, we acquired Advanced Technical Materials Inc. or ATM, a small niche business serving the microwave marketplace. ATM will be integrated into our Narda-MITEQ business units. We will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that will be accretive to earnings, complement our core businesses and expand our capabilities. 
As always, we're strongly dedicated to generating shareholder value, and we continue to return a significant portion of our cash in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while also investing in the business. Ultimately, we believe that our efficient capital structure provides us with ample flexibility to deliver value, while allowing us to remain opportunistic to drive growth. 
We're starting 2016 from a position of strength. I'm very pleased with our performance last quarter and I thank our employees for their continued focus on serving our valued customers. I am confident our business strategy positions us for even more success throughout the year, as evidenced by our increased full year EPS guidance today. 
Now Chris will provide some operational details. Chris?"

I will begin with a discussion of our portfolio then focus on operational initiatives and finally, summarize some additional new business wins from the quarter. 
As Mike mentioned, after completing the NSS divestiture, we believe that our portfolio is now largely aligned with the needs of our customers and future market demands. Accordingly, we're focusing our future portfolio shaping on acquisitions. Currently, we are evaluating several businesses targeting high-margin, high-growth companies that will further strengthen our portfolio to address new market opportunities in both defense and commercial. 
Along M&A, we're increasing our investment in R&D as we seek to distinguish ourselves not only of leaders of quality and availability but also as innovators. We develop cutting-edge technologies and next-generation products. For example, I've been spending time with our patriot works organization, which is developing next-generation products and subsystems that address the DoD's third offset strategy and other U.S. government classified opportunities. I've also been visiting our facilities to review our operations and to meet with business leaders and employees. I continue to be impressed with the talent we have in our divisions and the breadth of our forward solutions as a global security company. Working closely with our divisions, and our proposal, quality and procurement team, we're developing initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies to drive organic growth and a stronger margins. 
Also, we are identifying opportunities for collaboration to pursue new business. This will ensure that we stay focused on performance as well as secure new business and win recompetes. Our efforts have already begun to yield tangible results. 
In the first quarter, we saw outstanding performance on many of our existing contracts, particularly in Aerospace Systems which help drive our solid results. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making and we will continue to execute on our plan. 
Now let's discuss some of the key contract wins for the quarter in defense, commercial aviation and international. Starting with defense, we won several major new contracts. We will supply 2 key subsystems to the U.S. Navy's EO/IR surveillance and response system known as [indiscernible], which will provide unprecedented coverage for situational awareness and threat protection. Purchasers in enhanced countermeasure system to protect surface warships against the wide range of threats, including optically guided anti-chip missiles, fast attack craft and UAVs. 
In addition, we will provide our advanced DC-powered system switchgear for the Ohio class submarine replacement. This award is significant because we have been improving functionality while reducing cost and the system, and we are pleased to have won this competition for this new growth platform. 
We also received an award to continue our long-standing service life expansion work for the Elkhart program. Aerospace Systems received continued funding for our role as the prime on the EMARSS Army ISR program. Notably, we recently achieved a key program milestone with the inaugural flight of the EMARSS prototype aircraft. We received a variety of follow-on contracts and funding for logistics, lifecycle maintenance and other projects on programs, including the Army fleet support, the C-12, the Rivet Joint and the T-45 training aircraft. 
Closing out our defense wins, and we also received additional funding for many of our legacy communication programs in support [ph], the P-8 and that B-52 aircraft. 
Turning to commercial aviation. Global advance continued to generate increased interest in our Aviation Products & Security Systems. We received a new TSA order for our examiner check baggage screening equipment. 
In aviation products, we received orders for approximately 400 flight recorders and systems from a variety of airlines. And in aircraft systems, we want to contract to modify a Boeing 747, which when complete, will serve as an airborne launchpad for the Virgin Galactic satellite launch service. 
And finally, in international, we have several contract wins. As Mike mentioned, we've been expanding our in-country presence and leveraging our existing corporate offices to increase sales throughout the major regions. We've received funding for communications and ISR integration work on South Korea's Global Hawk program. 
Also this year, we'll be starting IRS work or other IRS work from other foreign governments. For decades, L-3 has been the prime contractor of the Rivet Joint ISR aircraft. We recently expanded our support work on this program to include training. 
And in Q1, we booked our first Rivet Joint simulator from the U.K. Royal Air Force. This new system will feature our innovative Reality 7 full flight simulator. Finally, we've received international orders for our sensory systems and night vision equipment from a number of countries, including Canada and Algeria. We made our largest direct sale of fusion night vision goggles to Turkey and we also supplying MX15 EO/IR turrets to the Saudi Arabian National Guard. 
Overall, our business mix remains at about 70% U.S. defense and 30% international and commercial. But we will continue to forge an in-customer relationships in emerging markets that will increase our international and commercial business in the long-term. 
I will now turn it over to Ralph, who will give you some more insight to the last quarter's results."
93538,330877785,964563,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss in details about the first results and then review an update to our 2016 guidance.

I'll discuss in details about the first results and then review an update to our 2016 guidance. We have very solid financial performance for the first quarter with diluted earnings per share, operating margin, free cash flow and orders all above our first quarter outlook. Earnings per share was $2.08, more than $0.45 higher than our outlook for the first quarter and driven primarily by higher operating margin and secondarily, lower taxes. 
Sales over $2,353,000,000  [ph] and in line with expectations. Organically, sales declined 2% but encouragingly, our U.S. Government business, which is mostly the Department of Defense, grew 4% organically. This demonstrates that the sales growth rate for our U.S. Government business is improving, which is significant as the U.S. Government market comprises about 72% of our business mix. 
Consolidated operating margin was 10.7% for the first quarter and about 150 basis points higher than we anticipated with segment margin increasing 230 basis points compared to the 2015 first quarter. 
The higher-margin generated operating income above our plan for the first quarter by about $35 million, which added $0.32 to EPS in the first quarter and that was mostly in Aerospace Systems. 
Aerospace Systems margin was 10.5% and significantly higher than we expected for the 2016 first quarter. I want to elaborate on this point. Heading into 2016, we anticipated the favorable year-over-year comparisons on the Army C-12 contract and the head-of-state jobs. What was unexpected was the profit resiliency at ISR Systems and that was the main driver of the better margin for Aerospace Systems in the first quarter. 
ISR Systems improved as contract performance across several programs, including lower direct labor and higher productivity. some of these improvements represented upside opportunities that we were targeting for this year and converted early. 
Additionally, ISR Systems had a good outcome on negotiated price contract adjustment. Also, improved contract performance at aircraft systems contributed about $5 million of the higher operating income for the first quarter. 
Communication Systems margin was 10.8% and that included a planned $3 million gain on the sale of a parcel of land, which added 60 basis points to the first quarter margin in that segment. Electronic Systems operating margin was 10.8% for the first quarter, it was lower than we expected due to a $15 million charge to increase the product returns allowance for the EoTech's holographic weapon sights. Otherwise Electronic Systems margin was in line with our full year estimates. 
First quarter income taxes were lower than expected due to the early adoption of our recently announced new accounting rule, which we classified $10 million of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation from shareholders' equity to the income statement. This tax benefit added $0.13 to EPS for the first quarter. 
Free cash flow was $84 million and it represented a good start for 2016 as the first quarter is always seasonally lowest cash flow quarter each year. Moving on to the 2016 guidance update. We increased EPS at the midpoint by $0.15 to $7.65 due to 2 items: 1, the annual tax accounting rule, which I just mentioned, adds $0.13 to EPS and it was all recognized in the first quarter; and 2, a net increase in segment margin adds about $0.02 so our 2016 EPS guidance midpoint is an 11% increase compared to last year. 
Consolidated sales guidance remains at $10,050,000,000 at the midpoint. We also maintained consolidated operating margin guidance at 9.8% with margins expected to increase for the full year over 2015 in all 3 segments. We made 2 changes to segment margin guidance. First, we raised Aerospace Systems midpoint margin by 50 basis points to 7.1% and that was for the better contract performance in the first quarter in ISR Systems. This added $20 million to our full year estimate income at the segment level. Secondly, with the Lord Electronic Systems midpoint margin by 40 basis points to 12.1% and that was for the $15 million charge to increase the product returns allowance in the first quarter. 
With respect to operating margins, we continue to work on improving program execution, increasing productivity and contract profit rates, while maintaining tight control over overhead cost. I'm working very closely with Chris, and we're making progress with all this margin expansion levers. 
Our free cash flow estimate stays at $825 million for the full year. With respect to our 2016 capital allocation, it continues to include planned share repurchases of $750 million, of which we repurchased about $200 million during the first quarter. It also includes estimated cash dividends of $217 million, which reflects the $0.05 increase in our quarterly dividend per share that we approved in February and a $300 million debt repayment, which we announced on March 24. 
After these cash deployment actions, we estimate that we'll end this year with a cash balance of about $275 million and that assumes no additional acquisitions. Our capital allocation and financing strategy continues to include our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, which is why we are repaying $300 million of debt this year. 
I want to underscore that if we achieve the operating income growth we're projecting for 2016 and next year, we will not be required to make additional debt repayments. 
And the last point for the full year 2016 guidance is that we still expect the book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 and possibly higher. 
With respect to the second quarter outlook, we expect sales in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, with operating margin of about 9% and diluted earnings per share of between $1.60 and $1.70. Free cash flow should be in the $100 million and $150 million range with the book-to-bill ratio of about 0.9. 
So to conclude my financial review, the company is clearly making progress and has positive momentum. We look forward to building upon our strong first quarter performance the rest of this year. Thank you. And we'll now begin the Q&A."

You recall that our guidance -- that our sales guidance this year assumes or contemplated about a 14% decline in our international sales and that's organically. And what we've talked about there was that we have 3 large ISR Systems jobs in Aerospace Systems that are nearing completion this year. And they're declining about $115 [ph] million or so year-over-year. And then in the Communication Systems segment, we booked a large SATCOM terminal job last year for Australia, which we shipped most of it, it was about $80 million. So we had a negative this year, and we do expect follow-on orders for more terminals from Australia and will probably book those sometime in the fourth quarter of this year or early in 2017. So that's a solid customer. And even with respect to the declines on those 3 front ISR jobs and ISR Systems, they each represent very good long-term customers of L-3 and they procure and modify their ISR aircraft of different cycles and there's peaks and valleys in those cycles. And we're entering a valley with those 3 jobs this year and some more next year. But those customers are certainly going to procure more aircraft in the future, and we have insight to their procurement plans because we're very close to them. So by the time they get to the latter part of this decade, we expect to have new programs each driving growth in our international end market from those customers."

These platforms will not be of any value to our customers without secured communication and world-class sensors. And, I think, when I look at what we're most proud of, I think, on the communications front, the secured communications of data links and such is your known for. A lot of the IR capabilities in the aerospace, the whole focus on ISR, I think, is a hot growth market.

Additionally, Chris mentioned that we're starting some new foreign Government ISR work in his comments.

So we're confident that we're going to have a product that we understand and properly disclose its specs. We think that we've made our best estimate of what needed to be reserved. We recorded that. Again, it's a voluntary program, which we all decided that it's something we wanted to do for our customers. We have a very loyal customer base, great brand even in spite of this issue. And we're actually developing some new products that will be coming out later this year that are getting some very positive early reviews. So we made our best estimate and next quarter, we'll give you an update on that. But again, I'll emphasize it's a voluntary program that we've decided to do and we've already started to see a drop-off in the return rate. So we'll see how that plays out, and we kind of look at this every month, Mike, Ralph and I decide what we want to do and decide to keep it going at least for the foreseeable future. On your second question, you're right, the margins upside, I think, on the logistics vertex business has a lot of potential and even in the quarter, we started to see some progress. I think once we made it clear that we're going to keep this business we had about half of the executive team change over and a new GM and a new CFO. And just last week, we were down in Mississippi, and we were impressed with the progress they've made. There's a long way to go but the team is clearly motivated and, as Ralph said, we're hoping to get some news and a couple of weeks on some big potential wins that would really help go boost us. In ES, we've felt other than the EoTech reserve, we were on track for the year, and we are confident that, that is one of our solid performing groups long-term. We talked about having 13% up to maybe 14% margin. And we don't see any change to that in the years ahead."

And the $15 [ph] million increase to the allowance was also a reduction of sales. That was part of the impact. In the Aviation Products & Security sector, there is a mix change going on there, where it last year, we had some significant sales of our very high margin airborne collision warning systems that were tied to a mandate that's essentially expired. So we're having less of those sales this year and they're mostly software oriented but again, we expected that so nothing unusual there.

We're looking at areas that we specialize in, whether it's autonomy our robotics or secured communications, and we are putting the money where the growth and the need is and took a few more bucks. And we've been, I think, somewhat unique in creative. We've seen with a couple of interesting innovative West Coast organization probably what you're allowed to say, and we're working collaboratively with them in a very unique and just a very unique collaborative manner. So we're seeing some pretty good stuff there in a rapid development environment."

One, there is a lifecycle replacement that we would expect on the original EDS machines or the automated bounded action margins that were the first to go in, in checked baggage line. Those are probably very close to end-of-life we're requiring major overhaul. We expect to see some form of upgrade program in the not-too-distant future. Last summer, we introduced the new product for the checkpoint that was known as ClearScan and is designed to hopefully make it a little bit easy. You get through the checkpoint by not requiring liquids, for example, to be removed from vaccines since the machine can't interrogate what liquids are in the bag without removing it. There are new technologies that could be added as well to provide further screening capabilities, such as the trace detection capability, which right now isn't done 100%. But you can imagine that technology could probably get built into the tunnels that are already processing bags rather than in the individual one-off examinations that are being conducted. Then, of course, you had some of the events -- the of events that happened in the European about involving airports that suggest that the checkpoint made at the start of the curve, if you will, or is there some other and for the security additional security outside the terminal perhaps. Certainly a lot of questions being asked, and we're certainly taking on a lot of places he can be a part of some discretions. It's an active area both from an R&D standpoint, from a potential M&A standpoint because there are technologies that are available in the marketplace for us to evaluate but as always, we'll be mindful on price. We do require the acquisitions to have real economic returns for us. So we are very focused on what we're willing to pay and we always have the ability to develop themes in our own too. Unfortunately, a lot of things in this market have been more event-driven them long-term strategy, and we have been working with our customers to try to shift that model to more of a long-term strategy and be proactive rather than being react reactive all the time. So it's something we're very engaged in with lately and I would expect some more activity in that area during the year. I mean, we'll be back to you on it."

We just went through a question about pricing, I think, from Richard Safran. Really a lot of that has to do with the margin improvement story that we haven't been working on and you're analysis was stunned many of the contracts in the Logistics space as to what the margins were coming in below or coming on different, which was originally bid and some of the analysis showed that there probably opportunities for further dialogue with customers where the customer side of the equation was not meeting what did assumptions were in terms of flights hours or other metrics they didn't develop. So there was room for further adjustment there and I think it has made our people a little smarter about how the bid jobs like some of these logistics jobs where you could have derivations from some of the original assumptions that could have negative impact on the margins going out. So it certainly has gotten people to focus on everything they do, whether it's how they manage their supply chain, how they manage their labor hours or how they manage the delivery side with the customer in terms of keeping their eye on the ball as it relates to margins. We like to know if we are not achieving what was bead, why with a rational explanation I think that we are getting a good response from the team on it.

Additionally, with more clarity in the defense budget and positive sense for growth in military spending, very well positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities. I'd add that more now than I could remember in the past, there has been a very productive dialogue with the folks at The Pentagon, particularly the organization, under Secretary Kendall, industry in terms of what their needs are and things that they would like us as an industry to focus because their desire of course is to get things for the warfighter quicker, cheaper and things that work out of the box. You heard Secretary Carter mentioned the 5 areas of concern, Russia, China and North Korea, Iran, the war on there. They're very focused on solving all those problems, they're all very challenging issues and they have many initiatives that they're working on. You've heard the term strategy. So there's a lot going on in that area. And that dialogue is very important to keep industry focused on making the right investments in the right places. So together, we and the warfighters are developing the systems that they need to deal on the current threat environment. So our focus has never been sharper than it is right now on R&D and how we spend it anywhere leveraging our expertise in working with our key partners to invest in and develop those technologies that strengthen our competitive profile and meet customer needs. Our agility and strong customer relationships are also differentiators that enable us to adapt quickly to evolving customer needs. Bottom line, we're very encouraged by the company's performance and the overall industry environment that we remain committed to delivering long-term value to our stakeholders.

I'm pleased to report very solid first quarter results, demonstrating our continued progress and increasing margins and driving organic revenue growth as well as aligning our portfolio to our core businesse",1013,"Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I'm pleased to report very solid first quarter results, demonstrating our continued progress and increasing margins and driving organic revenue growth as well as aligning our portfolio to our core businesses. 
I'll start out with an overview of our results and then will provide some color on the current environment, our strategic focus areas and where we see opportunities for growth moving forward. Then Chris will discuss our operational performance, and Ralph will provide financial details before we take your questions. 
For the first quarter, we reported net sales of $2.4 billion, a decrease of 5% over the same period last year. Excluding the impacts of divestitures and acquisitions, sales decreased by 2% organically. Our EPS was $2.08, which is a 50% increase over the first quarter of 2015. We recorded net cash from operations of $112 million, funded orders with $2.6 billion, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.1. 
Our segment margin performance was very strong in the quarter, increasing 230 basis points to 10.7%. This includes better-than-expected contract performance at Aerospace Systems, where margins increased to 10.5%. 
As we look at the overall environment, we've seen improvement in the U.S. defense budget in 2016, and we're expecting that the budget will continue to grow over the next several years. 
Our customer continues to focus on affordable solutions, and L-3 is well positioned to compete effectively. We've mapped our strategy to address the DoD spending priorities, which we feel are oriented towards weapon system sustainment, space, the classified area, protected communications as well as next-generation products. 
The DoD remains L-3's largest customer, and we work hard to anticipate and adapt to its needs so that our capabilities and solutions align with their current budget. 
A major win for us in the quarter was the maintenance and sustainment work for the F/A-18 A/B/C/D aircraft. Building on our U.K. and Canadian F/A-18 experience, this U.S. Navy competitive win is strategic for us because it represents the first time we'll perform sustainment work on this platform at our Waco, Texas facility, and we expect additional follow-on work in the years ahead. 
Similarly in commercial aviation, we're pursuing opportunities to increase market share and are encouraged by what we believe are very favorable long-term fundamentals. 
There's a particular demand for cockpit solutions -- I'm sorry, for checkpoint solutions as airports around the globe upgrade their security infrastructure. In fact, Singapore's airport is currently conducting a test of our advanced ProVision and ClearScan checkpoint solutions. We also will be providing a variety of screening systems as part of the Bahrain International Airport modernization program. Also, airlines are continuing to modernize and upgrade their fleets with the latest technology. 
We're well equipped to meet those needs with our market-leading aviation products and next-generation solutions. As you know, pilot training is another focus area for L-3. There remains a shortage of trained pilots. In fact, it's estimated that more than 0.5 million pilots will be needed in the decade ahead. L-3 has the world's most advanced military and commercial total training solutions business. 
The combination of our recently acquired CTC Aviation business with our Link U.K. operation now offers certification training for a wide range of pilots using reconfigurable simulators that can address virtually any commercial air transport platform. 
In the international area, there are longer lead times for new business awards and opportunities that are driven by customer needs that are ever-changing. However, we continue to push our strong track record and reputation for quality and affordability. We're expanding our international marketing and sales infrastructure by opening new locations and hiring additional in-country resources in order to increase our visibility in important markets. 
Our Far East operations has been helping to market L-3 products in that region, and last quarter, we received an order for our F-16 mission training system from Taiwan. We've had some other successes, which Chris will discuss in a moment. 
We continue to see international as an attractive, high-margin market and a long-time growth driver for us. Our results for the first quarter and our outlook for 2016 reflect the actions we've taken to transform L-3 into a more focused and flexible company with a goal of gaining market share in core areas and driving profitable growth. 
Our efforts to improve our market position are focused on strengthening our portfolio and targeted R&D investments. In the first quarter, we saw improvements in our margins, proof that we're on the right track in achieving our goals. 
We continue to have a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, and to that end in Q1, we completed the sale of NSS, National Security Solutions, which was central to our portfolio shaping efforts. We believe that our business is strongly positioned and do not anticipate actions along the scale of NSS in the near term. That, along with the MSI divestiture in 2015, has aligned L-3 with a changing macro environment. 
We do have a few minor divestitures in process, but going forward, our portfolio-shaping efforts will be focused on acquisitions. 
In January, we acquired Advanced Technical Materials Inc., or ATM, a small niche business serving the microwave marketplace. ATM will be integrated into our Narda-MITEQ business units. 
We will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that will be accretive to earnings, complement our core businesses and expand our capabilities. 
As always, we're strongly dedicated to generating shareholder value, and we continue to return a significant portion of our cash in the form of dividends and share repurchases while also investing in the business. Ultimately, we believe that our efficient capital structure provides us with ample flexibility to deliver value while allowing us to remain opportunistic to drive growth. 
We're starting 2016 from a position of strength. I'm very pleased with our performance last quarter, and I thank our employees for their continued focus on serving our valued customers. I'm confident that our business strategy positions us for even more success throughout the year as evidenced by our increased full year EPS guidance today. 
Now Chris will provide some operational details. Chris?"

I will begin with a discussion of our portfolio then focus on operational initiatives, and finally, summarize some additional new business wins from the quarter. As Mike mentioned, after completing the NSS",854,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with a discussion of our portfolio then focus on operational initiatives, and finally, summarize some additional new business wins from the quarter. 
As Mike mentioned, after completing the NSS divestiture, we believe that our portfolio is now largely aligned with the needs of our customers and future market demands. Accordingly, we are focusing our future portfolio, shaping on acquisitions. Currently, we are evaluating several businesses targeting high-margin, high-growth companies that will further strengthen our portfolio to address new market opportunities in both defense and commercial. 
Along with M&A, we are increasing our investment in R&D as we seek to distinguish ourselves, not only as leaders in quality and affordability, but also as innovators. We develop cutting-edge technology and next-generation products. 
For example, I've been spending time with our patriot works organization, which is developing next-generation products and subsystems that address the DoD's third offset strategy and other U.S. government classified opportunities. I've also been visiting our facilities to review our operations and to meet with business leaders and employees. 
I continue to be impressed with the talent we have in our divisions and the breadth of our solutions as a global security company. Working closely with the divisions and our proposal, quality and procurement team, we are developing initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies to drive organic growth and stronger margins. Also, we are identifying opportunities for collaboration to pursue new business. This will ensure that we stay focused on performance as well as secure new business and win recompetes. 
Our efforts have already begun to yield tangible results. In the first quarter, we saw outstanding performance on many of our existing contracts, particularly in Aerospace Systems, which help drive our solid results. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making, and we will continue to execute on our plan. 
Now let's discuss some of the key contract wins for the quarter in defense, commercial aviation and international. 
Starting with defense, we won several major new contracts. We will supply 2 key subsystems to the U.S. Navy's Combined EO/IR Surveillance and Response System, known as CESARS, which will provide unprecedented coverage for situational awareness and threat protection. CESARS is an enhanced countermeasure system to protect surface warships against the wide range of threats, including optically-guided anti-chip missiles, fast attack craft and UAVs. 
In addition, we will provide our advanced DC power system switchgear for the Ohio class submarine replacement. This award is significant because we have been improving functionality while reducing cost on the system, and we are pleased to have won this competition for this new growth platform. 
We also received an award to continue our long-standing service life extension work for the LCAC program. 
Aerospace Systems received continued funding for our role as the prime on the EMARSS-M Army ISR program. Notably, we recently achieved a key program milestone with the inaugural flight for the EMARSS-M prototype aircraft. 
We received a variety of follow-on contracts and funding for logistics, life cycle maintenance and other projects on programs including the Army fleet support, the C-12, the Rivet Joint and the T-45 training aircraft. 
Closing out our defense wins, we also received additional funding for many of our legacy communication programs in support of Hawklink, the P-8 and that B-52 aircraft. 
Turning to commercial aviation. Global advance continue to generate increased interest in our aviation products and security systems. We received a new TSA order for our examiner check baggage screening equipment. 
In aviation products, we received orders for approximately 400 flight recorders and key cap systems from a variety of airlines. 
And in aircraft systems, we want to contract to modify a Boeing 747, which, when complete, will serve as an airborne launchpad for the Virgin Galactic satellite launch service. 
And finally, in international, we have several contract wins. As Mike mentioned, we've been expanding our in-country presence and leveraging our existing corporate offices to increase sales throughout the major regions. We've received funding for communications and ISR integration work on South Korea's Global Hawk program. 
Also, this year, we'll be starting IRS work for another -- ISR work for another foreign government. 
For decades, L-3 has been the prime contractor on the Rivet Joint ISR aircraft. We've recently expanded our support work on this program to include training. And in Q1, we booked our first Rivet Joint simulator from the U.K. Royal Air Force. This new system will feature our innovative RealitySeven Full Flight Simulator. 
Finally, we have received international orders for our sensor systems and night vision equipment from a number of countries, including Canada and Algeria. We made our largest direct sale of fusion night vision goggles to Turkey, and we're also supplying MX15 EO/IR turrets to the Saudi Arabian National Guard. 
Overall, our business mix remains at about 70% U.S. defense and 30% international and commercial, but we will continue to forge new customer relationships in emerging markets that will increase our international and commercial business in the long term. 
I will now turn it over to Ralph, who will give you some more insight into last quarter's results."
93538,330877785,964988,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the first quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. We have very solid financial performance for the first quarter with diluted earnings per share, operating margin, free cash flow",995,"Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the first quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. 
We have very solid financial performance for the first quarter with diluted earnings per share, operating margin, free cash flow and orders all above our first quarter outlook. 
Earnings per share was $2.08, more than $0.45 higher than our outlook for the first quarter and driven primarily by higher operating margin, and secondarily, lower taxes. 
Sales were $2,353,000,000 and in line with our expectations. Organically, sales declined 2%, but encouragingly, our U.S. government business, which is mostly the Department of Defense, grew 4% organically. This demonstrates that the sales growth rate for our U.S. Government business is improving, which is significant as the U.S. Government market comprises about 72% of our business mix. 
Consolidated operating margin was 10.7% for the first quarter and about 150 basis points higher than we anticipated, with segment margin increasing 230 basis points compared to the 2015 first quarter. 
The higher margin generated operating income above our plan for the first quarter by about $35 million, which added $0.32 to EPS in the first quarter, and that was mostly in Aerospace Systems. 
Aerospace Systems margin was 10.5% and significantly higher than we expected for the 2016 first quarter. I want to elaborate on this point. Heading into 2016, we anticipated the favorable year-over-year comparisons on the Army C-12 contract and the head-of-state jobs. What was unexpected was the profit resiliency at ISR Systems, and that was the main driver of the better margin for Aerospace Systems in the first quarter. 
ISR Systems improved as contract performance across several programs, including lower direct labor and higher productivity. Some of these improvements represented upside opportunities that we were targeting for this year, and they converted early. Additionally, ISR Systems had a good outcome on negotiated price contract adjustment. 
Also, improved contract performance at aircraft systems contributed about $5 million of the higher operating income for the first quarter. 
Communication Systems margin was 10.8%, and that included a planned $3 million gain on the sale of a parcel of land, which added 60 basis points to the first quarter margin in that segment. 
Electronic Systems operating margin was 10.8% for the first quarter. It was lower than we expected due to a $15 million charge to increase the product returns allowance for the EOTech's holographic weapon sights. Otherwise, Electronic Systems margin was in line with our full year estimates. 
First quarter income taxes were lower than expected due to the early adoption of our recently announced new accounting rule, which we classified $10 million of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation from shareholders' equity to the income statement. This tax benefit added $0.13 to EPS for the first quarter. 
Free cash flow was $84 million, and it represented a good start for 2016 as the first quarter is our seasonally lowest cash flow quarter each year. 
Moving on to the 2016 guidance update. We increased EPS at the midpoint by $0.15 to $7.65 due to 2 items: one, the new tax accounting rule, which I just mentioned, adds $0.13 to EPS, and it was all recognized in the first quarter; and two, a net increase in segment margin adds about $0.02. So our 2016 EPS guidance midpoint is an 11% increase compared to last year. 
Consolidated sales guidance remains at $10,050,000,000 at the midpoint. We also maintained consolidated operating margin guidance at 9.8%, with margins expected to increase for the full year over 2015 in all 3 segments. 
We made 2 changes to segment margin guidance. First, we raised Aerospace Systems midpoint margin by 50 basis points to 7.1%, and that was for the better contract performance in the first quarter in ISR Systems. This added $20 million to our full year estimate operating income at the segment level. Secondly, we lowered Electronic Systems midpoint margin by 40 basis points to 12.1%, and that was for the $15 million charge to increase the product returns allowance in the first quarter. 
With respect to operating margins, we continue to work on improving program execution, increasing productivity and contract profit rates while maintaining tight control over overhead cost. I'm working very closely with Chris, and we're making progress with all this margin expansion levers. 
Our free cash flow estimate stays at $825 million for the full year. With respect to our 2016 capital allocation, it continues to include planned share repurchases of $750 million, of which we repurchased about $200 million during the first quarter. It also includes estimated cash dividends of $217 million, which reflects the $0.05 increase in our quarterly dividend per share that we approved in February and a $300 million debt repayment, which we announced on March 24. 
After these cash deployment actions, we estimate that we'll end this year with a cash balance of about $275 million, and that assumes no additional acquisitions. Our capital allocation and financing strategy continues to include our commitment to maintaining our investment grade credit ratings, which is why we are repaying $300 million of debt this year. I want to underscore that if we achieve the operating income growth we're projecting for 2016 and next year, we will not be required to make additional debt repayments. 
And the last point for the full year 2016 guidance is that we still expect the book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 and possibly higher. 
With respect to the second quarter outlook, we expect sales in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, with operating margin of about 9% and diluted earnings per share between $1.60 and $1.70. Free cash flow should be in the $100 million to $150 million range, with the book-to-bill ratio of about 0.9. 
So to conclude my financial review, the company is clearly making progress and has positive momentum. We look forward to building upon our strong first quarter performance the rest of this year. Thank you. 
And we'll now begin the Q&A."

Ron, so you recall that our guidance -- that our sales guidance for this year assumes or contemplated about a 14% decline in our international sales, and that's organically. And what we've talked about there was that we have 3 large ISR Systems jobs in Aerospace Systems that are nearing completion this year, and they're declining about $150 million or so year-over-year. And then within the Communication Systems segment, we booked a large SATCOM terminal job last year for Australia, which we shipped most of it. It was about $80 million, so we had that negative comparison this year. And we do expect follow-on orders for more terminals from Australia, and we'll probably book those sometime in the fourth quarter of this year or early in 2017. So that's a solid customer. And even with respect to the declines on those 3 foreign ISR jobs and ISR Systems, they each represent very good long-term customers of L-3, and they procure and modify their ISR aircraft on different cycles. And there's peaks and valleys in those cycles, and we're entering a valley with those 3 jobs this year and some more next year. But those customers are certainly going to procure more aircraft in the future, and we have insight to their procurement plans because we're very close to them. So by the time they we get to the latter part of this decade, we expect to have new programs each driving growth in our international end market from those customers."

And I think when I look at what we're most proud of, I think, on the communications front, the secured communications of data links and such is something we're known for, a lot of the IR capabilities. And then in aerospace, the whole focus on ISR, I think, is a hot growth market. We've spent a lot of time looking at the various DoD initiatives, the focus of Secretary Carter, the communities of interest. And we're pretty well aligned with where the DoD Government is focused, and that's where we've allocated our IRAD. And then I do not want to ignore the commercial aviation.

And we need to do some more good executing to realize those, so -- but clearly and positively, we're on the right path in terms of taking the margins higher in the segment. Additionally, Chris mentioned that we're starting some new foreign government ISR work in his comments, and that's going to be a multiyear program for us. But the initial scope of work in the contract is mostly concerning aircraft and material procurement with some engineering, so that work carries lower margins at the front end. But in the latter stages, we should have much better margins there. So that's an example of what's going on, and then I talked about those declining ISR, other ISR, foreign jobs this year. We're going to have -- the declines will be more pronounced this year after the first quarter, and that will also have some impact on the margins."

Relative to EOTech, we were actually just up there a few weeks ago in Michigan reviewing the operations and looking at the production. We believe they have made significant improvement to the products. If you recall, there were 4 issues with weather distortion and moisture, thermal drift and parallax. Two of those are fixed, and 2 are within 30 days of being fixed. So we're confident that we're going to have a product that we understand and properly disclosed its specs. We think that we've made our best estimate of what needed to be reserved. We recorded that. Again, it's a voluntary program, which we all decided for something we wanted to do for our customers. We have a very loyal customer base, a great brand even in spite of this issue, and we're actually developing some new products that will be coming out later this year that are getting some very positive early reviews. So we made our best estimate, and next quarter, we'll give you an update on that. But again, I'll emphasize it's a voluntary program that we've decided to do, and we've already started to see a drop-off in the return rate. So we'll see how that plays out. We kind of look at this every month. Mike, Ralph and I decide what we want to do, and then we opted to keep it going at least for the foreseeable future. On your second question, you're right, the margins upside, I think, on the logistics vertex business have a lot of potential. And even in the quarter, we've started to see some progress. I think once we made it clear that we were going to keep this business, we had about half of the executive team changed over and a new GM, a new CFO. And just last week, we were down in Mississippi, and we were impressed with the progress they've made. There's a long way to go, but the team is clearly motivated. And as Ralph said, we're hoping to get some news in the next couple of weeks on some big potential wins that would really help kind of boost us. In ES, we felt -- other than this EOTech reserve, we were on track for the year. And we're confident that, that's one of our solid performing groups long term. We've talked about having 13% up to maybe 14% margin, and we don't see any change to that in the years ahead."

So that's just the timing item, and the $15 million increase to the products allowance was also a reduction of sales. That was part of the impact. In the aviation product and security sector, there's a mix change going on there, where, last year, we had some significant sales of our very high margin airborne collision warning systems that were tied to a mandate that's essentially expired. So we're having less of those sales this year, and they're mostly software-oriented. But again, we expected that, so nothing unusual there.

One, there is a life cycle replacement that we would expect on the original EDS machines or the automated bomb detection machines that were the first to go in, in checked baggage line. Those are probably very close to end-of-life we're requiring major overhaul, so I'd expect to see some form of upgrade program in the not-too-distant future. Last summer, we introduced a new product for the checkpoint that was known as ClearScan and is designed to hopefully make it a little bit easier. You get through the checkpoint by not requiring liquids, for example, to be removed from bags since the machine can interrogate what liquids are in the bag without removing it. There are new technologies that could be added as well to provide further screening capabilities, such as the trace detection capability, which, right now, isn't done 100%. But you can imagine that technology could probably get built into the tunnels that are already processing bags rather than in the individual one-off examinations that are being conducted. Then, of course, you have some of the events -- the horrible events that have happened in Europe involving airports that suggest that the checkpoint may be at the start of the curve, if you will, or that there's other needs for secured, additional security outside the terminal, perhaps. Certainly, a lot of questions being asked, and we're certainly thinking of a lot of ways we can help be part of the solution to those questions. And it's an active area both from an R&D standpoint, from a potential M&A standpoint because there are technologies that are available in the marketplace for us to evaluate. But as always, we'll be mindful on price. We do require acquisitions to have real economic returns for us, so we are very focused on what we're willing to pay. And we always have the ability to develop things in our own, too. Unfortunately, a lot of things in this market have been more event-driven than long-term strategy, and we have been working with our customers to try to shift that model to more of a long-term strategy and be proactive rather than being reactive all the time. So it's something that we're very engaged in with lately, and I would expect the -- some more activity in that area during the year. I mean, we'll be back to you on it."

Because we believe our business performs probably the best out of any of them in the space in terms of technology, margins, product offerings, customer satisfaction, performance and the like. So to expand our offering, our customer base is a goal. And if there is a property out there that will help us achieve that goal faster, good economic turns would certainly interest it. But again, we're very satisfied with the business that we have put together. It's a completely organic business. It's been grown -- well, let me take back. There was an acquisition or 2 in there, but the base technology was developed at L-3. The automated threat detection technology and those algorithms were L-3 designed systems, and we could grow it either through further R&D internally or our acquisitions depending on what generates the best returns for us. So -- but it's something we're looking at pretty closely right now."

I think on the C-12 and ISR, when we're talking about pricing, and in these cases, we were talking about modifying the contracts. We made commitments, and a lot of these are based on such items as flight cost per hour and other assumptions that are made. And in several instances, customers will either use the aircraft more or less than anticipated. It's hard to predict those things, and a lot of these are just truing up the contracts through normal negotiations based on actual, in this case, I'll use flight hours, as an example, compared to what we signed up. So that's what we see there. It remains to be a competitive market out there. We're seeing more best value spend versus the LPTA. Low price is technically acceptable. I think our customers appreciate the need to have products that work on time and protect those people that are flying them, and I think with our track record and past performance, the best value competitions are helping us with new opportunities. So our goal is to increase the margins, and we're doing a lot of that through cost reductions.

We're very pleased with the first quarter, and I think I expect to see more of that. We just went through a question about pricing, I think, from Rich Safran. And really, a lot of that had to do with the margin improvement story that we've been working on, and a thorough analysis was done, many of the contracts in the Logistics space and as to why the margins were coming in low or coming in different than that, which was originally bid. And some of the analysis showed that there are probably opportunities for further dialogue with customers, where the customer side of the equation was not meeting what did assumptions were in terms of flights hours or other metrics that didn't develop. So there was room for further adjustment there, and then I think it has made our people a little smarter about how they bid jobs, like some of these logistics jobs, where you could have deviations from some of the original assumptions that could have negative impacts on the margins going out. So it certainly has gotten people to focus on everything they do, whether it's how they manage their supply chain, how they manage their labor hours or how they manage the delivery side with the customer in terms of keeping their eye on the ball as it relates to margins. We like to know if we're not achieving what was bid, why, with a rational explanation. I think that we are getting a good response from the team on it.

And on that note, let me just make a few summary comments. 
First of all, we're off to a solid start in 2016. Our results reflect our focus on margin improvement as well as driving organic revenue growth. In spite of the unprecedented volatility in the geopolitical environment, we're identifying growth opportunities across major markets and executing well throughout the organization. Additionally, with more clarity in the defense budget and positive signs for growth in military spending, we're well positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities. 
I'd add that more now than I can remember in the past, there has been a very productive dialogue with the folks at The Pentagon, particularly the AT&L organization under Secretary Kendall, with the industry in terms of what their needs are and things that they would like us as industry to focus on. Because their desire, of course, is to get things for the war fighter quicker, cheaper and things that work out of the box. You've heard Secretary Carter mentioned the 5 areas of concern: Russia, China and North Korea, Iran, the war on terra. They're very focused on solving all those problems. They're all very challenging issues, and they have many initiatives they're working on. You've heard the term third offset strategy, so there's a lot going on in that area. And that dialogue is very important to keep industry focused on making the right investments in the right places so that, together, we and the war fighters are developing the systems that they need to deal on the current threat environment. 
So our focus has never been sharper than it is right now on R&D and how we spend it, and we're leveraging our expertise in working with our key partners to invest in and develop those technologies that strengthen our competitive profile and meet customer needs. 
Our agility and strong customer relationship are also differentiators that enable us to adapt quickly to evolving customer needs. 
Bottom line, we're very encouraged by the company's performance and the overall industry environment. We remain committed to delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. 
And let me just thank everyone for joining us this afternoon for the call. I know it's a busy day, and we look forward to speaking with you in July. So thank you."

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report very solid first quarter results, demonstrating our continued progress in increasing margins and driving organic revenue growth as well as aligning our portfolio to our core businesses",1011,"Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I'm pleased to report very solid first quarter results, demonstrating our continued progress in increasing margins and driving organic revenue growth as well as aligning our portfolio to our core businesses. 
I'll start out with an overview of our results and then will provide some color on the current environment, our strategic focus areas and where we see opportunities for growth moving forward. Then Chris will discuss our operational performance, and Ralph will provide financial details before we take your questions. 
For the first quarter, we reported net sales of $2.4 billion, a decrease of 5% over the same period last year. Excluding the impacts of divestitures and acquisitions, sales decreased by 2% organically. Our EPS was $2.08, which is a 50% increase over the first quarter of 2015. We recorded net cash from operations of $112 million, funded orders were $2.6 billion, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.1. 
Our segment margin performance was very strong in the quarter, increasing 230 basis points to 10.7%. This includes better-than-expected contract performance at Aerospace Systems, where margins increased to 10.5%. 
As we look at the overall environment, we've seen improvement in the U.S. defense budget in 2016, and we're expecting that the budget will continue to grow over the next several years. 
Our customer continues to focus on affordable solutions, and L-3 is well positioned to compete effectively. We've mapped our strategy to address the DoD spending priorities, which we feel are oriented towards weapon system sustainment, space, the classified area, protected communications as well as next-generation products. 
The DoD remains L-3's largest customer, and we work hard to anticipate and adapt to its needs so that our capabilities and solutions align with their current budget. 
A major win for us in the quarter was the maintenance and sustainment work for the F/A-18 A/B/C/D aircraft. Building on our U.K. and Canadian F/A-18 experience, this U.S. Navy competitive win is strategic for us because it represents the first time we'll perform sustainment work on this platform at our Waco, Texas facility, and we expect additional follow-on work in the years ahead. 
Similarly in commercial aviation, we're pursuing opportunities to increase market share and are encouraged by what we believe are very favorable long-term fundamentals. 
There's a particular demand for cockpit solutions -- I'm sorry, for checkpoint solutions as airports around the globe upgrade their security infrastructure. In fact, Singapore's airport is currently conducting a test of our advanced ProVision and ClearScan checkpoint solutions. We also will be providing a variety of screening systems as part of the Bahrain International Airport modernization program. Also, airlines are continuing to modernize and upgrade their fleets with the latest technology. 
We're well equipped to meet those needs with our market-leading aviation products and next-generation solutions. As you know, pilot training is another focus area for L-3. There remains a shortage of trained pilots. In fact, it's estimated that more than 0.5 million pilots will be needed in the decade ahead. L-3 has the world's most advanced military and commercial total training solutions business. 
The combination of our recently acquired CTC Aviation business with our Link U.K. operation now offers certification training for a wide range of pilots using reconfigurable simulators that can address virtually any commercial air transport platform. 
In the international area, there are longer lead times for new business awards and opportunities are driven by customer needs that are ever-changing. However, we continue to push our strong track record and reputation for quality and affordability. We're expanding our international marketing and sales infrastructure by opening new locations and hiring additional in-country resources in order to increase our visibility in important markets. 
Our Far East operations has been helping to market L-3 products in that region, and last quarter, we received an order for our F-16 mission training system from Taiwan. We've had some other successes, which Chris will discuss in a moment. 
We continue to see international as an attractive, high-margin market and a long-term growth driver for us. Our results for the first quarter and our outlook for 2016 reflect the actions we've taken to transform L-3 into a more focused and flexible company with a goal of gaining market share in core areas and driving profitable growth. 
Our efforts to improve our market position have focused on strengthening our portfolio and targeted R&D investments. In the first quarter, we saw improvements in our margins, proof that we're on the right track in achieving our goals. 
We continue to have a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, and to that end, in Q1, we completed the sale of NSS, National Security Solutions, which was central to our portfolio-shaping efforts. We believe that our business is strongly positioned and do not anticipate actions along the scale of NSS in the near term. That, along with the MSI divestiture in 2015, has aligned L-3 with the changing macro environment. 
We do have a few minor divestitures in process, but going forward, our portfolio-shaping efforts will be focused on acquisitions. 
In January, we acquired Advanced Technical Materials Inc., or ATM, a small niche business serving the microwave marketplace. ATM will be integrated into our Narda-MITEQ business units. 
We will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that will be accretive to earnings, complement our core businesses and expand our capabilities. 
As always, we're strongly dedicated to generating shareholder value, and we continue to return a significant portion of our cash in the form of dividends and share repurchases while also investing in the business. Ultimately, we believe that our efficient capital structure provides us with ample flexibility to deliver value while allowing us to remain opportunistic to drive growth. 
We're starting 2016 from a position of strength. I'm very pleased with our performance last quarter, and I thank our employees for their continued focus on serving our valued customers. I'm confident that our business strategy positions us for even more success throughout the year as evidenced by our increased full year EPS guidance today. 
Now Chris will provide some operational details. Chris?"

Accordingly, we are focusing our future portfolio shaping on acquisitions. Currently, we are evaluating several businesses, targeting high-margin, high-growth companies that will further strengthen our portfolio to address new market opportunities in both defense and commercial. 
Along with M&A, we are increasing our investment in R&D as we seek to distinguish ourselves not only as leaders in quality and affordability, but also as innovators who develop cutting-edge technology and next-generation products. 
For example, I've been spending time with our patriot works organization, which is developing next-generation products and subsystems that address the DoD's third offset strategy and other U.S. government classified opportunities. I've also been visiting our facilities to review our operations and to meet with business leaders and employees. 
I continue to be impressed with the talent we have in our divisions and the breadth of our solutions as a global security company. Working closely with the divisions and our proposal, quality and procurement teams, we are developing initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies to drive organic growth and stronger margins. Also, we are identifying opportunities for collaboration to pursue new business. This will ensure that we stay focused on performance as well as secure new business and win in recompetes. 
Our efforts have already begun to yield tangible results. In the first quarter, we saw outstanding performance on many of our existing contracts, particularly in Aerospace Systems, which helped drive our solid results. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making, and we will continue to execute on our plan. 
Now let's discuss some of the key contract wins for the quarter in defense, commercial aviation and international. 
Starting with defense, we won several major new contracts. We will supply 2 key subsystems to the U.S. Navy's Combined EO/IR Surveillance and Response System, known as CESARS, which will provide unprecedented coverage for situational awareness and threat protection. CESARS is an enhanced countermeasure system to protect surface warships against a wide range of threats, including optically-guided anti-ship missiles, fast attack craft and UAVs. 
In addition, we will provide our advanced DC power system switchgear for the Ohio class submarine replacement. This award is significant because we have been improving functionality while reducing cost on the system, and we are pleased to have won this competition for this new growth platform. 
We also received an award to continue our long-standing service life extension work for the LCAC program. 
Aerospace Systems received continued funding for our role as the prime on the EMARSS-M Army ISR program. Notably, we recently achieved a key program milestone with the inaugural flight for the EMARSS-M prototype aircraft. 
We received a variety of follow-on contracts and funding for logistics, life cycle maintenance and other projects on programs including the Army fleet support, the C-12, the Rivet Joint and the T-45 training aircraft. 
Closing out our defense wins, we also received additional funding for many of our legacy communication programs in support of Hawklink, the P-8 and the B-52 aircraft. 
Turning to commercial aviation. Global events continue to generate increased interest in our aviation products and security systems. We received a new TSA order for our eXaminer checked baggage screening equipment. 
In aviation products, we received orders for approximately 400 flight recorders and TCAS systems from a variety of airlines. 
And in aircraft systems, we won a contract to modify a Boeing 747, which, when complete, will serve as an airborne launchpad for the Virgin Galactic satellite launch service. 
And finally, in international, we have several contract wins. As Mike mentioned, we've been expanding our in-country presence and leveraging our existing corporate offices to increase sales throughout the major regions. We've received funding for communications and ISR integration work on South Korea's Global Hawk program. 
Also, this year, we'll be starting the IRS work for another -- ISR work for another foreign government. 
For decades, L-3 has been the prime contractor on the Rivet Joint ISR aircraft. We've recently expanded our support work on this program to include training. And in Q1, we booked our first Rivet Joint simulator from the U.K. Royal Air Force. This new system will feature our innovative RealitySeven Full Flight Simulator. 
Finally, we have received international orders for our sensor systems and night vision equipment from a number of countries, including Canada and Algeria. We made our largest direct sale of fusion night vision goggles to Turkey, and we're also supplying MX15 EO/IR turrets to the Saudi Arabian National Guard. 
Overall, our business mix remains at about 70% U.S. defense and 30% international and commercial, but we will continue to forge new customer relationships in emerging markets that will increase our international and commercial business in the long term. 
I will now turn it over to Ralph, who will give you some more insight into last quarter's results."

I'll discuss some details about the first quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. We have very solid financial performance for the first quarter with diluted earnings per share, operating margin, free cash flow",995,"Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the first quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. 
We have very solid financial performance for the first quarter with diluted earnings per share, operating margin, free cash flow and orders all above our first quarter outlook. 
Earnings per share was $2.08, more than $0.45 higher than our outlook for the first quarter and driven primarily by higher operating margin, and secondarily, lower taxes. 
Sales were $2,353,000,000 and in line with our expectations. Organically, sales declined 2%, but encouragingly, our U.S. government business, which is mostly the Department of Defense, grew 4% organically. This demonstrates that the sales growth rate for our U.S. government business is improving, which is significant as the U.S. government market comprises about 72% of our business mix. 
Consolidated operating margin was 10.7% for the first quarter and about 150 basis points higher than we anticipated, with segment margin increasing 230 basis points compared to the 2015 first quarter. 
The higher margin generated operating income above our plan for the first quarter by about $35 million, which added $0.32 to EPS in the first quarter, and that was mostly in Aerospace Systems. 
Aerospace Systems margin was 10.5% and significantly higher than we expected for the 2016 first quarter. I want to elaborate on this point. Heading into 2016, we anticipated the favorable year-over-year comparisons on the Army C-12 contract and the head-of-state jobs. What was unexpected was the profit resiliency at ISR systems, and that was the main driver of the better margin for Aerospace Systems in the first quarter. 
ISR systems improved its contract performance across several programs, including lower direct labor and higher productivity. Some of these improvements represented upside opportunities that we were targeting for this year, and they converted early. Additionally, ISR systems had a good outcome on negotiated price contract adjustment. 
Also, improved contract performance at aircraft systems contributed about $5 million of the higher operating income for the first quarter. 
Communication Systems margin was 10.8%, and that included a planned $3 million gain on the sale of a parcel of land, which added 60 basis points to the first quarter margin in that segment. 
Electronic Systems operating margin was 10.8% for the first quarter. It was lower than we expected due to a $15 million charge to increase the product returns allowance for the EOTech's holographic weapon sights. Otherwise, Electronic Systems margin was in line with our full year estimates. 
First quarter income taxes were lower than expected due to the early adoption of our recently announced new accounting rule, which we classified $10 million of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation from shareholders' equity to the income statement. This tax benefit added $0.13 to EPS for the first quarter. 
Free cash flow was $84 million, and it represented a good start for 2016 as the first quarter is our seasonally lowest cash flow quarter each year. 
Moving on to the 2016 guidance update. We increased EPS at the midpoint by $0.15 to $7.65 due to 2 items: one, the new tax accounting rule, which I just mentioned, adds $0.13 to EPS, and it was all recognized in the first quarter; and two, a net increase in segment margin adds about $0.02. So our 2016 EPS guidance midpoint is an 11% increase compared to last year. 
Consolidated sales guidance remains at $10,050,000,000 at the midpoint. We also maintained consolidated operating margin guidance at 9.8%, with margins expected to increase for the full year over 2015 in all 3 segments. 
We made 2 changes to segment margin guidance. First, we raised Aerospace Systems midpoint margin by 50 basis points to 7.1%, and that was for the better contract performance in the first quarter at ISR systems. This added $20 million to our full year estimate for operating income at the segment level. Secondly, we lowered Electronic Systems midpoint margin by 40 basis points to 12.1%, and that was for the $15 million charge to increase the product returns allowance in the first quarter. 
With respect to operating margins, we continue to work on improving program execution, increasing productivity and contract profit rates while maintaining tight control over overhead cost. I'm working very closely with Chris, and we're making progress with all these margin expansion levers. 
Our free cash flow estimate stays at $825 million for the full year. With respect to our 2016 capital allocation, it continues to include planned share repurchases of $750 million, of which we repurchased about $200 million during the first quarter. It also includes estimated cash dividends of $217 million, which reflects the $0.05 increase in our quarterly dividend per share that we approved in February and a $300 million debt repayment, which we announced on March 24. 
After these cash deployment actions, we estimate that we'll end this year with a cash balance of about $275 million, and that assumes no additional acquisitions. Our capital allocation and financing strategy continues to include our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, which is why we are repaying $300 million of debt this year. I want to underscore that if we achieve the operating income growth we're projecting for 2016 and next year, we will not be required to make additional debt repayments. 
And the last point for the full year 2016 guidance is that we still expect a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0, and possibly higher. 
With respect to the second quarter outlook, we expect sales in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, with operating margin of about 9% and diluted earnings per share between $1.60 and $1.70. Free cash flow should be in the $100 million to $150 million range, with the book-to-bill ratio of about 0.9. 
So to conclude my financial review, the company is clearly making progress and has positive momentum. We look forward to building upon our strong first quarter performance the rest of this year. Thank you. 
And we'll now begin the Q&A."

Ron, so you recall that our guidance -- that our sales guidance for this year assumed or contemplated about a 14% decline in our international sales, and that's organically. And what we've talked about there was that we have 3 large ISR systems jobs in Aerospace Systems that are nearing completion this year, and they're declining about $150 million or so year-over-year. And then within the Communication Systems segment, we booked a large SATCOM terminal job last year for Australia, which we shipped most of it. It was about $80 million, so we had that negative comparison this year. And we do expect follow-on orders for more terminals from Australia, and we'll probably book those sometime in the fourth quarter of this year or early in 2017. So that's a solid customer. And even with respect to the declines on those 3 foreign ISR jobs at ISR systems, they each represent very good long-term customers of L-3, and they procure and modify their ISR aircraft on different cycles. And there's peaks and valleys in those cycles, and we're entering a valley with those 3 jobs this year and some more next year. But those customers are certainly going to procure more aircraft in the future, and we have insight to their procurement plans because we're very close to them. So by the time we get to the latter part of this decade, we expect to have new programs each driving growth in our international end market from those customers."

These platforms will not be of any value to our customers without secured communication and world-class sensors. And I think when I look at what we're most proud of, I think, on the communications front, the secured communications of data links and such is something we're known for, a lot of the EO/IR capabilities. And then in aerospace, the whole focus on ISR, I think, is a hot growth market. We've spent a lot of time looking at the various DoD initiatives, the focus of Secretary Carter, the communities of interest. And we're pretty well aligned with where the DoD government is focused, and that's where we've allocated our IRAD. And then I do not want to ignore the commercial aviation.

Additionally, Chris mentioned that we're starting some new foreign government ISR work in his comments, and that's going to be a multiyear program for us.

Relative to EOTech, we were actually just up there a few weeks ago in Michigan reviewing the operations and looking at the production. We believe they have made significant improvements to the products. If you recall, there were 4 issues with weather distortion and moisture, thermal drift and parallax. Two of those are fixed, and 2 are within 30 days of being fixed. So we're confident that we're going to have a product that we understand and properly disclosed its specs. We think that we've made our best estimate of what needed to be reserved. We recorded that. Again, it's a voluntary program, which we all decided was something we wanted to do for our customers. We have a very loyal customer base, a great brand even in spite of this issue, and we're actually developing some new products that will be coming out later this year that are getting some very positive early reviews. So we made our best estimate, and next quarter, we'll give you an update on that. But again, I'll emphasize it's a voluntary program that we've decided to do, and we've already started to see a drop-off in the return rate. So we'll see how that plays out. We kind of look at this every month. Mike, Ralph and I decide what we want to do, and then we opted to keep it going, at least for the foreseeable future. On your second question, you're right, the margins upside, I think, on the logistics Vertex business have a lot of potential. And even in the quarter, we've started to see some progress. I think once we made it clear that we were going to keep this business, we had about half of the executive team changed over and a new GM, a new CFO. And just last week, we were down in Mississippi, and we were impressed with the progress they've made. There's a long way to go, but the team is clearly motivated. And as Ralph said, we're hoping to get some news in the next couple of weeks on some big potential wins that would really help boost us. In ES, we felt, other than this EOTech reserve, we were on track for the year. And we're confident that that's one of our solid performing groups long term. We've talked about having 13% up to maybe 14% margin, and we don't see any change to that in the years ahead."

So that's just a timing item, and the $15 million increase to the products allowance was also a reduction of sales. That was part of the impact. In the aviation product and security sector, there's a mix change going on there, where, last year, we had some significant sales of our very high-margin airborne collision warning systems that were tied to a mandate that's essentially expired. So we're having less of those sales this year, and they're mostly software-oriented. But again, we expected that, so nothing unusual there.

One, there is a life cycle replacement that we would expect on the original EDS machines or the automated bomb detection machines that were the first to go in, in the checked baggage line. Those are probably very close to end-of-life or requiring major overhaul, so I'd expect to see some form of upgrade program in the not-too-distant future. Last summer, we introduced a new product for the checkpoint that was known as ClearScan and is designed to hopefully make it a little bit easier to get through the checkpoint by not requiring liquids, for example, to be removed from bags since the machine can interrogate what liquids are in the bag without removing it. There are new technologies that could be added as well to provide further screening capabilities, such as the trace detection capability, which, right now, isn't done 100%. But you can imagine that technology could probably get built into the tunnels that are already processing bags rather than in the individual one-off examinations that are being conducted. Then, of course, you have some of the events -- the horrible events that have happened in Europe involving airports that suggest that the checkpoint may be at the start of the curve, if you will, or that there's other needs for secured -- additional security outside the terminal, perhaps. Certainly, a lot of questions being asked, and we're certainly thinking of a lot of ways we can help be part of the solution to those questions. And it's an active area both from an R&D standpoint, from a potential M&A standpoint because there are technologies that are available in the marketplace for us to evaluate. But as always, we'll be mindful on price. We do require acquisitions to have real economic returns for us, so we are very focused on what we're willing to pay. And we always have the ability to develop things on our own, too. Unfortunately, a lot of things in this market have been more event-driven than long-term strategy, and we have been working with our customers to try to shift that model to more of a long-term strategy and be proactive rather than being reactive all the time. So it's something that we're very engaged in lately, and I would expect some more activity in that area during the year. I mean, we'll be back to you on it."

We're very pleased with the first quarter, and I think I expect to see more of that. We just went through a question about pricing, I think, from Rich Safran. And really, a lot of that had to do with the margin improvement story that we've been working on, and a thorough analysis was done, many of the contracts in the logistics space as to why the margins were coming in low or coming in different than that which was originally bid. And some of the analysis showed that there are probably opportunities for further dialogue with customers, where the customer side of the equation was not meeting what the assumptions were in terms of flights hours or other metrics that didn't develop. So there was room for further adjustment there, and then I think it has made our people a little smarter about how they bid jobs, like some of these logistics jobs, where you could have deviations from some of the original assumptions that could have negative impacts on the margins going out. So it certainly has gotten people to focus on everything they do, whether it's how they manage their supply chain, how they manage their labor hours or how they manage the delivery side with the customer in terms of keeping their eye on the ball as it relates to margins. We like to know if we're not achieving what was bid, why, with a rational explanation. I think that we are getting a good response from the team on it. But let me give Chris a chance to add his two cents on it because he's been very involved in this."

And on that note, let me just make a few summary comments. 
First of all, we're off to a solid start in 2016. Our results reflect our focus on margin improvement as well as driving organic revenue growth. In spite of the unprecedented volatility in the geopolitical environment, we're identifying growth opportunities across major markets and executing well throughout the organization. Additionally, with more clarity in the defense budget and positive signs for growth in military spending, we're well positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities. 
I'd add that more now than I can remember in the past, there has been a very productive dialogue with the folks at The Pentagon, particularly the AT&L organization under Secretary Kendall, with the industry in terms of what their needs are and things that they would like us as industry to focus on. Because their desire, of course, is to get things for the war fighter quicker, cheaper and things that work out of the box. You've heard Secretary Carter mention the 5 areas of concern: Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, the war on terror. They're very focused on solving all those problems. They're all very challenging issues, and they have many initiatives they're working on. You've heard the term third offset strategy, so there's a lot going on in that area. And that dialogue is very important to keep industry focused on making the right investments in the right places so that, together, we and the war fighters are developing the systems that they need to deal with the current threat environment. 
So our focus has never been sharper than it is right now on R&D and how we spend it, and we're leveraging our expertise and working with our key partners to invest in and develop those technologies that strengthen our competitive profile and meet customer needs. 
Our agility and strong customer relationships are also differentiators that enable us to adapt quickly to evolving customer needs. 
Bottom line, we're very encouraged by the company's performance and the overall industry environment. We remain committed to delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. 
And let me just thank everyone for joining us this afternoon for the call. I know it's a busy day, and we look forward to speaking with you in July. So thank you."

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report very solid first quarter results, demonstrating our continued progress in increasing margins and driving organic revenue growth as well as aligning our portfolio to our core businesses",1011,"Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. 
I'm pleased to report very solid first quarter results, demonstrating our continued progress in increasing margins and driving organic revenue growth as well as aligning our portfolio to our core businesses. 
I'll start out with an overview of our results and then will provide some color on the current environment, our strategic focus areas and where we see opportunities for growth moving forward. Then Chris will discuss our operational performance, and Ralph will provide financial details before we take your questions. 
For the first quarter, we reported net sales of $2.4 billion, a decrease of 5% over the same period last year. Excluding the impacts of divestitures and acquisitions, sales decreased by 2% organically. Our EPS was $2.08, which is a 50% increase over the first quarter of 2015. We recorded net cash from operations of $112 million, funded orders were $2.6 billion, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.1. 
Our segment margin performance was very strong in the quarter, increasing 230 basis points to 10.7%. This includes better-than-expected contract performance at Aerospace Systems, where margins increased to 10.5%. 
As we look at the overall environment, we've seen improvement in the U.S. defense budget in 2016, and we're expecting that the budget will continue to grow over the next several years. 
Our customer continues to focus on affordable solutions, and L-3 is well positioned to compete effectively. We've mapped our strategy to address the DoD spending priorities, which we feel are oriented towards weapon system sustainment, space, the classified area, protected communications as well as next-generation products. 
The DoD remains L-3's largest customer, and we work hard to anticipate and adapt to its needs so that our capabilities and solutions align with their current budget. 
A major win for us in the quarter was the maintenance and sustainment work for the F/A-18 A/B/C/D aircraft. Building on our U.K. and Canadian F/A-18 experience, this U.S. Navy competitive win is strategic for us because it represents the first time we'll perform sustainment work on this platform at our Waco, Texas facility, and we expect additional follow-on work in the years ahead. 
Similarly in commercial aviation, we're pursuing opportunities to increase market share and are encouraged by what we believe are very favorable long-term fundamentals. 
There's a particular demand for cockpit solutions -- I'm sorry, for checkpoint solutions as airports around the globe upgrade their security infrastructure. In fact, Singapore's airport is currently conducting a test of our advanced ProVision and ClearScan checkpoint solutions. We also will be providing a variety of screening systems as part of the Bahrain International Airport modernization program. Also, airlines are continuing to modernize and upgrade their fleets with the latest technology. 
We're well equipped to meet those needs with our market-leading aviation products and next-generation solutions. As you know, pilot training is another focus area for L-3. There remains a shortage of trained pilots. In fact, it's estimated that more than 0.5 million pilots will be needed in the decade ahead. L-3 has the world's most advanced military and commercial total training solutions business. 
The combination of our recently acquired CTC Aviation business with our Link U.K. operation now offers certification training for a wide range of pilots using reconfigurable simulators that can address virtually any commercial air transport platform. 
In the international area, there are longer lead times for new business awards and opportunities are driven by customer needs that are ever-changing. However, we continue to push our strong track record and reputation for quality and affordability. We're expanding our international marketing and sales infrastructure by opening new locations and hiring additional in-country resources in order to increase our visibility in important markets. 
Our Far East operations has been helping to market L-3 products in that region, and last quarter, we received an order for our F-16 mission training system from Taiwan. We've had some other successes, which Chris will discuss in a moment. 
We continue to see international as an attractive, high-margin market and a long-term growth driver for us. Our results for the first quarter and our outlook for 2016 reflect the actions we've taken to transform L-3 into a more focused and flexible company with a goal of gaining market share in core areas and driving profitable growth. 
Our efforts to improve our market position have focused on strengthening our portfolio and targeted R&D investments. In the first quarter, we saw improvements in our margins, proof that we're on the right track in achieving our goals. 
We continue to have a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, and to that end, in Q1, we completed the sale of NSS, National Security Solutions, which was central to our portfolio-shaping efforts. We believe that our business is strongly positioned and do not anticipate actions along the scale of NSS in the near term. That, along with the MSI divestiture in 2015, has aligned L-3 with the changing macro environment. 
We do have a few minor divestitures in process, but going forward, our portfolio-shaping efforts will be focused on acquisitions. 
In January, we acquired Advanced Technical Materials Inc., or ATM, a small niche business serving the microwave marketplace. ATM will be integrated into our Narda-MITEQ business units. 
We will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that will be accretive to earnings, complement our core businesses and expand our capabilities. 
As always, we're strongly dedicated to generating shareholder value, and we continue to return a significant portion of our cash in the form of dividends and share repurchases while also investing in the business. Ultimately, we believe that our efficient capital structure provides us with ample flexibility to deliver value while allowing us to remain opportunistic to drive growth. 
We're starting 2016 from a position of strength. I'm very pleased with our performance last quarter, and I thank our employees for their continued focus on serving our valued customers. I'm confident that our business strategy positions us for even more success throughout the year as evidenced by our increased full year EPS guidance today. 
Now Chris will provide some operational details. Chris?"

As Mike mentioned, after completing the NSS",855,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with a discussion of our portfolio, then focus on operational initiatives, and finally, summarize some additional new business wins from the quarter. 
As Mike mentioned, after completing the NSS divestiture, we believe that our portfolio is now largely aligned with the needs of our customers and future market demands. Accordingly, we are focusing our future portfolio shaping on acquisitions. Currently, we are evaluating several businesses, targeting high-margin, high-growth companies that will further strengthen our portfolio to address new market opportunities in both defense and commercial. 
Along with M&A, we are increasing our investment in R&D as we seek to distinguish ourselves not only as leaders in quality and affordability, but also as innovators who develop cutting-edge technology and next-generation products. 
For example, I've been spending time with our patriot works organization, which is developing next-generation products and subsystems that address the DoD's third offset strategy and other U.S. government classified opportunities. I've also been visiting our facilities to review our operations and to meet with business leaders and employees. 
I continue to be impressed with the talent we have in our divisions and the breadth of our solutions as a global security company. Working closely with the divisions and our proposal, quality and procurement teams, we are developing initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies to drive organic growth and stronger margins. Also, we are identifying opportunities for collaboration to pursue new business. This will ensure that we stay focused on performance as well as secure new business and win in recompetes. 
Our efforts have already begun to yield tangible results. In the first quarter, we saw outstanding performance on many of our existing contracts, particularly in Aerospace Systems, which helped drive our solid results. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making, and we will continue to execute on our plan. 
Now let's discuss some of the key contract wins for the quarter in defense, commercial aviation and international. 
Starting with defense, we won several major new contracts. We will supply 2 key subsystems to the U.S. Navy's Combined EO/IR Surveillance and Response System, known as CESARS, which will provide unprecedented coverage for situational awareness and threat protection. CESARS is an enhanced countermeasure system to protect surface warships against a wide range of threats, including optically-guided anti-ship missiles, fast attack craft and UAVs. 
In addition, we will provide our advanced DC power system switchgear for the Ohio class submarine replacement. This award is significant because we have been improving functionality while reducing cost on the system, and we are pleased to have won this competition for this new growth platform. 
We also received an award to continue our long-standing service life extension work for the LCAC program. 
Aerospace Systems received continued funding for our role as the prime on the EMARSS-M Army ISR program. Notably, we recently achieved a key program milestone with the inaugural flight for the EMARSS-M prototype aircraft. 
We received a variety of follow-on contracts and funding for logistics, life cycle maintenance and other projects on programs including the Army fleet support, the C-12, the Rivet Joint and the T-45 training aircraft. 
Closing out our defense wins, we also received additional funding for many of our legacy communication programs in support of Hawklink, the P-8 and the B-52 aircraft. 
Turning to commercial aviation. Global events continue to generate increased interest in our aviation products and security systems. We received a new TSA order for our eXaminer checked baggage screening equipment. 
In aviation products, we received orders for approximately 400 flight recorders and TCAS systems from a variety of airlines. 
And in aircraft systems, we won a contract to modify a Boeing 747, which, when complete, will serve as an airborne launchpad for the Virgin Galactic satellite launch service. 
And finally, in international, we have several contract wins. As Mike mentioned, we've been expanding our in-country presence and leveraging our existing corporate offices to increase sales throughout the major regions. We've received funding for communications and ISR integration work on South Korea's Global Hawk program. 
Also, this year, we'll be starting the IRS work for another -- ISR work for another foreign government. 
For decades, L-3 has been the prime contractor on the Rivet Joint ISR aircraft. We've recently expanded our support work on this program to include training. And in Q1, we booked our first Rivet Joint simulator from the U.K. Royal Air Force. This new system will feature our innovative RealitySeven Full Flight Simulator. 
Finally, we have received international orders for our sensor systems and night vision equipment from a number of countries, including Canada and Algeria. We made our largest direct sale of fusion night vision goggles to Turkey, and we're also supplying MX15 EO/IR turrets to the Saudi Arabian National Guard. 
Overall, our business mix remains at about 70% U.S. defense and 30% international and commercial, but we will continue to forge new customer relationships in emerging markets that will increase our international and commercial business in the long term. 
I will now turn it over to Ralph, who will give you some more insight into last quarter's results."
93538,330877785,965379,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the first quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. We have very solid financial performance for the first quarter with diluted earnings per share, operating margin, free cash flow",995,"Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the first quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. 
We have very solid financial performance for the first quarter with diluted earnings per share, operating margin, free cash flow and orders all above our first quarter outlook. 
Earnings per share was $2.08, more than $0.45 higher than our outlook for the first quarter and driven primarily by higher operating margin, and secondarily, lower taxes. 
Sales were $2,353,000,000 and in line with our expectations. Organically, sales declined 2%, but encouragingly, our U.S. government business, which is mostly the Department of Defense, grew 4% organically. This demonstrates that the sales growth rate for our U.S. government business is improving, which is significant as the U.S. government market comprises about 72% of our business mix. 
Consolidated operating margin was 10.7% for the first quarter and about 150 basis points higher than we anticipated, with segment margin increasing 230 basis points compared to the 2015 first quarter. 
The higher margin generated operating income above our plan for the first quarter by about $35 million, which added $0.32 to EPS in the first quarter, and that was mostly in Aerospace Systems. 
Aerospace Systems margin was 10.5% and significantly higher than we expected for the 2016 first quarter. I want to elaborate on this point. Heading into 2016, we anticipated the favorable year-over-year comparisons on the Army C-12 contract and the head-of-state jobs. What was unexpected was the profit resiliency at ISR systems, and that was the main driver of the better margin for Aerospace Systems in the first quarter. 
ISR systems improved its contract performance across several programs, including lower direct labor and higher productivity. Some of these improvements represented upside opportunities that we were targeting for this year, and they converted early. Additionally, ISR systems had a good outcome on negotiated price contract adjustment. 
Also, improved contract performance at aircraft systems contributed about $5 million of the higher operating income for the first quarter. 
Communication Systems margin was 10.8%, and that included a planned $3 million gain on the sale of a parcel of land, which added 60 basis points to the first quarter margin in that segment. 
Electronic Systems operating margin was 10.8% for the first quarter. It was lower than we expected due to a $15 million charge to increase the product returns allowance for the EOTech's holographic weapon sights. Otherwise, Electronic Systems margin was in line with our full year estimates. 
First quarter income taxes were lower than expected due to the early adoption of our recently announced new accounting rule, which we classified $10 million of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation from shareholders' equity to the income statement. This tax benefit added $0.13 to EPS for the first quarter. 
Free cash flow was $84 million, and it represented a good start for 2016 as the first quarter is our seasonally lowest cash flow quarter each year. 
Moving on to the 2016 guidance update. We increased EPS at the midpoint by $0.15 to $7.65 due to 2 items: one, the new tax accounting rule, which I just mentioned, adds $0.13 to EPS, and it was all recognized in the first quarter; and two, a net increase in segment margin adds about $0.02. So our 2016 EPS guidance midpoint is an 11% increase compared to last year. 
Consolidated sales guidance remains at $10,050,000,000 at the midpoint. We also maintained consolidated operating margin guidance at 9.8%, with margins expected to increase for the full year over 2015 in all 3 segments. 
We made 2 changes to segment margin guidance. First, we raised Aerospace Systems midpoint margin by 50 basis points to 7.1%, and that was for the better contract performance in the first quarter at ISR systems. This added $20 million to our full year estimate for operating income at the segment level. Secondly, we lowered Electronic Systems midpoint margin by 40 basis points to 12.1%, and that was for the $15 million charge to increase the product returns allowance in the first quarter. 
With respect to operating margins, we continue to work on improving program execution, increasing productivity and contract profit rates while maintaining tight control over overhead cost. I'm working very closely with Chris, and we're making progress with all these margin expansion levers. 
Our free cash flow estimate stays at $825 million for the full year. With respect to our 2016 capital allocation, it continues to include planned share repurchases of $750 million, of which we repurchased about $200 million during the first quarter. It also includes estimated cash dividends of $217 million, which reflects the $0.05 increase in our quarterly dividend per share that we approved in February and a $300 million debt repayment, which we announced on March 24. 
After these cash deployment actions, we estimate that we'll end this year with a cash balance of about $275 million, and that assumes no additional acquisitions. Our capital allocation and financing strategy continues to include our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, which is why we are repaying $300 million of debt this year. I want to underscore that if we achieve the operating income growth we're projecting for 2016 and next year, we will not be required to make additional debt repayments. 
And the last point for the full year 2016 guidance is that we still expect a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0, and possibly higher. 
With respect to the second quarter outlook, we expect sales in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, with operating margin of about 9% and diluted earnings per share between $1.60 and $1.70. Free cash flow should be in the $100 million to $150 million range, with the book-to-bill ratio of about 0.9. 
So to conclude my financial review, the company is clearly making progress and has positive momentum. We look forward to building upon our strong first quarter performance the rest of this year. Thank you. 
And we'll now begin the Q&A."

Ron, so you recall that our guidance -- that our sales guidance for this year assumed or contemplated about a 14% decline in our international sales, and that's organically. And what we've talked about there was that we have 3 large ISR systems jobs in Aerospace Systems that are nearing completion this year, and they're declining about $150 million or so year-over-year. And then within the Communication Systems segment, we booked a large SATCOM terminal job last year for Australia, which we shipped most of it. It was about $80 million, so we had that negative comparison this year. And we do expect follow-on orders for more terminals from Australia, and we'll probably book those sometime in the fourth quarter of this year or early in 2017. So that's a solid customer. And even with respect to the declines on those 3 foreign ISR jobs at ISR systems, they each represent very good long-term customers of L-3, and they procure and modify their ISR aircraft on different cycles. And there's peaks and valleys in those cycles, and we're entering a valley with those 3 jobs this year and some more next year. But those customers are certainly going to procure more aircraft in the future, and we have insight to their procurement plans because we're very close to them. So by the time we get to the latter part of this decade, we expect to have new programs each driving growth in our international end market from those customers."

I guess, with the first 6 months, I have been spending most of the time on the road, as I mentioned, reviewing the strategies and the operations. What's unique about L-3 is, and it's somewhat tied to Ron's question, is the products that we focus on, whether it's the sensors or the communications, are really applicable to the new programs and then the upgrades of the existing programs. These platforms will not be of any value to our customers without secured communication and world-class sensors. And I think when I look at what we're most proud of, I think, on the communications front, the secured communications of data links and such is something we're known for, a lot of the EO/IR capabilities. And then in aerospace, the whole focus on ISR, I think, is a hot growth market. We've spent a lot of time looking at the various DoD initiatives, the focus of Secretary Carter, the communities of interest. And we're pretty well aligned with where the DoD government is focused, and that's where we've allocated our IRAD. And then I do not want to ignore the commercial aviation. I mean, that's a long-term growth business. And we believe, as Mike said, there's pilot shortages. We're one of the top training providers in the world, and a lot of our products are focused on security. And I think that positions us well.

Additionally, Chris mentioned that we're starting some new foreign government ISR work in his comments, and that's going to be a multiyear program for us. But the initial scope of work in the contract is mostly concerning aircraft and material procurement with some engineering, so that work carries lower margins at the front end.

Two of those are fixed, and 2 are within 30 days of being fixed. So we're confident that we're going to have a product that we understand and properly disclosed its specs. We think that we've made our best estimate of what needed to be reserved. We recorded that. Again, it's a voluntary program, which we all decided was something we wanted to do for our customers. We have a very loyal customer base, a great brand even in spite of this issue, and we're actually developing some new products that will be coming out later this year that are getting some very positive early reviews. So we made our best estimate, and next quarter, we'll give you an update on that. But again, I'll emphasize it's a voluntary program that we've decided to do, and we've already started to see a drop-off in the return rate. So we'll see how that plays out.

On your second question, you're right, the margins upside, I think, on the logistics Vertex business have a lot of potential. And even in the quarter, we've started to see some progress. I think once we made it clear that we were going to keep this business, we had about half of the executive team changed over and a new GM, a new CFO. And just last week, we were down in Mississippi, and we were impressed with the progress they've made. There's a long way to go, but the team is clearly motivated. And as Ralph said, we're hoping to get some news in the next couple of weeks on some big potential wins that would really help boost us. In ES, we felt, other than this EOTech reserve, we were on track for the year. And we're confident that that's one of our solid performing groups long term. We've talked about having 13% up to maybe 14% margin, and we don't see any change to that in the years ahead."

So that's just a timing item, and the $15 million increase to the products allowance was also a reduction of sales. That was part of the impact. In the aviation product and security sector, there's a mix change going on there, where, last year, we had some significant sales of our very high-margin airborne collision warning systems that were tied to a mandate that's essentially expired. So we're having less of those sales this year, and they're mostly software-oriented. But again, we expected that, so nothing unusual there. So as Chris said, excepting the products return allowance, Electronic Systems is on track with respect to its margin performance for this year, including the improvement that we expect to have next year when the margins should get to the 13% to 14% range for the whole sector -- segment, rather."

One, there is a life cycle replacement that we would expect on the original EDS machines or the automated bomb detection machines that were the first to go in, in the checked baggage line. Those are probably very close to end-of-life or requiring major overhaul, so I'd expect to see some form of upgrade program in the not-too-distant future. Last summer, we introduced a new product for the checkpoint that was known as ClearScan and is designed to hopefully make it a little bit easier to get through the checkpoint by not requiring liquids, for example, to be removed from bags since the machine can interrogate what liquids are in the bag without removing it. There are new technologies that could be added as well to provide further screening capabilities, such as the trace detection capability, which, right now, isn't done 100%. But you can imagine that technology could probably get built into the tunnels that are already processing bags rather than in the individual one-off examinations that are being conducted. Then, of course, you have some of the events -- the horrible events that have happened in Europe involving airports that suggest that the checkpoint may be at the start of the curve, if you will, or that there's other needs for secured -- additional security outside the terminal, perhaps. Certainly, a lot of questions being asked, and we're certainly thinking of a lot of ways we can help be part of the solution to those questions. And it's an active area both from an R&D standpoint, from a potential M&A standpoint because there are technologies that are available in the marketplace for us to evaluate. But as always, we'll be mindful on price. We do require acquisitions to have real economic returns for us, so we are very focused on what we're willing to pay. And we always have the ability to develop things on our own, too. Unfortunately, a lot of things in this market have been more event-driven than long-term strategy, and we have been working with our customers to try to shift that model to more of a long-term strategy and be proactive rather than being reactive all the time. So it's something that we're very engaged in lately, and I would expect some more activity in that area during the year. I mean, we'll be back to you on it."

We're very pleased with the first quarter, and I think I expect to see more of that. We just went through a question about pricing, I think, from Rich Safran. And really, a lot of that had to do with the margin improvement story that we've been working on, and a thorough analysis was done, many of the contracts in the logistics space as to why the margins were coming in low or coming in different than that which was originally bid. And some of the analysis showed that there are probably opportunities for further dialogue with customers, where the customer side of the equation was not meeting what the assumptions were in terms of flights hours or other metrics that didn't develop. So there was room for further adjustment there, and then I think it has made our people a little smarter about how they bid jobs, like some of these logistics jobs, where you could have deviations from some of the original assumptions that could have negative impacts on the margins going out. So it certainly has gotten people to focus on everything they do, whether it's how they manage their supply chain, how they manage their labor hours or how they manage the delivery side with the customer in terms of keeping their eye on the ball as it relates to margins. We like to know if we're not achieving what was bid, why, with a rational explanation. I think that we are getting a good response from the team on it.

And on that note, let me just make a few summary comments. 
First of all, we're off to a solid start in 2016. Our results reflect our focus on margin improvement as well as driving organic revenue growth. In spite of the unprecedented volatility in the geopolitical environment, we're identifying growth opportunities across major markets and executing well throughout the organization. Additionally, with more clarity in the defense budget and positive signs for growth in military spending, we're well positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities. 
I'd add that more now than I can remember in the past, there has been a very productive dialogue with the folks at The Pentagon, particularly the AT&L organization under Secretary Kendall, with the industry in terms of what their needs are and things that they would like us as industry to focus on. Because their desire, of course, is to get things for the war fighter quicker, cheaper and things that work out of the box. You've heard Secretary Carter mention the 5 areas of concern: Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, the war on terror. They're very focused on solving all those problems. They're all very challenging issues, and they have many initiatives they're working on. You've heard the term third offset strategy, so there's a lot going on in that area. And that dialogue is very important to keep industry focused on making the right investments in the right places so that, together, we and the war fighters are developing the systems that they need to deal with the current threat environment. 
So our focus has never been sharper than it is right now on R&D and how we spend it, and we're leveraging our expertise and working with our key partners to invest in and develop those technologies that strengthen our competitive profile and meet customer needs. 
Our agility and strong customer relationships are also differentiators that enable us to adapt quickly to evolving customer needs. 
Bottom line, we're very encouraged by the company's performance and the overall industry environment. We remain committed to delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. 
And let me just thank everyone for joining us this afternoon for the call. I know it's a busy day, and we look forward to speaking with you in July. So thank you."

I'm pleased to report that L-3 continues its positive momentum, demonstrating solid results and market progress in our key strategic initiatives. Our employees and business leaders did excellent work in the quarter, and we're proud of their performance. So I'd like to thank everyone for their dedication. As a result of their hardware, we had organic growth, margin expansion and cash generation in the quarter. 
I'd like to begin with an overview of the quarter and discuss our business with respect industry trends and the steps we are taking to continue delivering value to customers and shareholders. Chris will then discuss some of the details regarding our financial, our operational performance followed by Ralph's review the financials. 
Over the past year, we've pursued a disciplined growth strategy that concentrates on areas where we believe we can consistently win due to strong product offerings and past performance. 
For the second quarter, we reported net sales of $2.7 billion, an increase of 5% over the same period last year and improved margins. We recorded net cash from operations of $257 million for the quarter and funded orders were $2.1 billion while the book-to-bill ratio was 0.8, driven mainly by award timings and delays. And we expect we will have a book-to-bill ratio over 1 for our defense business this year. 
We continue to have success across L-3 and our new business personals. Chris will discuss this in more detail but I'd like to mention a few. We received several significant logistics support contracts, including significant wins on almost $2 billion for the KC-10 program and over $300 million for the U.S. Navy C-12 program. We are also successfully performing on the Navy's F/A-18 upgrade program we recently won. 
We also have some key international wins which Chris will take you through. As we pursue opportunities, we remain committed to leading the industry as an innovator and developing and delivering solutions that meet our customers' needs. 
Prioritizing growth and remaining an agile company have enabled us to capitalize on expansion opportunities and invest strategically in R&D and improve our market positions. We remain focused on areas where we have leading positions in the strongest potential for growth. This includes training and simulation, aviation products and our legacy work supporting a wide range of ISR platforms, unmanned systems equipment and secure communications, such as ROVER and Communication Systems for the Virginia class submarines. 
The U.S. building remains our largest end customer, constituting roughly 70% of our total sales. Following the decline over the last 5 years, the U.S. defense budget is beginning to trend upward, which is important to the growth of our business. We anticipate the DoD budget as a whole is heading towards low single-digit growth at a minimum. 
Given that both candidates in the upcoming election have expressed a strong commitment to national security, this is clearly a positive development for L-3, the industry and the nation. 
As I mentioned, we expect that we'll have a positive book-to-bill ratio for our defense business this year, meaning above 1. As you are aware, commercial aviation remains a growth market. Revenue from global traffic continues to outpace GDP as the market -- mature markets of North America and Europe recapitalize their fleets while many parts of the world like Asia and the Middle East continue to grow steadily. 
This continued robust demand for commercial airplanes has resulted in new regulations, demand for more pilots and technical upgrade requirements, all areas where L-3 products and technologies come into play like airport security and baggage detection, pilot training and avionics. 
International sales remain a focus for us and events in recent weeks have shown, the global threat level remains very high. International business, including military and commercial represented 24% of our sales last year and while the total addressable market appears flat through the remainder of 2016, we do see significant potential in emerging sectors to expand market share and increase our global footprint over the long term. 
There are opportunities to make headway with our competitively priced offerings, including our commercial training solutions, EO/IR sensors and night vision equipment, security and detection systems and our Communications Systems. 
Turning next to capital allocation. We remain committed to delivering value to shareholders and intelligently deploying capital when and where it supports the overall business strategy. Share repurchases and dividends are ongoing components of this strategy. We continue to maintain a healthy and efficient capital structure which provides us with the flexibility to invest in our business a lot of the symptom due to shareholders. We are also evaluating potential acquisitions that expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. We've heightened our focus on transactions that will strengthen our portfolio. 
As you've read in June, we welcome Heidi Wood to our newly created position of Vice President and Chief Analytics Officer and many of you know Heidi, I'm sure. Heidi brings to L-3 a wealth of industry and financial expertise and she's supporting both myself, Chris and Ralph and the rest of management team as we execute on our M&A and Investor Relations strategies and evaluate our portfolio as we continue improving the efficiency of our operations. 
We will continue to bolster our strong management with the talented people who have the expertise to help us take advantage of emerging opportunities within our industry. We're also prioritizing our R&D investments. This is an important part of our long-term strategy to ensure we remain competitive in the dynamic ever-changing and highly regulated industries in which we operate. 
In fact, we're investing more than 2.5% of our revenue in R&D this year. We also have several exciting products and new capabilities that are already in early development, such as the smaller form factor Siggins system, low-cost next-generation infrared search and track systems and our mission simulator, which will enable us to deliver scenario training at the mission level. 
Overall, we're pleased with our performance during the quarter. I'm confident that we're on the right track to achieve our goals. And with that, let me turn it over to Chris to give you some additional operational details. Go ahead, Chris."

We made great progress during the first half this year and we have the momentum to continue delivering results as we enter the second half. 
I've been here 9 months now and one of the things I've been most impressed by is the extent to which they L-3 culture is truly entrepreneurial, highly responsive and ready to take on change. We are collectively working well together and getting the better handle on areas requiring operational improvements as well as supporting new initiatives and increasing our focus on acquisitions. 
I'd like to gave you an update on what we've been doing recently to improve margins, refine our portfolio and enhance the focus on operational excellence. In Q2, we continue to challenge our existing structure as we look for opportunities to drive value for our customers and shareholders. 
We are realigning a number of facilities, downsizing the work for us and consolidating business units to enhance our competitive profile and position L-3 for future growth. 
With respect to portfolio shaping, we are in the final innings. We are divesting a few very small businesses that has largely completed our previously announced portfolio shaping phase. We are now focused on the next phase of our history, which is disciplined growth. In May, we announced the closure of our ultra devices facility in Santa Clara, California and will be transitioning those manufacturing operations to our facilities in Los Angeles and Pennsylvania. These actions will help reduce costs over the long run. 
In order to expand strategically into emerging markets, as a prime system integrator and a subsystem provider, we are aligning unmanned systems, space and navigation and Mustang technologies into a single business. This consolidation will also yield cost reductions through shared management and back office resources while optimizing our R&D. 
But we are investing for growth where it makes sense. So in May, we announced the plans to open a facility in Ottawa, Ontario that will accommodate a team of highly specialized engineers and a state-of-the-art lab. This will allow us to better develop and demonstrate future maritime communications for the Royal Canadian Navy submarine and surface fleets. 
With our M&A strategy, we have picked up the intensity a notch and are assessing the landscape to identify opportunities that would be a good strategic fit for L-3. As we've been saying, we are looking at about a dozen or so properties across all the markets we currently serve and we like the pipeline that we are seeing. We are sharpening our vision and looking for ways we can add new and proprietary capabilities to our portfolio. 
We continually evaluate prior deals and seek ways to maximize their value to the enterprise. Our last 4 acquisitions of [ph], CTC Aviation, Vortex and ATM have all enhanced our growth prospects and are performing at or above our business cases. 
Let me now turn to some of our new business wins. Let's start with defense. Although the book to bill ratio is low, we have several noteworthy wins across our defense businesses that reflect our strategy of growth through excellent program performance. For the U.S. Air Force, we won a key recompete towards warfighter readiness and training program. This is a 7-year contract to provide a wide range of advanced technologies to improve training effectiveness. We will also provide the Air Force and the Special Operations Command with a lifecycle product support and [ph] for our panoramic night vision goggles, our ultralight rangefinders and our fusion goggle systems. 
For the U.S. Navy, we received a follow-on contract for engineering services for the flight test and instrumentation systems in support of the Trident program, and we were selected to supply next-generation total rates for submarine. Our systems will provide an increased ASW capability and reliability suitable for an increasingly challenged undersea environment. 
Additionally, L-3 was 1 of 9 firms that earned a spot from the $1.7 billion ID/IQ contract to provide training services, systems and related support to the navy, the marine and FMS customers. And for the U.S. Coast Guard, we want to recompete to provide the integrated C4ISR system for the [indiscernible] class Fast Response Cutter. We've been performing work on this platform since 2009. 
In our commercial aviation products business, we received a contract to provide P-3 cat surveillance system to EasyJet [ph] A320 aircraft fleet. We continue to receive solid orders for our and it's the line of transponders for multiple U.S. airlines as they equip their fleet to meet the FAA's 2020 mandate. And we receive additional follow-on funding from the TSA for our meeting airport security products, which include passenger screeners as well as carry-on and checked baggage scanners. 
Demand is strong for our commercial training solutions business. Since quarter end, we have already received approximately $150 million in commitments for our aircraft Full Flight Simulators. We expect this will be contracted for in the third quarter, including an A320 simulator for [ph] in Japan. 
During Q2, we marked a few operational milestones that are worth noting. At the [ph] facilities, we inducted the first U.S. Coast Guard C-130J aircraft for a mission system upgrade. We also made key aircraft deliveries, including a fourth small cargo aircraft for Australia and C-130s with our upgraded avionics for the Air Force and an international customer under our foreign military sales. 
And finally, turning to international. Last week, Ralph and I visited our WESCAM business in Canada, which produces market-leading stabilizing cameras and imaging systems for the military and public safety customers. WESCAM recently received multiple orders for our [ph] larger optical and infrared systems for their international military customers. This latest order reaffirms the market interest in our MX line, which provides full motion intelligence range of high-altitude and ultra long-range missions. 
Lastly, we've been selected to deliver night vision goggles and capabilities to NATO member state special operations force. With this contract, there are now 5 NATO countries that have purchased L-3's fusion goggles. 
As we move into the third quarter, we will continue to respond quickly to market opportunities and capitalize on a steady demand environment. With the commitment to operational excellence and program performance, we look forward to continued progress in the months ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph."

I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. We have another constructive quarter, our second quarter was also better than we expected, primarily because of higher sales. Fre",1288,"Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. We have another constructive quarter, our second quarter was also better than we expected, primarily because of higher sales. Free cash flow was also very solid and while orders were lower than what we estimated, that was primarily due to awards timing, some delays and the fact that our quarter ended on June 24. 
Diluted earnings per share was $1.88, increasing 38% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.36 for the 2015 second quarter. The second quarter sales were almost $2.7 billion and grew 7% organically. Our U.S. Government sales, which are mostly to the Department of Defense, totaled $1.9 billion and grew 6% and their international commercial sales grew 11% to almost $800 million. 
Our second quarter sales growth rate was unusually high due to some timing items, including the procurement and delivery of 2 aircraft on a foreign ISR systems contract, which added about $90 million of sales to second quarter. We expect a lower sales growth rate in the second half because that is when most of the sales headwinds that we have this year versus 2015 happen. 
We previously discussed these negative year-over-year sales comparisons. They include a Aerospace Systems [ph] of our sales declines related to the Afghanistan drawdown and a 3 large international ISR Systems contracts, which are nearing completion. And in Communication Systems, they include the Australian MOD SATCOM terminals and the declining TWT power devices for commercial satellites. However, the key takeaway is that our sales [ph] outlook is improving and that's evidenced by our $150 million increase to our 2016 sales guidance which I'll cover in a few minutes.
Consolidated operating margin was 9.3% for the second quarter. Margins increased in all 3 segments, raising consolidated margin by 330 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The main reason for the large increase in margin was the $84 million of losses that we recorded in Aerospace Systems in the second quarter of 2015 on the head-of-state aircraft modification contracts. 
Electronic Systems operating margin was 12.2% for the second quarter and Communication Systems margin was 10.5%. Aerospace Systems margin was 6.1%, in line with a 6% type margins for the second, third and fourth quarters of the year, which we discussed on our first quarter earnings conference call. Free cash flow generation was also robust for the second quarter at $221 million. 
Moving on to our full year guidance update. We increased our earnings per share at the midpoint by $0.10 to $7.75. This increase is driven by higher sales and slightly lower tax rate, partially offset by more diluted shares outstanding. The diluted EPS guidance midpoint is a 12% increase compared to 2015's adjusted diluted EPS of $6.91. 
We increased consolidated sales guidance by $150 million to $10.2 billion at the midpoint and that [ph] to an organic sales decline of about 1%. We expect our U.S. Government sales that now grow 1% organically versus 2015. This compares favorably to our prior guidance, which estimated a 2% decline for our U.S. Government sales. Our updated sales guidance also projects commercial to now grow at about 3% and international sales to decline 13% versus 2015. 
At the segment level, we increased Aerospace Systems sales by $150 million and Communication Systems by $50 million, with both of these increases due to stronger U.S. Department of Defense market. Lower Electronic Systems sales by $50 million due to softer sales in 2 niche commercial markets. These are, 1, our holographic weapon sights we sell into the sport and recreation market; and 2, a new transporter that we introduced last year for the general aviation market where the sales are developing at a slower rate than we planned. 
Our updated Aerospace Systems guidance does not add any sales for the U.S. Air Force KC-10 tanker sustainment contract that Vertex Aerospace won in early June because our award is being protested by competitor. Moreover, our KC-10 work will not begin in earnest until January of 2017 either before considering the delay cost by the protest. We expect that this contract will have annual sales of about $200 million and that's obviously conditioned on our award being upheld. 
We maintained consolidated operating margin guidance of 9.8% and segment margin guidance was also unchanged. I'd like to elaborate on a couple of point about our margin guidance update. First, in Electronic Systems, there's upside in the second half to margin and top operating income but that could be offset by downside risk that remains in the holographic weapon sights. Second, while communications systems margin was not changed, we now expect higher margin for both broadband communication systems and advanced communications, driven by better contract performance and labor productivity. 
These improvements are being offset by an initial $6 million of severance and restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our traveling wave 2 or TWT power device businesses in California that Chris talked about. That businesses consolidation is a complex multiyear project. We expect that they will incur additional larger restructuring costs in 2017 and by 2018, we will complete the consolidation and at that time, we expect to begin to generate annual pretax savings of about $9 million from the consolidation. 
Our free cash flow estimate stays at $825 million for the full year. With respect to the book-to-bill ratio, second quarter orders were about $250 million below our estimate. This was primarily due to timing. For example, as Chris mentioned a few minutes ago, during his comments, last week, we received orders for its several new simulation and training devices worth about $150 million. I will add that it's common and abnormal to have orders timing volatility among the quarters. Secondarily, our international ISR Systems order is trailing what we planned with several pursuits sliding into 2017 were not materializing. That said, with the increases we currently see in Electronic Systems and Communication Systems, we remain on track to achieve our full year consolidated book-to-bill ratio of at least 1.0 and that's even after raising our sales guidance by $150 million. 
Regarding capital allocation for this year, while it's the same as our prior guidance, we deliberately slowed the pace of share repurchases because we expect to shift some cash deployment acquisitions in the second half of this year. We still expect to end this year with a cash balance of about $300 million. 
Looking at the third quarter outlook, we presently expect sales in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, which will calculate to organic growth that's about flat. Margin should be in the low 9% range with diluted earnings per share between $1.75 and $1.85. Free cash flow should be in the $100 million to $200 million range with a book-to-bill ratio of about 1.0. 
A couple of other things regarding the third quarter. I want to remind you that we presently expect our 2016 third quarter operating margin and EPS to decline compared to 2015's third quarter. In 2015, our highest quarterly margin occurred in the third quarter at 10.7% and that was due to abnormally high margin in Aerospace Systems. And if you recall, what happened there was that we had significant risk retirements on international ISR contracts that are nearing completion and in fact declining this year, and we talked about that. Also last year's third quarter, we had an $8 million [ph] recovery on our previous Army C-12 contract.

Readiness has become a critically important area for our customers and it's an area where they used to having L-3 as a player, as a good player in that space and that is evidenced by some of the substantial wins in the quarter. And the fact that, that the printer in what the margin might be is lower than we would like, it does provide operating leverage for that entire business because of the absorption in that group as well as for all of L-3. Those consumer grew relationships are invaluable in terms of operating leverage for pulling our products through, it does present us with opportunities where we might be able to cross-sell avionics, heavy maintenance, whether it's engine work or whatever in our facility and the like. So having more business is a good thing. We are working with our customers to change some of the dynamics of the margin model where we can and I had expressed some serious concerns with customers about where margins are and our ability to continue in this space. And I was assured that customers were willing to listen and help us address that. So I know Chris spend some time on this too. This is a debate we have regularly, but we're on all the same page.

We're looking for is some product that can enhance our existing business and then there's occasions where we actually get access to win customer. So it's a pretty obvious process we focus first and foremost on the strategic fit and does last week, Mike and Ralph and I are going for the list and like I said, about a dozen of these perhaps strategic Kerguelen that we are going to the next phase of making offers and starting due diligence and working to the finance side. So was Ralph said would love to do a couple the second half of the year we're not going to do a bad deal just to say we did 1. But I kind of like our position and some of these given our reputation of doing over 100 acquisitions, a lot of people come to us on a proprietary basis because they like the model, they like the culture and the like the opportunity be part of a bigger company.

BUt in addition, just the type of technology that would traditionally be nurtured in commercial environment. As you've read, the DoD has done something in the Silicon Valley. Now they have moved up here in the Northeast in MIT.

As I said during my comments, we're working on smaller form factors for [ph] Systems, some low-cost next-generation infrared search and tracking systems as well as our mission simulator which will enable us to bring the warfighter training at the mission level. Now a lot of these technology is dependent on video graphics and things like that as well as the expertise we bring and we've really found a great partner to help us in this area. It's a mutual relationship of course, but it's working very well and we've made this as a resource available, of course, the company, through our group presidents were they can tap into it and bring it into their R&D programs as needed. And I see it really bearing fruit in the future for us where it's differentiating the things that L-3 is doing. And I think we're 1 of -- I haven't heard anybody else thinking this kind of a step-up than maybe in 1 other occasion.

So with that, thanks very much for joining us this morning. We had what I would characterize as another strong quarter, and we continue that's we intend to continue to build on this progress. As we've discussed, we are pursuing a three-pronged approach to drive growth and enhance profitability. First, we want to achieve more organic growth and are working closely with our business development organization to better leverage our investments in R&D as well as approaching proposals, teaming agreements and making sure that we engage in the best win strategy we can think of. Second, we are active in scouting out potential acquisitions to broaden our customer offerings and has our long-term strategic positioning. We'll continue to take a disciplined approach as you've seen us do in the past but will like having a healthy pipeline of candidates to look at and we're seeing that now. And third, with respect to cost control, we're tightening operations as you've heard, we're consolidating where it makes sense, and we're engaging in other cost-reduction activities to help with the margin story. Our program execution remains a strong and consistent, and we're focused on opportunities in our commercial training solutions business, EO/IR in additional markets, which will be part of our growth story going forward. Steps we've taken to show positive results and overall, we're well positioned to achieve future growth and deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders.

I'm pleased to report that L-3 continues its positive momentum, demonstrating solid results and marked progress on our key strategic initiatives. Our employees and business leaders did excellent work in the quarter, and we're proud of their performance. So I'd like to thank everyone for their dedication. As a result of their hard work, we had organic growth, margin expansion and cash generation in the quarter. 
I'd like to begin with an overview of the quarter and discuss our business with respect to industry trends and the steps we are taking to continue delivering value to customers and shareholders. Chris will then discuss some of the details regarding our financial -- our operational performance, followed by Ralph's review of the financials. 
Over the past year, we've pursued a disciplined growth strategy that concentrates on areas where we believe we can consistently win due to strong product offerings and past performance. 
For the second quarter, we reported net sales of $2.7 billion, an increase of 5% over the same period last year and improved margins. We recorded net cash from operations of $257 million for the quarter and funded orders were $2.1 billion, while the book-to-bill ratio was 0.8, driven mainly by award timings and delays. And we expect that we will have a book-to-bill ratio over 1 for our defense business this year. 
We continue to have success across L-3 and our new business pursuits. Chris will discuss these in more detail, but I'd like to mention a few. We received several significant logistic support contracts, including significant wins on almost $2 billion for the KC-10 program and over $300 million for the U.S. Navy C-12 program. We are also successfully performing on the Navy's F/A-18 depot upgrade program we recently won. 
We also have some key international wins, which Chris will take you through. As we pursue opportunities, we remain committed to leading the industry as an innovator and developing and delivering solutions that meet our customers' needs. 
Prioritizing growth and remaining an agile company have enabled us to capitalize on expansion opportunities, invest strategically in R&D and improve our market positions. We remain focused on areas where we have leading positions and the strongest potential for growth. This includes training and simulation, aviation products and our legacy work supporting a wide range of ISR platforms, unmanned systems equipment and secure communications, such as ROVER and Communication Systems for the Virginia class submarines. 
The U.S. DoD remains our largest end customer, constituting roughly 70% of our total sales. Following the decline over the past 5 years, the U.S. defense budget is beginning to trend upward, which is important to the growth of our business. We anticipate the DoD budget, as a whole, is heading towards low single-digit growth at a minimum. 
Given that both candidates in the upcoming election have expressed a strong commitment to national security, this is clearly a positive development for L-3, the industry and the nation. 
As I mentioned, we expect that we'll have a positive book-to-bill ratio for our defense business this year, meaning above 1. As you are aware, commercial aviation remains a growth market. Revenue from global traffic continues to outpace GDP, as the market -- mature markets of North America and Europe recapitalized their fleets, while many parts of the world like Asia and the Middle East continue to grow steadily. 
This continued robust demand for commercial airplanes is resulting in new regulations, demand for more pilots and technical upgrade requirements, all areas where L-3 products and technologies come into play, like airport security and baggage detection, pilot training and avionics. 
International sales remain a focus for us, and as events in recent weeks have shown, the global threat level remains very high. International business, including military and commercial, represented 24% of our sales last year. And while the total addressable market appears flat for the remainder of 2016, we do see significant potential in emerging sectors to expand market share and increase our global footprint over the long term. 
There are opportunities to make headway with our competitively priced offerings, including our commercial training solutions, EO/IR sensors and night vision equipment, security and detection systems and our Communications Systems. 
Turning next to capital allocation. We remain committed to delivering value to shareholders and intelligently deploying capital when and where it supports the overall business strategy. Share repurchases and dividends are ongoing components of this strategy. We continue to maintain a healthy and efficient capital structure, which provides us with the flexibility to invest in our business, while at the same time returning capital to shareholders. We are also evaluating potential acquisitions that expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. We've heightened our focus on transactions that will strengthen our portfolio. 
As you've read in June, we welcomed Heidi Wood to our newly created position of Vice President and Chief Analytics Officer, and many of you know Heidi, I'm sure. Heidi brings to L-3 a wealth of industry and financial expertise, and she's supporting both myself, Chris and Ralph and the rest of our leadership team as we execute on our M&A and Investor Relations strategies and evaluate our portfolio as we continue improving the efficiency of our operations. 
We will continue to bolster our strong management team with talented people who have the expertise to help us take advantage of emerging opportunities within our industry. We're also prioritizing our R&D investments. This is an important part of our long-term strategy to ensure we remain competitive in the dynamic, ever-changing and highly regulated industries in which we operate. In fact, we're investing more than 2.5% of our revenue in R&D this year. 
We also have several exciting products and new capabilities that are already in early development, such as the smaller form factor SIGINT Systems, low-cost next-generation infrared search and track systems and our mission simulator, which will enable us to deliver scenario training at the mission level. 
Overall, we're pleased with our performance during the quarter. I'm confident that we're on the right track to achieve our goals. And with that, let me turn it over to Chris to give you some additional operational details. Go ahead, Chris."

We made great progress during the first half of this year, and we have the momentum to continue delivering results as we enter the second half. I've been here 9 months now, and",1049,"Okay. Thank you, Mike, and good morning. First, let me echo Mike's comments. We made great progress during the first half of this year, and we have the momentum to continue delivering results as we enter the second half. 
I've been here 9 months now, and one of the things I've been most impressed by is the extent to which the L-3 culture is truly entrepreneurial, highly responsive and ready to take on change. We are collectively working well together and getting the better handle on areas requiring operational improvements as well as supporting new initiatives and increasing our focus on acquisitions. 
I'd like to give you an update on what we've been doing recently to improve margins, refine our portfolio and enhance the focus on operational excellence. In Q2, we continue to challenge our existing structure as we look for opportunities to drive value for our customers and shareholders. 
We are realigning a number of facilities, downsizing the work for us and consolidating business units to enhance our competitive profile and position L-3 for future growth. 
With respect to portfolio shaping, we are in the final innings. We are divesting a few very small businesses that has largely completed our previously announced portfolio shaping phase. We are now focused on the next phase of our history, which is disciplined growth. In May, we announced the closure of our electron devices facility in San Carlos, California and will be transitioning those manufacturing operations to our facilities in Los Angeles and Pennsylvania. These actions will help reduce costs over the long run. 
In order to expand strategically into emerging markets, as a prime system integrator and a subsystem provider, we are aligning unmanned systems, space and navigation and Mustang technologies into a single business. This consolidation will also yield cost reductions through shared management and back office resources while optimizing our R&D. 
But we are investing for growth where it makes sense. So in May, we announced the plans to open a facility in Ottawa, Ontario that will accommodate a team of highly specialized engineers and a state-of-the-art lab. This will allow us to better develop and demonstrate future maritime communications for the Royal Canadian Navy submarine and surface fleets. 
With our M&A strategy, we have picked up the intensity a notch and are assessing the landscape to identify opportunities that would be a good strategic fit for L-3. As we've been saying, we are looking at about a dozen or so properties across all the markets we currently serve, and we like the pipeline that we are seeing. We are sharpening our vision and looking for ways we can add new and proprietary capabilities to our portfolio. 
We continually evaluate prior deals and seek ways to maximize their value to the enterprise. Our last 4 acquisitions of MITEQ, CTC Aviation, Vertex and ATM have all enhanced our growth prospects and are performing at or above our business cases. 
Let me now turn to some of our new business wins. Let's start with defense. Although the book-to-bill ratio is low, we have several noteworthy wins across our defense businesses that reflect our strategy of growth through excellent program performance. For the U.S. Air Force, we won a key recompete towards warfighter readiness and training program. This is a 7-year contract to provide a wide range of advanced technologies to improve training effectiveness. We will also provide the Air Force and the Special Operations Command with a life-cycle product support and spares for our panoramic night vision goggles, our ultralight rangefinders and our fusion goggle systems. 
For the U.S. Navy, we've received a follow-on contract for engineering services for the flight test instrumentation systems in support of the Trident program, and we were selected to supply next-generation towed-arrays for submarine. Our systems will provide an increased ASW capability and reliability suitable for an increasingly challenged undersea environment. 
Additionally, L-3 was 1 of 9 firms that earned a spot on the $1.7 billion ID/IQ contract to provide training services, systems and related support to The Navy, The Marine and FMS customers. And for the U.S. Coast Guard, we want to recompete to provide the integrated C4ISR system for the Sentinel-class Fast Response Cutter. We've been performing work on this platform since 2009. 
In our commercial Aviation Products business, we received a contract to provide T3 CAT surveillance systems to easyJet for A320 aircraft fleet. We continue to receive solid orders for our NXT line of transponders for multiple U.S. airlines, as they equip their fleet to meet the FAA's 2020 mandate. And we received additional follow-on funding from the TSA for our leading airport security products, which include passenger screeners as well as carry-on and checked baggage scanners. 
Demand is strong for our commercial training solutions business. Since quarter end, we have already received approximately $150 million in commitments for our aircraft Full Flight Simulators. We expect these will be contracted for in the third quarter, including an A320 simulator for A&A in Japan. 
During Q2, we marked a few operational milestones that are worth noting. At our Waco facilities, we inducted the first U.S. Coast Guard C-130J aircraft for a mission systems upgrade. We also made key aircraft deliveries, including a fourth small cargo aircraft for Australia and C-130s with upgraded avionics for the Air Force and an international customer under our foreign military sales. 
And finally, turning to international. Last week, Ralph and I visited our WESCAM business in Canada, which produces market-leading stabilizing cameras and imaging systems for the military and public safety customers. WESCAM recently received multiple orders for our MX Electro-Optical and Infrared systems for the international military customers. This latest order reaffirms the market interest in our MX line, which provides full motion intelligence for a range of high-altitude and ultra-long-range missions. 
Lastly, we've been selected to deliver night vision goggles and capabilities to a NATO member state special operations force. With this contract, there are now 5 NATO countries that have purchased L-3's fusion goggles. 
As we move into the third quarter, we will continue to respond quickly to market opportunities and capitalize on a steady demand environment. With the commitment to operational excellence and program performance, we look forward to continued progress in the months ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph."
93538,372081720,1015846,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. We had another constructive quarter. Our second quarter was also better than we expected, primarily because of higher sales. Free",1297,"Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. We had another constructive quarter. Our second quarter was also better than we expected, primarily because of higher sales. Free cash flow was also very solid. And while orders were lower than what we estimated, that was primarily due to award timing, some delays and the fact that our quarter ended on June 24. 
Diluted earnings per share was $1.88, increasing 38% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.36 for the 2015 second quarter. The second quarter sales were almost $2.7 billion and grew 7% organically. Our U.S. Government sales, which are mostly to the Department of Defense, totaled $1.9 billion and grew 6%, and their international commercial sales grew 11% to almost $800 million. 
Our second quarter sales growth rate was unusually high due to some timing items, including the procurement and delivery of 2 aircraft on a foreign ISR systems contract, which added about $90 million of sales to second quarter. We expect a lower sales growth rate in the second half, because that is when most of the sales headwinds that we have this year versus 2015 happen. 
We previously discussed these negative year-over-year sales comparisons. They include an Aerospace Systems' the final runoff of our sales declines related to the Afghanistan drawdown and the 3 large international ISR Systems contracts, which are nearing completion. And in Communication Systems, they include the Australian MoD SATCOM terminals and the declining TWT power devices for commercial satellites. However, the key takeaway is that our sales growth outlook is improving, and that's evidenced by our $150 million increase to our 2016 sales guidance, which I'll cover in a few minutes.
Consolidated operating margin was 9.3% for the second quarter. Margins increased in all 3 segments, raising consolidated margin by 330 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The main reason for the large increase in margin was the $84 million of losses that we recorded in Aerospace Systems in the second quarter of 2015 on the head-of-state aircraft modification contracts. 
Electronic Systems operating margin was 12.2% for the second quarter and Communication Systems margin was 10.5%. Aerospace Systems margin was 6.1%, in line with a 6% type margin for the second, third and fourth quarters of the year, which we discussed on our first quarter earnings conference call. Free cash flow generation was also robust for the second quarter, at $221 million. 
Moving on to our full year guidance update. We increased earnings per share at the midpoint by $0.10 to $7.75. This increase is driven by higher sales and a slightly lower tax rate, partially offset by more diluted shares outstanding. The diluted EPS guidance midpoint is a 12% increase compared to 2015's adjusted diluted EPS of $6.91. 
We increased consolidated sales guidance by $150 million to $10.2 billion at the midpoint and that calculates to an organic sales decline of about 1%. We expect our U.S. Government sales to now grow 1% organically versus 2015. This compares favorably to our prior guidance, which estimated a 2% decline for our U.S. Government sales. Our updated sales guidance also projects commercial to now grow at about 3% and international sales to decline 13% versus 2015. 
At the segment level, we increased Aerospace Systems sales by $150 million and Communication Systems sales by $50 million, with both of these increases due to a stronger U.S. Department of Defense market. Lower Electronic Systems sales by $50 million due to softer sales in 2 niche commercial markets. These are, one, our holographic weapon sights that we sell into the sporting and recreation market; and two, a new transponder that we introduced last year for the general aviation market where the sales are developing at a slower rate than we planned. 
Our updated Aerospace Systems guidance does not add any sales for the U.S. Air Force KC-10 tanker sustainment contract that Vertex Aerospace won in early June, because our award has been protested by a competitor. Moreover, our KC-10 work will not begin in earnest until January of 2017, either before considering the delay caused by the protest. We'd expect that this contract will have annual sales of about $200 million and that's obviously conditioned on our award being upheld. 
We maintained consolidated operating margin guidance of 9.8%, and segment margin guidance was also unchanged. I'd like to elaborate on a couple of points about our margin guidance update. First, in Electronic Systems, there's upside in the second half to margin and to operating income, but that could be offset by downside risk that remains in the holographic weapon sights. Second, while communications systems margin was not changed, we now expect higher margin for both broadband communication systems and advanced communications, driven by better contract performance and labor productivity. 
These improvements are being offset by an initial $6 million of severance and restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our Traveling Wave Tube, or TWT, power device businesses in California that Chris talked about. That businesses consolidation is a complex multiyear project. We expect that we will incur additional larger restructuring costs in 2017. And by 2018, we will complete the consolidation, and at that time, we expect to begin to generate annual pretax savings of about $9 million from the consolidation. 
Our free cash flow estimate stays at $825 million for the full year. With respect to the book-to-bill ratio, second quarter orders were about $250 million below our estimate. This was primarily due to timing. For example, as Chris mentioned a few minutes ago during his comments, last week, we received orders for several new simulation and training devices worth about $150 million. I will add that it's common and normal to have orders timing volatility among the quarters. Secondarily, our international ISR Systems orders are trailing what we planned, with several pursuits sliding to 2017 or not materializing. That said, with the increases that we currently see in Electronic Systems and Communication Systems, we remain on track to achieve our full year consolidated book-to-bill ratio of at least 1.0, and that's even after raising our sales guidance by $150 million. 
Regarding capital allocation for this year, while it's the same as our prior guidance, we've deliberately slowed the pace of share repurchases, because we expect to shift some cash deployment acquisitions in the second half of this year. We still expect to end this year with a cash balance of about $300 million. 
Looking at the third quarter outlook, we presently expect sales in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, which will calculate to organic growth that's about flat. Margin should be in the low 9% range with diluted earnings per share between $1.75 and $1.85. Free cash flow should be in the $100 million to $200 million range, with a book-to-bill ratio of about 1.0. 
A couple of other things regarding the third quarter. I want to remind you that we presently expect our 2016 third quarter operating margin and EPS to decline compared to 2015's third quarter. In 2015, our highest quarterly margin occurred in the third quarter at 10.7% and that was due to abnormally high margin in Aerospace Systems. And if you recall, what happened there was that we had significant risk retirements on 3 large international ISR contracts that are nearing completion, and in fact, declining this year, and we've talked about that. Also last year's third quarter, we had an $8 million REA profit recovery on our previous Army C-12 contract. 
So to conclude my financial review, the company continues to make progress. Contract performance is solid. We are increasing margins, and our orders and sales trends are improving. 
Thank you. We'll now begin the Q&A."

Noah -- yes, sure. Your assumptions are correct. However, looking forward, and as you could have heard from the testimony of some of the service chiefs on readiness, readiness has become a critically important area for our customers and it's an area where they used to having L-3 as a player, as a good player in that space, and that is evidenced by some of the substantial wins in the quarter. And the fact that the print-on what the margin might be is lower than we would like, it does provide operating leverage for that entire business because of the absorption in that group as well as for all of L-3. Those customer relationships are invaluable and in terms of operating leverage for pulling our products through, it does present us with opportunities where we might be able to cross-sell avionics, heavy maintenance, whether it's engine work or whatever in our Waco facility and the like. So -- I mean, having more business is a good thing. We are working with our customers to change some of the dynamics of the margin model, where we can, and I had expressed some serious concerns with customers about where margins are and our ability to continue in this space. And I was assured that customers were willing to listen and help us address that. So I know Chris had spent some time on this, too. This is a debate we have regularly, but we're all on the same page.

We'll go through that process, but with over $2 billion of awards, we have to be booked and finalized, we feel pretty good. The customer dynamics are changing. We've talked about the shift from the LPTA to the best value model. I think, that's going to give us some opportunities. Margins are important, and we've talked about our need to increase those, but we also like to look at the ROIC and many of these programs do not have a lot of capital intensity. So when we balance the return on invested capital with the margins, we think we're creating value for the corporation. So there's still work to be done in Vertex. We're not done fixing it, but this win and given our large aircraft capabilities, such as KC-135, we're comfortable with our ability to satisfactorily perform on KC-10. And then, I'm sure we'll talk more about things like Fort Rucker and Army C-12 and [indiscernible], 3 large opportunities that will be coming up late '17, '18. And we like our positioning.

Obviously, I'm more comfortable with the lower end, and that is a nice increase to this year's margin guidance, which stands at 12.1%. Within Communications Systems, the margin targets that we articulated for next year are between 10% and 11%. Our midpoint guidance for 2016 is 10.4%. So I think we're going to be closer to the high end of that range for 2017. And then lastly, within commercial -- within Aerospace Systems, we said the target range for margins is in the high single-digit area, which is 7%, 8% or 9%.

The second item is that we're involved in class action lawsuit litigation on the holographic weapon sights, and we have valid defenses, and we're vigorously defending ourselves and we're presently scheduled to go to mediation in August to try and settle that litigation. But obviously, litigation is inherently risky, and we're not sure -- we can't predict if we are going to be able to settle those items and what the ultimate outcome will be. So those are the items on the holographic weapon sights, Rich."

Actually, I'm glad you asked that question, Miles, because the targets that I just discussed for 2017 do not factor in any pension expense assumption changes. So we're not going to set the assumptions for next year's pension expense until we get to December 31, because that's our measurement date. But the way things are trending in the interest rate markets year-to-date, we're looking at a meaningful reduction in the discount rate for the pension expense assumptions somewhere in the 90-basis-point range. And the 90 basis points breaks down to between a nearly 70-basis-point reduction in the 10-year treasury yield since the end of last year and another 20 basis points reduction due to the overall tightening of credit spreads and the investment-grade market. So that 90 basis points reduction, if it holds, would translate into about a $45 million increase to pension expense for 2017 versus this year, on a pretax basis."

But in addition, just the type of technology that would traditionally be nurtured in a commercial environment. As you've read, the DoD has done something in the Silicon Valley. Now they've moved -- hoping to move this up here in the northeast, near MIT.

Now a lot of these technology is dependent on video graphics and things like that as well as the expertise we bring, and we've really found a great partner to help us in this area. It's a mutual relationship, of course, but it's working very well. And we've made this as a resource available, of course, the company, to our group presidents, where they can tap into it and bring it into their R&D programs as needed. And I see it really bearing fruit in the future for us, where it's differentiating the things that L-3 is doing.

So with that, thanks very much for joining us this morning. We had what I would characterize as another strong quarter, and we continue -- we intend to continue to build on this progress. As we've discussed, we are pursuing a 3-pronged approach to drive growth and enhance profitability. First, we want to achieve more organic growth and are working closely with our business development organization to better leverage our investments in R&D as well as approaching proposals, teaming agreements and making sure that we engage in the best win strategies that we can think of. Second, we are active in scouting out potential acquisitions to broaden our customer offerings and enhance our long-term strategic positioning. We'll continue to take a disciplined approach, as you've seen us do in the past, but we like having a healthy pipeline of candidates to look at and we're seeing that now. And third, with respect to cost control, we're tightening operations, as you've heard, we're consolidating where it makes sense, and we're engaging in other cost-reduction activities to help with the margin story. Our program execution remains strong and consistent, and we're focused on opportunities in our commercial training solutions business, EO/IR and additional markets, which will be part of our growth story going forward. The steps we've taken to showing positive results, and overall, we're well positioned to achieve future growth and deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders. 
So once again, thanks for joining us. Everybody, enjoy the rest of the summer. And we look forward to speaking with you again in October. Thank you."

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that L-3 continues its positive momentum, demonstrating solid results and marked progress on our key strategic initiatives. Our employees and business leaders did excellent work in the qu",1040,"Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that L-3 continues its positive momentum, demonstrating solid results and marked progress on our key strategic initiatives. Our employees and business leaders did excellent work in the quarter, and we're proud of their performance. So I'd like to thank everyone for their dedication. As a result of their hard work, we had organic growth, margin expansion and cash generation in the quarter. 
I'd like to begin with an overview of the quarter and discuss our business with respect to industry trends and the steps we are taking to continue delivering value to customers and shareholders. Chris will then discuss some of the details regarding our financial -- our operational performance, followed by Ralph's review of the financials. 
Over the past year, we've pursued a disciplined growth strategy that concentrates on areas where we believe we can consistently win due to strong product offerings and past performance. 
For the second quarter, we reported net sales of $2.7 billion, an increase of 5% over the same period last year and improved margins. We recorded net cash from operations of $257 million for the quarter and funded orders were $2.1 billion, while the book-to-bill ratio was 0.8, driven mainly by award timings and delays. And we expect that we will have a book-to-bill ratio over 1 for our defense business this year. 
We continue to have success across L-3 in our new business pursuits. Chris will discuss these in more detail, but I'd like to mention a few. We received several significant logistic support contracts, including significant wins on almost $2 billion for the KC-10 program and over $300 million for the U.S. Navy C-12 program. We are also successfully performing on the Navy's F/A-18 depot upgrade program we recently won. 
We also have some key international wins, which Chris will take you through. As we pursue opportunities, we remain committed to leading the industry as an innovator and developing and delivering solutions that meet our customers' needs. 
Prioritizing growth and remaining an agile company have enabled us to capitalize on expansion opportunities, invest strategically in R&D and improve our market positions. We remain focused on areas where we have leading positions and the strongest potential for growth. This includes training and simulation, aviation products and our legacy work supporting a wide range of ISR platforms, unmanned systems equipment and secure communications, such as ROVER and Communication Systems for the Virginia class submarines. 
The U.S. DoD remains our largest end customer, constituting roughly 70% of our total sales. Following the decline over the past 5 years, the U.S. defense budget is beginning to trend upward, which is important to the growth of our business. We anticipate the DoD budget, as a whole, is heading towards low single-digit growth at a minimum. 
Given that both candidates in the upcoming election have expressed a strong commitment to national security, this is clearly a positive development for L-3, the industry and the nation. 
As I mentioned, we expect that we'll have a positive book-to-bill ratio for our defense business this year, meaning above 1. As you are aware, commercial aviation remains a growth market. Revenue from global traffic continues to outpace GDP, as the market -- mature markets of North America and Europe recapitalized their fleets, while many parts of the world like Asia and the Middle East continue to grow steadily. 
This continued robust demand for commercial airplanes is resulting in new regulations, demand for more pilots and technical upgrade requirements, all areas where L-3 products and technologies come into play, like airport security and baggage detection, pilot training and avionics. 
International sales remain a focus for us, and as events in recent weeks have shown, the global threat level remains very high. International business, including military and commercial, represented 24% of our sales last year. And while the total addressable market appears flat for the remainder of 2016, we do see significant potential in emerging sectors to expand market share and increase our global footprint over the long term. 
There are opportunities to make headway with our competitively priced offerings, including our commercial training solutions, EO/IR sensors and night vision equipment, security and detection systems and our Communications Systems. 
Turning next to capital allocation. We remain committed to delivering value to shareholders and intelligently deploying capital when and where it supports the overall business strategy. Share repurchases and dividends are ongoing components of this strategy. We continue to maintain a healthy and efficient capital structure, which provides us with the flexibility to invest in our business, while at the same time returning capital to shareholders. We are also evaluating potential acquisitions that expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. We've heightened our focus on transactions that will strengthen our portfolio. 
As you've read in June, we welcomed Heidi Wood to our newly created position of Vice President and Chief Analytics Officer, and many of you know Heidi, I'm sure. Heidi brings to L-3 a wealth of industry and financial expertise, and she's supporting both myself, Chris and Ralph and the rest of our leadership team as we execute on our M&A and Investor Relations strategies and evaluate our portfolio as we continue improving the efficiency of our operations. 
We will continue to bolster our strong management team with talented people who have the expertise to help us take advantage of emerging opportunities within our industry. We're also prioritizing our R&D investments. This is an important part of our long-term strategy to ensure we remain competitive in the dynamic, ever-changing and highly regulated industries in which we operate. In fact, we're investing more than 2.5% of our revenue in R&D this year. 
We also have several exciting products and new capabilities that are already in early development, such as the smaller form factor SIGINT Systems, low-cost next-generation infrared search and track systems and our mission simulator, which will enable us to deliver scenario training at the mission level. 
Overall, we're pleased with our performance during the quarter. I'm confident that we're on the right track to achieve our goals. And with that, let me turn it over to Chris to give you some additional operational details. Go ahead, Chris."

We made great progress during the first half of this year, and we have the momentum to continue delivering results as we enter the second half. I've been here 9 months now, and",1048,"Okay. Thank you, Mike, and good morning. First, let me echo Mike's comments. We made great progress during the first half of this year, and we have the momentum to continue delivering results as we enter the second half. 
I've been here 9 months now, and one of the things I've been most impressed by is the extent to which the L-3 culture is truly entrepreneurial, highly responsive and ready to take on change. We are collectively working well together and getting the better handle on areas requiring operational improvements as well as supporting new initiatives and increasing our focus on acquisitions. 
I'd like to give you an update on what we've been doing recently to improve margins, refine our portfolio and enhance the focus on operational excellence. In Q2, we continue to challenge our existing structure as we look for opportunities to drive value for our customers and shareholders. 
We are realigning a number of facilities, downsizing the workforce and consolidating business units to enhance our competitive profile and position L-3 for future growth. 
With respect to portfolio shaping, we are in the final innings. We are divesting a few very small businesses that have largely completed our previously announced portfolio shaping phase. We are now focused on the next phase of our history, which is disciplined growth. In May, we announced the closure of our electron devices facility in San Carlos, California and will be transitioning those manufacturing operations to our facilities in Los Angeles and Pennsylvania. These actions will help reduce costs over the long run. 
In order to expand strategically into emerging markets, as a prime system integrator and a subsystem provider, we are aligning unmanned systems, space and navigation and Mustang technologies into a single business. This consolidation will also yield cost reductions through shared management and back office resources while optimizing our R&D. 
But we are investing for growth where it makes sense. So in May, we announced the plans to open a facility in Ottawa, Ontario that will accommodate a team of highly specialized engineers and a state-of-the-art lab. This will allow us to better develop and demonstrate future maritime communications for the Royal Canadian Navy submarine and surface fleets. 
With our M&A strategy, we have kicked up the intensity a notch and are assessing the landscape to identify opportunities that would be a good strategic fit for L-3. As we've been saying, we are looking at about a dozen or so properties across all the markets we currently serve, and we like the pipeline that we are seeing. We are sharpening our vision and looking for ways we can add new and proprietary capabilities to our portfolio. 
We continually evaluate prior deals and seek ways to maximize their value to the enterprise. Our last 4 acquisitions of MITEQ, CTC Aviation, Vertex and ATM have all enhanced our growth prospects and are performing at or above our business cases. 
Let me now turn to some of our new business wins. Let's start with defense. Although the book-to-bill ratio is low, we have several noteworthy wins across our defense businesses that reflect our strategy of growth through excellent program performance. For the U.S. Air Force, we won a key recompete towards warfighter readiness and training programs. This is a 7-year contract to provide a wide range of advanced technologies to improve training effectiveness. We will also provide the Air Force and the Special Operations Command with a life-cycle product support and spares for our panoramic night vision goggles, our ultralight rangefinders and our fusion goggle systems. 
For the U.S. Navy, we've received a follow-on contract for engineering services for the flight test instrumentation systems in support of the Trident program, and we were selected to supply next-generation towed arrays for submarines. Our systems will provide an increased ASW capability and reliability suitable for an increasingly challenged undersea environment. 
Additionally, L-3 was 1 of 9 firms that earned a spot on the $1.7 billion ID/IQ contract to provide training services, systems and related support to The Navy, The Marine and FMS customers. And for the U.S. Coast Guard, we won a recompete to provide the integrated C4ISR system for the Sentinel-class Fast Response Cutter. We've been performing work on this platform since 2009. 
In our commercial Aviation Products business, we received a contract to provide T3 CAT surveillance systems to easyJet for A320 aircraft fleet. We continue to receive solid orders for our NXT line of transponders for multiple U.S. airlines, as they equip their fleet to meet the FAA's 2020 mandate. And we received additional follow-on funding from the TSA for our leading airport security products, which include passenger screeners as well as carry-on and checked baggage scanners. 
Demand is strong for our commercial training solutions business. Since quarter end, we have already received approximately $150 million in commitments for our aircraft Full Flight Simulators. We expect these will be contracted for in the third quarter, including an A320 simulator for A&A in Japan. 
During Q2, we marked a few operational milestones that are worth noting. At our Waco facilities, we inducted the first U.S. Coast Guard C-130J aircraft for a mission systems upgrade. We also made key aircraft deliveries, including a fourth small cargo aircraft for Australia and C-130s with upgraded avionics for the Air Force and an international customer under our foreign military sales. 
And finally, turning to international. Last week, Ralph and I visited our WESCAM business in Canada, which produces market-leading stabilizing cameras and imaging systems for the military and public safety customers. WESCAM recently received multiple orders for our MX Electro-Optical and Infrared systems for the international military customers. This latest order reaffirms the market interest in our MX line, which provides full motion intelligence for a range of high-altitude and ultra-long-range missions. 
Lastly, we've been selected to deliver night vision goggles and capabilities to a NATO member state special operations force. With this contract, there are now 5 NATO countries that have purchased L-3's fusion goggles. 
As we move into the third quarter, we will continue to respond quickly to market opportunities and capitalize on a steady demand environment. With the commitment to operational excellence and program performance, we look forward to continued progress in the months ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph."
93538,372081720,1016144,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. We had another constructive quarter. Our second quarter was also better than we expected, primarily because of higher sales. Free",1297,"Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. We had another constructive quarter. Our second quarter was also better than we expected, primarily because of higher sales. Free cash flow was also very solid. And while orders were lower than what we estimated, that was primarily due to award timing, some delays and the fact that our quarter ended on June 24. 
Diluted earnings per share was $1.88, increasing 38% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.36 for the 2015 second quarter. The second quarter sales were almost $2.7 billion and grew 7% organically. Our U.S. Government sales, which are mostly to the Department of Defense, totaled $1.9 billion and grew 6%, and our international commercial sales grew 11% to almost $800 million. 
Our second quarter sales growth rate was unusually high due to some timing items, including the procurement and delivery of 2 aircraft on a foreign ISR systems contract, which added about $90 million of sales to second quarter. We expect a lower sales growth rate in the second half, because that is when most of the sales headwinds that we have this year versus 2015 happen. 
We previously discussed these negative year-over-year sales comparisons. They include, in Aerospace Systems, the final runoff of our sales declines related to the Afghanistan drawdown and the 3 large international ISR Systems contracts, which are nearing completion. And in Communication Systems, they include the Australian MoD SATCOM terminals and the declining TWT power devices for commercial satellites. However, the key takeaway is that our sales growth outlook is improving, and that's evidenced by our $150 million increase to our 2016 sales guidance, which I'll cover in a few minutes.
Consolidated operating margin was 9.3% for the second quarter. Margins increased in all 3 segments, raising consolidated margin by 330 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The main reason for the large increase in margin was the $84 million of losses that we recorded in Aerospace Systems in the second quarter of 2015 on the head-of-state aircraft modification contracts. 
Electronic Systems' operating margin was 12.2% for the second quarter and Communication Systems' margin was 10.5%. Aerospace Systems margin was 6.1%, in line with a 6% type margin for the second, third and fourth quarters of the year, which we discussed on our first quarter earnings conference call. Free cash flow generation was also robust for the second quarter, at $221 million. 
Moving on to our full year guidance update. We increased earnings per share at the midpoint by $0.10 to $7.75. This increase is driven by higher sales and a slightly lower tax rate, partially offset by more diluted shares outstanding. The diluted EPS guidance midpoint is a 12% increase compared to 2015's adjusted diluted EPS of $6.91. 
We increased consolidated sales guidance by $150 million to $10.2 billion at the midpoint and that calculates to an organic sales decline of about 1%. We expect our U.S. Government sales to now grow 1% organically versus 2015. This compares favorably to our prior guidance, which estimated a 2% decline for our U.S. Government sales. Our updated sales guidance also projects commercial to now grow at about 3% and international sales to decline 13% versus 2015. 
At the segment level, we increased Aerospace Systems sales by $150 million and Communication Systems sales by $50 million, with both of these increases due to a stronger U.S. Department of Defense market. Lower Electronic Systems sales by $50 million due to softer sales in 2 niche commercial markets. These are, one, our holographic weapon sights that we sell into the sporting and recreation market; and two, a new transponder that we introduced last year for the general aviation market where the sales are developing at a slower rate than we planned. 
Our updated Aerospace Systems guidance does not add any sales for the U.S. Air Force KC-10 tanker sustainment contract that Vertex Aerospace won in early June, because our award has been protested by a competitor. Moreover, our KC-10 work will not begin in earnest until January of 2017, even before considering the delay caused by the protest. We'd expect that this contract will have annual sales of about $200 million and that's obviously conditioned on our award being upheld. 
We maintained consolidated operating margin guidance at 9.8%, and segment margin guidance was also unchanged. I'd like to elaborate on a couple of points about our margin guidance update. First, in Electronic Systems, there's upside in the second half to margin and to operating income, but that could be offset by downside risk that remains in the holographic weapon sights. Second, while communications systems margin was not changed, we now expect higher margin for both broadband communication systems and advanced communications, driven by better contract performance and labor productivity. 
These improvements are being offset by an initial $6 million of severance and restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our Traveling Wave Tube, or TWT, power device businesses in California that Chris talked about. That businesses consolidation is a complex multiyear project. We expect that we will incur additional larger restructuring costs in 2017. And by 2018, we will complete the consolidation, and at that time, we expect to begin to generate annual pretax savings of about $9 million from the consolidation. 
Our free cash flow estimate stays at $825 million for the full year. With respect to the book-to-bill ratio, second quarter orders were about $250 million below our estimate. This was primarily due to timing. For example, as Chris mentioned a few minutes ago during his comments, last week, we received orders for several new simulation and training devices worth about $150 million. I will add that it's common and normal to have orders timing volatility among the quarters. Secondarily, our international ISR Systems orders are trailing what we planned, with several pursuits sliding to 2017 or not materializing. That said, with the increases that we currently see in Electronic Systems and Communication Systems, we remain on track to achieve our full year consolidated book-to-bill ratio of at least 1.0, and that's even after raising our sales guidance by $150 million. 
Regarding capital allocation for this year, while it's the same as our prior guidance, we've deliberately slowed the pace of share repurchases, because we expect to shift some cash deployment acquisitions in the second half of this year. We still expect to end this year with a cash balance of about $300 million. 
Looking at the third quarter outlook, we presently expect sales in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, which will calculate to organic growth that's about flat. Margin should be in the low 9% range with diluted earnings per share between $1.75 and $1.85. Free cash flow should be in the $100 million to $200 million range, with a book-to-bill ratio of about 1.0. 
A couple of other things regarding the third quarter. I want to remind you that we presently expect our 2016 third quarter operating margin and EPS to decline compared to 2015's third quarter. In 2015, our highest quarterly margin occurred in the third quarter at 10.7% and that was due to abnormally high margin in Aerospace Systems. And if you recall, what happened there was that we had significant risk retirements on 3 large international ISR contracts that are nearing completion, and in fact, declining this year, and we've talked about that. Also last year's third quarter, we had an $8 million REA profit recovery on our previous Army C-12 contract. 
So to conclude my financial review, the company continues to make progress. Contract performance is solid. We are increasing margins, and our orders and sales trends are improving. 
Thank you. We'll now begin the Q&A."

Noah -- yes, sure. Your assumptions are correct. However, looking forward, and as you could have heard from the testimony of some of the service chiefs on readiness, readiness has become a critically important area for our customers and it's an area where they're used to having L-3 as a player, as a good player in that space, and that is evidenced by some of the substantial wins in the quarter. And the fact that the print-on what the margin might be is lower than we would like, it does provide operating leverage for that entire business because of the absorption in that group as well as for all of L-3. Those customer relationships are invaluable and in terms of operating leverage for pulling our products through, it does present us with opportunities where we might be able to cross-sell avionics, heavy maintenance, whether it's engine work or whatever in our Waco facility and the like. So -- I mean, having more business is a good thing. We are working with our customers to change some of the dynamics of the margin model, where we can, and I had expressed some serious concerns with customers about where margins are and our ability to continue in this space. And I was assured that customers were willing to listen and help us address that. So I know Chris had spent some time on this, too. This is a debate we have regularly, but we're all on the same page.

We'll go through that process, but with over $2 billion of awards, yet to be booked and finalized, we feel pretty good. The customer dynamics are changing. We've talked about the shift from the LPTA to the best value model. I think, that's going to give us some opportunities. Margins are important, and we've talked about our need to increase those, but we also like to look at the ROIC and many of these programs do not have a lot of capital intensity. So when we balance the return on invested capital with the margins, we think we're creating value for the corporation. So there's still work to be done in Vertex. We're not done fixing it, but this win and given our large aircraft capabilities, such as KC-135, we're comfortable with our ability to satisfactorily perform on KC-10.

We also need to win the 2 recompetes that we have coming up over the next year, which Chris talked about, Fort Rucker and Army C-12.

We definitely want to do better with the margins on it, but I think we've demonstrated in the quarter that we're well thought of by the customer community, and we are winning sizable long-term work on significant platforms with significant units that are fielded. So this is an area that has the potential to be a good driver of the top line in our businesses space going forward. And believe me, the margins are something that we're focusing on."

In fact, we had one of our top executives earlier this week down in Fort Rucker, spending a few days just to independently talk to our customer and see how we are doing and getting some favorable reports out of that.

Obviously, I'm more comfortable with the lower end, and that is a nice increase to this year's margin guidance, which stands at 12.1%. Within Communications Systems, the margin targets that we articulated for next year are between 10% and 11%. Our midpoint guidance for 2016 is 10.4%. So I think we're going to be closer to the high end of that range for 2017. And then lastly, within commercial -- within Aerospace Systems, we said the target range for margins is in the high single-digit area, which is 7%, 8% or 9%. And what we explained was, the way we get to that high end of that range of Aerospace Systems is more international ISR and other international work. Two, growing the business base and improving the margins of logistics or Vertex, and we covered that in the first question. So clearly, we're still working on those items.

And as you know, it stands at $35 million in terms of total estimated returns and that's following the $15 million increase that we recorded to it in the first quarter of this year. The good news with respect to the returns are: One, it's voluntary. So we could discontinue it at our discretion. Two, it takes care of our customers. And three, the return experience is trending in the right direction, declining. And we now have 7-plus months of experience with that voluntary return program. We have a very robust detailed statistical analysis and our estimate is holding and proving to be accurate. But like anything else, it's subject to change, if the return rate were to change for some reason, but right now, it's heading in the right direction.

But the way things are trending in the interest rate markets year-to-date, we're looking at a meaningful reduction in the discount rate for the pension expense assumptions somewhere in the 90-basis-point range. And the 90 basis points breaks down to between a nearly 70-basis-point reduction in the 10-year treasury yield since the end of last year and another 20 basis points reduction due to the overall tightening of credit spreads in the investment-grade market.

And the sales on that new product, even though the mandate are in effect and have been slow to materialize and they're lagging what we'd planned, and that's probably $20 million of the $50 million sales reduction in Electronic Systems guidance, and the other $30 million is due to a softer demand for the weapon sites at EOTech."

I'm not going to name them. I've mentioned this in the past, that is on retainer with us and bringing some of those commercial technologies to the table and marrying them up with some of our defense technologies in terms of user interfaces, weight, power, size, all things that are very important to the warfighter, especially if they're carrying something around. But in addition, just the type of technology that would traditionally be nurtured in a commercial environment. As you've read, the DoD has done something in the Silicon Valley. Now they've moved to open an office up here in the northeast, near MIT. So they are very, very focused on accelerating innovation, if you will, and we have certainly not missed that, and we are attempting to stay ahead of the pack. As I said during my comments, we're working on smaller form factors for our SIGINT Systems, some low-cost next-generation infrared search and tracking systems as well as our mission simulator, which will enable us to bring the warfighter training at the mission level. Now a lot of these technology is dependent on video graphics and things like that as well as the expertise we bring, and we've really found a great partner to help us in this area. It's a mutual relationship, of course, but it's working very well. And we've made this as a resource available across the company, to our group presidents, where they can tap into it and bring it into their R&D programs as needed. And I see it really bearing fruit in the future for us, where it's differentiating the things that L-3 is doing. And I think we're one of -- I haven't heard anybody else taking this kind of a step-up than maybe in one other occasion. But -- and we are looking at more opportunities like that, to reach out of the box, if you will, and bring some thought leadership commercial technologies to the table to stitch into our own product offerings, where we can make a big differentiator between what we're offering versus the competition."

So we kind of did a midyear correction on where we're spending our R&D to try to address some of these challenges. And again, I think we're one of the few companies that increased our R&D spend year-over-year, or as a percentage of revenue or however you want to mention it.

So with that, thanks very much for joining us this morning. We had what I would characterize as another strong quarter, and we continue -- we intend to continue to build on this progress. As we've discussed, we are pursuing a 3-pronged approach to drive growth and enhance profitability. First, we want to achieve more organic growth and are working closely with our business development organization to better leverage our investments in R&D as well as approaching proposals, teaming agreements and making sure that we engage in the best win strategies that we can think of. Second, we are active in scouting out potential acquisitions to broaden our customer offerings and enhance our long-term strategic positioning. We'll continue to take a disciplined approach, as you've seen us do in the past, but we like having a healthy pipeline of candidates to look at and we're seeing that now. And third, with respect to cost control, we're tightening operations, as you've heard, we're consolidating where it makes sense, and we're engaging in other cost-reduction activities to help with the margin story. Our program execution remains strong and consistent, and we're focused on opportunities in our commercial training solutions business, EO/IR and additional markets, which will be part of our growth story going forward. The steps we've taken are showing positive results, and overall, we're well positioned to achieve future growth and deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders. 
So once again, thanks for joining us. Everybody, enjoy the rest of the summer. And we look forward to speaking with you again in October. Thank you."

I'm pleased to report that L-3 continues its positive momentum, demonstrating solid results and marked progress on our key strategic initiatives. Our employees and business leaders did excellent work in the quarter, and we're proud of their performance. So I'd like to thank everyone for their dedication. As a result of their hard work, we had organic growth, margin expansion and cash generation in the quarter. 
I'd like to begin with an overview of the quarter and discuss our business with respect to industry trends and the steps we are taking to continue delivering value to customers and shareholders. Chris will then discuss some of the details regarding our financial -- our operational performance, followed by Ralph's review of the financials. 
Over the past year, we've pursued a disciplined growth strategy that concentrates on areas where we believe we can consistently win due to strong product offerings and past performance. 
For the second quarter, we reported net sales of $2.7 billion, an increase of 5% over the same period last year and improved margins. We recorded net cash from operations of $257 million for the quarter and funded orders were $2.1 billion, while the book-to-bill ratio was 0.8, driven mainly by award timings and delays. And we expect that we will have a book-to-bill ratio over 1 for our defense business this year. 
We continue to have success across L-3 in our new business pursuits. Chris will discuss these in more detail, but I'd like to mention a few. We received several significant logistic support contracts, including significant wins on almost $2 billion for the KC-10 program and over $300 million for the U.S. Navy C-12 program. We are also successfully performing on the Navy's F/A-18 depot upgrade program we recently won. 
We also have some key international wins, which Chris will take you through. As we pursue opportunities, we remain committed to leading the industry as an innovator and developing and delivering solutions that meet our customers' needs. 
Prioritizing growth and remaining an agile company have enabled us to capitalize on expansion opportunities, invest strategically in R&D and improve our market positions. We remain focused on areas where we have leading positions and the strongest potential for growth. This includes training and simulation, aviation products and our legacy work supporting a wide range of ISR platforms, unmanned systems equipment and secure communications, such as ROVER and Communication Systems for the Virginia class submarines. 
The U.S. DoD remains our largest end customer, constituting roughly 70% of our total sales. Following the decline over the past 5 years, the U.S. defense budget is beginning to trend upward, which is important to the growth of our business. We anticipate the DoD budget, as a whole, is heading towards low single-digit growth at a minimum. 
Given that both candidates in the upcoming election have expressed a strong commitment to national security, this is clearly a positive development for L-3, the industry and the nation. 
As I mentioned, we expect that we'll have a positive book-to-bill ratio for our defense business this year, meaning above 1. As you are aware, commercial aviation remains a growth market. Revenue from global traffic continues to outpace GDP, as the market -- mature markets of North America and Europe recapitalized their fleets, while many parts of the world like Asia and the Middle East continue to grow steadily. 
This continued robust demand for commercial airplanes is resulting in new regulations, demand for more pilots and technical upgrade requirements, all areas where L-3 products and technologies come into play, like airport security and baggage detection, pilot training and avionics. 
International sales remain a focus for us, and as events in recent weeks have shown, the global threat level remains very high. International business, including military and commercial, represented 24% of our sales last year. And while the total addressable market appears flat for the remainder of 2016, we do see significant potential in emerging sectors to expand market share and increase our global footprint over the long term. 
There are opportunities to make headway with our competitively priced offerings, including our commercial training solutions, EO/IR sensors and night vision equipment, security and detection systems and our Communications Systems. 
Turning next to capital allocation. We remain committed to delivering value to shareholders and intelligently deploying capital when and where it supports the overall business strategy. Share repurchases and dividends are ongoing components of this strategy. We continue to maintain a healthy and efficient capital structure, which provides us with the flexibility to invest in our business, while at the same time returning capital to shareholders. We are also evaluating potential acquisitions that expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. We've heightened our focus on transactions that will strengthen our portfolio. 
As you've read in June, we welcomed Heidi Wood to our newly created position of Vice President and Chief Analytics Officer, and many of you know Heidi, I'm sure. Heidi brings to L-3 a wealth of industry and financial expertise, and she's supporting both myself, Chris and Ralph and the rest of our leadership team as we execute on our M&A and Investor Relations strategies and evaluate our portfolio as we continue improving the efficiency of our operations. 
We will continue to bolster our strong management team with talented people who have the expertise to help us take advantage of emerging opportunities within our industry. We're also prioritizing our R&D investments. This is an important part of our long-term strategy to ensure we remain competitive in the dynamic, ever-changing and highly regulated industries in which we operate. In fact, we're investing more than 2.5% of our revenue in R&D this year. 
We also have several exciting products and new capabilities that are already in early development, such as the smaller form factor SIGINT Systems, low-cost next-generation infrared search and track systems and our mission simulator, which will enable us to deliver scenario training at the mission level. 
Overall, we're pleased with our performance during the quarter. I'm confident that we're on the right track to achieve our goals. And with that, let me turn it over to Chris to give you some additional operational details. Go ahead, Chris."

Thank you, Mike, and good morning. First, let me echo Mike's comments. We made great progress during the first half of this year, and we have the momentum to continue delivering results as we enter the second half. I've been here 9 months now, and",1048,"Okay. Thank you, Mike, and good morning. First, let me echo Mike's comments. We made great progress during the first half of this year, and we have the momentum to continue delivering results as we enter the second half. 
I've been here 9 months now, and one of the things I've been most impressed by is the extent to which the L-3 culture is truly entrepreneurial, highly responsive and ready to take on change. We are collectively working well together and getting the better handle on areas requiring operational improvements as well as supporting new initiatives and increasing our focus on acquisitions. 
I'd like to give you an update on what we've been doing recently to improve margins, refine our portfolio and enhance the focus on operational excellence. In Q2, we continue to challenge our existing structure as we look for opportunities to drive value for our customers and shareholders. 
We are realigning a number of facilities, downsizing the workforce and consolidating business units to enhance our competitive profile and position L-3 for future growth. 
With respect to portfolio shaping, we are in the final innings. We are divesting a few very small businesses that have largely completed our previously announced portfolio shaping phase. We are now focused on the next phase of our history, which is disciplined growth. In May, we announced the closure of our electron devices facility in San Carlos, California and will be transitioning those manufacturing operations to our facilities in Los Angeles and Pennsylvania. These actions will help reduce costs over the long run. 
In order to expand strategically into emerging markets, as a prime system integrator and a subsystem provider, we are aligning unmanned systems, space and navigation and Mustang technologies into a single business. This consolidation will also yield cost reductions through shared management and back office resources while optimizing our R&D. 
But we are investing for growth where it makes sense. So in May, we announced the plans to open a facility in Ottawa, Ontario that will accommodate a team of highly specialized engineers and a state-of-the-art lab. This will allow us to better develop and demonstrate future maritime communications for the Royal Canadian Navy submarine and surface fleets. 
With our M&A strategy, we have kicked up the intensity a notch and are assessing the landscape to identify opportunities that would be a good strategic fit for L-3. As we've been saying, we are looking at about a dozen or so properties across all the markets we currently serve, and we like the pipeline that we are seeing. We are sharpening our vision and looking for ways we can add new and proprietary capabilities to our portfolio. 
We continually evaluate prior deals and seek ways to maximize their value to the enterprise. Our last 4 acquisitions of MITEQ, CTC Aviation, Vertex and ATM have all enhanced our growth prospects and are performing at or above our business cases. 
Let me now turn to some of our new business wins. Let's start with defense. Although the book-to-bill ratio is low, we have several noteworthy wins across our defense businesses that reflect our strategy of growth through excellent program performance. For the U.S. Air Force, we won a key recompete towards warfighter readiness and training programs. This is a 7-year contract to provide a wide range of advanced technologies to improve training effectiveness. We will also provide the Air Force and the Special Operations Command with a life-cycle product support and spares for our panoramic night vision goggles, our ultralight rangefinders and our fusion goggle systems. 
For the U.S. Navy, we've received a follow-on contract for engineering services for the flight test instrumentation systems in support of the Trident program, and we were selected to supply next-generation towed arrays for submarines. Our systems will provide an increased ASW capability and reliability suitable for an increasingly challenged undersea environment. 
Additionally, L-3 was 1 of 9 firms that earned a spot on the $1.7 billion ID/IQ contract to provide training services, systems and related support to The Navy, The Marine and FMS customers. And for the U.S. Coast Guard, we won a recompete to provide the integrated C4ISR system for the Sentinel-class Fast Response Cutter. We've been performing work on this platform since 2009. 
In our commercial Aviation Products business, we received a contract to provide T3 CAT surveillance systems to easyJet for A320 aircraft fleet. We continue to receive solid orders for our NXT line of transponders for multiple U.S. airlines, as they equip their fleet to meet the FAA's 2020 mandate. And we received additional follow-on funding from the TSA for our leading airport security products, which include passenger screeners as well as carry-on and checked baggage scanners. 
Demand is strong for our commercial training solutions business. Since quarter end, we have already received approximately $150 million in commitments for our aircraft Full Flight Simulators. We expect these will be contracted for in the third quarter, including an A320 simulator for A&A in Japan. 
During Q2, we marked a few operational milestones that are worth noting. At our Waco facilities, we inducted the first U.S. Coast Guard C-130J aircraft for a mission systems upgrade. We also made key aircraft deliveries, including a fourth small cargo aircraft for Australia and C-130s with upgraded avionics for the Air Force and an international customer under our foreign military sales. 
And finally, turning to international. Last week, Ralph and I visited our WESCAM business in Canada, which produces market-leading stabilizing cameras and imaging systems for the military and public safety customers. WESCAM recently received multiple orders for our MX Electro-Optical and Infrared systems for the international military customers. This latest order reaffirms the market interest in our MX line, which provides full motion intelligence for a range of high-altitude and ultra-long-range missions. 
Lastly, we've been selected to deliver night vision goggles and capabilities to a NATO member state special operations force. With this contract, there are now 5 NATO countries that have purchased L-3's fusion goggles. 
As we move into the third quarter, we will continue to respond quickly to market opportunities and capitalize on a steady demand environment. With the commitment to operational excellence and program performance, we look forward to continued progress in the months ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph."

The second quarter sales were almost $2.7 billion and grew 7% organically. Our U.S. Government sales, which are mostly to the Department of Defense, totaled $1.9 billion and grew 6%, and our international commercial sales grew 11% to almost $800 million. 
Our second quarter sales growth rate was unusually high due to some timing items, including the procurement and delivery of 2 aircraft on a foreign ISR systems contract, which added about $90 million of sales to second quarter. We expect a lower sales growth rate in the second half, because that is when most of the sales headwinds that we have this year versus 2015 happen. 
We previously discussed these negative year-over-year sales comparisons. They include, in Aerospace Systems, the final runoff of our sales declines related to the Afghanistan drawdown and the 3 large international ISR Systems contracts, which are nearing completion. And in Communication Systems, they include the Australian MoD SATCOM terminals and the declining TWT power devices for commercial satellites. However, the key takeaway is that our sales growth outlook is improving, and that's evidenced by our $150 million increase to our 2016 sales guidance, which I'll cover in a few minutes.
Consolidated operating margin was 9.3% for the second quarter. Margins increased in all 3 segments, raising consolidated margin by 330 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The main reason for the large increase in margin was the $84 million of losses that we recorded in Aerospace Systems in the second quarter of 2015 on the head-of-state aircraft modification contracts. 
Electronic Systems' operating margin was 12.2% for the second quarter and Communication Systems' margin was 10.5%. Aerospace Systems margin was 6.1%, in line with a 6% type margin for the second, third and fourth quarters of the year, which we discussed on our first quarter earnings conference call. Free cash flow generation was also robust for the second quarter, at $221 million. 
Moving on to our full year guidance update. We increased earnings per share at the midpoint by $0.10 to $7.75. This increase is driven by higher sales and a slightly lower tax rate, partially offset by more diluted shares outstanding. The diluted EPS guidance midpoint is a 12% increase compared to 2015's adjusted diluted EPS of $6.91. 
We increased consolidated sales guidance by $150 million to $10.2 billion at the midpoint and that calculates to an organic sales decline of about 1%. We expect our U.S. Government sales to now grow 1% organically versus 2015. This compares favorably to our prior guidance, which estimated a 2% decline for our U.S. Government sales. Our updated sales guidance also projects commercial to now grow at about 3% and international sales to decline 13% versus 2015. 
At the segment level, we increased Aerospace Systems sales by $150 million and Communication Systems sales by $50 million, with both of these increases due to a stronger U.S. Department of Defense market. Lower Electronic Systems sales by $50 million due to softer sales in 2 niche commercial markets. These are, one, our holographic weapon sights that we sell into the sporting and recreation market; and two, a new transponder that we introduced last year for the general aviation market where the sales are developing at a slower rate than we planned. 
Our updated Aerospace Systems guidance does not add any sales for the U.S. Air Force KC-10 tanker sustainment contract that Vertex Aerospace won in early June, because our award has been protested by a competitor. Moreover, our KC-10 work will not begin in earnest until January of 2017, even before considering the delay caused by the protest. We'd expect that this contract will have annual sales of about $200 million and that's obviously conditioned on our award being upheld. 
We maintained consolidated operating margin guidance at 9.8%, and segment margin guidance was also unchanged. I'd like to elaborate on a couple of points about our margin guidance update. First, in Electronic Systems, there's upside in the second half to margin and to operating income, but that could be offset by downside risk that remains in the holographic weapon sights. Second, while communications systems margin was not changed, we now expect higher margin for both broadband communication systems and advanced communications, driven by better contract performance and labor productivity. 
These improvements are being offset by an initial $6 million of severance and restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our Traveling Wave Tube, or TWT, power device businesses in California that Chris talked about. That businesses consolidation is a complex multiyear project. We expect that we will incur additional larger restructuring costs in 2017. And by 2018, we will complete the consolidation, and at that time, we expect to begin to generate annual pretax savings of about $9 million from the consolidation. 
Our free cash flow estimate stays at $825 million for the full year. With respect to the book-to-bill ratio, second quarter orders were about $250 million below our estimate. This was primarily due to timing. For example, as Chris mentioned a few minutes ago during his comments, last week, we received orders for several new simulation and training devices worth about $150 million. I will add that it's common and normal to have orders timing volatility among the quarters. Secondarily, our international ISR Systems orders are trailing what we planned, with several pursuits sliding to 2017 or not materializing. That said, with the increases that we currently see in Electronic Systems and Communication Systems, we remain on track to achieve our full year consolidated book-to-bill ratio of at least 1.0, and that's even after raising our sales guidance by $150 million. 
Regarding capital allocation for this year, while it's the same as our prior guidance, we've deliberately slowed the pace of share repurchases, because we expect to shift some cash deployment acquisitions in the second half of this year. We still expect to end this year with a cash balance of about $300 million. 
Looking at the third quarter outlook, we presently expect sales in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, which will calculate to organic growth that's about flat. Margin should be in the low 9% range with diluted earnings per share between $1.75 and $1.85. Free cash flow should be in the $100 million to $200 million range, with a book-to-bill ratio of about 1.0. 
A couple of other things regarding the third quarter. I want to remind you that we presently expect our 2016 third quarter operating margin and EPS to decline compared to 2015's third quarter. In 2015, our highest quarterly margin occurred in the third quarter at 10.7% and that was due to abnormally high margin in Aerospace Systems. And if you recall, what happened there was that we had significant risk retirements on 3 large international ISR contracts that are nearing completion, and in fact, declining this year, and we've talked about that. Also last year's third quarter, we had an $8 million REA profit recovery on our previous Army C-12 contract. 
So to conclude my financial review, the company continues to make progress. Contract performance is solid. We are increasing margins, and our orders and sales trends are improving. 
Thank you. We'll now begin the Q&A."

Noah -- yes, sure. Your assumptions are correct. However, looking forward, and as you could have heard from the testimony of some of the service chiefs on readiness, readiness has become a critically important area for our customers and it's an area where they're used to having L-3 as a player, as a good player in that space, and that is evidenced by some of the substantial wins in the quarter. And the fact that the print-on what the margin might be is lower than we would like, it does provide operating leverage for that entire business because of the absorption in that group as well as for all of L-3. Those customer relationships are invaluable and in terms of operating leverage for pulling our products through, it does present us with opportunities where we might be able to cross-sell avionics, heavy maintenance, whether it's engine work or whatever in our Waco facility and the like. So -- I mean, having more business is a good thing. We are working with our customers to change some of the dynamics of the margin model, where we can, and I had expressed some serious concerns with customers about where margins are and our ability to continue in this space. And I was assured that customers were willing to listen and help us address that. So I know Chris had spent some time on this, too. This is a debate we have regularly, but we're all on the same page. So Chris, why don't you add your thoughts on this."

We'll go through that process, but with over $2 billion of awards, yet to be booked and finalized, we feel pretty good. The customer dynamics are changing. We've talked about the shift from the LPTA to the best value model. I think, that's going to give us some opportunities. Margins are important, and we've talked about our need to increase those, but we also like to look at the ROIC and many of these programs do not have a lot of capital intensity. So when we balance the return on invested capital with the margins, we think we're creating value for the corporation. So there's still work to be done in Vertex. We're not done fixing it, but this win and given our large aircraft capabilities, such as KC-135, we're comfortable with our ability to satisfactorily perform on KC-10.

Obviously, I'm more comfortable with the lower end, and that is a nice increase to this year's margin guidance, which stands at 12.1%. Within Communications Systems, the margin targets that we articulated for next year are between 10% and 11%. Our midpoint guidance for 2016 is 10.4%.

And then lastly, within commercial -- within Aerospace Systems, we said the target range for margins is in the high single-digit area, which is 7%, 8% or 9%.

But the way things are trending in the interest rate markets year-to-date, we're looking at a meaningful reduction in the discount rate for the pension expense assumptions somewhere in the 90-basis-point range. And the 90 basis points breaks down to between a nearly 70-basis-point reduction in the 10-year treasury yield since the end of last year and another 20 basis points reduction due to the overall tightening of credit spreads in the investment-grade market. So that 90 basis points reduction, if it holds, would translate into about a $45 million increase to pension expense for 2017 versus this year, on a pretax basis."

And now we are going into the next phase of making offers and starting due diligence and working the finance side. So as Ralph said, we'd love to do a couple from the second half of the year. We're not going to do a bad deal. Just to say, we did one, but I kind of like our position and some of these given our reputation of doing over 100 acquisitions, a lot of people come to us on a proprietary basis, because they like the model, they like the culture and they like the opportunity to be part of a bigger company.

But in addition, just the type of technology that would traditionally be nurtured in a commercial environment. As you've read, the DoD has done something in the Silicon Valley. Now they've moved to open an office up here in the northeast, near MIT. So they are very, very focused on accelerating innovation, if you will, and we have certainly not missed that, and we are attempting to stay ahead of the pack. As I said during my comments, we're working on smaller form factors for our SIGINT Systems, some low-cost next-generation infrared search and tracking systems as well as our mission simulator, which will enable us to bring the warfighter training at the mission level. Now a lot of these technology is dependent on video graphics and things like that as well as the expertise we bring, and we've really found a great partner to help us in this area. It's a mutual relationship, of course, but it's working very well. And we've made this as a resource available across the company, to our group presidents, where they can tap into it and bring it into their R&D programs as needed. And I see it really bearing fruit in the future for us, where it's differentiating the things that L-3 is doing. And I think we're one of -- I haven't heard anybody else taking this kind of a step-up than maybe in one other occasion.

So with that, thanks very much for joining us this morning. We had what I would characterize as another strong quarter, and we continue -- we intend to continue to build on this progress. As we've discussed, we are pursuing a 3-pronged approach to drive growth and enhance profitability. First, we want to achieve more organic growth and are working closely with our business development organization to better leverage our investments in R&D as well as approaching proposals, teaming agreements and making sure that we engage in the best win strategies that we can think of. Second, we are active in scouting out potential acquisitions to broaden our customer offerings and enhance our long-term strategic positioning. We'll continue to take a disciplined approach, as you've seen us do in the past, but we like having a healthy pipeline of candidates to look at and we're seeing that now. And third, with respect to cost control, we're tightening operations, as you've heard, we're consolidating where it makes sense, and we're engaging in other cost-reduction activities to help with the margin story. Our program execution remains strong and consistent, and we're focused on opportunities in our commercial training solutions business, EO/IR and additional markets, which will be part of our growth story going forward. The steps we've taken are showing positive results, and overall, we're well positioned to achieve future growth and deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders.

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that L-3 continues its positive momentum, demonstrating solid results and marked progress on our key strategic initiatives. Our employees and business leaders did excellent work in the qu",1040,"Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that L-3 continues its positive momentum, demonstrating solid results and marked progress on our key strategic initiatives. Our employees and business leaders did excellent work in the quarter, and we're proud of their performance. So I'd like to thank everyone for their dedication. As a result of their hard work, we had organic growth, margin expansion and cash generation in the quarter. 
I'd like to begin with an overview of the quarter and discuss our business with respect to industry trends and the steps we are taking to continue delivering value to customers and shareholders. Chris will then discuss some of the details regarding our financial -- our operational performance, followed by Ralph's review of the financials. 
Over the past year, we've pursued a disciplined growth strategy that concentrates on areas where we believe we can consistently win due to strong product offerings and past performance. 
For the second quarter, we reported net sales of $2.7 billion, an increase of 5% over the same period last year and improved margins. We recorded net cash from operations of $257 million for the quarter and funded orders were $2.1 billion, while the book-to-bill ratio was 0.8, driven mainly by award timings and delays. And we expect that we will have a book-to-bill ratio over 1 for our defense business this year. 
We continue to have success across L-3 in our new business pursuits. Chris will discuss these in more detail, but I'd like to mention a few. We received several significant logistic support contracts, including significant wins on almost $2 billion for the KC-10 program and over $300 million for the U.S. Navy C-12 program. We are also successfully performing on the Navy's F/A-18 depot upgrade program we recently won. 
We also have some key international wins, which Chris will take you through. As we pursue opportunities, we remain committed to leading the industry as an innovator and developing and delivering solutions that meet our customers' needs. 
Prioritizing growth and remaining an agile company have enabled us to capitalize on expansion opportunities, invest strategically in R&D and improve our market positions. We remain focused on areas where we have leading positions and the strongest potential for growth. This includes training and simulation, aviation products and our legacy work supporting a wide range of ISR platforms, unmanned systems equipment and secure communications, such as ROVER and Communication Systems for the Virginia class submarines. 
The U.S. DoD remains our largest end customer, constituting roughly 70% of our total sales. Following the decline over the past 5 years, the U.S. defense budget is beginning to trend upward, which is important to the growth of our business. We anticipate the DoD budget, as a whole, is heading towards low single-digit growth at a minimum. 
Given that both candidates in the upcoming election have expressed a strong commitment to national security, this is clearly a positive development for L-3, the industry and the nation. 
As I mentioned, we expect that we'll have a positive book-to-bill ratio for our defense business this year, meaning above 1. As you are aware, commercial aviation remains a growth market. Revenue from global traffic continues to outpace GDP, as the market -- mature markets of North America and Europe recapitalized their fleets, while many parts of the world like Asia and the Middle East continue to grow steadily. 
This continued robust demand for commercial airplanes is resulting in new regulations, demand for more pilots and technical upgrade requirements, all areas where L-3 products and technologies come into play, like airport security and baggage detection, pilot training and avionics. 
International sales remain a focus for us, and as events in recent weeks have shown, the global threat level remains very high. International business, including military and commercial, represented 24% of our sales last year. And while the total addressable market appears flat for the remainder of 2016, we do see significant potential in emerging sectors to expand market share and increase our global footprint over the long term. 
There are opportunities to make headway with our competitively priced offerings, including our commercial training solutions, EO/IR sensors and night vision equipment, security and detection systems and our Communications Systems. 
Turning next to capital allocation. We remain committed to delivering value to shareholders and intelligently deploying capital when and where it supports the overall business strategy. Share repurchases and dividends are ongoing components of this strategy. We continue to maintain a healthy and efficient capital structure, which provides us with the flexibility to invest in our business, while at the same time returning capital to shareholders. We are also evaluating potential acquisitions that expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. We've heightened our focus on transactions that will strengthen our portfolio. 
As you've read in June, we welcomed Heidi Wood to our newly created position of Vice President and Chief Analytics Officer, and many of you know Heidi, I'm sure. Heidi brings to L-3 a wealth of industry and financial expertise, and she's supporting both myself, Chris and Ralph and the rest of our leadership team as we execute on our M&A and Investor Relations strategies and evaluate our portfolio as we continue improving the efficiency of our operations. 
We will continue to bolster our strong management team with talented people who have the expertise to help us take advantage of emerging opportunities within our industry. We're also prioritizing our R&D investments. This is an important part of our long-term strategy to ensure we remain competitive in the dynamic, ever-changing and highly regulated industries in which we operate. In fact, we're investing more than 2.5% of our revenue in R&D this year. 
We also have several exciting products and new capabilities that are already in early development, such as the smaller form factor SIGINT Systems, low-cost next-generation infrared search and track systems and our mission simulator, which will enable us to deliver scenario training at the mission level. 
Overall, we're pleased with our performance during the quarter. I'm confident that we're on the right track to achieve our goals. And with that, let me turn it over to Chris to give you some additional operational details. Go ahead, Chris."

Thank you, Mike, and good morning. First, let me echo Mike's comments. We made great progress during the first half of this year, and we have the momentum to continue delivering results as we enter the second half. I've been here 9 months now, and",1050,"Okay. Thank you, Mike, and good morning. First, let me echo Mike's comments. We made great progress during the first half of this year, and we have the momentum to continue delivering results as we enter the second half. 
I've been here 9 months now, and one of the things I've been most impressed by is the extent to which the L-3 culture is truly entrepreneurial, highly responsive and ready to take on change. We are collectively working well together and getting the better handle on areas requiring operational improvements as well as supporting new initiatives and increasing our focus on acquisitions. 
I'd like to give you an update on what we've been doing recently to improve margins, refine our portfolio and enhance the focus on operational excellence. In Q2, we continue to challenge our existing structure as we look for opportunities to drive value for our customers and shareholders. 
We are realigning a number of facilities, downsizing the workforce and consolidating business units to enhance our competitive profile and position L-3 for future growth. 
With respect to portfolio shaping, we are in the final innings. We are divesting a few very small businesses that have largely completed our previously announced portfolio shaping phase. We are now focused on the next phase of our history, which is disciplined growth. In May, we announced the closure of our electron devices facility in San Carlos, California and we'll be transitioning those manufacturing operations to our facilities in Los Angeles and Pennsylvania. These actions will help reduce costs over the long run. 
In order to expand strategically into emerging markets, as a prime system integrator and a subsystem provider, we are aligning unmanned systems, space and navigation and Mustang technologies into a single business. This consolidation will also yield cost reductions through shared management and back office resources while optimizing our R&D. 
But we are investing for growth where it makes sense. So in May, we announced the plans to open a facility in Ottawa, Ontario that will accommodate a team of highly specialized engineers and a state-of-the-art lab. This will allow us to better develop and demonstrate future maritime communications for the Royal Canadian Navy submarine and surface fleets. 
With our M&A strategy, we have kicked up the intensity a notch and are assessing the landscape to identify opportunities that would be a good strategic fit for L-3. As we've been saying, we are looking at about a dozen or so properties across all the markets we currently serve, and we like the pipeline that we are seeing. We are sharpening our vision and looking for ways we can add new and proprietary capabilities to our portfolio. 
We continually evaluate prior deals and seek ways to maximize their value to the enterprise. Our last 4 acquisitions of MITEQ, CTC Aviation, ForceX and ATM have all enhanced our growth prospects and are performing at or above our business cases. 
Let me now turn to some of our new business wins. Let's start with defense. Although the book-to-bill ratio is low, we have several noteworthy wins across our defense businesses that reflect our strategy of growth through excellent program performance. For the U.S. Air Force, we won a key recompete for its warfighter readiness and training programs. This is a 7-year contract to provide a wide range of advanced technologies to improve training effectiveness. We will also provide the Air Force and the Special Operations Command with a life-cycle product support and spares for our panoramic night vision goggles, our ultralight rangefinders and our fusion goggle systems. 
For the U.S. Navy, we've received a follow-on contract for engineering services for the flight test instrumentation systems in support of the Trident program, and we were selected to supply next-generation towed arrays for submarines. Our systems will provide an increased ASW capability and reliability suitable for an increasingly challenged undersea environment. 
Additionally, L-3 was 1 of 9 firms that earned a spot on the $1.7 billion ID/IQ contract to provide training services, systems and related support to The Navy, The Marine and FMS customers. And for the U.S. Coast Guard, we won a recompete to provide the integrated C4ISR system for the Sentinel-class Fast Response Cutter. We've been performing work on this platform since 2009. 
In our commercial Aviation Products business, we received a contract to provide T3 CAT surveillance systems to easyJet for its A320 aircraft fleet. We continue to receive solid orders for our NXT line of transponders for multiple U.S. airlines, as they equip their fleet to meet the FAA's 2020 mandate. And we received additional follow-on funding from the TSA for our leading airport security products, which include passenger screeners as well as carry-on and checked baggage scanners. 
Demand is strong for our commercial training solutions business. Since quarter end, we have already received approximately $150 million in commitments for our aircraft Full Flight Simulators. We expect these will be contracted for in the third quarter, including an A320 simulator for ANA in Japan. 
During Q2, we marked a few operational milestones that are worth noting. At our Waco facilities, we inducted the first U.S. Coast Guard C-130J aircraft for a mission systems upgrade. We also made key aircraft deliveries, including a fourth small cargo aircraft for Australia and C-130s with upgraded avionics for the Air Force and an international customer under our foreign military sales. 
And finally, turning to international. Last week, Ralph and I visited our WESCAM business in Canada, which produces market-leading stabilizing cameras and imaging systems for the military and public safety customers. WESCAM recently received multiple orders for our MX Electro-Optical and Infrared systems for the international military customers. This latest order reaffirms the market interest in our MX line, which provides full motion intelligence for a range of high-altitude and ultra-long-range missions. 
Lastly, we've been selected to deliver night vision goggles and capabilities to a NATO member state special operations force. With this contract, there are now 5 NATO countries that have purchased L-3's fusion goggles. 
As we move into the third quarter, we will continue to respond quickly to market opportunities and capitalize on a steady demand environment. With the commitment to operational excellence and program performance, we look forward to continued progress in the months ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph."
93538,372081720,1055863,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. We had another constructive quarter. Our second quarter results were better than we expected, primarily because of higher sales.",1298,"Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the second quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance. We had another constructive quarter. Our second quarter results were better than we expected, primarily because of higher sales. Free cash flow was also very solid. And while orders were lower than what we estimated, that was primarily due to award timing, some delays and the fact that our quarter ended on June 24. 
Diluted earnings per share was $1.88, increasing 38% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.36 for the 2015 second quarter. The second quarter sales were almost $2.7 billion and grew 7% organically. Our U.S. Government sales, which are mostly to the Department of Defense, totaled $1.9 billion and grew 6%, and our international commercial sales grew 11% to almost $800 million. 
Our second quarter sales growth rate was unusually high due to some timing items, including the procurement and delivery of 2 aircraft on a foreign ISR systems contract, which added about $90 million of sales to second quarter. We expect a lower sales growth rate in the second half, because that is when most of the sales headwinds that we have this year versus 2015 happen. 
We previously discussed these negative year-over-year sales comparisons. They include, in Aerospace Systems, the final runoff of our sales declines related to the Afghanistan drawdown and the 3 large international ISR Systems contracts, which are nearing completion. And in Communication Systems, they include the Australian MoD SATCOM terminals and the declining TWT power devices for commercial satellites. However, the key takeaway is that our sales growth outlook is improving, and that's evidenced by our $150 million increase to our 2016 sales guidance, which I'll cover in a few minutes.
Consolidated operating margin was 9.3% for the second quarter. Margins increased in all 3 segments, raising consolidated margin by 330 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The main reason for the large increase in margin was the $84 million of losses that we recorded in Aerospace Systems in the second quarter of 2015 on the head-of-state aircraft modification contracts. 
Electronic Systems' operating margin was 12.2% for the second quarter and Communication Systems' margin was 10.5%. Aerospace Systems margin was 6.1%, in line with a 6% type margin for the second, third and fourth quarters of the year, which we discussed on our first quarter earnings conference call. Free cash flow generation was also robust for the second quarter, at $221 million. 
Moving on to our full year guidance update. We increased earnings per share at the midpoint by $0.10 to $7.75. This increase is driven by higher sales and a slightly lower tax rate, partially offset by more diluted shares outstanding. The diluted EPS guidance midpoint is a 12% increase compared to 2015's adjusted diluted EPS of $6.91. 
We increased consolidated sales guidance by $150 million to $10.2 billion at the midpoint and that calculates to an organic sales decline of about 1%. We expect our U.S. Government sales to now grow 1% organically versus 2015. This compares favorably to our prior guidance, which estimated a 2% decline for our U.S. Government sales. Our updated sales guidance also projects commercial to now grow at about 3% and international sales to decline 13% versus 2015. 
At the segment level, we increased Aerospace Systems sales by $150 million and Communication Systems sales by $50 million, with both of these increases due to a stronger U.S. Department of Defense market. We lowered Electronic Systems sales by $50 million due to softer sales in 2 niche commercial markets. These are, one, our holographic weapon sights that we sell into the sporting and recreation market; and two, a new transponder that we introduced last year for the general aviation market where the sales are developing at a slower rate than we planned. 
Our updated Aerospace Systems guidance does not add any sales for the U.S. Air Force KC-10 tanker sustainment contract that Vertex Aerospace won in early June, because our award has been protested by a competitor. Moreover, our KC-10 work will not begin in earnest until January of 2017, even before considering the delay caused by the protest. We'd expect that this contract will have annual sales of about $200 million and that's obviously conditioned on our award being upheld. 
We maintained consolidated operating margin guidance at 9.8%, and segment margin guidance was also unchanged. I'd like to elaborate on a couple of points about our margin guidance update. First, in Electronic Systems, there's upside in the second half to margin and to operating income, but that could be offset by downside risk that remains in the holographic weapon sights. Second, while communications systems margin was not changed, we now expect higher margin for both broadband communication systems and advanced communications, driven by better contract performance and labor productivity. 
These improvements are being offset by an initial $6 million of severance and restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our Traveling Wave Tube, or TWT, power device businesses in California that Chris talked about. That businesses consolidation is a complex multiyear project. We expect that we will incur additional larger restructuring costs in 2017. And by 2018, we will complete the consolidation, and at that time, we expect to begin to generate annual pretax savings of about $9 million from the consolidation. 
Our free cash flow estimate stays at $825 million for the full year. With respect to the book-to-bill ratio, second quarter orders were about $250 million below our estimate. This was primarily due to timing. For example, as Chris mentioned a few minutes ago during his comments, last week, we received orders for several new simulation and training devices worth about $150 million. I will add that it's common and normal to have orders timing volatility among the quarters. Secondarily, our international ISR Systems orders are trailing what we planned, with several pursuits sliding to 2017 or not materializing. That said, with the increases that we currently see in Electronic Systems and Communication Systems, we remain on track to achieve our full year consolidated book-to-bill ratio of at least 1.0, and that's even after raising our sales guidance by $150 million. 
Regarding capital allocation for this year, while it's the same as our prior guidance, we've deliberately slowed the pace of share repurchases, because we expect to shift some cash deployment acquisitions in the second half of this year. We still expect to end this year with a cash balance of about $300 million. 
Looking at the third quarter outlook, we presently expect sales in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, which will calculate to organic growth that's about flat. Margin should be in the low 9% range with diluted earnings per share between $1.75 and $1.85. Free cash flow should be in the $100 million to $200 million range, with a book-to-bill ratio of about 1.0. 
A couple of other things regarding the third quarter. I want to remind you that we presently expect our 2016 third quarter operating margin and EPS to decline compared to 2015's third quarter. In 2015, our highest quarterly margin occurred in the third quarter at 10.7% and that was due to abnormally high margin in Aerospace Systems. And if you recall, what happened there was that we had significant risk retirements on 3 large international ISR contracts that are nearing completion, and in fact, declining this year, and we've talked about that. Also last year's third quarter, we had an $8 million REA profit recovery on our previous Army C-12 contract. 
So to conclude my financial review, the company continues to make progress. Contract performance is solid. We are increasing margins, and our orders and sales trends are improving. 
Thank you. We'll now begin the Q&A."

Noah -- yes, sure. Your assumptions are correct. However, looking forward, and as you could have heard from the testimony of some of the service chiefs on readiness, readiness has become a critically important area for our customers and it's an area where they're used to having L-3 as a player, as a good player in that space, and that is evidenced by some of the substantial wins in the quarter. And the fact that the print-on what the margin might be is lower than we would like, it does provide operating leverage for that entire business because of the absorption in that group as well as for all of L-3. Those customer relationships are invaluable and in terms of operating leverage for pulling our products through, it does present us with opportunities where we might be able to cross-sell avionics, heavy maintenance, whether it's engine work or whatever in our Waco facility and the like. So -- I mean, having more business is a good thing. We are working with our customers to change some of the dynamics of the margin model, where we can, and I had expressed some serious concerns with customers about where margins are and our ability to continue in this space. And I was assured that customers were willing to listen and help us address that. So I know Chris had spent some time on this, too. This is a debate we have regularly, but we're all on the same page.

And when you look at what we've done in the first quarter with these new wins, I think we're off to a pretty good start. I mean, a couple of these are being protested. We'll go through that process, but with over $2 billion of awards, yet to be booked and finalized, we feel pretty good. The customer dynamics are changing. We've talked about the shift from the LPTA to the best value model. I think, that's going to give us some opportunities. Margins are important, and we've talked about our need to increase those, but we also like to look at the ROIC and many of these programs do not have a lot of capital intensity. So when we balance the return on invested capital with the margins, we think we're creating value for the corporation. So there's still work to be done in Vertex. We're not done fixing it, but this win and given our large aircraft capabilities, such as KC-135, we're comfortable with our ability to satisfactorily perform on KC-10. And then, I'm sure we'll talk more about things like Fort Rucker and Army C-12 and Salsa [ph], 3 large opportunities that will be coming up late '17, '18. And we like our positioning.

And aside from those 2 recompetitions, we don't have any large single contract recompetitions across the entire company for the next several years, but that's where those 2 stand, Noah."

So we can all agree on what teammates we align with. We look at the draft proposals and challenge terms and conditions to the extent that's appropriate, and we develop an outreach program to make sure that we are touching the appropriate stakeholders. In fact, we had one of our top executives earlier this week down in Fort Rucker, spending a few days just to independently talk to our customer and see how we are doing and getting some favorable reports out of that. So I think given the significance and then maybe a little more focus at the executive level earlier on the process is going to improve our chance of winning."

Because we've been saying the same thing now for at least 1.5 years. And so I'll go through it again. So within Electronic Systems, we expect margins to be somewhere between 13% and 14% for 2017. Obviously, I'm more comfortable with the lower end, and that is a nice increase to this year's margin guidance, which stands at 12.1%. Within Communications Systems, the margin targets that we articulated for next year are between 10% and 11%. Our midpoint guidance for 2016 is 10.4%. So I think we're going to be closer to the high end of that range for 2017. And then lastly, within commercial -- within Aerospace Systems, we said the target range for margins is in the high single-digit area, which is 7%, 8% or 9%. And what we explained was, the way we get to that high end of that range of Aerospace Systems is more international ISR and other international work. Two, growing the business base and improving the margins of logistics or Vertex, and we covered that in the first question. So clearly, we're still working on those items. And as of now, I'm more comfortable with the low end of that range for 2017."

The first one concerns our voluntary return program, which we instituted in the fourth quarter of last year. And as you know, it stands at $35 million in terms of total estimated returns and that's following the $15 million increase that we recorded to it in the first quarter of this year. The good news with respect to the returns are: One, it's voluntary. So we could discontinue it at our discretion. Two, it takes care of our customers. And three, the return experience is trending in the right direction, declining. And we now have 7-plus months of experience with that voluntary return program. We have a very robust detailed statistical analysis and our estimate is holding and proving to be accurate. But like anything else, it's subject to change, if the return rate were to change for some reason, but right now, it's heading in the right direction. The second item is that we're involved in class action lawsuit litigation on the holographic weapon sights, and we have valid defenses, and we're vigorously defending ourselves and we're presently scheduled to go to mediation in August to try and settle that litigation. But obviously, litigation is inherently risky, and we're not sure -- we can't predict if we are going to be able to settle those items and what the ultimate outcome will be.

But the way things are trending in the interest rate markets year-to-date, we're looking at a meaningful reduction in the discount rate for the pension expense assumptions somewhere in the 90-basis-point range. And the 90 basis points breaks down to between a nearly 70-basis-point reduction in the 10-year treasury yield since the end of last year and another 20 basis points reduction due to the overall tightening of credit spreads in the investment-grade market. So that 90 basis points reduction, if it holds, would translate into about a $45 million increase to pension expense for 2017 versus this year, on a pretax basis."

Well, Howard, we attempt to be a thought leader in this area and one of the things, I think, that we've done to get ahead of the pack, if you will, is to sign a teaming arrangement with a technology-driven company on the West Coast. I'm not going to name them. I've mentioned this in the past, that is on retainer with us in bringing some of those commercial technologies to the table and marrying them up with some of our defense technologies in terms of user interfaces, weight, power, size, all things that are very important to the warfighter, especially if they're carrying something around. But in addition, just the type of technology that would traditionally be nurtured in a commercial environment. As you've read, the DoD has done something in the Silicon Valley. Now they've moved to open an office up here in the northeast, near MIT. So they are very, very focused on accelerating innovation, if you will, and we have certainly not missed that, and we are attempting to stay ahead of the pack. As I said during my comments, we're working on smaller form factors for our SIGINT Systems, some low-cost next-generation infrared search and tracking systems as well as our mission simulator, which will enable us to bring the warfighter training at the mission level. Now a lot of these technology is dependent on video graphics and things like that as well as the expertise we bring, and we've really found a great partner to help us in this area. It's a mutual relationship, of course, but it's working very well. And we've made this as a resource available across the company, to our group presidents, where they can tap into it and bring it into their R&D programs as needed. And I see it really bearing fruit in the future for us, where it's differentiating the things that L-3 is doing. And I think we're one of -- I haven't heard anybody else taking this kind of a step-up than maybe in one other occasion. But -- and we are looking at more opportunities like that, to reach out of the box, if you will, and bring some thought leadership commercial technologies to the table to stitch into our own product offerings, where we can make a big differentiator between what we're offering versus the competition."

So we kind of did a midyear correction on where we're spending our R&D to try to address some of these challenges. And again, I think we're one of the few companies that increased our R&D spend year-over-year, or as a percentage of revenue or however you want to mention it.

So with that, thanks very much for joining us this morning. We had what I would characterize as another strong quarter, and we continue -- we intend to continue to build on this progress. As we've discussed, we are pursuing a 3-pronged approach to drive growth and enhance profitability. First, we want to achieve more organic growth and are working closely with our business development organization to better leverage our investments in R&D as well as approaching proposals, teaming agreements and making sure that we engage in the best win strategies that we can think of. Second, we are active in scouting out potential acquisitions to broaden our customer offerings and enhance our long-term strategic positioning. We'll continue to take a disciplined approach, as you've seen us do in the past, but we like having a healthy pipeline of candidates to look at and we're seeing that now. And third, with respect to cost control, we're tightening operations, as you've heard, we're consolidating where it makes sense, and we're engaging in other cost-reduction activities to help with the margin story. Our program execution remains strong and consistent, and we're focused on opportunities in our commercial training solutions business, EO/IR and additional markets, which will be part of our growth story going forward. The steps we've taken are showing positive results, and overall, we're well positioned to achieve future growth and deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders. 
So once again, thanks for joining us. Everybody, enjoy the rest of the summer. And we look forward to speaking with you again in October. Thank you."

Third quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're feeling confident about the remainder of the year. Throughout the past year, we drove organic sales growth in our U.S. Government business, announced",1000,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're feeling confident about the remainder of the year. Throughout the past year, we drove organic sales growth in our U.S. Government business, announced bolt-on acquisitions and enhanced our profitability by expanding our capabilities in higher margin, higher returning businesses. 
Our performance reflects the hard work and dedication of our employees, so I'd like to thank everyone on the L-3 team for their focus on program execution and delivering results for our customers. 
Overall, L-3's agility, talented workforce, broad portfolio and market-leading positions form the foundation of this company. By leveraging these resources, we are concentrating our efforts on developing cutting-edge technologies that meet the evolving needs of our customer base.
We continue to execute on our strategy to identify efficiencies across the company, make key acquisitions to strengthen our business and pursue opportunities for growth and long-term success. 
In the third quarter, net sales were $2.5 billion, which was a slight decrease from the same period last year. We had healthy increases in our organic sales to the U.S. Government, for both the third quarter and year-to-date periods, which were offset by declines in international and commercial sales. 
We are seeing an improving pipeline of opportunities, both in the international and commercial spaces, and our outlook remains positive. Our EPS for the quarter was $1.88. Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations was $210 million and funded orders were $2.7 billion. 
The book-to-bill ratio improved to a healthy 1.07. While segment operating margins at 8.6% were down in the third quarter versus 2015, they increased on a year-to-date basis. We expect to end the year at 9.6%, thanks to our ongoing margin improvement efforts, which are helping L-3 to become more agile and a more streamlined company. 
All in all, we're tracking on a multiyear course to improve our sales growth and margins and are concentrating on areas we are confident we can consistently compete and win.
In July's guidance update, we increased our sales guidance by $150 million, and we have raised it again by another $100 million today. As for our outlook for 2017, we expect to grow sales, margin and EPS. Ralph will give you some more information on the 2016 guidance update and the 2017 preliminary outlook. 
In addition to our focus on our organic growth opportunities, we intend to make acquisitions that build upon our core businesses. We're looking at companies that complement our operations, expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. 
Just recently, we added a couple of business that do just that, and our pipeline remains robust. Chris will discuss the acquisitions in more detail, but these companies bring innovative technologies that streamline our platform for growth. 
We are winning new contracts and expanding our scope of work on existing programs through contract extensions and recompete wins across all business segments. 
Let me touch on a few new business highlights. We've secured major awards in training and simulation, as well as new contracts and extensions in our customer logistics support work and market expanding wins internationally through communications and warrior systems products. 
These include our work on the KC-10 program, which is now underway following the resolution of a bidders protest. This is a significant CLS contract, which adds to the roster of aircraft and customers that we support. 
Our specialized modification program for head-of-state aircraft, I'll provide a brief update. As you know, we have 3 projects, all of which are stable. Just 2 weeks ago, delivered the first aircraft on schedule for a promised 2016 delivery date, and we're on track to deliver the other 2 in 2017, though we are expecting potential customer change orders that could extend those schedules. 
And in the U.K., we're selected to provide our enabling communications equipment to a new MOD program. Chris will talk about these more and our wins across the company. We're also investing in developing technologies that will yield future benefits for both L-3 and our customers. 
As a technology company, we're always looking to reduce the size and weight of our products, while delivering a higher capability. Earlier this month, we announced that our next-generation military code, or M-Code, GPS user equipment has successfully completed the final step in the government security certification process. This is a milestone and makes L-3 the first DoD contractor to complete security certification for this critical technology. 
Now turning to the budget and some of the broader industry trends that affect our business. As many of you know, military spending has been the focus of lawmakers in recent weeks as Congress works to come to an agreement on a budget for the new fiscal year. 
Following a 5-year decline, the DoD budget cycle is beginning to rebound and grow. The up-tempo environment is rising, and we are starting to see results of the uptick in spending that we mentioned last quarter. 
L-3 remains well positioned in the defense marketplace. We expect a positive book-to-bill ratio for our DoD business this year because we provide solutions in priority areas, such as protected communications, sensors, ISR, power systems and night vision and imaging-densification equipment. 
Shifting gears to our capital deployment strategy, we will continue to generate strong free cash flow and deploy our capital to create value. We are maintaining our healthy and efficient capital structure, which provides us with the flexibility to invest in our business, when and where it makes sense. 
We continue to evaluate companies that build and leverage our capabilities in high potential areas, and of course, returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program continues. 
To conclude, we are pursuing market leadership in our business by addressing evolving customer needs, continuing our investment in growth areas and maximizing operational efficiencies, which is becoming increasingly important in the current environment. 
Now let me turn it over to Chris, who will provide some additional operational details. Chris?"

I like the teamwork at L-3 and how we're working together to capitalize on L-3's strengths. We're streamlining operations, improving productivity and optimizing our portfolio for the long-term. 
I've seen firsthand the entrepreneurial spirit and agility that drives this organization, along with the dedication of our talented employees and the trust that is placed in us by our customers. 
While we are realizing improvements in our performance, we continue to see opportunities to do better and fire up our growth trajectory. As Mike mentioned, we are repositioning ourselves in the higher margin, higher returning businesses, and we are accomplishing this by putting more emphasis on organic growth through program execution, thereby resulting in better performance evaluation. 
We're focusing on follow-on work with existing customers and competing for new businesses. We are getting more attuned to our customers and redirecting our R&D efforts towards the new technologies that align with customer priorities.
The acquisitions we announced this quarter are all very different, fit our criteria of expanding market share, and increasing our customer base. Harrison gives us a stronger presence in cadet pilot training in the United States and the Asia Pacific marketplace. And it brings additional capabilities to L-3, including distance learning and flexibility, low-cost flight training devices. 
By integrating Aerosims into our other training businesses, L-3 commercial training solutions has strengthened its global operations that span the complete spectrum of commercial training aviation, including simulators, cadets and pilot training. This consolidation will help us meet current and emerging customer requirements and drive efficiencies. 
In September, we acquired Micreo Limited, a specialized electronic warfare subsystem provider based in Australia, an important international market. L-3 Micreo specializes in high-performance microwave, millimeterwave and plutonic technology solutions that complements our wide range of sensors and strengthens our development of future products in the higher EW RF bandwidth. 
Finally, we announced an agreement to acquire certain assets of Implant Sciences Corporation in an uncommon, but innovative transaction. Implant is a provider of explosive trace detection solution. These assets will augment our existing security and detection systems businesses. And we are evaluating several other modest, but strategically significant additions that are a good fit with our portfolio. We may announce a few more before the end of 2016 or early next year. 
We passed on several deals after due diligence due to higher valuations or significant issues being flagged. We'll keep our discipline process in place. 
Let me turn to operations as we look across the company. We've taken several steps to maximize efficiency through the consolidation of business units. 
For example, in August, we merged 3 of our leading aviation products divisions into a single unit focused on cockpit displays, avionics and black box equipment. By better sizing our operations, we're becoming more responsive to customer demands. We are amping up our drive to develop and offer competitive solutions to a customer base that faces the challenges of performance and cost. 
Turning to contract wins. Mike mentioned a few across the segment, but here are some of the more noteworthy ones. First, in defense. We were selected for the development and production of the TB-29X Towed Array passive sonar receiver installed aboard U.S. Navy submarines. If fully exercised, this 5-year contract has a value of approximately $250 million. For the army, we won a production contract for our night vision equipment and our STORM SLX rifle-mounted laser rangefinding system. Also, we'll be providing operational flight trainers and associated simulation and training services for the UH-60M's helicopter program. 
Finally, for the Air Force, we won a contract for E-3 flight crew training systems. And we will provide maintenance services on the U.S. Air Force senior aircraft and expand our CLS work on the C-12 aircraft. 
In commercial aviation, demand remains strong in our commercial training solutions business. We expanded our business base with Japan's All Nippon Airways and EVA Air in Taiwan. And we already have new fourth quarter awards from both Asian and North American customers. Overall, this is a terrific growing business area for L-3. 
We also received 2 official award notices from the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority to supply 10 additional explosive detection systems. The TSA has ordered additional provision 2 systems for airports throughout the U.S. With this latest award, we now have an installed base of 1,800 ProVision systems at over 300 airports worldwide, making it industry-leading solution for safe and efficient advance personal screening. Additionally, we are providing the Istanbul Airport with check baggage screening systems following a competitive process. 
Finally, in our international business, one of our key wins is the U.K. joint remote viewing terminal or JT RVT. Under this direct commercial contract with the MOD, we will deliver our ROVER transceivers, this will enable the exchange of ISR information, including full motion video across the battle space via wideband IC network. There's potential upside for this program if the system has application on multiple platforms. 
With a major contract win, we also won a $200 million award from an international customer to deliver night vision equipment, including night vision goggles, weapon-mounted laser rangefinders and specialized aiming lights. We also won a contract for third [ph] aircraft from the Japanese Coast Guard. The content of this contract includes training and spares through mid-2019. 
And in Q3, we received multiple orders for our WESCAM MX10V and and 15V EO/IR systems for international military customers. We also introduced the smaller and lighter MX8. There are over 3,600 MX systems operating for more than 136 different platforms across more than 75 countries. 
So in summary, we'll continue to evaluate strategic opportunities and what we believe is a healthy demand environment, while maintaining our discipline and our commitment to operational excellence and program performance. As you'd expect, Ralph and I have been spending a lot of time together on M&A and cost containment. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Ralph."
93538,404700714,1063268,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance, as well as our preliminary outlook for 2017. Our third quarter results were generally in line with what we expected, including t",1085,"Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance, as well as our preliminary outlook for 2017. 
Our third quarter results were generally in line with what we expected, including the lower operating margin and earnings per share versus the 2015 third quarter. Quarters improve, catching up a large portion of the award delays that we experienced in the second quarter. 
Dilute earnings per share or EPS was $1.88, decreasing 7% compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $2.03 for the 2015 third quarter. EPS was impacted by 2 items, which together added $0.11 to earnings. First, we had a tax benefit of $0.22 from resolution of certain tax contingencies. And second, we entered into an agreement in principle to settle the holographic weapon sites litigation and recorded $14 million pretax charge for it, which lowered EPS by $0.11. 
Third quarter consolidated net sales were $2.5 billion and declined 2.5% organically. U.S. Government sales, which are mostly to the Department of Defense totaled $1.9 billion and grew organically by 5%. International and commercial declined 19% to $626 million and that was due to the sales headwinds that we've been anticipating for this year versus 2015, which we previously talked about. 
However, our overall sales growth profile continues to improve, evidenced by our $100 million increase to estimated 2016 sales, which I'll cover in a few moments. 
At the segment level, third quarter sales were about $50 million lower than we anticipated in Electronic Systems and that was mostly due to some timing items and deliveries slipping into the fourth quarter. 
Consolidated operating margin was 8.6% for the third quarter and excluding the holographic weapon site charge, consolidated margin would have been 9.1% and Electronic Systems margin would have been 13.4%. 
Aerospace Systems margin was 5.5%, about 50 basis points lower than we expected because of higher passthrough volume and lower intensities at the Vertex Aerospace sector. In the Communication System segment, margin was 7.9% and about 150 basis points or $7 million less than we expected due to higher design and manufacturing costs for new products in the Space & Power Systems sector. 
Moving on to our 2016 guidance update, we increased EPS at the midpoint by $0.15 to $7.90. This increase is primarily driven by lower taxes and higher sales. 
We increased consolidated sales guidance by $100 million to $10.3 billion and that calculates to about flat organic sales growth for all of 2016. We expect our U.S. Government sales to now grow almost 3% organically versus 2015 and our updated sales guidance projects commercial to decline 1% and international sales to decline 12%. 
At the segment level, we increased Aerospace Systems sales by $75 million and Communication Systems sales by $25 million, both due to increases in estimated U.S. Department of Defense sales. 
We lower consolidated operating margin by 20 basis points to 9.6%, primarily for the holographic weapons sights charge. Electronic Systems 2016 margin was slightly lowered for that charge and excluding it, margin would have increase there by 30 basis points. 
We reduced Communication Systems margin by 35 basis points, again for that $7 million for the higher new product cost that we incurred during the third quarter. We still expect our free cash flow to be about $125 million this year and regarding our 2016 capital allocation, as you know, we delivered deliberately slowed our share repurchases because we are shifting some cash deployment to acquisitions. 
We repurchased 50 million of our stock during the third quarter and 325 million through September. That leaves up to another 340 million or so for share repurchases the fourth quarter after being about $80 million for the Mike Rio and Aerosim acquisitions. However, as Chris talked about, we could have additional acquisition investments in the fourth quarter and that would further reduce share repurchases. 
And the last point for our full year 2016 guidance update is that we still expect our book-to-bill ratio to be at least 1.0. 
Next, scrolling to our preliminary outlook for 2017, we expect consolidated sales to grow in the 1% to 2% range, which is $10,450 million at the midpoint and this is after increasing our 2016 sales estimate by $100 million. The estimated sales growth is about the same organically. We expect our U.S. Government and commercial sales to each grow about 2% and our international sales to decline about 1%. 
At the segment level, we expect organic sales growth in 2016 to be in the 3% to 4% range for Electronic Systems and 4% to 5% for Communication Systems and these are partially offset by a decline of 1% to 2% for the Aerospace Systems segment. 
The 2017 estimated sales for Aerospace Systems includes between $120 million and $150 million for the KC10 logistics contract. We expect to start performing our full scope of work on that job in April 2017. 
We presently expect 10.0% consolidated operating margin for next year and this assumes a pension expense increase of about $29 million versus 2016, which lowers the 2017 margin by 30 basis points. 
Our preliminary segment margins for 2017 are consistent with the margin targets that I talked about on the second quarter earnings conference call. We see 2017 margins at 12.8% for Electronic Systems; 6.8% for Aerospace Systems; and 10.3% for Communication Systems. Excluding the higher pension expense for next year, 2017 margins would be 13% for Electronic Systems, 7.1% for Aerospace Systems and 10.7% for Communication System and consolidated operating margin income would grow about it percent. Next years tax rate is going to be higher than this year's. We estimate it at 27.5% compared to 23.5% for 2016. We expect that will generate about $850 million of free cash flow next year and our preliminary outlook uses an estimated diluted shares outstanding of 76.5 million, which assumes share repurchases of about 600 million but that's only a placeholder to the extent that we make for acquisitions, we would have lowered share repurchases and higher diluted shares for next year. 
Finally, in the middle of the ranges of our 2017 preliminary outlook, that calculates to diluted earnings per share of about $8.25 and that is after the headwinds and pension expense and income taxes. So to conclude my financial review, the company continues to make progress, we're increasing margins, operating income and EPS and our sales are set to return to organic growth in 2017. 
Thank you. And we'll now begin the Q&A."

There's is a gap here in '16 and '17 as we decline. But when I look at what we've done and talk about a fair amount, FAH and Apple maintenance program, that has some longer-term potential over 200 aircraft in the near term. We're going to be competing for the P-8 depot maintenance contracts and we've already won KC-10 and picked up some new Navy C-12 work. So I think we're going to be opening the aperture and then going after some programs that we may not have traditionally -- I'm personally spending a lot of time in Texas with the team and we are going to go after some new business. We have a couple of new products that will be rolling out and they have some international opportunities, probably more in the Africa and Middle East regions. So I think is quite exciting.

However, there are some opportunities in some of the bigger recap programs, where just a necessity, there will be teaming but we'll work extra hard to make sure we're on the winning teams. But you still believe that, that is a very strong business in terms being a national asset and mission icing aircraft. We have an excellent track record with our Government customers and our international customers are delivering systems that work out of the box then bring extraordinarily good and unprecedented capabilities to our customers. So the value of our systems that are getting is that these are long cycled, the other big expensive platforms. And they just don't have the predictable every year sales cycle. And I can't -- it's hard to gauge how much oil -- I don't want to point to that as being -- but how much that is causing a split in the sleeping the sales cycle in certain countries that are dependent on oil prices.

And that's why I said the growth rates are about the same organically as they are in total.

But it's that type of magnitude that was there and part of the focus now in the coming years going to be on the top line growth and organic growth. And we keep talking about moving up the market a little bit. We actually had undisclosed international customer who, for the first time, on an ISR platform brought a full suite of communications gear, including some of the ground elements. So we've gone from maybe just selling boxes to an entire suite of communication. It's what we're talking more and more about, how we team internally and move up the food chain.

Third quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're feeling confident about the remainder of the year. Throughout the past year, we drove organic sales growth in our U.S. government business, announced",1000,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're feeling confident about the remainder of the year. Throughout the past year, we drove organic sales growth in our U.S. government business, announced bolt-on acquisitions and enhanced our profitability by expanding our capabilities in higher margin, higher returning businesses. 
Our performance reflects the hard work and dedication of our employees, so I'd like to thank everyone on the L-3 team for their focus on program execution and delivering results for our customers. 
Overall, L-3's agility, talented workforce, broad portfolio and market-leading positions form the foundation of this company. By leveraging these resources, we are concentrating our efforts on developing cutting-edge technologies that meet the evolving needs of our customer base.
We continue to execute on our strategy to identify efficiencies across the company, make key acquisitions to strengthen our business and pursue opportunities for growth and long-term success. 
In the third quarter, net sales were $2.5 billion, which was a slight decrease from the same period last year. We had healthy increases in our organic sales to the U.S. government, for both the third quarter and year-to-date periods, which were offset by declines in international and commercial sales. 
We are seeing an improving pipeline of opportunities, both in the international and commercial spaces, and our outlook remains positive. Our EPS for the quarter was $1.88. Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations was $210 million and funded orders were $2.7 billion. 
The book-to-bill ratio improved to a healthy 1.07. While segment operating margins at 8.6% were down in the third quarter versus 2015, they increased on a year-to-date basis. We expect to end the year at 9.6%, thanks to our ongoing margin improvement efforts, which are helping L-3 to become more agile and a more streamlined company. 
All in all, we're tracking on a multiyear course to improve our sales growth and margins and are concentrating on areas we are confident we can consistently compete and win.
In July's guidance update, we increased our sales guidance by $150 million, and we have raised it again by another $100 million today. As for our outlook for 2017, we expect to grow sales, margin and EPS. Ralph will give you some more information on the 2016 guidance update and the 2017 preliminary outlook. 
In addition to our focus on our organic growth opportunities, we intend to make acquisitions that build upon our core businesses. We're looking at companies that complement our operations, expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. 
Just recently, we added a couple of business that do just that, and our pipeline remains robust. Chris will discuss the acquisitions in more detail, but these companies bring innovative technologies that streamline our platform for growth. 
We are winning new contracts and expanding our scope of work on existing programs through contract extensions and recompete wins across all business segments. 
Let me touch on a few new business highlights. We've secured major awards in training and simulation, as well as new contracts and extensions in our customer logistics support work and market expanding wins internationally through communications and warrior systems products. 
These include our work on the KC-10 program, which is now underway following the resolution of a bidders protest. This is a significant CLS contract, which adds to the roster of aircraft and customers that we support. 
Our specialized modification program for head-of-state aircraft, I'll provide a brief update. As you know, we have 3 projects, all of which are stable. Just 2 weeks ago, delivered the first aircraft on schedule for a promised 2016 delivery date, and we're on track to deliver the other 2 in 2017, though we are expecting potential customer change orders that could extend those schedules. 
And in the U.K., we're selected to provide our enabling communications equipment to a new MOD program. Chris will talk about these more and our wins across the company. We're also investing in developing technologies that will yield future benefits for both L-3 and our customers. 
As a technology company, we're always looking to reduce the size and weight of our products, while delivering a higher capability. Earlier this month, we announced that our next-generation military code, or M-Code, GPS user equipment has successfully completed the final step in the government security certification process. This is a milestone and makes L-3 the first DoD contractor to complete security certification for this critical technology. 
Now turning to the budget and some of the broader industry trends that affect our business. As many of you know, military spending has been the focus of lawmakers in recent weeks as Congress works to come to an agreement on a budget for the new fiscal year. 
Following a 5-year decline, the DoD budget cycle is beginning to rebound and grow. The up-tempo environment is rising, and we are starting to see results of the uptick in spending that we mentioned last quarter. 
L-3 remains well positioned in the defense marketplace. We expect a positive book-to-bill ratio for our DoD business this year because we provide solutions in priority areas, such as protected communications, sensors, ISR, power systems and night vision and imaging-densification equipment. 
Shifting gears to our capital deployment strategy, we will continue to generate strong free cash flow and deploy our capital to create value. We are maintaining our healthy and efficient capital structure, which provides us with the flexibility to invest in our business, when and where it makes sense. 
We continue to evaluate companies that build and leverage our capabilities in high potential areas, and of course, returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program continues. 
To conclude, we are pursuing market leadership in our business by addressing evolving customer needs, continuing our investment in growth areas and maximizing operational efficiencies, which is becoming increasingly important in the current environment. 
Now let me turn it over to Chris, who will provide some additional operational details. Chris?"

I like the teamwork at L-3 and how we're working together to capitalize on L-3's strengths. We're streamlining operations, improving productivity and optimizing our portfolio for the long-term. 
I've seen firsthand the entrepreneurial spirit and agility that drives this organization, along with the dedication of our talented employees and the trust that is placed in us by our customers. 
While we are realizing improvements in our performance, we continue to see opportunities to do better and fire up our growth trajectory. As Mike mentioned, we are repositioning ourselves in the higher margin, higher returning businesses, and we are accomplishing this by putting more emphasis on organic growth through program execution, thereby resulting in better performance evaluation. 
We're focusing on follow-on work with existing customers and competing for new businesses. We are getting more attuned to our customers and redirecting our R&D efforts towards the new technologies that align with customer priorities.
The acquisitions we announced this quarter are all very different, fit our criteria of expanding market share, and increasing our customer base. Harrison gives us a stronger presence in cadet pilot training in the United States and the Asia Pacific marketplace. And it brings additional capabilities to L-3, including distance learning and flexibility, low-cost flight training devices. 
By integrating Aerosims into our other training businesses, L-3 commercial training solutions has strengthened its global operations that span the complete spectrum of commercial training aviation, including simulators, cadets and pilot training. This consolidation will help us meet current and emerging customer requirements and drive efficiencies. 
In September, we acquired Micreo Limited, a specialized electronic warfare subsystem provider based in Australia, an important international market. L-3 Micreo specializes in high-performance microwave, millimeterwave and plutonic technology solutions that complements our wide range of sensors and strengthens our development of future products in the higher EW RF bandwidth. 
Finally, we announced an agreement to acquire certain assets of Implant Sciences Corporation in an uncommon, but innovative transaction. Implant is a provider of explosive trace detection solution. These assets will augment our existing security and detection systems businesses. And we are evaluating several other modest, but strategically significant additions that are a good fit with our portfolio. We may announce a few more before the end of 2016 or early next year. 
We passed on several deals after due diligence due to higher valuations or significant issues being flagged. We'll keep our discipline process in place. 
Let me turn to operations as we look across the company. We've taken several steps to maximize efficiency through the consolidation of business units. 
For example, in August, we merged 3 of our leading aviation products divisions into a single unit focused on cockpit displays, avionics and black box equipment. By better sizing our operations, we're becoming more responsive to customer demands. We are amping up our drive to develop and offer competitive solutions to a customer base that faces the challenges of performance and cost. 
Turning to contract wins. Mike mentioned a few across the segment, but here are some of the more noteworthy ones. First, in defense. We were selected for the development and production of the TB-29X Towed Array passive sonar receiver installed aboard U.S. Navy submarines. If fully exercised, this 5-year contract has a value of approximately $250 million. For the army, we won a production contract for our night vision equipment and our STORM SLX rifle-mounted laser rangefinding system. Also, we'll be providing operational flight trainers and associated simulation and training services for the UH-60M's helicopter program. 
Finally, for the Air Force, we won a contract for E-3 flight crew training systems. And we will provide maintenance services on the U.S. Air Force senior aircraft and expand our CLS work on the C-12 aircraft. 
In commercial aviation, demand remains strong in our commercial training solutions business. We expanded our business base with Japan's All Nippon Airways and EVA Air in Taiwan. And we already have new fourth quarter awards from both Asian and North American customers. Overall, this is a terrific growing business area for L-3. 
We also received 2 official award notices from the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority to supply 10 additional explosive detection systems. The TSA has ordered additional ProVision 2 systems for airports throughout the U.S. With this latest award, we now have an installed base of 1,800 ProVision systems at over 300 airports worldwide, making it industry-leading solution for safe and efficient advance personnel screening. Additionally, we are providing the Istanbul Airport with check baggage screening systems, following a competitive process. 
Finally, in our international business, one of our key wins is the U.K. Joint Common Remote Viewing Terminal, or JCRVT. Under this direct commercial contract with the MOD, we will deliver our ROVER transceivers, which will enable the exchange of ISR information, including full motion video across the battle space via Wideband IP network. There's potential upside for this program if the system has application on multiple platforms. 
In a major contract win, we also won a $200 million award from an international customer to deliver night vision equipment, including night vision goggles, weapon-mounted laser rangefinders and specialized aiming lights. We also won a contract for a third missionized aircraft from the Japanese Coast Guard. The content of this contract includes training and spares through mid-2019. 
And in Q3, we received multiple orders for our WESCAM MX-10D and 15D EO IR systems for international military customers. We also introduced the smaller and lighter MX-8. There are over 3,600 MX systems operating from more than 136 different platforms across more than 75 countries. 
So in summary, we'll continue to evaluate strategic opportunities in what we believe is a healthy demand environment, while maintaining our discipline and our commitment to operational excellence and program performance. 
As you'd expect, Ralph and I have been spending a lot of time together on M&A and cost containment. So with that, I'll turn it over to Ralph."

I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance, as well as our preliminary outlook for 2017. Our third quarter results were generally in line with what we expected, including t",1088,"Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance, as well as our preliminary outlook for 2017. 
Our third quarter results were generally in line with what we expected, including the lower operating margin and diluted earnings per share versus the 2015 third quarter. Quarters improve, catching up a large portion of the award delays that we experienced in the second quarter. 
Diluted earnings per share or EPS was $1.88, decreasing 7% compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $2.03 for the 2015 third quarter. EPS was impacted by 2 items, which together added $0.11 to earnings. First, we had a tax benefit of $0.22 from the resolution of certain tax contingencies. And second, we entered into an agreement in principle to settle the holographic weapon sites class-action litigation and recorded a $14 million pretax charge for it, which lowered EPS by $0.11.
Third quarter consolidated net sales were $2.5 billion and declined 2.5% organically. U.S. government sales, which are mostly to the Department of Defense, totaled $1.9 billion and grew organically by 5%. International and commercial declined 19% to $626 million and that was due to the sales headwinds that we've been anticipating for this year versus 2015, which we previously talked about. However, our overall sales growth profile continues to improve, evidenced by a $100 million increase to estimated 2016 sales, which I'll cover in a few moments. 
At the segment level, third quarter sales were about $50 million lower than we anticipated in Electronic Systems, and that was mostly due to some timing items and deliveries slipping into the fourth quarter. 
Consolidated operating margin was 8.6% for the third quarter and excluding the holographic weapon site charge, consolidated margin would have been 9.1% and Electronic Systems margin would have been 13.4%.
Aerospace Systems margin was 5.5%, about 50 basis points lower than we expected because of higher passthrough volume and lower incentive fees at the Vertex Aerospace sector. In the Communication Systems segment, margin was 7.9% and about 150 basis points or $7 million less than we expected due to higher design and manufacturing cost for new products in the Space & Power Systems sector. 
Moving on to our 2016 guidance update, we increased EPS at the midpoint by $0.15 to $7.90. This increase is primarily driven by lower taxes and higher sales. 
We increased consolidated sales guidance by $100 million to $10.3 billion and that calculates to about flat organic sales growth for all of 2016. We expect our U.S. government sales to now grow almost 3% organically versus 2015, and our updated sales guidance projects commercial to decline 1% and international sales to decline 12%. 
At the segment level, we increased Aerospace Systems sales by $75 million and Communication Systems sales by $25 million, both due to increases in estimated U.S. Department of Defense sales. 
We lower consolidated operating margin by 20 basis points to 9.6%, primarily for the holographic weapons sights charge. Electronic Systems 2016 margin was slightly lowered for that charge and excluding it, margin would have increase there by 30 basis points. 
We reduced Communication Systems margin by 35 basis points, again, for that $7 million for the higher new product cost that we incurred during the third quarter. We still expect our free cash flow to be about $825 million for this year, and regarding our 2016 capital allocation, as you know, we deliberately slowed our share repurchases because we are shifting some cash deployment to acquisitions.
We repurchased 50 million of our stock during the third quarter and 325 million through September. That leaves up to another 340 million or so for share repurchases in the fourth quarter after paying about $80 million for the Micreo and Aerosim acquisitions. However, as Chris talked about, we could have additional acquisition investments in the fourth quarter, and that would further reduce share repurchases. 
And the last point for our full year 2016 guidance update is that we still expect our book-to-bill ratio to be at least 1.0. 
Next, scrolling to our preliminary outlook for 2017, we expect consolidated sales to grow in the 1% to 2% range, which is $10,450,000,000 at the midpoint and this is after increasing our 2016 sales estimate by $100 million. The estimated sales growth is about the same organically. We expect our U.S. government and commercial sales to each grow about 2% and our international sales to decline about 1%. 
At the segment level, we expect organic sales growth in 2016 to be in the 3% to 4% range for Electronic Systems and 4% to 5% for Communication Systems and these are partially offset by a decline of 1% to 2% for the Aerospace Systems segment. 
The 2017 estimated sales for Aerospace Systems includes between $120 million and $150 million for the KC-10 logistics contract. We expect to start performing our full scope of work on that job in April of 2017. We presently expect 10.0% consolidated operating margin for next year, and this assumes a pension expense increase of about $29 million versus 2016, which lowers the 2017 margin by 30 basis points. 
Our preliminary segment margins for 2017 are consistent with the margin targets that I talked about on the second quarter earnings conference call. We see 2017 margins at 12.8% for Electronic Systems; 6.8% for Aerospace Systems; and 10.3% for Communication Systems. Excluding the higher pension expense for next year, 2017 margins would be 13% for Electronic Systems; 7.1% for Aerospace Systems; and 10.7% for Communication Systems; and consolidated operating income would grow about 8%. 
Next year's tax rate is going to be higher than this year's. We estimate it at 27.5% compared to 23.5% for 2016. We expect that we'll generate about $850 million of free cash flow next year and our preliminary outlook uses an estimated diluted shares outstanding of 76.5 million, which assumes share repurchases of about 600 million, but that's only a placeholder to the extent that we make more acquisitions, we would have lower share repurchases and higher diluted shares for next year. 
Finally, in the middle of the ranges of our 2017 preliminary outlook, that calculates to diluted earnings per share of about $8.25, and that is after the headwinds to pension expense and income taxes. 
So to conclude my financial review, the company continues to make progress. We're increasing margins, operating income and EPS, and our sales are set to return to organic growth in 2017. 
Thank you. And we'll now begin the Q&A."

There's a gap here in '16 and '17 as we decline. But when I look at what we've done and talked about a fair amount with the F/A team, depo maintenance program, that has some longer-term potential, over 200 aircraft in the near term. We're going to be competing for the P-8 depot maintenance contracts and we've already won KC-10 and picked up some new Navy C-12 work. So I think we're going to be opening the aperture and going after some programs that we may not have, traditionally -- I'm personally spending a lot of time in Texas with the team and we're going to go after some new business. We have a couple of new products that we'll be rolling out and they have some international opportunities, probably more in the Africa and Mid East region. So I think that's quite exciting.

So the trend is to work as a prime as much as we can in that space. However, there are opportunities on some of the bigger recap programs, where just by necessity, there will be teaming, but we'll work extra hard to make sure we're on the winning teams. But you still believe that, that is a very strong business in terms of being a national asset in missionizing aircraft. We have an excellent track record with our government customers and our international customers on delivering systems that work out of the box then bring extraordinarily good and unprecedented capabilities to our customers. So the value of our systems there. The thing is, that these are long cycled. They're big expensive platforms, and they just don't have that predictable every year sales cycle. And I can't -- it's hard to gauge how much oil -- I don't want to point to that as being -- but how much that is causing a slip in the sales cycle in certain countries that are dependent on oil prices. So I'm sure, there's an effect. I just can't tell you how much of an effect at this point. It's really hard to gauge. But it's not neutral, it's a negative."

This year, the sales from those 2 are going to be about $15 million in the fourth quarter, which is basically a rounding item, which is why we did not adjust Electronic Systems segment sales. And so that incremental $65 million of sales next year is largely offset by a couple of small divestitures that we're currently working on in electronic systems, where we'll probably lose $50 million in sales next year versus this year on those. And that's why I said the growth rates are about the same organically as they are in total. Back to those 2 acquisitions, the margins next year on both of those are going to be almost 10% before purchase accounting items and about 8% after purchase accounting adjustments in expenses. And in terms of what we paid for those, the purchase price was an aggregate of almost $82 million, and that works out to about 7x multiple on 2017 EBITDA, and a little under 9x 2016 EBITDA.

The second 2 are in production and are expected to deliver next year during '17. And given some of that pain we went through at the beginning of the first aircraft, which is last year, really, there were a lot of lessons learned, and some of the areas that gave us problems were baked into our planning and our thought process and did not recur. So that in and of itself gives us a good leg up on getting these programs off to a solid start. However, each one is unique, as unique as a snowflake, if you will. And it's not without any risk, but we feel quite confident that given the performance in the latter part of the first aircraft with the lessons learned and how they've been applied, that we think we're in pretty good shape to get these programs executed, along our plan and deliver them on schedule. We're working very close with our customers to identify and respond to issues as quickly as they can be identified. So you can appreciate we have a lot of eyes on these programs, making sure that they do execute as planned. So I don't know if I can give you any more color, but that's kind of where we are.

So I would say we're on track. We might be a little above that, which is why you see a slight uptick in the margins. But it's that type of magnitude that was there and part of the focus now in the coming year is going to be on the top line growth and the organic growth. And we keep talking about moving up the market a little bit. We actually had an undisclosed international customer who, for the first time, on an ISR platform bought a full suite of communications gear, including some of the ground elements. So we've gone from maybe just selling boxes to an entire suite of communication. It's what we're talking more and more about, how we team internally and move up the food chain. So there's been some evidence of that, and that will be a major focus for '17. But I don't know if that helps, Howard."

Third quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're feeling confident about the remainder of the year. Throughout the past year, we drove organic sales growth in our U.S. government business, announced",1005,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're feeling confident about the remainder of the year. Throughout the past year, we drove organic sales growth in our U.S. government business, announced bolt-on acquisitions and enhanced our profitability by expanding our capabilities in higher margin, higher returning businesses. 
Our performance reflects the hard work and dedication of our employees, so I'd like to thank everyone on the L-3 team for their focus on program execution and delivering results for our customers. 
Overall, L-3's agility, talented workforce, broad portfolio and market-leading positions form the foundation of this company. By leveraging these resources, we are concentrating our efforts on developing cutting-edge technologies that meet the evolving needs of our customer base.
We continue to execute on our strategy to identify efficiencies across the company, make key acquisitions to strengthen our business and pursue opportunities for growth and long-term success. 
In the third quarter, net sales were $2.5 billion, which was a slight decrease from the same period last year. We had healthy increases in our organic sales to the U.S. government, for both the third quarter and year-to-date periods, which were offset by declines in international and commercial sales. 
We are seeing an improving pipeline of opportunities, both in the international and commercial spaces, and our outlook remains positive. Our EPS for the quarter was $1.88. Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations was $210 million and funded orders were $2.7 billion. 
The book-to-bill ratio improved to a healthy 1.07. While segment operating margins at 8.6% were down in the third quarter versus 2015, they increased on a year-to-date basis. We expect to end the year at 9.6%, thanks to our ongoing margin improvement efforts, which are helping L-3 to become more agile and a more streamlined company. 
All in all, we're tracking on a multiyear course to improve our sales growth and margins and are concentrating on areas we are confident we can consistently compete and win.
In July's guide and update, we increased our sales guidance by $150 million, and we have raised it again by another $100 million today. As for our outlook for 2017, we expect to grow sales, margin and EPS. Ralph will give you some more information on the 2016 guidance update and the 2017 preliminary outlook. 
In addition to our focus on our organic growth opportunities, we intend to make acquisitions that build upon our core businesses. We're looking at companies that complement our operations, expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. 
Just recently, we added a couple of business that do just that, and our pipeline remains robust. Chris will discuss the acquisitions in more detail, but these companies bring innovative technologies that streamline our platform for growth. 
We are winning new contracts and expanding our scope of work on existing programs through contract extensions and recompete wins across all our business segments. 
Let me touch on a few new business highlights. We've secured major awards in training and simulation, as well as new contracts and extensions in our customer logistics support work and market expanding wins internationally through communications and Warrior Systems products. 
These include our work on the KC-10 program, which is now underway following the resolution of a bidders protest. This is a significant CLS contract, which adds to the roster of aircraft and customers that we support. 
On our specialized modification program for head-of-state aircraft, I'll provide a brief update. As you know, we have 3 projects, all of which are stable. Just 2 weeks ago, we delivered the first aircraft on schedule for a promised 2016 delivery date, and we're on track to deliver the other 2 in 2017, though we are expecting potential customer change orders that could extend those schedules. 
And in the U.K., we're selected to provide our enabling communications equipment to a new MOD program. Chris will talk about these more and our wins across the company. We're also investing in developing technologies that will yield future benefits for both L-3 and our customers. 
As a technology company, we're always looking to reduce the size and weight of our products, while delivering a higher capability. Earlier this month, we announced that our next-generation military code, or M-Code, GPS user equipment has successfully completed the final step in the government security certification process. This is a milestone and makes L-3 the first DoD contractor to complete security certification for this critical technology. 
Now turning to the budget and some of the broader industry trends that affect our business. As many of you know, military spending has been the focus of lawmakers in recent weeks as Congress works to come to an agreement on a budget for the new fiscal year. 
Following a 5-year decline, the DoD budget cycle is beginning to rebound and grow. The up-tempo environment is rising, and we are starting to see results of the uptick in spending that we mentioned last quarter. 
L-3 remains well positioned in the defense marketplace. We expect a positive book-to-bill ratio for our DoD business this year because we provide solutions in priority areas, such as protected communications, sensors, ISR, power systems and night vision and image intensification equipment. 
Shifting gears to our capital deployment strategy, we will continue to generate strong free cash flow and deploy our capital to create value. We are maintaining our healthy and efficient capital structure, which provides us with the flexibility to invest in our business, when and where it makes sense. 
We continue to evaluate companies that build and leverage our capabilities in high potential areas, and of course, returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program continues. 
To conclude, we are pursuing market leadership in our business by addressing evolving customer needs, continuing our investment in growth areas and maximizing operational efficiencies, which are becoming increasingly important in the current environment. 
Now let me turn it over to Chris, who will provide some additional operational details. Chris?"

I like the teamwork at L-3 and how we're working together to capitalize on L-3's strengths. We're streamlining operations, improving productivity and optimizing our portfolio for the long-term. 
I've seen firsthand the entrepreneurial spirit and agility that drives this organization, along with the dedication of our talented employees and the trust that is placed in us by our customers. 
While we are realizing improvements in our performance, we continue to see opportunities to do better and fire up our growth trajectory. As Mike mentioned, we are repositioning ourselves into higher margin, higher returning businesses, and we are accomplishing this by putting more emphasis on our organic growth through program execution, thereby resulting in better past performance evaluation. 
We're focusing on follow-on work with existing customers and competing for new businesses. We are getting more attuned to our customers and redirecting our R&D efforts towards the new technologies that align with customer priorities.
The acquisitions we announced this quarter are all very different, fit our criteria of expanding market share and increasing our customer base. Harrison gives us a stronger presence in cadet pilot training in the United States and the Asia Pacific marketplace. And it brings additional capabilities to L-3, including distance learning and flexibility, low-cost flight training devices. 
By integrating Aerosims into our other training businesses, L-3 commercial training solutions has strengthened its global operations that span the complete spectrum of commercial training aviation, including simulators, cadets and pilot training. This consolidation will help us meet current and emerging customer requirements and drive efficiencies. 
In September, we acquired Micreo Limited, a specialized electronic warfare subsystem provider based in Australia, an important international market. L-3 Micreo specializes in high-performance microwave, millimeter wave and plutonic technology solutions that complement our wide range of sensors and strengthens our development of future products in the higher EW RF bandwidth. 
Finally, we announced an agreement to acquire certain assets of Implant Sciences Corporation in an uncommon, but innovative transaction. Implant is a provider of explosive trace detection solutions.  These assets will augment our existing security and detection systems businesses. And we are evaluating several other modest but strategically significant additions that are a good fit with our portfolio. We may announce a few more before the end of 2016 or early next year. 
We passed on several deals after due diligence due to higher valuations or significant issues being flagged. We'll keep our discipline process in place. 
Let me turn to operations as we look across the company. We've taken several steps to maximize efficiency through the consolidation of business units. 
For example, in August, we merged 3 of our leading aviation products divisions into a single unit focused on cockpit displays, avionics and black box equipment. By better sizing our operations, we're becoming more responsive to customer demands. We are amping up our drive to develop and offer competitive solutions to a customer base that faces the challenges of performance and cost. 
Turning to contract wins. Mike mentioned a few across the segments, but here are some of the more noteworthy ones. First, in defense. We were selected for the development and production of the TB-29X Towed Array passive sonar receiver installed aboard U.S. Navy submarines. If fully exercised, this 5-year contract has a value of approximately $250 million. For the army, we won a production contract for our night vision equipment and our STORM SLX rifle-mounted laser rangefinding system. Also, we'll be providing operational flight trainers and associated simulation and training services for the UH-60M's helicopter program. 
Finally, for the Air Force, we won a contract for E-3 flight crew training systems. And we will provide maintenance services on the U.S. Air Force King Air aircraft and expand our CLS work on the C-12 aircraft. 
In commercial aviation, demand remains strong in our commercial training solutions business. We expanded our business base with Japan's All Nippon Airways and EVA Air in Taiwan. And we already have new fourth quarter awards from both Asian and North American customers. Overall, this is a terrific growing business area for L-3. 
We also have received 2 official award notices from the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority to supply 10 additional explosive detection systems. The TSA has ordered additional ProVision 2 systems for airports throughout the U.S. With this latest award, we now have an installed base of 1,800 ProVision systems at over 300 airports worldwide, making it the industry-leading solution for safe and efficient advanced personnel screening. Additionally, we are providing the Istanbul Airport with check baggage screening systems, following a competitive process. 
Finally, in our international business, one of our key wins is the U.K. Joint Common Remote Viewing Terminal or JCRVT. Under this direct commercial contract with the MOD, we will deliver our ROVER transceivers, which will enable the exchange of ISR information, including full-motion video across the battle space via Wideband IP network. There's potential upside for this program if the system has applications on multiple platforms. 
In a major contract win, we also won a $200 million award from an international customer to deliver night vision equipment, including night vision goggles, weapon-mounted laser rangefinders and specialized aiming lights. We also won a contract for a third missionized aircraft from the Japanese Coast Guard. The content of this contract includes training and spares through mid-2019. 
And in Q3, we received multiple orders for our WESCAM MX-10D and 15D EO IR systems for international military customers. We also introduced the smaller and lighter MX-8. There are over 3,600 MX systems operating from more than 136 different platforms across more than 75 countries. 
So in summary, we'll continue to evaluate strategic opportunities in what we believe is a healthy demand environment, while maintaining our discipline and our commitment to operational excellence and program performance. 
As you'd expect, Ralph and I have been spending a lot of time together on M&A and cost containment. So with that, I'll turn it over to Ralph."

I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance, as well as our preliminary outlook for 2017. Our third quarter results were generally in line with what we expected, including t",1088,"Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance, as well as our preliminary outlook for 2017. 
Our third quarter results were generally in line with what we expected, including the lower operating margin and diluted earnings per share versus the 2015 third quarter. Quarters improved, catching up a large portion of the award delays that we experienced in the second quarter. 
Diluted earnings per share or EPS was $1.88, decreasing 7% compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $2.03 for the 2015 third quarter. EPS was impacted by 2 items, which together added $0.11 to earnings. First, we had a tax benefit of $0.22 from the resolution of certain tax contingencies. And second, we entered into an agreement in principle to settle the holographic weapon sites class-action litigation and recorded a $14 million pretax charge for it, which lowered EPS by $0.11.
Third quarter consolidated net sales were $2.5 billion and declined 2.5% organically. U.S. government sales, which are mostly to the Department of Defense, totaled $1.9 billion and grew organically by 5%. International and commercial declined 19% to $626 million and that was due to the sales headwinds that we've been anticipating for this year versus 2015, which we've previously talked about. However, our overall sales growth profile continues to improve, evidenced by a $100 million increase to estimated 2016 sales, which I'll cover in a few moments. 
At the segment level, third quarter sales were about $50 million lower than we anticipated in Electronic Systems, and that was mostly due to some timing items and deliveries slipping into the fourth quarter. 
Consolidated operating margin was 8.6% for the third quarter and excluding the holographic weapon site charge, consolidated margin would have been 9.1% and Electronic Systems margin would have been 13.4%.
Aerospace Systems margin was 5.5%, about 50 basis points lower than we expected because of higher pass-through volume and lower incentive fees at the Vertex Aerospace sector. In the Communication Systems segment, margin was 7.9% and about 150 basis points or $7 million less than we expected due to higher design and manufacturing costs for new products in the Space & Power Systems sector. 
Moving on to our 2016 guidance update, we increased EPS at the midpoint by $0.15 to $7.90. This increase is primarily driven by lower taxes and higher sales. 
We increased consolidated sales guidance by $100 million to $10.3 billion and that calculates to about flat organic sales growth for all of 2016. We expect our U.S. government sales to now grow almost 3% organically versus 2015, and our updated sales guidance projects commercial to decline 1% and international sales to decline 12%. 
At the segment level, we increased Aerospace Systems sales by $75 million and Communication Systems sales by $25 million, both due to increases in estimated U.S. Department of Defense sales. 
We lowered consolidated operating margin by 20 basis points to 9.6%, primarily for the holographic weapons sights charge. Electronic Systems 2016 margin was slightly lowered for that charge and excluding it, margin would have increased there by 30 basis points. 
We reduced Communication Systems margin by 35 basis points, again, for that $7 million for the higher new product cost that we incurred during the third quarter. We still expect our free cash flow to be about $825 million for this year, and regarding our 2016 capital allocation, as you know, we deliberately slowed our share repurchases because we are shifting some cash deployment to acquisitions.
We repurchased 50 million of our stock during the third quarter and 325 million through September. That leaves up to another 340 million or so for share repurchases in the fourth quarter after paying about $80 million for the Micreo and Aerosim acquisitions. However, as Chris talked about, we could have additional acquisition investments in the fourth quarter, and that would further reduce share repurchases. 
And the last point for our full year 2016 guidance update is that we still expect our book-to-bill ratio to be at least 1.0. 
Next, scrolling to our preliminary outlook for 2017, we expect consolidated sales to grow in the 1% to 2% range, which is $10,450,000,000 at the midpoint and this is after increasing our 2016 sales estimate by $100 million. The estimated sales growth is about the same organically. We expect our U.S. government and commercial sales to each grow about 2% and our international sales to decline about 1%. 
At the segment level, we expect organic sales growth in 2016 to be in the 3% to 4% range for Electronic Systems and 4% to 5% for Communication Systems and these are partially offset by a decline of 1% to 2% for the Aerospace Systems segment. 
The 2017 estimated sales for Aerospace Systems includes between $120 million and $150 million for the KC-10 logistics contract. We expect to start performing our full scope of work on that job in April of 2017. We presently expect 10.0% consolidated operating margin for next year, and this assumes a pension expense increase of about $29 million versus 2016, which lowers the 2017 margin by 30 basis points. 
Our preliminary segment margins for 2017 are consistent with the margin targets that I talked about on the second quarter earnings conference call. We see 2017 margins at 12.8% for Electronic Systems; 6.8% for Aerospace Systems; and 10.3% for Communication Systems. Excluding the higher pension expense for next year, 2017 margins would be 13% for Electronic Systems; 7.1% for Aerospace Systems; and 10.7% for Communication Systems; and consolidated operating income would grow about 8%. 
Next year's tax rate is going to be higher than this year's. We estimate it at 27.5% compared to 23.5% for 2016. We expect that we'll generate about $850 million of free cash flow next year and our preliminary outlook uses an estimated diluted shares outstanding of 76.5 million, which assumes share repurchases of about 600 million, but that's only a placeholder to the extent that we make more acquisitions, we would have lower share repurchases and higher diluted shares for next year. 
Finally, in the middle of the ranges of our 2017 preliminary outlook, that calculates to diluted earnings per share of about $8.25, and that is after the headwinds for pension expense and income taxes. 
So to conclude my financial review, the company continues to make progress. We're increasing margins, operating income and EPS, and our sales are set to return to organic growth in 2017. 
Thank you. And we'll now begin the Q&A."

And there's clearly going to need a jump-start, there's a gap here in '16 and '17, as we decline. But when I look at what we've done and talked about a fair amount with the F/A team, depo maintenance program that has some longer-term potential, over 200 aircraft in the near term. We're going to be competing for the P-8 depot maintenance contracts and we've already won KC-10 and picked up some new Navy C-12 work. So I think we're going to be opening the aperture and going after some programs that we may not have, traditionally -- I'm personally spending a lot of time in Texas with the team and we're going to go after some new business. We have a couple of new products that we'll be rolling out and they have some international opportunities, probably more in the Africa and Mid East regions.  So I think that's quite exciting.

Even with some of the new work that we've brought in-house, whether it's the F/A-18 or the KC work on the tankers. I mean, that -- all that work is as a prime.

So the trend is to work as a prime as much as we can in that space. However, there are opportunities on some of the bigger recap programs, where just by necessity, there will be teaming, but we'll work extra hard to make sure we're on the winning teams. But we still believe that that is a very strong business in terms of being a national asset in missionizing aircraft. We have an excellent track record with our government customers and our international customers on delivering systems that work out of the box and bring extraordinarily good and unprecedented capabilities to our customers. So the value of our systems is there. The thing is, that these are long cycled, they're big expensive platforms, and they just don't have that predictable every year sales cycle. And I can't -- it's hard to gauge how much oil -- I don't want to point to that as being -- but how much that is causing a slip in the sales cycle in certain countries that are dependent on oil prices. So I'm sure, there's an effect. I just can't tell you how much of an effect at this point. It's really hard to gauge. But it's not neutral, it's a negative."

This year, the sales from those 2 are going to be about $15 million in the fourth quarter, which is basically a rounding item, which is why we did not adjust Electronic Systems segment sales. And so that incremental $65 million of sales next year is largely offset by a couple of small divestitures that we're currently working on in electronic systems where we'll probably lose $50 million in sales next year versus this year on those. And that's why I said the growth rates are about the same organically as they are in total. Back to those 2 acquisitions, the margins next year on both of those are going to be almost 10% before purchase accounting items and about 8% after purchase accounting adjustments in expenses. And in terms of what we paid for those, the purchase price was an aggregate of almost $82 million, and that works out to about a 7x multiple on 2017 EBITDA, and a little under 9x 2016 EBITDA.

The second 2 are in production and are expected to deliver next year during '17. And given some of the pain we went through at the beginning of the first aircraft, which was last year, really, there were a lot of lessons learned, and some of the areas that gave us problems were baked into our planning and our thought process and did not recur. So that in and of itself gives us a good leg up on getting these programs off to a solid start. However, each one is unique, as unique as a snowflake, if you will. And it's not without any risk, but we feel quite confident that given the performance in the latter part of the first aircraft with the lessons learned and how they've been applied, that we think we're in pretty good shape to get these programs executed along our plan and deliver them on schedule. We're working very closely with our customers to identify and respond to issues as quickly as they can be identified. So you can appreciate we have a lot of eyes on these programs, making sure that they do execute as planned. So I don't know if I can give you any more color, but that's kind of where we are. We are very, very focused on that execution and making sure that these aircraft deliver as scheduled."

So I would say we're on track. We might be a little above that, which is why you see a slight uptick in the margins. But it's that type of magnitude that was there and part of the focus now in the coming year is going to be on the top line growth and the organic growth. And we keep talking about moving up the market a little bit. We actually had an undisclosed international customer who, for the first time, on an ISR platform bought a full suite of communications gear, including some of the ground elements. So we've gone from maybe just selling boxes to an entire suite of communication. This is what we're talking more and more about, how we team internally and move up the food chain. So there's been some evidence of that, and that will be a major focus for '17. But I don't know if that helps, Howard."

First of all, as we look beyond this year into 2017, we see rising demand from our core capabilities, from global customers, and many opportunities across our lines of business. Our competitive position and market leadership are the culmination of a dual focus on cost control and strategic investments in cutting-edge technologies to meet our customers' needs. 
Across all of our segments, we're growing the business and driving margin expansion through increased efficiencies and other operational improvements. Overall, solid balance sheet discipline of capital deployment, and our strategic approach to M&A, ensure that we'll continue pursuing opportunities to increase our customer base and maximize shareholder value. I'm confident that we're on the right track to finish the year on a strong note. 
We look forward to highlighting more of our business initiatives and providing a detailed financial outlook and other business updates at our annual investor conference to be held on December 6 here in New York City.

Third quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're feeling confident about the remainder of the year. Throughout the past year, we drove organic sales growth in our U.S. government business, announced",1005,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're feeling confident about the remainder of the year. Throughout the past year, we drove organic sales growth in our U.S. government business, announced bolt-on acquisitions and enhanced our profitability by expanding our capabilities in higher margin, higher returning businesses. 
Our performance reflects the hard work and dedication of our employees, so I'd like to thank everyone on the L-3 team for their focus on program execution and delivering results for our customers. 
Overall, L-3's agility, talented workforce, broad portfolio and market-leading positions form the foundation of this company. By leveraging these resources, we are concentrating our efforts on developing cutting-edge technologies that meet the evolving needs of our customer base.
We continue to execute on our strategy to identify efficiencies across the company, make key acquisitions to strengthen our business and pursue opportunities for growth and long-term success. 
In the third quarter, net sales were $2.5 billion, which was a slight decrease from the same period last year. We had healthy increases in our organic sales to the U.S. government, for both the third quarter and year-to-date periods, which were offset by declines in international and commercial sales. 
We are seeing an improving pipeline of opportunities, both in the international and commercial spaces, and our outlook remains positive. Our EPS for the quarter was $1.88. Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations was $210 million and funded orders were $2.7 billion. 
The book-to-bill ratio improved to a healthy 1.07. While segment operating margins at 8.6% were down in the third quarter versus 2015, they increased on a year-to-date basis. We expect to end the year at 9.6%, thanks to our ongoing margin improvement efforts, which are helping L-3 to become more agile and a more streamlined company. 
All in all, we're tracking on a multiyear course to improve our sales growth and margins and are concentrating on areas we are confident we can consistently compete and win.
In July's guide and update, we increased our sales guidance by $150 million, and we have raised it again by another $100 million today. As for our outlook for 2017, we expect to grow sales, margin and EPS. Ralph will give you some more information on the 2016 guidance update and the 2017 preliminary outlook. 
In addition to our focus on our organic growth opportunities, we intend to make acquisitions that build upon our core businesses. We're looking at companies that complement our operations, expand our market share, broaden our offerings and bring us new customers. 
Just recently, we added a couple of business that do just that, and our pipeline remains robust. Chris will discuss the acquisitions in more detail, but these companies bring innovative technologies that streamline our platform for growth. 
We are winning new contracts and expanding our scope of work on existing programs through contract extensions and recompete wins across all our business segments. 
Let me touch on a few new business highlights. We've secured major awards in training and simulation, as well as new contracts and extensions in our customer logistics support work and market expanding wins internationally through communications and Warrior Systems products. 
These include our work on the KC-10 program, which is now underway following the resolution of a bidders protest. This is a significant CLS contract, which adds to the roster of aircraft and customers that we support. 
On our specialized modification program for head-of-state aircraft, I'll provide a brief update. As you know, we have 3 projects, all of which are stable. Just 2 weeks ago, we delivered the first aircraft on schedule for a promised 2016 delivery date, and we're on track to deliver the other 2 in 2017, though we are expecting potential customer change orders that could extend those schedules. 
And in the U.K., we're selected to provide our enabling communications equipment to a new MOD program. Chris will talk about these more and our wins across the company. We're also investing in developing technologies that will yield future benefits for both L-3 and our customers. 
As a technology company, we're always looking to reduce the size and weight of our products, while delivering a higher capability. Earlier this month, we announced that our next-generation military code, or M-Code, GPS user equipment has successfully completed the final step in the government security certification process. This is a milestone and makes L-3 the first DoD contractor to complete security certification for this critical technology. 
Now turning to the budget and some of the broader industry trends that affect our business. As many of you know, military spending has been the focus of lawmakers in recent weeks as Congress works to come to an agreement on a budget for the new fiscal year. 
Following a 5-year decline, the DoD budget cycle is beginning to rebound and grow. The up-tempo environment is rising, and we are starting to see results of the uptick in spending that we mentioned last quarter. 
L-3 remains well positioned in the defense marketplace. We expect a positive book-to-bill ratio for our DoD business this year because we provide solutions in priority areas, such as protected communications, sensors, ISR, power systems and night vision and image intensification equipment. 
Shifting gears to our capital deployment strategy, we will continue to generate strong free cash flow and deploy our capital to create value. We are maintaining our healthy and efficient capital structure, which provides us with the flexibility to invest in our business, when and where it makes sense. 
We continue to evaluate companies that build and leverage our capabilities in high potential areas, and of course, returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program continues. 
To conclude, we are pursuing market leadership in our business by addressing evolving customer needs, continuing our investment in growth areas and maximizing operational efficiencies, which are becoming increasingly important in the current environment. 
Now let me turn it over to Chris, who will provide some additional operational details. Chris?"

I like the teamwork at L-3 and how we're working together to capitalize on L-3's strengths. We're streamlining operations, improving productivity and optimizing our portfolio for the long-term. 
I've seen firsthand the entrepreneurial spirit and agility that drives this organization, along with the dedication of our talented employees and the trust that is placed in us by our customers. 
While we are realizing improvements in our performance, we continue to see opportunities to do better and fire up our growth trajectory. As Mike mentioned, we are repositioning ourselves into higher margin, higher returning businesses, and we are accomplishing this by putting more emphasis on our organic growth through program execution, thereby resulting in better past performance evaluation. 
We're focusing on follow-on work with existing customers and competing for new businesses. We are getting more attuned to our customers and redirecting our R&D efforts towards the new technologies that align with customer priorities.
The acquisitions we announced this quarter are all very different, fit our criteria of expanding market share and increasing our customer base. Harrison gives us a stronger presence in cadet pilot training in the United States and the Asia Pacific marketplace. And it brings additional capabilities to L-3, including distance learning and flexibility, low-cost flight training devices. 
By integrating Aerosims into our other training businesses, L-3 commercial training solutions has strengthened its global operations that span the complete spectrum of commercial training aviation, including simulators, cadets and pilot training. This consolidation will help us meet current and emerging customer requirements and drive efficiencies. 
In September, we acquired Micreo Limited, a specialized electronic warfare subsystem provider based in Australia, an important international market. L-3 Micreo specializes in high-performance microwave, millimeter wave and plutonic technology solutions that complement our wide range of sensors and strengthens our development of future products in the higher EW RF bandwidth. 
Finally, we announced an agreement to acquire certain assets of Implant Sciences Corporation in an uncommon, but innovative transaction. Implant is a provider of explosive trace detection solutions.  These assets will augment our existing security and detection systems businesses. And we are evaluating several other modest but strategically significant additions that are a good fit with our portfolio. We may announce a few more before the end of 2016 or early next year. 
We passed on several deals after due diligence due to higher valuations or significant issues being flagged. We'll keep our discipline process in place. 
Let me turn to operations as we look across the company. We've taken several steps to maximize efficiency through the consolidation of business units. 
For example, in August, we merged 3 of our leading aviation products divisions into a single unit focused on cockpit displays, avionics and black box equipment. By better sizing our operations, we're becoming more responsive to customer demands. We are amping up our drive to develop and offer competitive solutions to a customer base that faces the challenges of performance and cost. 
Turning to contract wins. Mike mentioned a few across the segments, but here are some of the more noteworthy ones. First, in defense. We were selected for the development and production of the TB-29X Towed Array passive sonar receiver installed aboard U.S. Navy submarines. If fully exercised, this 5-year contract has a value of approximately $250 million. For the army, we won a production contract for our night vision equipment and our STORM SLX rifle-mounted laser rangefinding system. Also, we'll be providing operational flight trainers and associated simulation and training services for the UH-60M's helicopter program. 
Finally, for the Air Force, we won a contract for E-3 flight crew training systems. And we will provide maintenance services on the U.S. Air Force King Air aircraft and expand our CLS work on the C-12 aircraft. 
In commercial aviation, demand remains strong in our commercial training solutions business. We expanded our business base with Japan's All Nippon Airways and EVA Air in Taiwan. And we already have new fourth quarter awards from both Asian and North American customers. Overall, this is a terrific growing business area for L-3. 
We also have received 2 official award notices from the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority to supply 10 additional explosive detection systems. The TSA has ordered additional ProVision 2 systems for airports throughout the U.S. With this latest award, we now have an installed base of 1,800 ProVision systems at over 300 airports worldwide, making it the industry-leading solution for safe and efficient advanced personnel screening. Additionally, we are providing the Istanbul Airport with check baggage screening systems, following a competitive process. 
Finally, in our international business, one of our key wins is the U.K. Joint Common Remote Viewing Terminal or JCRVT. Under this direct commercial contract with the MOD, we will deliver our ROVER transceivers, which will enable the exchange of ISR information, including full-motion video across the battle space via Wideband IP network. There's potential upside for this program if the system has applications on multiple platforms. 
In a major contract win, we also won a $200 million award from an international customer to deliver night vision equipment, including night vision goggles, weapon-mounted laser rangefinders and specialized aiming lights. We also won a contract for a third missionized aircraft from the Japanese Coast Guard. The content of this contract includes training and spares through mid-2019. 
And in Q3, we received multiple orders for our WESCAM MX-10D and 15D EO/IR systems for international military customers. We also introduced the smaller and lighter MX-8. There are over 3,600 MX systems operating from more than 136 different platforms across more than 75 countries. 
So in summary, we'll continue to evaluate strategic opportunities in what we believe is a healthy demand environment, while maintaining our discipline and our commitment to operational excellence and program performance. 
As you'd expect, Ralph and I have been spending a lot of time together on M&A and cost containment. So with that, I'll turn it over to Ralph."

I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance, as well as our preliminary outlook for 2017. Our third quarter results were generally in line with what we expected, including t",1088,"Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss some details about the third quarter results and then review the update to our 2016 guidance, as well as our preliminary outlook for 2017. 
Our third quarter results were generally in line with what we expected, including the lower operating margin and diluted earnings per share versus the 2015 third quarter. Quarters improved, catching up a large portion of the award delays that we experienced in the second quarter. 
Diluted earnings per share or EPS was $1.88, decreasing 7% compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $2.03 for the 2015 third quarter. EPS was impacted by 2 items, which together added $0.11 to earnings. First, we had a tax benefit of $0.22 from the resolution of certain tax contingencies. And second, we entered into an agreement in principle to settle the holographic weapon sites class-action litigation and recorded a $14 million pretax charge for it, which lowered EPS by $0.11.
Third quarter consolidated net sales were $2.5 billion and declined 2.5% organically. U.S. government sales, which are mostly to the Department of Defense, totaled $1.9 billion and grew organically by 5%. International and commercial declined 19% to $626 million and that was due to the sales headwinds that we've been anticipating for this year versus 2015, which we've previously talked about. However, our overall sales growth profile continues to improve, evidenced by a $100 million increase to estimated 2016 sales, which I'll cover in a few moments. 
At the segment level, third quarter sales were about $50 million lower than we anticipated in Electronic Systems, and that was mostly due to some timing items and deliveries slipping into the fourth quarter. 
Consolidated operating margin was 8.6% for the third quarter and excluding the holographic weapon site charge, consolidated margin would have been 9.1% and Electronic Systems margin would have been 13.4%.
Aerospace Systems margin was 5.5%, about 50 basis points lower than we expected because of higher pass-through volume and lower incentive fees at the Vertex Aerospace sector. In the Communication Systems segment, margin was 7.9% and about 150 basis points or $7 million less than we expected due to higher design and manufacturing costs for new products in the Space & Power Systems sector. 
Moving on to our 2016 guidance update, we increased EPS at the midpoint by $0.15 to $7.90. This increase is primarily driven by lower taxes and higher sales. 
We increased consolidated sales guidance by $100 million to $10.3 billion and that calculates to about flat organic sales growth for all of 2016. We expect our U.S. government sales to now grow almost 3% organically versus 2015, and our updated sales guidance projects commercial to decline 1% and international sales to decline 12%. 
At the segment level, we increased Aerospace Systems sales by $75 million and Communication Systems sales by $25 million, both due to increases in estimated U.S. Department of Defense sales. 
We lowered consolidated operating margin by 20 basis points to 9.6%, primarily for the holographic weapons sights charge. Electronic Systems 2016 margin was slightly lowered for that charge and excluding it, margin would have increased there by 30 basis points. 
We reduced Communication Systems margin by 35 basis points, again, for that $7 million for the higher new product cost that we incurred during the third quarter. We still expect our free cash flow to be about $825 million for this year, and regarding our 2016 capital allocation, as you know, we deliberately slowed our share repurchases because we are shifting some cash deployment to acquisitions.
We repurchased 50 million of our stock during the third quarter and 325 million through September. That leaves up to another 340 million or so for share repurchases in the fourth quarter after paying about $80 million for the Micreo and Aerosim acquisitions. However, as Chris talked about, we could have additional acquisition investments in the fourth quarter, and that would further reduce share repurchases. 
And the last point for our full year 2016 guidance update is that we still expect our book-to-bill ratio to be at least 1.0. 
Next, scrolling to our preliminary outlook for 2017, we expect consolidated sales to grow in the 1% to 2% range, which is $10,450,000,000 at the midpoint and this is after increasing our 2016 sales estimate by $100 million. The estimated sales growth is about the same organically. We expect our U.S. government and commercial sales to each grow about 2% and our international sales to decline about 1%. 
At the segment level, we expect organic sales growth in 2016 to be in the 3% to 4% range for Electronic Systems and 4% to 5% for Communication Systems and these are partially offset by a decline of 1% to 2% for the Aerospace Systems segment. 
The 2017 estimated sales for Aerospace Systems includes between $120 million and $150 million for the KC-10 logistics contract. We expect to start performing our full scope of work on that job in April of 2017. We presently expect 10.0% consolidated operating margin for next year, and this assumes a pension expense increase of about $29 million versus 2016, which lowers the 2017 margin by 30 basis points. 
Our preliminary segment margins for 2017 are consistent with the margin targets that I talked about on the second quarter earnings conference call. We see 2017 margins at 12.8% for Electronic Systems; 6.8% for Aerospace Systems; and 10.3% for Communication Systems. Excluding the higher pension expense for next year, 2017 margins would be 13% for Electronic Systems; 7.1% for Aerospace Systems; and 10.7% for Communication Systems; and consolidated operating income would grow about 8%. 
Next year's tax rate is going to be higher than this year's. We estimate it at 27.5% compared to 23.5% for 2016. We expect that we'll generate about $850 million of free cash flow next year and our preliminary outlook uses an estimated diluted shares outstanding of 76.5 million, which assumes share repurchases of about 600 million, but that's only a placeholder to the extent that we make more acquisitions, we would have lower share repurchases and higher diluted shares for next year. 
Finally, in the middle of the ranges of our 2017 preliminary outlook, that calculates to diluted earnings per share of about $8.25, and that is after the headwinds for pension expense and income taxes. 
So to conclude my financial review, the company continues to make progress. We're increasing margins, operating income and EPS, and our sales are set to return to organic growth in 2017. 
Thank you. And we'll now begin the Q&A."

So I think we're going to be opening the aperture and going after some programs that we may not have, traditionally -- I'm personally spending a lot of time in Texas with the team and we're going to go after some new business. We have a couple of new products that we'll be rolling out and they have some international opportunities, probably more in the Africa and Mid East regions.  So I think that's quite exciting. So those are my thoughts."

Even with some of the new work that we've brought in-house, whether it's the F/A-18 or the KC work on the tankers. I mean, that -- all that work is as a prime. And you know we have tough comparisons because we completed the U.K. Airseeker program, which, again, we were a prime on 2 Airseeker platforms for the U.K. and also the Australia 27J program, where we, again, were prime. So the trend is to work as a prime as much as we can in that space. However, there are opportunities on some of the bigger recap programs, where just by necessity, there will be teaming, but we'll work extra hard to make sure we're on the winning teams. But we still believe that that is a very strong business in terms of being a national asset in missionizing aircraft. We have an excellent track record with our government customers and our international customers on delivering systems that work out of the box and bring extraordinarily good and unprecedented capabilities to our customers. So the value of our systems is there. The thing is, that these are long cycled, they're big expensive platforms, and they just don't have that predictable every year sales cycle. And I can't -- it's hard to gauge how much oil -- I don't want to point to that as being -- but how much that is causing a slip in the sales cycle in certain countries that are dependent on oil prices. So I'm sure, there's an effect. I just can't tell you how much of an effect at this point. It's really hard to gauge. But it's not neutral, it's a negative."

This year, the sales from those 2 are going to be about $15 million in the fourth quarter, which is basically a rounding item, which is why we did not adjust Electronic Systems segment sales. And so that incremental $65 million of sales next year is largely offset by a couple of small divestitures that we're currently working on in electronic systems where we'll probably lose $50 million in sales next year versus this year on those. And that's why I said the growth rates are about the same organically as they are in total. Back to those 2 acquisitions, the margins next year on both of those are going to be almost 10% before purchase accounting items and about 8% after purchase accounting adjustments in expenses. And in terms of what we paid for those, the purchase price was an aggregate of almost $82 million, and that works out to about a 7x multiple on 2017 EBITDA, and a little under 9x 2016 EBITDA.

The second 2 are in production and are expected to deliver next year during '17. And given some of the pain we went through at the beginning of the first aircraft, which was last year, really, there were a lot of lessons learned, and some of the areas that gave us problems were baked into our planning and our thought process and did not recur. So that in and of itself gives us a good leg up on getting these programs off to a solid start. However, each one is unique, as unique as a snowflake, if you will. And it's not without any risk, but we feel quite confident that given the performance in the latter part of the first aircraft with the lessons learned and how they've been applied, that we think we're in pretty good shape to get these programs executed along our plan and deliver them on schedule. We're working very closely with our customers to identify and respond to issues as quickly as they can be identified. So you can appreciate we have a lot of eyes on these programs, making sure that they do execute as planned. So I don't know if I can give you any more color, but that's kind of where we are. We are very, very focused on that execution and making sure that these aircraft deliver as scheduled."

So that's just a collaborative process and we work with them closely. We make a change order as needed and sometimes that adds a little bit of time.

So there's been some evidence of that, and that will be a major focus for '17. But I don't know if that helps, Howard."

In terms of numbers to track, you could basically follow it in our guidance updates at the operating income line, which is what falls to the bottom line, pretaxes, and our guidance or outlook for next year compared to the 2016 guidance update calls for about $50 million of pretax operating income increases and that's after the almost $30 million that we had in there for higher pension expense. So it's about $80 million of improvement that falls to the bottom line, pre-taxes, after you factor out pension. At which it's -- that's not really a controllable cost, given the expense assumptions."

There're some big U.S. Air Force ones that are pretty well-publicized, where we're a teammate with some of the OEMs.  There're still decisions being made whether these platforms are migrating to business jets or staying on the more traditional aircraft. We -- in those situations I think we're aligned with who we think has the highest probability of winning. But internationally, we're seeing more and more opportunities, especially with the advent of some of the technologies that we have. So we're -- we have a couple of pages of opportunities we just need to go and get some of these decisions made and win the work."

First of all, as we look beyond this year into 2017, we see rising demand from our core capabilities, from global customers, and many opportunities across our lines of business. Our competitive position and market leadership are the culmination of a dual focus on cost control and strategic investments in cutting-edge technologies to meet our customers' needs. 
Across all of our segments, we're growing the business and driving margin expansion through increased efficiencies and other operational improvements. Overall, solid balance sheet discipline of capital deployment, and our strategic approach to M&A, ensure that we'll continue pursuing opportunities to increase our customer base and maximize shareholder value. I'm confident that we're on the right track to finish the year on a strong note. 
We look forward to highlighting more of our business initiatives and providing a detailed financial outlook and other business updates at our annual investor conference to be held on December 6 here in New York City. It will also be webcast, and you'll hear more about it in the coming weeks, but we look forward to seeing all of you and having a robust Q&A session like we always do, as well as the presentations. 
So with that, thanks for joining us this morning. And hopefully, we'll see you in the beginning of December. Thanks."
